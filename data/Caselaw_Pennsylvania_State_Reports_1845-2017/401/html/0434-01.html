In February 1952, Yahr had entered into a contract with Harold S. Sauers, trading as Real Estate Maintenance Company [herein called Maintenance Company] to paint certain window frames on the exterior of the building and, pursuant to this contract, Albert Greco [plaintiff] and John Pappas, Maintenance Company employees, were at the time of accident — August 25, 1952 — engaged in performing this work. At the time of accident Greco and Paplias were placing a thirty-six foot extension ladder against the sill of a window located on the third floor of the building, this window being approximately twenty-five feet above the surface of the ground. The ladder consisted of two eighteen-foot sections and, in order to reach this third floor window, it was necessary that one section be extended seven or eight feet above the other section. In so doing, Pappas held the <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>ladder with his back to the building and Greco, standing on the second or third rung from the bottom of the ladder, was manually pushing the extension upward. Greco alleges that, when the top of the ladder came in contact with the window sill, a piece of wood<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and a cast iron sash weight became dislodged, fell to the ground and one or the other or both struck him on the head inflicting severe injuries.</p>
    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[117,811,1145,600]]]'>Greco instituted a trespass action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County against Yahr and the Bottling Company and Yahr then joined the Maintenance Company as an additional defendant. At trial the jury returned a verdict of $15,000 in favor of Greco and against Yahr as well as verdicts against Yahr and in favor of the Bottling Company and the Maintenance Company. As to all three defendants the court below granted a new trial and refused Yalir’s motion for judgment n.o.v. From these orders the present appeals were taken.</p>

The Bottling Company contends: (1) that since Yahr, the building owner, without its knowledge arranged to have the Maintenance Company paint the exterior woodwork of the building, it, the tenant in possession, would not be liable to Greco, an employee of the independent painting contractor, by reason of any latent defective condition of the window frame; (2) that, inasmuch as the Bottling Company’s liability was submitted under proper instructions to the jury and inasmuch as the jury absolved <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>it of any liability and lield Yahr, the building owner, liable, the grant of a new trial as to the Bottling Company was an abuse of discretion; (3) the absence of one of Greco’s trial counsel from the courtroom on two or three occasions during the trial did not justify the grant of a new trial. The Maintenance Company’s position was that there was no evidence of any negligence on its part and that the court below abused its discretion in granting a new trial as to it.</p>

Under the second lease, the Bottling Company agreed to “maintain at [its] own expense the premises and every part thereof in good repair . . .” without exception; the lease also provided that Yahr should “not be liable for any injury or damage to [the Bottling Company] or to any person or to any property at any time on said premises or building from any cause whatever which may arise from the use or conditions of said premises or building . . .” and that Yahr had “let the premises in their present condition, and without any representation, by him or in his behalf as to their present or future condition which can affect the rights and obligations created by this [lease]” and that the Bottling Company would “repair and replace all broken windows throughout the building” On February 14, 1952<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Yahr entered into a contract with the Maintenance Company for the painting of the exterior woodwork of the building for f&gt;387.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

As to the observability of any defective condition in the window frames there was considerable uncontradicted testimony: Sauers, owner of the Maintenance Company, stated that, aside from the need of paint, he could not observe any defects in the window frames; Schell, a Maintenance Company employee, testified that he observed nothing on his inspection previous to the performance of the work which indicated a defective condition of the window frames; Greco, having painted five windows on the same side of the building, one of which was only ten feet from this particular window, testified he observed nothing which indicated a defective condition of this particular window frame; Pappas, standing on the ground and observing the window frame, saw nothing wrong with it; Yahr and all the Bottling Company witnesses testified there was nothing noticeably wrong with the window frame. The top of the ladder had been placed against the window sill immediately prior to the accident and, while there is no evidence as to the object which struck Greco, there was testimony that immediately after the accident a portion of window frame was on the ground on one side of the ladder and a heavy iron sashweight on the other side of the ladder. The portion of window frame found on the ground gave the appearance of being extensively rotted and there were no nails in the wood, the nails apparently having “rusted out” from the wood.</p>

Yahr, however, was not liable for a latent defect of which he was ignorant or which could not have been discovered in the exercise of reasonable care and diligence. In <em>Lentz v. Allentown Bobbin </em>Works, <a href="/pa/291/0526-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="291 Pa. 526" data-case-ids="1107286" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0526-01">291 Pa. 526</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.%20541" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="140 A. 541">140 A. 541</a>, Lentz had entered into a written contract to put roofing on the defendant’s two-story building and to respout the building. While the written contract was silent as to the manner of removal of the roof covering, actually the covering was removed by de<a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>fendant’s employees when and as requested by Lentz. The large roof consisted of rafters upon which rested inch boards that supported the covering. On the date of accident, Lentz, on the roof taking measurements for' spouting, leaned over, placed his weight on his left hand near the eaves and a roof board broke causing him to fall to the ground. After the accident the board was found to be rotted — -a fact previously unknown to Lentz or defendant — and its condition was not discoverable by a visual examination but only by the removal of the roof covering. This Court, reversing a judgment entered upon a verdict for Lentz, held that the defect was a latent defect for which the defendant was not liable. The Court stated (p. 530) : “[The defendant] is only required to use ordinary care to protect those lawfully upon his premises . . . This degree of care does not place upon the property-owner the practically impossible task of testing every roof board before removal of the old covering to make way for the new”. In <em>Miller v.

On the date of accident, Miller was cleaning, brushing and scraping the fire escape and had progressed to a point where he decided he needed some paint; he then turned around, put his left hand on the outside rail of the fire escape, the rail gave way and Miller fell to the ground. After the accident, the pipe which formed the outside rail was found to be “corroded, almost rusted through; in bad condition.” This Court reversed a judgment entered upon a verdict for Miller, holding that Miller had failed to prove that the defect could or should have been discovered <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>by a proper or reasonable inspection. Both <em>Lentz </em>and <em>Miller </em>presented factual situations clearly distinguishable from the instant situation.</p>

Under the instant circumstances, was Yahr exercising reasonable care and diligence in not making this or some other type of inspection? There is no evidence whatsoever that Yahr <em>at any time </em>inspected the condition of the window frames either from within or without the building. This was an old building which had been owned by Yahr for eight years prior to the date of accident and the window frames, particularly by reason of the manner of construction of this particular window frame, were continually exposed to the elements. Granted that a visual or superficial examination of this window frame would not have revealed its defective condition, it was for the jury to decide under these particular circumstances whether such visual or superficial inspection was all that was required of Yahr. Whether Yahr’s conduct or failure to inspect met the standard of reasonable care and diligence was a matter for the jury: <em>Blasi v. Bonnert, </em><a href="/pa-super/186/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="186 Pa. Super. 179" data-case-ids="740591" data-case-paths="/pa-super/186/0179-01">186 Pa.

Whether Yahr fulfilled his duty of maintaining the exterior of the building in a reasonably safe condition for the protection and safety of such invitees and business visitors as the Maintenance Company and its employees, and whether Yahr in failing to make more than a visual inspection, had exercised the care which a reasonable and prudent person would have exercised were matters peculiarly within the province of the jury to determine. As the Superior Court <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>said in <em>Blast, </em>supra: “But the duty of reasonable care and diligence may in certain circumstances impose something more than a mere cursory observation.

No notice whatsoever of such invitation and permission granted by Yahr was given to the Bottling Company. The original entry upon the premises having been at the invitation and permission of Yahr, unless it can be shown that the Bottling Company had notice that the Maintenance Company and its employees were on the premises and that the Bottling Company acquiesced in their presence on the premises no liability can attach to the Bottling Company in the instant factual situation. From knowledge acquired by one of its officers that the building on one side <em>had </em>been painted and that someone <em>had </em>entered upon the premises for that purpose, Greco urges that the Bottling Company should either have become aware that the other side of the building was <em>then </em>being painted or it should have searched the premises to ascertain whether it was <em>then </em>being painted. Under the circumstances the Bottling Company was under no obligation to search the premises for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of the Maintenance Company’s employees.</p>

In <em>Super </em>tbe decedent, working as a lineman on a pole in the course of constructing a telephone line, was electrocuted when a high tension wire on the defendant power company’s pole half a mile away fell on the telephone wire which had been attached to that pole. There was no evidence that the power company had authorized the placement of the telephone wire on the pole or had . any knowledge of that fact. This Court, deciding that the evidence was insufficient to show any breach of duty on the power company, stated (p. 165) : “Whether the Telephone Company and/or the Construction Company had secured permission from the Power Company to attach wires and cross-arms to the latter’s poles was of vital importance in determining the negligence of the Power Company. A critical issue in determining the Power Company’s liability was whether it ‘had knowledge that a trespasser [the Telephone Company and/or the Construction Company] had done some act which affected the safety of the pole (Pole 1/117) and had failed to do some act to correct it.’ In the absence of <em>any </em>evidence that the Power Company granted permission for the use of its poles or knew of such use, the instruction now suggested that the jury determine whether the use of such poles was by one in the status of a licensee is without any basis of fact in the record.</p>

The record shows simply that the Construction Company, acting at the direction of the Telephone Company, strung wires and cross-arms on the Power Company poles without any permission, express or implied, and the testimony falls far short of proof that either company occupied as to the Power Company the position of a licensee.” In <em>Stark, </em>the possessor of land directed the placement of a crane underneath the high-powered line of a power company. Absent any evidence that the power company knew of the presence of the crane, this Court decided that there was no breach of duty on the part of the power company.</p>

We find no justification on this record to support a finding that such verdict was against either the evidence or the charge of the court. Furthermore, inadequacy of the verdict rendered against Yahr furnishes no ground for the granting of a new trial as to the Bottling Company.

The Maintenance Company had no notice actual or constructive, of the latent defective condition of this window frame. A visual inspection did not and could not have revealed the rotted condition of the frame; no further method of inspection was required of the Maintenance Company under the circumstances. Furthermore, there was no proof that the ladder itself was in any manner defective or that the failure to equip the ladder with pulleys or ropes to extend the sections thereof was either improper or in any way contributed to the happening of this accident. In the absence of proof of any such negligent conduct, it is difficult to understand why the court below permitted the jury to pass on the question of the Maintenance Company’s negligence. Having permitted the jury to pass upon this question was error; to grant a new trial after the jury absolved the Maintenance Company from liability was to compound the error.</p>

In a trespass action against two defendants, the fact that a jury returns a verdict inadequate in amount against one defendant and a verdict in favor of the other defendant, such inadequacy of verdict against the former does not, in itself, constitute a valid ground for the grant of a new trial as to the other defendant: <em>Fitzpatrick v.

If she is required to proceed against Sheppard alone she fears that another jury might conclude that the doctor was at fault and Sheppard was not.

At no time did such counsel request the court for a recess nor was this matter ever brought to the attention of the court until <em>after the verdict </em>and at argument before the court below. Such circumstance does not and should not constitute a ground for a retrial of this case. The trial proceeded during the absence of the chief trial counsel, Greco being represented by an associate of the chief trial counsel; there is certainly nothing on this record to show that such associate was not a skilled, capable and able lawyer nor that his handling of the trial in any manner affected adversely Greco’s rights. Counsel cannot walk out of the courtroom, leave the proceedings in the hands of an associate and then after an adverse or inadequate verdict complain that, if he had been present, the verdict would have been otherwise.
