On August 6, 1953, while his wife and mother were away from his home for the day, he went to the daughter’s bedroom on the third floor and found her sleeping in bed. Having assured himself that she was asleep, he went downstairs to his drug room on the first floor, took four shells from a box of twenty-twos, returned to the third floor and inserted the four shells in the clip of a bolt action .22 rifle. He aimed the gun at the back of his sleeping daughter’s head. The shot misfired. He went to the second floor to secure something to aid in removing the misfired cartridge. He reloaded the rifle, returned to his daughter’s bedroom, and fired one shot into the back of her head. He placed her on the floor and folded her arms over her chest. He wiped the blood from the floor, replaced the two remaining shells in the box, and threw the discharged shell and the one that misfired into a creek located to the rear of the property. <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>Then he treated two patients in the office of his home, one for poison ivy, the other for a puncture wound. He paid a young man for cutting the lawn. Sometime later, he checked his daughter’s condition and, finding her still alive and breathing, injected two doses of 5 cc of methadone into her body to hasten death and alleviate suffering. He also injected a total of 25 ce of the same drug into his own body, intending to commit suicide. When his wife and mother returned home late in the afternoon, they found Betsy dead on the floor of her bedroom and the defendant draped over a swivel chair in his office. A local doctor was called, who administered first aid to the defendant and arranged his transfer, by ambulance, to a hospital. The State Police were summoned. At the hospital, defendant’s attorney advised him against making any statement to the police.</p>

He was taken to his home and he re-enacted the events of August 6th as, he said, they happened. His statements were steno-graphically recorded. Among other things, he said that he had been having trouble with his daughter for sometime as far as obedience was concerned. He also stated that “the plans to take Betsy’s life <em>had been in my mind for a year or more</em>

After hearings, the commis<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>sion concluded that the defendant was mentally ill and recommended that he be institutionalized. On February 25, 1954, by court order, he was committed to the Farview State Hospital for the criminal insane. On September 29, 1955, Dr. John P. Shovlin, superintendent of this institution asked for the defendant’s discharge therefrom stating that “lie had sufficiently recovered ... to no longer need custodial care and remedial treatment.” By agreement of defendant’s counsel and the district attorney, the defendant’s transfer to the county jail was deferred. On December 29, 1955, a supplemental petition was presented to the court as a result of which the defendant was ordered transferred to the Harrisburg State Hospital. One year and three months later, the superintendent of this hospital petitioned for his release on the ground that he had fully recovered. The trial began May 6, 1957.</p>

Other lay Avitnesses called by the defense testified that for at least a year before the shooting noticeable changes were apparent in the defendant, manifesting signs of unhappiness, irritability, moroseness, lack of memory and a Avorried attitude about his own health, that of his daughter, and her anti-social attitude.</p>

The trial judge charged in part: “In all crimes Avhere the defense of insanity is set forth, the defendant must sIioav the crime committed Avas the result of that insanity. In other words, there must be some relation betAveen the insane delusions he may have and the crime he commits. It is not enough to prove, to escape the consequences of his act, that he has some mental infirmity, some disease of the mind.

And, until the seventeenth century, the authorities on the subject Avere so very general in terms as to be of little concrete value.

As a result, five questions Avere submitted to the fifteen judges of England regarding the existing laAV of insanity.

Some judges have also voiced caustic criticism. This criticism reached its peak in this country in the present century as a phase of the rise of psychoanalysis. See, Weihofen, “Mental Disorder As A Criminal Defense”; Roche, “The Criminal Mind”; Biggs, “The Guilty Mind”; Zilboorg, “Mind, Medicine And Man”. Some critics advocate the adoption of the “Irresistible Impulse” rule as the guiding test for criminal responsibility in such cases; others favor the application of the Durham rule; <em>still others argue that all named tests are inadequate </em>and that, it is thoroughly illogical to entrust the determination of the issue of insanity to laymen; that only experts are qualified to decide this question. Some urge a fresh and completely new approach to the entire problem. It is suggested that we reformulate our laws of penology so that they are no longer focused on punishment as the normal consequence of crime, with other dispositions taking their place as exceptions to the rule; and to allow for three alternate dispositions of the criminal, principally of equal penological rank, viz., punishment, custody and therapy.

Unquestionably, in a republican form of government as we are privileged to enjoy, order, certainty and stability in the law are essential for the safety and protection of all. Stare Decisis should not be trifled with. If the law knows no fixed principles, chaos and confusion will certainly follow. Despite this, we agree that the law should never be stunted in its growth. Precedent may not be sufficient reason, in itself, to sustain. If some principle is based upon an erroneous premise long since dissipated by accurate, dependable knowledge, no one may justifiably or reasonably argue that the law should not be brought up with the times. If it is clear that the reason for a law no longer exists and modern circumstances and justice require a change, and no vested rights will be violated, a change should be made. But, we are not convinced that this situation presents so definite a picture. Furthermore, a rule so long adhered to should not now be rejected except for solid, cogent and convincing reasons. Certainly, its extensive acceptance and survival for more than a century is an index of its soundness as a practical and efficient, fair and wise instrument to determine the important issue involved.</p>

Many ask, what do the words “product” and “mental defect” mean? “Mental defect” is so broad, indefinite and nebulous as to be almost indefinable. The term “product” obviously connotes some type of causation. One noted psychiatrist suggests a close affinity between mental illness and criminal behavior. Says he: “Mental illness does not cause one to commit a crime nor does mental illness produce a crime. Behavior and mental illness are inseparable — one and the same thing”: Roche, Criminality and Mental Illness — Two Faces of the Same <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>Coin, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20320" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="22 U.

The language was as follows: “The determination of whether the defendant was legally insane on August 6, 1953, depends to a great extent upon the defendant’s statements and the observations of his actions immediately before and after the alleged shooting. Therefore, it is important to consider the opportunity each witness had to observe defendant’s actions and what interest, if any, the witness may have in the outcome of the case. In addition thereto, you will consider the opinions of the psychiatrists. You must consider their training, qualifications and experience, and the date or dates when they examined the defendant. It must be <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>kept in mind that an opinion is only an opinion. It creates no fact. Because of this, opinion evidence is considered of a low grade and not entitled to much weight against positive testimony of actual facts such as statements by the defendant and observations of his actions.” This was an accurate statement of the law. The <em>lay witnesses </em>called by the Commonwealth in rebuttal testified to <em>actual facts. </em>The executive officer of the Boy Scouts and the young lady patient, who saw the defendant on the same morning, right after the murder, had the unusual opportunity of seeing and observing him at a most important hour. Even witnesses called by the defense testified as to the normal conduct of the defendant on the day of the killing. They testified as to what they saw. The conclusions to be drawn therefrom were completely within the province of the jury. The state policemen, to whom the defendant gave a very lengthy statement six or seven days later, after his release from the hospital, testified to what they saw and observed. An analysis of the statement itself, which is undenied, manifests a splendid recollection of the incidents of the killing and the reasons therefor. It demonstrates quite vividly a mind fully conscious of the nature and consequences of his act and the knowledge that it was wrong. All this was positive proof of actual facts. Actual facts, proven by positive evidence, are under the law of Pennsylvania entitled to far more weight than opinion evidence, even that of experts: <em>Commonwealth v. Lance, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth v. Patskin, </em>supra; <em>Commonwealth v. Heller, </em>supra.

The court, in charging the jury, said: “It must be kept in mind that an opinion is only an opinion. It creates no fact. Because of this, opinion evidence is considered of a low grade and not entitled to much weight against positive testimony of actual facts such as statements by the defendant and observations of his actions.”</p>
    <p id="b279-7" data-blocks='[["BL_279.10",279,[131,1745,1146,420]]]'>I submit that this instruction was erroneous. The evidence of doctors in a case of this kind is not “low grade.” They have studied and they have been trained to analyze mental disorders. They have had many years of experience, they have seen and analyzed hundreds of cases. They are certainly in a far better position to diagnose a mental illness than a casual observer.</p>

How can anyone donbt that the defendant was insane when he then tried to kill himself?</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[248,545,1143,428]]]'>Beading the first three paragraphs of the Majority Opinion should be enough to convince anyone that the defendant was not in his right mind when he committed the horrible deeds therein related. The only possible explanation for his conduct is that his mind was unhinged at the time. This conclusion was substantiated by three able men, learned, experienced and wise in the ways of the mind.</p>
    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.6",280,[245,994,1144,527]]]'>Dr. Woodhouse had no possible motive to kill someone who was dear to him — a poor, helpless, sick child. The jury had the right to be assisted in the discharge of their awesome duties by listening to doctors who have dedicated their lives to determining the why and the wherefore of the inexplicable. But when the judge told the jury that the testimony of the three physicians was of “low grade,” he practically wiped it out of the case and when he did that he deprived the defendant of a fair trial.</p>
    <p id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.7",280,[242,1551,1144,318]]]'>The trial judge also erred, in my opinion, when he refused to charge the jury, as requested by defense counsel, as follows: “If the mind of the defendant was so affected by disease at the time of the act in question that he could not control his actions, he was not responsible and your verdict must be not guilty.”</p>

Certainly, if one in an epileptic seizure should strike an unoffending person, the striking would not be regarded criminal. If the mind of the defendant was <em>so </em>affected by disease at the time of the killing that he had no more control over his actions than an epileptic can control his equilibrium, <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>how and why should he be criminally responsible for what he does?</p>

The brief is well prepared, the authorities are cited and reviewed, the argumentation is cogently presented. However, the brief is blemished by a statement which has no place in a lawyer’s argument, oral or written. After pointing out the high value which should attach to expert opinion, the brief writer says: “The law has never been ass enough to hold a contrary view.”</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[138,1169,1147,693]]]'>To refer to the law in such rustic language is not worthy of one learned in jurisprudence, veteran in the use of legal terminology, and distinguished by reputation and achievement. We know that the law does not shine in the constellation of man’s endeavors as the impeccable star of undeviating perfection. We know that, in fact, it often dims when errors throw it in eclipse. We also are aware of Mr. Bumble’s oft-quoted observation on the law<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> which adds no glory to jurisprudence in general. But Mr. Bumble was speaking suppositionally and it was undoubtedly his indecorous hypothesis which provoked the unseemly utterance contained in defendant’s counsel’s brief.</p>

    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.7",282,[261,499,1142,539]]]'>It is not the Act of any Legislature, it is not the decision of any court, and it is not the concept of an American mind. It was an advisory opinion given by the British Law Lords in 1S43 at a time when the life of the Sovereign and her consort had been threatened, and it grew directly from an unsuccessful attempt upon the life of the Prime Minister. It was conceived by disaster, born of excitement, and nourished in fear. It has, however, fastened like a leech upon American jurisprudence.</p>
    <p id="b282-6" data-blocks='[["BL_282.8",282,[259,1059,1144,801]]]'>The Rule is not used in any other field where mental competence is at issue. When a commission in lunacy is had or proceedings are taken against a person for the appointment of a guardian, the point of inquiry is not whether the patient knows right from wrong but whether he is mentally ill or incapable of handling his property and affairs and is likely to become the victim of designing persons. The Rule does not apply even when the issue is whether he is mentally capable of standing trial and making his defense. The concern of The Mental Health Act of June 12, 1951, P. L. 533, 50 PS §1071 et seq., with regard to those <em>accused </em>of crime is with mental health, not with right and wrong. Why should the law’s purpose be different with those <em>convicted </em>of crime?</p>
    <p id="b282-7" data-blocks='[["BL_282.9",282,[258,1882,1143,371]]]'>If our system of criminal law and penology has a purpose, it cannot be other than to protect society. As Sir Matthew Hale said: “That in business capital [which was most of business criminal in his day, since 17th Century England had 350 capital offenses], though my nature prompt me to pity, yet to consider there is also a pity due the country.”</p>
    <p id="b282-8" data-blocks='[["BL_282.10",282,[257,2265,1141,98]],["BL_283.1",283,[124,381,1143,366]]]'>This is precisely where the law has failed in dealing with crime and criminals. With our national law <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>enforcement officials declaring that the recidivist rate for the country is 60%, we cannot argue that the law successfully protects society. Every time a judge calls attention to the current crime wave he is saying that we are failing to cope with it, and the long and painful history of penology shows that merely giving longer sentences increases crime and does not diminish it.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[127,767,1147,925]]]'>It may not be possible to prevent a man’s first crime, but it should be possible to prevent his second. I do not favor psychiatrists in the courtroom, though every defendant has a right to summon them if he pleases. I favor combatting crime by keeping a felon in prison, regardless of his offense, until he has been shown to be criminally harmless and no longer a menace to society. This should be done by a consensus of our best medical, legal, sociological, and lay brains: I do not favor his release by the action of a board of psychiatrists.' If he remains a menace, he should be continued in custody indefinitely. Nor should he be kept in custody beyond the time when he is safe to return to the free community. The law recognizes this principle by providing that when the defense of insanity is successful the defendant shall not be released but shall be continued in custody until he has recovered.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[133,1705,1144,255]]]'>While in prison, a man should receive the most intelligent handling to achieve his rehabilitation, whether it be medical, psychiatric, educational, or vocational, as his needs may require. This is exactly what he receives when detained for mental illness.</p>
    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.7",283,[136,1979,1144,431]],["BL_284.1",284,[270,381,1143,266]]]'>The majority refuses to move against the Rule because no satisfactory alternative to it has been presented. I believe that none is needed. The Rule is a ready method of qualifying defendants for conviction and imprisonment, but also for their release without regard for their criminal tendencies. To free dangerous people when they should remain locked up is stupid and has the opposite effect of protecting society. The <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>Rule does this and hence is the keystone of a vengeful rather than a curative system. If we release a man from prison without curing him, it is obvious that we did no more than avenge ourselves upon him when we put him there.</p>
    <p id="b284-4" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[268,658,1145,648]]]'>The maximum social protection will occur when the judicial and penological processes are separated, when the courts decide whether or not defined anti-social deeds have been done and the prisons decide when it is safe to allow a prisoner to return to live among us. It would of course remain his Anglo-Saxon right at trial to ask a jury of his peers to decide whether under all of the circumstances, including his mental derangement as and if the jury sees it, it would be just to hold him accountable: this was the law of England at one period before M’Naghten. See <em>Rex v. Hadfield, 27 </em>St. Tr. 1281 (1800).</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[265,1317,1143,265]]]'>If jurors are, as the Majority unavoidably implies, capable of knowing the difference between right and wrong without being given standards for those terms, they should be equally able, also without given standards, to assess sanity and insanity.</p>
    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.7",284,[260,1593,1146,811]]]'>It must not be forgotten that the operative area of the Rule is very narrow. It applies only to the defendant who asserts that he was mad when he committed the crime but has recovered his sanity since. Not many fact-finders are convinced by such an argument. If he asserts insanity at any other time his condition is judged by The Mental Health Act. But such restricted area is not a virtue or a reason for continuing the Rule. It is hard to be mad enough to qualify for its protection, and this makes it the convenient delight of prosecutors. Less obvious is its guarantee of release to technically sane but criminally depraved men at the end of their pat sentences. They should be called “M’Naghten criminals” and they are the most dangerous of the lot.</p>
    <p id="b285-3" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[144,392,1145,479]]]'>
      <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>We must choose between protecting society and punishing prisoners. The progress of penology shows that we cannot effectively do both. Any enforced restraint, followed by treatment benighted or enlightened, feels like punishment to him who suffers it. Punishment is valid only when, as Thomas Aquinas has said, a man accepts it and makes it his own. If he merely endures what is inflicted upon him, it is of little worth.</p>
    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[144,890,1145,809]]]'>The courts are under constant criticism for doing nothing about crime. They can do something. They can abolish their own rules, like M’Naghten’s, whose failure cries aloud. The doctrine of stare decisis can remain wholesome only if, among the laws it is allowed to shelter, there are included the quick and not the dead. In the Collected Legal Papers of Mr. Justice Holmes, 1920, page 139, this appears: “An ideal system of law should draw its postures and its legislative justification from science. As it is now, we rely upon tradition or vague sentiment or the fact that we never thought of any other way of doing things as our only warrant for rules which we enforce with as much confidence as if they embodied revealed wisdom.”</p>
