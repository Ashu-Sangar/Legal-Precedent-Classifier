It is clear from the record that the Secretary and the Department made a very thorough examination of all pertinent facts and factors, and carefully and conscientiously evaluated all the evidence. We have considered the evidence, the findings and all of appellant’s contentions which were vigorously presented, but we find no reversible error.</p>

Appellant apparently believes that this alone is sufficient “to establish a need for the services or facilities contemplated by the establishment of such a branch, within the meaning of the Act of December 30, 1955, supra.” Prior to this Amendment of 1955, a bank could establish a branch office within the same city, etc., if it was “without adequate banking facilities”.

The Amendment of 1955 — 204.1B—provides, as we have seen, that a bank can, with the prior written approval of the Department of Banking, establish a branch in the same city when there is “a need for the banking services or facilities such as are contemplated by the establishment of such branch”. Appellant contends that this change in the law which substituted “need for certain proposed services or facilities” for the prior test of “Avithout adequate banking facilities”, evidenced a legislative intent to change the laAV and that the only requirement today is, in essence, a need of the applicant bank or its depositors and customers for the proposed services or facilities, i.e., a more convenient service or facilities.</p>
