[that] a private driveway 20 feet wide leading to the subject property from Abbott Drive, a public street, is of sufficient width to be used by any fire apparatus in the Borough of Whitehall . . .

We therefore agree with the Court below that the issuance of the building permit to Colligan would not violate the minimum 60 foot frontage requirement of the Borough ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[246,608,1158,1205]]]'>However, the Borough further contends that Colligan is not entitled to a building permit because (a) a permit is prohibited by Section 14 of the Subdivision Ordinance which (we repeat) was approved November 4, 1957, and (b) because the Allegheny County Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Section 14 of the Subdivision Ordinance provides: “No permit to erect any building shall be issued unless the lot abuts a dedicated street.” This ordinance also provides that each subdivision plan must be approved by the Borough Engineer, and any owner aggrieved by his decision may appeal to the Borough Council, <em>whose decision shall be final. </em>Notwithstanding this provision, the Subdivision Ordinance then goes on to provide in Section 17: “In any case where Council disapproves a subdivision plan, any person aggrieved thereby may . . . appeal therefrom ... to the Court of Quarter Sessions . . . which Court shall hear the matter de novo, and after hearing enter a decree affirming, reversing or modifying the action of the Council as may appear just in the premises. . . . <em>The decision of the Court shall be final.”</em>

      <em>not </em>a zoning ordinance. The Borough further contends that a home owner must secure both a zoning permit and a subdivision permit when he desires to erect his home on two lots instead of on one lot; and that no permit can be granted unless the lot abuts a dedicated public street — what happens to a property owner’s right when the lot abuts a street which is public without dedication? The Borough further contends that all questions of zoning must be appealed to the County Court, and all questions arising on the subject of subdivision must be appealed to the Quarter Sessions Court.</p>
    <p id="b151-4" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[114,1050,1154,821]]]'>The primary and important question in this appeal involves a question of zoning and that subject matter is one over which the County Court ;of Allegheny County has undoubtedly jurisdiction. There is no provision in the Subdivision Ordinance for a variance, and we need not consider or decide the meaning or the validity or the constitutionality of this Borough Subdivision Ordinance either generally or as applied to Colligan’s property. It will suffice to say that the Allegheny County Court had jurisdiction of this matter; that there was adequate evidence to support that Court’s findings of fact and conclusions; that it did not abuse its discretion or commit any error of law; and that it wisely directed the issuance of a permit to Colligan.</p>

The Board, which has jurisdiction over zoning matters only, refused to grant the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>variance. Mr. Colligan appealed to the County Court of Allegheny County which held that his proposed building would comply with the terms of the zoning ordinance. Somehow not explained by the record, a question of compliance with the Borough’s subdivision ordinance was argued before the County Court, although it was not and could not have been argued before the Zoning Board of Adjustment, whence the case arose. Article XYI of the Borough Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> prescribes that the Borough Council handle all questions concerning subdivision regulation and that any appeal from a decision of the Council in such regard shall be taken to the Court of Quarter Sessions, where the issue is to be heard de novo. The County Court, nevertheless, took jurisdiction of the wrongly injected subdivision question and held that Colligan was not subject to the terms of the subdivision ordinance. The County Court then further ordered “that a <em>building </em>permit be issued” to Colligan. (Emphasis supplied.) It is from that order that the Borough of Whitehall appealed.</p>

With that, I agree. The majority opinion takes note of the Borough’s assertion that the County Court had no jurisdiction over the subdivision issue, but it fails to meet that issue. In fact, the opinion for the court ignores the Borough’s contention that all that the Zoning Board of Adjustment could competently have issued and, consequently, all that the County Court could order it to issue, was a <em>zoning </em>permit and not a building permit. To qualify for a building permit in the Borough of Whitehall an applicant must not only <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>comply with zoning and subdivision ordinances, but also with plumbing and electrical codes, as to which there is no evidence of any compliance.</p>

If so, the County Court was without jurisdiction of the subdivision issue. The order of that court should, therefore, be modified so that a <em>zoning </em>permit may be issued to Colligan, but not a <em>building </em>permit.</p>
