It is clear beyond question that the victim’s death re-<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>suited directly from violence inflicted upon him by the ■defendant while he was engaged in the perpetration of a robbery and that during the course thereof the defendant, according to the Commonwealth’s witnesses, cruelly shot and killed the proprietor of a small business establishment, a man by whom he had previously ■been employed. However, basic prejudicial errors occurred during the trial which render a retrial necessary.</p>
    <p id="b120-4" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[231,880,1156,974]]]'>The trial judge, in part, said to the jury: “I say to ■you, if there is any doubt about this man’s guilt, if there be any reasonable doubt about any fact upon which the ultimate verdict of guilt may rest, give him ■the benefit of that doubt and send him out that way; but if you have no doubt, and you find from all the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this is first degree murder, <em>in that a decent citizen was brought to his death without a chance perhaps to repent, by a bullet from a gun in the hands of a man whose reputation before you is one that is steeped in crime, vicious crime </em>— and <em>at the commission thereof, beating, striking and ill using, on a previous 'occasion </em>— you may then give consideration to that, and then, and then only, do you exercise the discretion the law not only ■gives you, but imposes upon you, to say whether or ■not in your judgment the penalty should be life imprisonment or death.”</p>

One such conviction, even of so serious a nature, did not warrant the use of the words employed in the charge. But what is more important, the instruction above <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>quoted could not help but have the effect of causing the jury to consider the previous record of the defendant in determining his guilt on the present indictment, rather than of restricting its use to a determination of the penalty to be imposed after guilt of murder in the first degree had been first resolved. What influence this imprudent language had on the jury in arriving at its verdict as to the defendant’s guilt is impossible to say. When this case was tried, Act of December 1, 1959, P. L. 1621, not being retroactive, did not apply: <em>Commonwealth v. Scoleri, </em><a href="/pa/399/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="399 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="1290525" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0110-01">399 Pa. 110</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.2d%20215" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="160 A.2d 215">160 A. 2d 215</a> (1960). But, even as of then, the sole and only purpose for the admission into evidence in this casé of the record of the defendant’s prior convictions was to aid the jury in fixing the penalty, <em>after </em>the jury found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree: <em>Commonwealth v. DePofi, </em><a href="/pa/362/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="362 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="477333" data-case-paths="/pa/362/0229-01">362 Pa. 229</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20649" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="66 A.2d 649">66 A. 2d 649</a> (1949) ; <em>Commonwealth v.

Its purpose and scope were strictly limited and it was most incumbent upon the trial judge in such an instance to make certain that the jury clearly so understood. For the instructions to lead to the impression, even to the slightest degree, that this evidence should influence the jury’s determination of the defendant’s guilt was substantial and prejudicial error.</p>

We can well appreciate the high sense of moral indignation the presiding jurist experienced in listening to the account of the heinous crime involved. Yet, under such circumstances, it is more imperative than ever that one charged with such a great responsibility should preside with calmness and equanimity to make sure that the right of the defendant to a fair and impartial trial is constantly kept inviolate.</p>

The defendant in his appeal protests that the trial judge unduly and actively participated in the trial and that this undue participation contributed heavily toward the death verdict. If the judge did inordinately become involved in the trial to the prejudice of the defendant’s right to a fair trial, he may have come into conflict with what Justice Kephart (later Chief Justice) said in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Myma, </em><a href="/pa/278/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="278 Pa. 505" data-case-ids="1080524" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0505-01">278 Pa. 505</a>, 508: <em>“The practice of a judge entering into the trial of a case as an advocate is emphatically disapproved. </em>The judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person to whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, and from whom the litigants expect absolute impartiality. <em>An expression indicative of favor or condemnation is quichly reflected in the jury box and at the counsel table. </em>To depart from the clear .line of duty through questions, expressions or conduct, contravenes the orderly administration of justice. <em>It has a tendency to tahe from one of the parties the right to a fair and impartial trial, as guaranteed under our tsystem of jurisprudence. </em>Judges should refrain from extended examination of witnesses; they should not, during the trial, indicate an opinion on the merits, a doubt as to the witnesses’s credibility, or do anything to indicate a leaning to one side or the other, without explaining to the jury that all these matters are for them.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

    <p id="b124-4" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[259,710,1149,483]]]'>What were those questions? Unless the Trial Judge knows which questions were improper, he may ask them again and, in the event of another guilty verdict, we may have to remand the case once more. I believe that correct procedure requires and justice demands that an appellate court chart a course for a new trial which will mark the dangerous reefs and perilous rocks on which the ship of a fair trial foundered in the first voyage.</p>
    <p id="b124-5" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[257,1203,1151,979]]]'>This charting should not be done in the spirit of censuring the judge but with the object of illuminating the waters over which he must guide the craft of the new trial. It is my impression, as I read the record in this case, that at times the Trial Judge forgot he was wearing a robe and saw himself back in the lists as a battling district attorney determined to uphold the rights of the Commonwealth and to protect society from the defendant. But the courtroom already had a district attorney and nothing in the record would suggest that he was not discharging his responsibilities ably and conscientiously. Nevertheless, when he had finished with his cross-examination, the Trial Judge said: “I think this case has not been developed completely, and I take it it is my duty to develop it further.” With this announcement, he practically shunted the district attorney aside, loosened his robe, and took over an active prosecution of the case.</p>
    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.7",124,[257,2196,1148,207]],["BL_125.1",125,[114,377,1154,433]]]'>I want to make it clear at the outset of my discus-felon that I believe a judge <em>should </em>ask questions in order to clarify issues, remove ambiguities, and protect the rights of parties and witnesses and uphold the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>dignity of the proceedings. As justly stated by Justice (later Chief Justice) Steen in the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Watts, </em><a href="/pa/358/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="358 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="8845042,8845060" data-case-paths="/pa/358/0092-01,/pa/358/0092-02">358 Pa. 92</a>: “It is always the right and sometimes the duty of a trial judge to interrogate witnesses. . .” The able and experienced Justice, however, added this limitation: “although, of course, questioning from the bench should not show bias or feeling nor be unduly protracted.”</p>
    <p id="b125-3" data-blocks='[["BL_125.5",125,[117,821,1151,265]]]'>I believe that the very first question put by the Trial Judge in this case, when he took over the cross-examination, showed bias: “You apparently know how to handle a gun or a revolver, don’t you? You know about revolvers, don’t you?”</p>
    <p id="b125-4" data-blocks='[["BL_125.6",125,[115,1097,1153,1149]]]'>He then put a series of questions which seemed more like accusations than inquiries. And it is a matter of reasonable likelihood that an accusation coming from the determined lips of the judge may well, in the eyes and ears of a devoted jury, proclaim that the judge knows that the answers to the questions should be “Yes”, regardless of how the defendant might reply. The following questions are typical of the judge’s interrogation: “You planned this robbery, didn’t you?” “Two weeks before this happened you had planned it with a man by the name of Allen; isn’t that right?” “To rob your former employer?” “He (his accomplice) knew the place because you sort of took him down there and looked at it, didn’t you?” “You told him before, so that it was you who was the captain of this enterprise, isn’t that right?” “Why didn’t you order him in the back without the gun? You smile. Can you answer that question?” “Hid he attempt to use any judo or any technique of handling bales, of which you know he had some proAvess?” “He raised your arm, and there is the gun practically in his face?”</p>
    <p id="b125-5" data-blocks='[["BL_125.7",125,[118,2257,1149,101]],["BL_126.1",126,[244,382,1147,99]]]'>To most of these questions, the defendant answered in the negative, but, as above stated, the negatives <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>would have little weight in the face of the obviously determined opposition of the judge.</p>
    <p id="b126-4" data-blocks='[["BL_126.5",126,[238,492,1153,1526]]]'>Another part of the judge’s examination, with its repetitive accusations and subtle sarcasms would make satisfactory reading if the prosecuting attorney were putting the questions. When, however, one realizes that it was the judge who was doing the interrogating, one cannot help wondering if the jury might not have been unduly influenced against the defendant because of the very fact that the judge was the questioner. Thus: “Q. Now, you did not intend to hurt anybody, did you? A. No, sir. Q. Tell me why you took that loaded gun with you? A. Because it was a way of persuasion.' Q. It was a way of persuasion? A. That they would be afraid of the gun just to see it. Q. In other words, you took the gun to persuade, didn’t you? Did you? A. Yes, sir. Q. You knew a gun is a lethal, deadly instrument, didn’t you? A. Yes. Q. Notwithstanding your knowledge of that, you took that gun to persuade; is that correct? A. Yes, sir. Q. To persuade to what end, to rob? A. Yes, sir. Q. To persuade to take the money, and you used that gun in this business, didn’t you? A. Your Honor, the expression ‘this business’ is rather— the court : I am trying to use innocuous terms. All right, I will change it. by the court : Q. You used that gun in the stiekup, didn’t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. You did. You used it on two girls, didn’t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. And then when those girls responded to your demands, you put the gun back in your pocket, didn’t you? A. Yes, sir.”</p>

Even the un-literate <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>defendant objected to tbe phrase, as indeed he had the right to object.</p>
    <p id="b127-4" data-blocks='[["BL_127.5",127,[127,472,1152,545]]]'>Another danger attendant upon a judge’s extended and aggressive cross-examination resides in the fact that there is the possibility the judge may carry the mood, temper and irony of his cross-examination into his charge. During the judge’s examination of McCoy he asked McCoy how Sabelli had raised his arms during the encounter. The defendant asked if he could demonstrate the way it happened, and the judge dryly observed: “This is your day. You demonstrate it to that jury.”</p>
    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.6",127,[128,1033,1153,652]]]'>Then, in charging the jury, the judge sardonically recalled the defendant’s demonstration as follows: “The defendant asked for a court officer to demonstrate what happened. I hope you witnessed every maneuver of that demonstration. Could it have happened the way he said? Did he portray it consonant with his description of what happened? You saw it just as well as I did, and from a better angle. Was that the case? His plea is not guilty, but is he saying by way of confession, I did this thing but I did not intend to kill him? He does not have to intend if it is in the commission or perpetration of a holdup.”</p>
