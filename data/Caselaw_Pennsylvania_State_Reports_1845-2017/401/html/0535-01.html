The answer also admitted that Burk-hart did not own the shovels described in the bailment lease and alleged that the lease was a fictitious arrangement in that Lingenfelter, the putative lessee, was and had been the actual owner of the shovels and that the plaintiff bank knew this all along. Burkhart further alleged that Lingenfelter had applied to the bank for a loan with the shovels as security; that Vincent E. Furey, a vice president of the bank, who acted <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>in tlie matter for and on behalf of the bank, had explained to Lingenfelter that the bank could not charge a high enough rate of interest if it made a loan directly to him secured by a chattel mortgage of the shovels; that'Eurey advised Lingenfelter to procure the signature of some dealer as the lessor in a bailment lease of the shovels so that the bank might thereby discount the leases and thus obtain a higher rate of interest on the money loaned; and that he (Burkhart) had executed the bailment lease as an accommodation for the bank and Lingenfelter without receiving any consideration therefor.</p>
    <p id="b558-4" data-blocks='[["BL_558.5",558,[248,1043,1146,924]]]'>The answer likewise admitted that Burkhart did not own the shovels described in the bailment lease of August 17, 1948, and alleged that his signatures on the lease and the assignment were forgeries. At trial the defendant called the president of the local Cambria Finance Company, who testified that he had known Burkhart for 25 years and that, in his opinion, the questioned signatures were not Burkhart’s, and also the cashier of the First National Bank of Ebensburg, who had 35 years of experience in the banking business and who testified that, in his opinion, the signatures were not Burkhart’s. In refutation, the bank called a handwriting expert who testified that the signatures were Burkhart’s. On this conflicting testimony, the trial judge, sitting as a jury, found that the signatures were genuine — a fact which is necessarily to be accepted on this appeal.</p>

Vice president Furey testified that these checks were issued by the plaintiff bank in payment for the bailment leases which the bank purchased from Burkhart. On the back of each of these checks was an endorsement by Burkhart followed by an endorsement by Lingenfelter Motor Corp. On cross-examination Furey testified that he did not know to whom the $40,000 check had been delivered but that he personally delivered the $60,000 check to a Mr. Gorsuck, Lingenfelter’s equipment manager, who contemporaneously gave Furey the August 17, 1948, bailment lease and attached note each being signed with Burkhart’s name. At the time of the trial Gorsucli was dead and consequently not available as a witness.</p>

      <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, the defendant called Lingenfelter as a witness and attempted to interrogate him concerning the negotiations he had with vice president Furey prior to the execution of the first lease. On objection by plaintiff’s counsel, defendant’s counsel made the following offer of proof: “We propose to prove by the witness that Mr. Furey, vice president of the Corn Exchange Bank, suggested to the witness that the loan be secured by a bailment lease rather than a chattel mortgage due to the fact that they could get a larger return on the money or a larger rate of interest on the money, and that Mr. Furey knew that the property was not actually owned by Mr. Burkhart and that his name was being used as an accommodation for the whole transaction between the plaintiff and the witness on the stand.”</p>
    <p id="b560-4" data-blocks='[["BL_560.5",560,[237,1252,1148,913]]]'>Plaintiff’s counsel renewed his objection to the proffered testimony. The trial judge sustained the objection for the following assigned reasons: (1) the testimony would violate the parol evidence rule and (2) it would be irrelevant in any event, even if the bailment leases were executed pursuant to Furey’s suggestion and he knew that they were fictitious when he accepted them on behalf of the plaintiff bank, since such knowledge on Furey’s part would not be binding on the bank. In so ruling, the court below misinterpreted both the parol evidence rule and the law of agency. Whether the testimony would ultimately prove to be factually persuasive is a matter for the fact-finder to ponder and determine, but that it is admissible in the circumstances alleged there can be no doubt. Consequently, its exclusion by the trial court was harmful error.</p>

In this case, however, the defendant makes no attempt to vary or contradict the terms of the bailment leases. He does not dispute a single one of their terms. On the contrary, he freely concedes that among such terms is his express warranty of title to the machinery covered by the Avritten agreements. What the defendant offered to prove is that what purported to be bailment leases were not such in reality; that the putative lessee in the leases, as fully known to the bank throughout, Avas actually the owner of the machinery Avithout any property right whatsoever in the lessor and that the fictitious arrangement was adopted at the instance of Furey, the bank’s vice president, in order that the bank might thereby exact a higher return upon the loans which, in truth, were sought by and intended for Lingenfelter.</p>

In the <em>Smilow </em>case the lower court refused to enforce Avhat purported to be a binding Avritten contract because parol testimony disclosed that the contract Avas a “fictitious transaction. The parties signatory never intended the writing ... to be in truth and in fact a binding contract between them.” In affirming the ruling, we said, at pp. 461-462, “The parol evidence rule has no application Avhere parol testimony reveals that the instrument never had any legal existence or binding force. The written instrument in the instant case is exactly Avhat the parties intended it to be, and only that. No effort is made by parol testimony to vary or contradict its terms. In the leading English case of Pym v. Campbell, 6 El. &amp; Bl. 370, it is said: ‘The distinction in point of law is that evidence to vary the terms of an agreement in writing is not <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>admissible, but evidence to shew that there is not an agreement at all is admissible:’ Rogers v.

In that case judgment had been confessed against Sagerson and others on two judgment notes, payable to the plaintiff banks, and whereof he was a co-maker. On Sagerson’s petition to open the judgment so far as he Avas concerned and to permit him to make a defense, the prayer of his petition Avas granted and a jury trial awarded, which resulted in verdicts in Sager-son’s favor against the íavo bank plaintiffs, Avhereon judgments Avere entered. At the trial Sagerson Avas permitted to introduce testimony showing that the president of the payee banks told him, before he signed the notes, that the sole purpose of the notes was to deceive-the bank examiner and that the banks Avould not hold him liable on the notes. On appeal by the plaintiffs this court reversed, holding that the testimony proffered by Sagerson was inadmissible on the ground that, when a party to a transaction acts in collusion Avith an officer of a bank, or knows or should know that the officer is acting beyond his authority and contrary to the best interests of the bank, the lmoAvledge of the bank officer in such regard cannot be imputed to the bank.</p>

Her affidavit of defense alleged that she had executed the note at the bank’s request, and solely for its accommodation, without receiving any consideration therefor, because an officer of the bank told her that the purpose of the note was merely to continue the claim of the bank against the estate as a current rather than as an overdue obligation of the estate and that the bank would not hold her personally liable upon it. The lower court discharged the plaintiff’s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense and the plaintiff appealed, contending that the defense thus interposed was unavailing because it was antagonistic to the parol evidence rule. In deciding that the affidavit of defense was sufficient, this court said, p. 236, — “Will the facts in the present affidavit of defense, if properly proved and believed, suffice to defeat plaintiff’s claim? Clearly they will. Suppose that, at the trial, plaintiff proved them by a writing duly executed, or that plaintiff and the officer who alone acted for the bank at the time the paper sued on was given, agreed, and there was no countervailing evidence, that, at the time the endorsement was signed, and in order to induce defendant to execute it, the bank. <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>officer expressly agreed that if plaintiff did so, it ‘would not bind her individually nor would she be obliged to pay any money to the plaintiff by reason of its execution and endorsement’; and that, on the faith thereof, defendant signed the paper; would any one assert that, under such circumstances, she would nevertheless be held liable.

From this evidence, if accredited by the fact-finder, it could reasonably be inferred that the plaintiff knew that the second bailment <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>lease was also a fictitious arrangement. Furthermore, had the excluded evidence been admitted, it might also have affected the court’s approach to the conflict in the testimony of certain other witnesses as to the genuineness of Burkhart’s signature on the second bailment lease and assignment thereof. The exclusion of the proffered testimony was reversible error as to both leases.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[242,830,1146,1091]]]'>Since the case must go back for a new trial, we deem it advisable to offer some guidance to the court below on the issue of damages if the court should find the facts concerning the bailment lease transactions in favor of the plaintiff bank. The complaint and the testimony adduced by the plaintiff bank at trial indicate that it computes its damages on the mistaken assumption that the defendant was a guarantor of the promissory notes' of Lingenfelter and the judgment entered below confirms that the trial court erroneously adopted that theory. Burkhart did not guarantee Lingenfelter’s notes. The fact is that he assigned them to the plaintiff bank by his endorsement thereof <em>without recourse </em>and the bank so accepted them. The complaint alleges a cause of action for breach of warranty and nothing else. The unpaid balances due on Lingenfelter’s notes which Burkhart assigned to the bank without recourse, have no bearing whatsoever on the quantum of the damages incident to Burkhart’s breach of warranty of title to the leased mining machinery.</p>

Consequently, the plaintiff suffered no damage whatsoever by reason of any breach of warranty as to the two shovels which it repossessed out of the four covered by the first lease. The plaintiff may, therefore, claim damages only for <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>the value of the shovels which it can prove it was prevented from repossessing because of assertion by third parties of interests paramount to that which the plaintiff possessed by virtue of the bailment leases, and the value of such unrepossessed shovels is their value at the time that plaintiff’s attempt to repossess them was frustrated.</p>
