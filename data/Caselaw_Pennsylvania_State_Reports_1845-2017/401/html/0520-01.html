Main Street, running east and west, bounds the property’s 119 feet of frontage on the north, but the building occupies only 96% feet of this length; at the eastern side of the building there is a 3-foot sidewalk and beyond it an lS-foot parking lot on defendant’s property and bordering on Bridge Street, which forms the eastern boundary of the property. The western boundary consists of other buildings. The southern boundary is Diamond Street, which parallels Main. The market building does not run the full length of the lot, which is 120 feet, from Main to Diamond, but occupies only 99% feet. This leaves an open L-shaped area, all of it on the defendant’s property, the southern arm 20 feet wide and the eastern 18 feet, and this is used for parking by the patrons of the market; the sidewalk allows them to pass from the front entrance on Main to the side and rear, in order to reach their cars, and it extends no <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>farther south than the southern wall of the building.

Its long northern side is the southern wall of the building, and it is used as a fire exit. There was no railing around it except a curbing 10 inches wide and 5 inches higher than the surrounding surface of the parking lot. The southern edge of the cellarway is 18 feet from Diamond Street, and its eastern side about 60 feet from Bridge Street. An outside chimney extending 18 inches into the parking area forms part of its eastern wall.</p>

The town had a curfew and the girls had been warned by a policeman not to loiter. Going east on Main they met some boys they knew and stopped to talk with them in front of defendant’s market. When someone shouted that cops were coming, Marjorie and two of the other girls began to run east on Main, then south on the sidewalk alongside the market, and at some sort of angle across the rear parking area on or towards Diamond Street. Marjorie said that it was dark and that suddenly she tripped and fell into what turned out to be the cellarway, breaking her leg.</p>

      <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>Defendant’s first point is that Marjorie was a trespasser and was owed no duty beyond refraining from wanton conduct, or at least that if she was a gratuitous licensee in cutting short across the parking area from Bridge to Diamond she went beyond the area of her license by deviating too far towards the cellarway and hence became a trespasser. It is hard to separate this question <em>from </em>those <em>of </em>negligence, original and contributory, since all of them depend on what Marjorie was doing and why she was where she was, and hence we will discuss the case as a whole.</p>
    <p id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[254,996,1146,983]]]'>There is evidence from a man who worked as police officer and photographer that the public used the sidewalk along the eastern Avail of defendant’s market to go south and then out southwestAvardly across the rear parking lot to Diamond Street. This would take them on the hypotenuse of a triangle along whose leg to their right was the cellarAvay. People so cutting the corner Avould pass near but not close to the hole, depending on how sharply they were cutting the corner. In order to make his property inviting, defendant had eliminated any difference in height between his parking area and the two public, streets that bounded it, and had provided a sidewalk on his own land as well. If the public used this unified system of public street and private way and parking area, defendant must be held to know what risks existed for the public to run and be held also to the duty to warn or safeguard against them.</p>

She and her friends had been warned not to loiter and when someone said that the police were baying down their trial she felt that discretion lay in mobility. Whether the rapid decisions of flight were reasonable or not was for the jury and is not for us. Was she trying to hide? Was she merely taking temporary refuge behind the truck parked near the hole in order to wait and see if the police were really after her? Did she think there might be another way out of the area and was she looking for it? Was she, a sixteen-year-old colt, just galloping about? None of these alternatives seem rendered brittle as a matter of law.</p>
