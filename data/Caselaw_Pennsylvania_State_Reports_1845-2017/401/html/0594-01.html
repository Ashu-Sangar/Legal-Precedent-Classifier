    <p id="b615-4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.7",615,[123,429,1144,375]]]'>This case has been tried twice and was here on appeal from the grant of a new trial after the first one, at <a href="/pa/389/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="389 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1274055" data-case-paths="/pa/389/0283-01">389 Pa. 283</a> (1957), <a href="/citations/?q=133%20A.2d%20181" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="133 A.2d 181">133 A. 2d 181</a>. Both trials resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $20,-000, and this time the verdict was allowed to stand. Defendant appealed when her motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.r. were overruled.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.8",615,[122,814,1145,699]]]'>There is a preliminary matter to cope with before we test the merits. Defendant filed, on December 9, 1959, a motion to amend the record to show that the verdict fee was paid and judgment entered on November 20, 1959, instead of on August 5, 1959. Since this appeal was taken on February 17, 1960, the timeliness of its filing depends on whether judgment was entered on one date or the other. The court below, in an opinion by the late Judge Marshall, of Allegheny County, held a hearing, took testimony on the petition, upheld the date of August 5th, and dismissed defendant’s petition to amend the record. The current appeal is also from that order.</p>
    <p id="b615-6" data-blocks='[["BL_615.9",615,[122,1533,1145,594]]]'>Certain facts are conceded: that the court below overruled defendant’s motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. on August 4, 1959; that the jury fee of $5 was paid on August 5; that a receipt bearing that date has a legend on the reverse side: “Verdict fee paid and judgment entered on verdict, etc.”; that on the same date judgment was entered in the Judgment Docket and indexed' in the current General Judgment Index, as well as in the Ad Sectam Judgment Docket; and that the judgment was published in the August 7 issue of the Pittsburgh Legal Journal.</p>
    <p id="b615-7" data-blocks='[["BL_615.10",615,[123,2139,1143,210]]]'>It is also admitted that the Appearance Docket contains the following entry: “On August 5, 1959, verdict fee paid and judgment entered on verdict in favor of William Ilartigan in sum of $20000.”</p>

    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[254,590,1144,816]]]'>The opinion of Judge Marshall contains the following two paragraphs in disposition of this controversy : “After a careful review of the entire record, the Court is of the opinion that there is not sufficient evidence to support defendant’s contention. It is admitted that counsel for plaintiff paid the verdict fee on August 5, 1959, and judgment was noted on the verdict slip, in the fee docket, the Adsectum Index and General Judgment Index. The clerk from the Prothonotary’s Office testified that he entered the judgment on the back of the verdict slip on August 5,1959, and also on the Appearance Docket. The court records speak for themselves and the Court should sustain them unless there is. sufficient evidence to the contrary.</p>
    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[254,1418,1143,419]]]'>“In addition to this, it is to be noted that although counsel for defendant states he had the Appearance Docket checked periodically, he never examined the other dockets or the papers themselves until November 20, 1959. Had he done so, he would have discovered that plaintiff’s counsel paid the verdict fee on August 5, 1959, and judgment had been entered in the other dockets.”</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.7",616,[253,1859,1144,485]]]'>The evidence before the court on the crucial point was the testimony of five men: Norbert Pail, a college student working part time in the winter and full time in the summer in the office of defendant’s counsel; David H. Trushel, Esquire, a lawyer associated with defendant’s counsel; Harry A. Sherman, Esquire, plaintiff’s trial counsel; Hamilton A. Robinson, Esquire, defendant’s trial counsel; and John S. Kenna, a clerk in the Prothonotary’s office.</p>

    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[122,1042,1146,969]]]'>Mr. Trushel testified that he was an associate in Mr. Robinson’s office and was asked by him to examine the Appearance Docket on November 20; that he did so on that date and found no entry of the judgment; that he then got the papers in the case and found the receipt for the jury fee and its reference to entering judgment; that he spoke to Mr. Mawhinney, a floor man in the Prothonotary’s office, who looked at the Appearance Docket and pronounced it an error; that Mawhinney then summoned Kenna, another floor man, who, at Mawhinney’s direction, entered judgment in the Appearance Docket as of August 5, 1959; that this was done in his, Trushel’s presence on November 20; that he saw Pail’s pencilled X on the docket; and that when he protested Kenna’s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>entry of judgment on the ground that it would affect the right to appeal, Kenna shrugged his shoulders.</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.6",617,[122,2033,1145,264]]]'>Mr. Sherman testified that he paid the $5 verdict fee to the Prothonotary on August 5, 1959; that he notified Mr. Robinson orally that he had paid the verdict fee and taken judgment; and that he never checked the Appearance Docket after August 4th.</p>

    <p id="b618-4" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[249,817,1141,422]]]'>Henna testified that he was a prothonotary’s clerk; that he believed that he had made the entry of judgment in the Appearance Docket on August 5 because the book said so, but that he had no independent personal recollection of the fact, although he did remember Mawhinney’s speaking to him about it; and that he had seen the small pencilled X in the Docket but did not know what it meant.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[247,1260,1143,362]]]'>On the basis of this testimony Judge Marshall said that the records spoke for themselves and should be sustained except on sufficient evidence to the contrary: he referred to the admitted facts but dismissed defendant’s contention concerning the disputed Appearance Docket by saying that it was not supported by sufficient evidence.</p>
    <p id="b618-6" data-blocks='[["BL_618.7",618,[242,1645,1146,584]]]'>We find it difficult to imagine more specific evidence than that of Messrs. Thrushel, Robinson and Pail. Thrushel saw Henna make the entry on November 20; Henna didn’t remember but relied on the book. Plaintiff argues that if defendant didn’t call Mawhinney to testify it must be presumed that the witness had adverse evidence to offer, but in a case like this that sword cuts both ways; the court was entitled to every scrap of relevant testimony and the duty to call a witness, if he had any knowledge, lay equally on both sides.</p>

These are not lay witnesses, strangers to the court’s process. The essential issue <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>lies between an officer of tlie court and an employe of one of its arms. Counsel’s unworthy imputation of unprofessional conduct to a brother lawyer, that he would shade his testimony so as to uphold the position of his firm, is weaker than the counter inference that the Protlionotary’s employe may have gone by the book and forgotten the fact in order to cover his reprehensible act of retro-dating an entry of judgment and destroying counsel’s right of appeal.</p>
    <p id="b619-4" data-blocks='[["BL_619.5",619,[118,883,1146,431]]]'>We regard the evidence favoring November 20 as so clear and weighty and the opposing evidence as so lacking in substance that we would be regrinding the miller’s grain if we ordered a further hearing or failed to settle the issue ourselves.

Or, if he did not wish to go to the prothonotary’s office, although it is in the very building where he tried this case and tries cases almost daily, he only had to turn to the Pittsburgh Legal Journal in his of<a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>fice to get tlie information which he would have us believe was being hidden from him.

In that event, the Court should have so notified the plaintiff and that would have ended this protracted litigation. While I am aivare that the doctrine of estoppel cannot apply to a court, yet it seems to me that there is some kind of moral obligation on an appellate court when it once decides that a litigant has a legal claim and orders him to proceed in court to litigate that claim, not to tell him three years later that he has no legal claim.</p>
