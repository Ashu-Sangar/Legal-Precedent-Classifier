The first enactment of this law in 1936 was silent on the topic of necessitous abandonment of one’s job. It contained no exception to the provision that: “An employe shall be ineligible for compensation for any week in which his unemployment is due to . . . (b) voluntarily leaving work . . .” (Act of December 5, 1936, P. L. (1937) 2897, §402.)</p>

(b) in which his unemployment is due to voluntarily leaving work without good cause . . .” (Act of April 23, 1942, P. L. 60, §402.)</p>

When the employer would not or could not offer her the hours of-work she requested, she quit her employment and made claim for unemployment compensation. The Superior Court affirmed unemployment compensation because she had “good cause” for leaving her employment, pointing out: “She [the claimant] was legally obligated to care for her three small children. Family obligations cannot be considered as mere whim or fancy but, on the contrary, are real and compelling reasons. The board’s finding that she desired -work at a time to permit her to fulfill her family obligations is supported by the evidence and conclusive . . .

Judge Rexo, in discussing this phase of the entire picture, recalled that one of the reasons for the call of the Special Session which enacted the Act of 1945 was designated as “Liberalization of the Unemployment Compensation Law,” and then said: “These circumstances justify the conclusion that the General Assembly deliberately chose to enact into law purely personal reasons as good cause, and a majority of this court announced that conclusion in Teicher Unemployment Compensation Case, <a href="/pa-super/154/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="154 Pa.

    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[103,1603,1148,758]]]'>The same reason applies to the instant situation. When the Legislature in 1955 removed the specific exception of the 1953 amendment precluding marital, filial and domestic circumstances and obligations from being good cause within the meaning of the Act, the Legislature intended those obligations again to be good cause, as had been held prior to the 1953 exception. The change of the term “good cause” as it appeared in the 1942 Act to “cause of a necessitous and compelling nature” in the 1955 amendment is simply a matter of phraseology which in no way adversely affects the conclusions reached by the Superior Court in the <em>Teicher, Sturdevant, Mooney, Hamilton </em>and <em>Quiggle </em>cases, supra.</p>

      <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>Judge Reno made an irrefutable observation of legal, sociological and economic significance when he said: “The Unemployment Compensation Law is remedial humanitarian legislation of vast import. Its benefits sections must be liberally and broadly construed. It is primarily intended for the benefit of unemployed workers.”</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[248,760,1143,541]]]'>When an employed person becomes unemployed, he is, by that fact in itself, potentially a beneficiary of the Act. The law was passed to protect society itself as much as the individual involved because the cumulative distress of vast numbers of unemployed can wreck the stoutest and most solid economy. Thus, the Legislature in its wisdom, provided a formidable bridge over which the recently dismissed employee may pass unharmed (or as slightly harmed as possible) from one job to another.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[244,1322,1146,695]]]'>The Act has wiped out the acute and almost unbearable hardships which heretofore accompanied unanticipated loss of employment. The employee does not need to fear now that suddenly, because he has been “laid off”, the bread will be taken off his table and his wife and children will be bereft of adequate heat, light, raiment and perhaps even a roof over their heads. The Unemployment Compensation Act is proof that mankind is on the march toward an ever-increasing concern over one’s fellow-man who, through no fault of his own, falls into the waters of want and privation because of economic floods which he can no more control than the rains and the snows.</p>

Is he to be denied the, benefits of the Unem<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>ployment law? The Legislature has answered that question in the negative. Whether the unemployment is due to the closing of the plant or the wrecking of the bridge which leads to the plant, the employee still needs to eat. The General Assembly accordingly has provided that the employee in such a situation may obtain the benefits of the Act, provided the facts demonstrate that he is kept away from his job for reasons of a “necessitous and compelling nature.” In determining whether such facts exist, the test is not whether the claimant has taken himself out of the scope of the Act, but whether the Act specifically excludes him from its provisions.
