Chief Justice Gibson in Hock v. Hock, 6 S. &amp; R. 47 succinctly stated this rule: “Proof of execution must be made by two witnesses, each of whom must separately depose to all the facts necessary to complete the chain of evidence, so that no link in it may depend on the credibility of but one”. More recently the rule was concisely stated by Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stern in James’ Estate, supra (p. 275) : “There must be a strict compliance with these statutory provisions, and a will is not valid unless executed precisely in accordance therewith. If executed by mark, it is not a lawful instrument unless testator’s name was subscribed in his presence and by his direction and authority : Hunter’s Estate, <a href="/pa/328/0484-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="328 Pa. 484" data-case-ids="1179662" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0484-01">328 Pa. 484</a> . . .

The testimony of these two witnesses is diametrically opposed. The decedent understood and spoke the Polish language and was unable to sign her name; it is not disputed that decedent affixed her mark to the will after her name was subscribed thereto by Miss Jurkowski; it is not disputed that both Miss Jurkowski and Steve Torhan witnessed the will. The variance in the testimony is as to the time of its execution, the witnessing thereof, and the place and manner in which it was witnessed. Miss Jurkowski testified that sometime in the afternoon of January 4, 1954, the decedent, with one or two of her daughters, came to her place of business, she being a justice of the peace and maintaining an office in the Borough of Ambridge; that decedent discussed with her, in the Polish language, the contents of the will and thereafter she typed the will; after it <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>was typed slie subscribed the name ‘Anna Torhan’ to the will, Mrs. Torhan then made her mark in her presence and she, Miss Jurkowski, then witnessed the making of her mark. She further testified that Steve Torhan did not accompany his mother to her office, he was not present when the will was discussed, he was not present when Mrs. Torhan affixed her £X’ or when she, Miss Jurkowski, witnessed the will by affixing her signature thereto. Steve Torhan testified that he accompanied his mother to Miss Jurkowski’s office, arriving there between ten and eleven a.m., on January 4, 1954; that when they arrived a clerk, employed by Miss JurkoAvski, advised them they would have to wait she being otherwise occupied; thereafter he, together with his mother, discussed the preparation and contents of the will with Miss Jurkowski in her office. He further testified that subsequent to the discussion the will was typed either by Miss Jurkowski or her clerk and then Miss JurkoAvski subscribed his mother’s name to the will; his mother then affixed her £X’ mark, and immediately thereafter he and Miss JurkoAvski Avitnessed the Avill. He further testified, that Miss Jurkowski, after witnessing the Avill, affixed her notary public seal thereto. Miss Jurkowski denied affixing the seal to the Avill and an examination thereof shows that no such seal was affixed. She also denied having any clerk in her employment in January of 1954. <em>We find Miss Jurkowski’s testimony to be </em>credible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a> In corroboration of her testimony, Charles Shevchik, son of the decedent, testified that on Sunday afternoon, January 10, 1954, his mother having had a birthday on January 7th, he had gone to her home Avhere he was told about the aatII and his mother showed it to him; while he was examining it his brother, Steve Torhan, walked in, and when he made inquiry of him about the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>will Steve told Mm that his mother and his sister, Helen, had brought it home for him to sign as a witness and that he did so sign as a witness.</p>
