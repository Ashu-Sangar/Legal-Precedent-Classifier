The contention is a non sequitur. True enough, the court of quarter sessions has jurisdiction of the person of its clerk, but it has never been given jurisdiction of municipal auditors’ reports which are in the clerk’s keeping only as one of the statutorily designated repositories. As the Superior Court pointed out, “The fact that one of the three places at which the report must be filed is the office of the clerk of the court of quarter sessions does not give that court jurisdiction of a contest over the report’s contents any more than the requirement that the report be filed with the Secretary of Internal Affairs gives that Secretary jurisdiction of such contest.” <em>Matey Appeal, </em>supra, p. 401. There is no legal justification whatsoever for ascribing to the court of quarter sessions jurisdiction to pass upon either the form or substance of a report by municipal auditors on file in the office of the clerk of the court.</p>

    <p id="b224-4" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[256,774,1145,1192]]]'>The petitioners’ allegations that the report was motivated by political considerations and was unnecessarily scandalous and defamatory could not and, of course, did not clothe the court of quarter sessions with jurisdiction to pass upon either the form or substance of the auditors’ report. If expeditious and effective action looking to the judicial suppression of a legally improper report was indicated in the circumstances, the court of common pleas, which has unquestioned jurisdiction of the subject matter, was the competent tribunal to afford appropriate and prompt relief. Nor is it material that the auditors on two occasions, prior to filing their report, had sought and obtained from the court of quarter sessions an extension of the time prescribed by statute for such filing. Obviously, no jurisdiction of the subject matter was conferred by the auditors’ request for an enlargement of the filing time. If judicial power to grant such an extension actually does exist (and we do not mean to imply that it does), it could be nowhere else than in the court of common pleas as ancillary to that court’s jurisdiction under Section 1038 of The Borough Code of 1927.</p>

Tlie reason is not far to seek. Tlie appeal was originally taken to tliis court and was remitted by us to the Superior Court on the strength of the ruling in <em>Manor Township School District Audit, </em><a href="/pa/281/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="281 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1087019" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0116-01">281 Pa. 116</a>, 117-118, <a href="/citations/?q=126%20A.%20251" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="126 A. 251">126 Atl. 251</a> (1924). None the less, the remission of this appeal to the Superior Court was an inadvertence. Our attention had not been called at the time to the fact that no appeal to the Superior Court from the action of the court of quarter sessions had been conferred by statute. Hence, the action of the court of quarter sessions was reviewable only on common law certiorari in an exercise of the King’s Bench powers under the Act of May 22, 1722, 1 Sm. L. 131, 140, Section XIII, which the Superior Court does not possess. Whether the absence of a statutorily authorized appeal to the Superior Court was brought to the court’s attention in <em>Manor Township School District Audit </em>case, supra, does not appear. What does appear in the brief per curiam opinion is that the court of quarter sessions had jurisdiction of the auditors’ report there involved. However that may be, we reaffirm that, lacking a statutorily authorized appeal, the Superior Court is without power to review the action of a lower court upon a common law writ of certiorari, as we held in <em>Bell Appeal, </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.5",225,[141,1761,1145,598]],["BL_226.1",226,[245,383,1145,927]]]'>Any restrictions (due to the decision in <em>Bell Appeal) </em>on the scope of appellate review, as theretofore exercised by the Superior Court, can be readily and effectively lifted, to the extent desired, by appropriate legislation. For example, <em>appeals </em>from proceedings in courts of quarter sessions (except where title to a public office is involved) are lodged in the Superior Court by Section 7(a) of the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, 17 PS §182. Where, however, no <em>appeal </em>is provided for by statute or where a statute prescribes that the decision of the lower court shall be final or expressly <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>prohibits an appeal, the Superior Court can be, and properly should be, legislatively empowered to review the records in such cases on common law certiorari, broad or narrow as the case may be, according to the well recognized distinction in the use of the writ. Such authorization would implement the Superior Court in a manner that would enable it to review all proceedings emanating from courts of quarter sessions (except cases involving title to public office) regardless of whether or not a right of appeal is statutorily authorized. It was not until 1941 that power to issue the extraordinary common law writs of <em>mandamus </em>and <em>prohibition </em>to courts of inferior jurisdiction was first conferred on the Superior Court for use “where such actions are ancillary to proceedings within its <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction” (emphasis supplied). Act of May 21, 1941, P. L. 47, §1, 17 PS §181 (pkt. part).</p>

Owing to the fact that the pronouncements of a court with respect to matters not within its jurisdiction are Avithout binding legal force and effect, an apprehension has been voiced that our holding in <em>Bell Appeal </em>operated to nullify decisions of the Superior Court in cases heretofore passed upon by that court where no appeal was authorized by statute and revieAV Avas had on common law Avrits of certiorari and that, consequently, the Superior Court’s orders in such cases Ávere invalid. There is no practical basis for any such fear. Even though the Superior Court’s opinions in the indicated cases were not jurisdictionally decisional, the judgments, orders or decrees entered pursuant thereto in the courts of first instance, where all of such cases originated and where jurisdiction of the subject matter unquestionably resided, have long' since become final and unassailable, not having been appealed within the time <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>prescribed by law. It is in the courts of first instance and not in the appellate courts that final judgments, orders and decrees are ultimately entered and become unimpeachable if not appealed from. Whether the opinions of the Superior Court in such cases constitute authoritative expressions of germane law depends, of course, upon their inherent worth. They represent the considered views of judges learned in the law on the legal questions considered and any judge of a court of first instance will be well advised to follow the reasoning of such opinions unless they appear to be in conflict with controlling higher judicial authority.</p>
