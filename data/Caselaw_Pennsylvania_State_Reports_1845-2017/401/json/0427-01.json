The words were an obvious exaggeration. Certainly, Donald G. Smith had no notion that the crane operator intended to kill Mc-Featers or anyone else. It was the kind of an expression often used among workmen to suggest sloppy operation and in no way to be associated with homicidal action, criminal or accidental.\nUnder these circumstances, the trial court should have submitted the question of the plaintiffs alleged contributory negligence to the jury, together with the question of defendant\u2019s negligence.\nReversed with a procedendo.\nMr. Justice Bell dissents.",
