        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis was an action of trespass in which the plaintiff claimed damages from the defendant on account of injuries which she alleged, she sustained by reason of defendant\u2019s negligence. The statement of claim averred that at 6 P. M. on July 30, 1932, plaintiff entered defendant\u2019s restaurant to be served with food \u201cwhen by reason of the negligence and carelessness of defendant, a severe explosion occurred therein and a panic of the customers therein occurred so that by means of the panic and explosion, plaintiff was violently thrown over a certain chair and was trampled upon and injured by other customers in the said panic produced and caused by the said explosion.\u201d She then detailed the injuries which she claimed resulted to her from being \u201cthrown down and trampled upon.\u201d\nAt the trial she offered no proof whatever in support of her allegation of defendant\u2019s negligence. Her proof was confined to a recital of the fact that \u201cthere was a terrific explosion on the southwest corner of the building,\u201d which she said she was facing. She testified: \u201cI heard an awful noise, and it looked as if the whole balcony was coming down and hit the people on the floor; . . . the place was crowded. With one accord they rushed towards the door, and being sort of in the center, I got caught in the jam, about six feet from where I was standing. ... A crowd pushed me forward over the chair, and the chair and I rolled over together, and the chair racked me half a dozen places, and I was thrown so far that I fell flat on the floor and fainted.\u201d She then stated that she was taken to the hospital, where she was examined and sent home.\nWhen plaintiff rested, defendant moved for a non-suit. The motion was refused. Testimony was then produced in behalf of defendant. In the charge of the court there was no reference whatsoever made to any proof offered by the plaintiff in support of the allegation of negligence. On this phase of the case the court said in its charge: \u201cShe heard, she said, an explosion, like that of a bomb. . . . Whether you will accept it or not you will have to decide later on. . . . She said she heard an explosion and the place became filled with smoke, soot and dirt, and that there was a terrific rush of people towards the exit; that she was caught in the jam of people and wedged across a chair and in that position was knocked down and trampled upon. . . . There is not a single witness in this case that says anything like that happened to her.\u201d\nThe jury found a verdict in favor of the defendant. A new trial was asked for and refused. Plaintiff appealed.\nThe chief complaint of the appellant is that the trial judge over-emphasized the defendant\u2019s theory of the case and belittled the plaintiff\u2019s theory, and that the charge was argumentative.\nIt is clear to us that plaintiff made out no case against defendant, and the motion for a nonsuit should have been granted.\nIn Sowers v. McManus, 214 Pa. 244, 63 A. 601, this court said, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Bkown : \u201cWhere one is injured by the explosion of it [dynamite] when stored, the burden rests upon him, as in other cases of negligence, of proving either the specific act or negligence that caused the explosion, or such circumstances surrounding it as would justify the inference that the degree of care required by the law had not been observed. When, as here, nothing appears but the explosion itself, there can be nothing but conjecture as to what caused it, and against conjectured negligence no man is called upon to defend, whether the care to be exercised by him be of ordinary or of high degree.\u201d\nIn Earle v. Arbogast et al., 180 Pa. 409, 36 A. 923, this court held that in an action by a landlord against the tenants to recover damages for a loss caused by an explosion, the mere fact of the explosion did not throw upon the tenants the burden of proving that they were not negligent; and that the burden of proof was upon the landlord [plaintiff] throughout the trial.\nIn support of its proposition that the burden of proof in this case shifted to defendant on the showing plaintiff made, the latter relies upon the following cases: Shafer v. Locock, Hawthorn & Co., 168 Pa. 497, 32 A. 44; Durning v. Hyman, 286 Pa. 376, 133 A. 568; Gawronski v. McAdoo, 266 Pa. 449, 109 A. 763, and Maltz v. Carter, 311 Pa. 550, 166 A. 852. All these cases are easily distinguishable from the case at bar.\nThe Shafer Case was an action in trespass to recover damages for loss of property which was destroyed by a fire alleged to have been caused by defendant\u2019s workmen. In that case this court said: \u201cThe destruction of the property was due to a fire brought there [i. e., on the roof] by them [defendant\u2019s workmen], and under their control. The occurrence was not in the ordinary course of things, and the circumstances connected with and surrounding it put on them the duty of showing that it was at least consistent with the exercise of proper care in the performance of their work.\u201d\nIn the Burning Case, a child thirteen years of age was admitted by a ticket to a moving picture theatre. As soon as she sat on a seat provided for the use of patrons, it broke and caused her to fall. This court held that from these circumstances an inference of negligence might be legitimately drawn. In the instant case, if the plaintiff had produced some evidence as to just what \u201cexploded\u201d and such attendant circumstances as would warrant the inference of defendant\u2019s carelessness, she would have shifted the burden of proof to the owner of the exploding instrumentality to show that he exercised due care to insure the safety of anyone having legitimate business at a place near enough to that instrumentality to be injured by it if it did explode. In the case before us all that plaintiff showed as to the cause of her alleged injuries was that \u201cthere was a terrific explosion on the southwest corner of the building.\u201d Her allegation of an explosion is apparently based on an inference from the fact that she \u201cheard an awful noise, and it looked as if the whole balcony was coming down.\u201d It does not appear anywhere in the testimony that the thing that exploded was under defendant\u2019s control or even on liis premises. For all that appears, some stranger might have dropped a bomb \u201con the southwest corner of the building,\u201d or an airplane or a meteor might have crashed through the roof.\nIn the Gawronski Case this court said: \u201cCounsel for defendant volunteered an admission wherein he stated: \u2018The engineer lost control of the mechanism of his engine in such a way that the brakes would not work.\u2019 This, in the absence of further explanation, presumably within the power of defendant to make, was sufficient to justify the jury in finding either that the locomotive was defective or that it was improperly handled by the men having charge thereof, either of which would constitute negligence.\u201d In the case before us plaintiff did not submit proof of any circumstances from which the inference of negligence could legitimately be drawn.\nIn the Maltz Case the plaintiff was injured in an automobile in which defendant\u2019s decedent was the driver. The automobile was described as \u201cpractically new.\u201d Without warning, it swerved and left the road on the right-hand side and struck a tree seven and three-tenths feet from the edge of the concrete and up an 18-inch rise. The machine was demolished, the driver was fatally injured, and the plaintiff seriously injured. There was no evidence offered in explanation of the car\u2019s suddenly leaving the road. This court held that the circumstances of this accident unexplained justified an inference of negligence and quoted the following from Knox v. Simmerman, 301 Pa. 1, 151 A. 678: \u201cIt is not a case of res ipsa loquitur, for negligence is not presumed from the mere happening of the accident, but from the circumstances under which it occurred. It was an abnormal occurrence such as in the usual course of events does not occur. An automobile when driven along a dry level road in daylight at proper speed and under control is not accustomed to leave the pavement and dash against a stone pile at the roadside. That the coup\u00e9 did this very extraordinary thing is some evidence that it was not properly driven.\u201d In the Maltz Case the instrumentality which caused the injuries complained of was admittedly under the control of defendant\u2019s decedent. A prima facie case of negligence was made out. Here no such case was made out. What plaintiff is really contending for is the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. This doctrine cannot be successfully invoked by a plaintiff on a record as barren as this.\nIn view of the fact that the evidence disclosed no cause of action against the defendant, the duty of the court was.to grant the motion made for a nonsuit, or, at the close of the trial, to have directed a verdict for the defendant. Such being the state of the record, plaintiff\u2019s assignments of error are only of academic int\u00e9rest and no purpose would be served by their adjudication.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
