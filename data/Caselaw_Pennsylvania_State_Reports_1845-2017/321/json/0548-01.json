        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Deew,\nPlaintiff, a taxpayer, seeks in this class bill to enjoin members of the city council of Philadelphia and the clerk and sergeant-at-arms of the council from serving on various political committees. An answer was filed by two of the defendants and preliminary objections in behalf of the others. The appeal is from the dismissal of the bill.\nThe complaint is founded upon section 23, of article XIX, of the Charter Act of Philadelphia, approved June 25, 1919 (P. L. 581). In that section it is provided that \u201cno officer, clerk, or employee of any city of the first class, or of any department, trust, or commission thereof, shall be a member of . . . any political convention . . . [or] serve as a member of . . . any committee of any political party,\u201d or engage in other specified political activities. Plaintiff contends that defendants are officers and employees within the meaning of this section, and that members of city council are within the unclassified civil service, by virtue of section 3(a) of the same article, which provides that \u201cthe unclassified service shall comprise: (a) All officers elected by the people.\u201d It is a necessary premise in plaintiff\u2019s case that article XIX applies to members and employees of city council, and that councilmen are \u201cofficers elected by the people\u201d under section 3(a) of that article. An examination of the act, however, makes it quite evident that it was not the legislative intent to include these defendants in the provisions of article XIX, and that councilmen are not within the meaning of the term \u201cofficers\u201d as used in the act.\nArticle XIX is entitled \u201cThe Civil Service.\u201d Article XVI deals with'\u201cCity Council.\u201d In section 3, of article IV, which is headed \u201cOfficers and Employees in General,\u201d it is provided that \u201cno person shall hold more than one office or position of profit under the city government, and no person shall hold any office or position of profit under the city, or any department thereof, while holding any other office or position of profit\u201d in or under the federal or state government or any political subdivision thereof, with certain exceptions. A practically equivalent provision as to councilmen is found in section 3 of article XVI. This repetition would obviously be unnecessary if members of council were included in the term \u201cofficers\u201d in article IV. Under section 2(b) of article IV, whenever \u201cany elective officer\u201d of a first-class city dies or becomes incapacitated, his place shall, in the absence of other provision therefor, be filled by a vote of the council, until the next municipal election more than 30 days thereafter. On the other hand, vacancies within the council itself are, by section 2, of article XVI, to be filled at the next general, municipal or special election, occurring not less than 30 days after the happening of the vacancy. Plainly, a councilman is not an \u201celective officer\u201d within the meaning of section 2(b) of article IV.\nSection 1, of article XIX, provides that all appointments, transfers, reinstatements, and the like, in the civil service of the city \u201cshall be made in accordance with the terms and provisions of this article and the rules prescribed thereunder.\u201d Plaintiff would have us believe that these defendants are included in the civil service and therefore subject to this provision. But under section 5, of article XVI, the city council has power \u201cto provide for its own organization, and to provide for the employment and fix the salaries of such persons as may be necessary to the proper discharge of its business.\u201d Section 25, of article XIX, stipulates: \u201cAny officer, clerk, or employee of such city, .or of any department, trust, or commission thereof, violating any of the provisions of this article, shall be immediately dismissed by the mayor or by the head of the department, trust, or commission in which he is employed.\u201d If defendants are \u201cofficers and employees\u201d within the meaning of section 23 of this article, as plaintiff contends, they must also be subject to section 25. But it manifestly never could have been the legislative intent to subject councilmen to dismissal by the mayor or by the head of any department, trust or commission. Merely to state these anomalous consequences of plaintiff\u2019s argument is sufficient to show its unsoundness. It is clear beyond doubt that the legislature did not intend to require city council, described in section 1, of article XVI, as \u201cthe legislative branch of the government\u201d of the city, to submit to the civil service regulations or to the supervision of the civil service commission. In view of section 5, of article XVI, the employees of the council must be regarded as being responsible to that body alone. It follows that these defendants are not within the terms of section 23, of article XIX, upon which plaintiff\u2019s bill is based. Even if they would otherwise be included within that section, they are clearly removed from its operation by section 28, of article XIX, which provides: \u201cNothing in this article shall be construed to apply to the officers and employees of any office, department, bureau, commission, board, or trust, not now administered under the existing civil service laws.\u201d Plaintiff has thus pointed to no legal ground for judicial interference in the situation complained of, and her prayers for relief must therefore fail.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.",
