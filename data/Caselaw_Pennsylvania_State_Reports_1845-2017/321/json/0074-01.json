        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Schaffer,\nThe question for determination is whether Henrietta E. Garrett, widow of Walter Garrett, took an absolute estate in fee simple under his will, or a life estate with power to use the principal during her life and to dispose of it by power of appointment in her will. The orphans\u2019 court decided that the widow took an absolute estate in fee. A number of the heirs at law of Walter Garrett appeal.\nThe size of the estate left by Henrietta E. Garrett, fl7,549,642.58, should not becloud the meaning clear to us, of the paragraph in Walter Garrett\u2019s will which is to be interpreted. It reads: \u201cThirteenth: \u2014 I give, devise and bequeath to my dear wife Henrietta E. Garrett, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate real and personal whatsoever and wheresoever situate for her own absolute use and disposal. And not having been blessed with any children, I desire that at my death she shall make a will disposing of all her property so that she may know to whom it will descend. If I should die within one calendar month after the execution of this Will, I trust that she will see that all of its provisions are fully carried out.\u201d\nThe first rule for the interpretation of wills should be the common sense one, that where the testator\u2019s intention is expressed in plain language, no technical rules of construction are necessary: Boyer v. Campbell, 312 Pa. 460, 462, and cases cited. That rule governs in this instance. That the expression \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my dear wife Henrietta E. Garrett, her heirs, executors, administrators and assigns\u201d gave her an absolute estate is not controverted. It could not be. But it is argued that the words which follow \u201cfor her own absolute use and disposal\u201d cut down the complete estate to one of a lifetime right to use income and principal and a power to appoint by will what should be left. A long line of our eases, of which Tarter\u2019s Est., 291 Pa. 458, 462; Crawford v. Withrow, 314 Pa. 497, 499, 500; Rapson\u2019s Est., 318 Pa. 587, 590, are examples, lay down the principle that where in a will an absolute estate is given it will not be cut down by subsequent language unless the intent so to do is clear. Certainly it cannot be said that any such intent is clear in the will before us. On the contrary, we think the language is confirmatory of the fee previously given. As bequeathed, it was \u201cfor her own absolute use\u201d and for her own absolute \u201cdisposal.\u201d Her dominion over it was to be absolute, that is to say, unlimited.\nIf the words \u201cheirs, executors, administrators and assigns\u201d had been left out and the words had been \u201cto my dear wife Henrietta E. Garrett for her own absolute use and disposal,\u201d we think there could be even then no other determination than that she took a fee. While it is earnestly argued that the words \u201cfor her own absolute use and disposal\u201d import a power of appointment, the words are not apt for such a purpose and convey no such meaning to our minds. Nor are they such as would be used to create a life estate.\nThe further-expression in the next sentence confirms the conclusion that the testator intended an absolute estate in his wife, \u201cI desire that at my death she shall make a will disposing of all her property so that she may know to whom it will descend.\u201d This shows that he regarded the property after his death as hers. There was no gift over and it seems to us inconceivable that the testator, whose estate amounted to more than f6,000,000, could have intended to permit its ultimate disposition to remain in the air and that he did not regard its placement as fixed in his widow by his will. The absence of a gift over aids the construction, if aid were necessary, that an absolute estate was intended to be given: Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, section 12, 20 P. S., section 224; Eberle v. Wood, 304 Pa. 403, 407, and cases cited.\nThe letter from the testator to his wife, referring to the will, which letter the court refused to admit in evidence, was properly rejected: Dembinski\u2019s Est., 316 Pa. 61; Hughes\u2019s Est., 319 Pa. 326; Mizener\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 62. The will stood in no need of anything outside of it to aid in its interpretation. Moreover, as we read the letter, it does not help appellants but evidences that the testator thought he had conferred on his wife an absolute estate.\nThe decree is affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.",
