It is contended that the city council has already exceeded its capacity, as limited by the Constitution of the Commonwealth, to borrow without a vote of the people, and that for this reason the ordinance is unconstitutional and void. After a hearing on the bill and the answers filed by the defendants, the court below found that the proposed increase of indebtedness is within the borrowing power of the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>city council.

However, the statement shows that city council has already borrowed $26,367,958.59. But, from this amount the comptroller has deducted $8,177,304.60, representing two-thirds of all outstanding delinquent taxes. This deduction reduces the councilmanic debt to $18,190,653.99, a figure well within its borrowing power. It is apparent that as the debt is reduced, the borrowing capacity is increased.</p>

According to his estimate, the payments of delinquent taxes during the present year will exceed eighty per centum of the total outstanding. Therefore, he maintains that the two-thirds proportion, though fixed arbitrarily, represents a conservative and realizable estimate.

For example, in <em>McGuire v. Phila. (No. 1), </em><a href="/pa/245/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="245 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="326271" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0287-01">245 Pa. 287</a>, 293, we said: “Outstanding solvent debts, within the meaning of the Act of 1874, which a municipality may deduct from its gross indebtedness in ascertaining its borrowing capacity, are debts due to it directly, payment of which it can enforce as one of its quick assets for the liquidation of any of its obligations.” To the same effect in <em>Elliot v. Phila., </em>supra, we said, at page 229: “It seems to us that the method provided for ascertaining the net indebtedness of municipalities by this Act [of 1874] is both reasonable and sensible ... Of course, the municipal authorities cannot arbitrarily say that every claim of the city is an outstanding solvent debt, or that revenues necessary to pay current expenses could be set apart for this purpose, but where there are bona fide outstanding debts due the city, and revenues not necessary to meet current expenses are available for the payment of indebtedness within the year, such deductions can be made under the provisions of the act in ascertaining the <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>net indebtedness.” See also <em>Halpin v.

Thus in <em>McGuire v. Phila., </em>supra, a city obligation assumed by a school district was held not deductible, because it did not appear when or how the indebtedness incurred by the city was to be paid by the school district. On the other hand, in <em>Schuldice v.

Such municipal assessments, however, cannot be considered an offset against the city’s debt until represented by undisputed liens actually filed against the property: <em>McAnulty v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/284/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="284 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="1092003" data-case-paths="/pa/284/0304-01">284 Pa. 304</a>.

Upon this record we are bound to accept as a fact that there will be prompt collection of this proportion of delinquent taxes as claimed by the comptroller. The reason given in <em>Schuldice v. Pittsburgh, </em>supra, for regarding liens based on benefit assessments as “solvent debts” apply with equal force to delinquent taxes; here, as there, the taxes are soundly secured upon property which the city may sell to enforce its claim, and over three-quartex*s of such taxes outstanding are paid off each year. Indeed, delinquent taxes are in an even better position than assessment benefit liens; the filing and enforcement of such claims are regulated by the Act of May 16, 1923, P. L. 207, as amended by the Act of April 30, 1929, P. L. 902. Section 2 of the act specifically provides that taxes shall be a first lien on the property assessed, and section 3 provides that other municipal claims shall have priority in satisfaction over all other charges against the property, save only the costs of sale, <em>and taxes. </em>Subsequent provisions of the act make no distinction between the manner of enforcement of taxes and that of other municipal claims. Under this act it would seem that taxes are entitled to priority over all other municipal liens. Since it is settled, by <em>Schuldice v. Pittsburgh, </em>supra, that undisputed liens filed for municipal improvements are “solvent debts” to be deducted from a municipality’s indebtedness, it must follow that delinquent taxes are also deductible in such proportion as they are certain to be collected.</p>

While these cases cannot be deemed authorities for our present conclusion, as no question was raised in any of them as to the validity of this practice, yet they indicate that a construction has been given to <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>the term “solvent debts” which, after so many years, we should be loath to disturb.</p>

If then, as is sometimes done, the amount of delinquent taxes which the municipality expects to collect within the year are treated as current revenues, for the payment of current expenses, they cannot properly also be deducted from the indebtedness of the city.

The act provides for the issuance of notes such as were authorized by the ordinance, “to pay the engineering, architectural and other expenses incurred, or <em>to be incurred </em>in connection with contracts for municipal improvements; and to pay for the construction of public improvements within the city and the preliminary expenses in connection therewith.” It will be noted that the ordinance embodies these authorizations in exact terms, yet this defendant contends that the act contemplates that notes shall be issued only for the payment of expenses already incurred. He argues that, as no contracts have yet been entered into, there are no debts incurred for which money may be borrowed under the authority of the act. This argument refutes itself. The act expressly states that money may be borrowed to pay expenses <em>“to be incurred” </em>in connection with contracts for municipal improvements. This language contemplates that the moneys borrowed under the act are to be used for future obligations, and we cannot disregard the plain import of the statute and require that definite engagements and contracts be entered into by a municipality prior to taking advantage of its provisions.</p>
