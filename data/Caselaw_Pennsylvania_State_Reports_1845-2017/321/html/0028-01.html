The Poole Company should of course not recover unless the record shows performance of valid contracts. The county complains that the Poole Company was not required to produce such evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The suggestion must be rejected for several reasons. To disregard the issues made by the pleadings, save by express or implied consent, would generally lead to intolerable confusion, uncertainty, waste of time and public expense. The liberal construction of the statutes allowing amendments (and of Equity Rule 56) protects ¿gainst possible hardship. When these parties went to trial, the frequently amended pleadings clearly advised that the county, in the joint answer filed by two of the commissioners, insisted on the invalidity of the contracts for' specified reasons and the right to reject the machines on specified grounds, while the Poole Company and the third commissioner asserted the validity of the contracts, adequacy of performance, and consequent right to recover the contract price on the basis of the issues pleaded. Later, in the course of the trial, when the county announced its formal alignment with the plaintiff taxpayers, it acted with knowledge of the issues raised and without proposing further amendment; it knew that <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>after a change of membership among the commissioners,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> a majority of them on January 13, 1932, had repudiated the contracts made by their predecessors, and, by their answers, had declared their legal position to be the same as that pleaded in the bill. The case was tried accordingly and on that theory the appellee is entitled to have the record reviewed.</p>

There is no doubt about the general rule that (in the words of appellants’ brief) “when a corporation sues on a contract entered into with a governmental board, or seeks to enforce payment to it for goods delivered or services rendered under the contract to such a body, the claimant must prove and establish its case, and if certain steps, acts or doings are required preliminarily to the making of the contract in question, the fact that such steps have been taken, such acts performed and such doings occurred must be shown by evidence produced at trial.” But it is equally well settled that proof need only be made of relevant facts put in issue. The ultimate inquiry was whether the contracts were invalid in the respects averred or whether they were valid with the resulting obligation to pay as agreed. That is to be determined by the record as now presented, without regard to which party presented the evidence of the issuable facts. The learned court below concluded that neither violation of statute nor failure to comply with specifications appeared; that it necessarily followed that plaintiffs, including a majority of the commissioners acting for the county, had failed to make good their averments of invalidity; and that, no infirmity appearing, the county was not justified in withholding payment. The findings of fact, resulting in the conclusions adopted, <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>are supported by evidence, and, on familiar principles, must be accepted.</p>

The presumption was not rebutted. The learned court below found, on the evidence, that the contracts were lawfully awarded, that the specifications were complied with, and that, if properly adjusted and used as they were intended to be used, the machines would perform efficiently. In addition it may be noted that the learned chancellor has given his opinion, unfavorable to appellants, of matters in the record, not formally put in issue, which the county now refers to as not proved by the Poole Company. In dealing with many claims of alleged noncompliance with specifications, the learned chancellor said: “If the bill had included the foregoing [referring to specified details], we would have been compelled to find that the machines complied therewith.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

While appellant frankly states that this issue was not specifically made, it is suggested that a general averment of abuse of discretion in awarding the contracts is sufficiently comprehensive to raise the point. We cannot so consider it. The commissioners had no discretion on the subject; the law required that the same specifications be available to all bidders; if all bidders received the same specifications, all had the same or a common standard by which to bid. Sealed proposals for furnishing the first lot of machines were duly invited to be submitted August 18,1930; the others on certain days later. The advertisement for the proposals specified that they must be subject to certain specifications on file in the office of the county controller in the courthouse and that a copy would be furnished to each bidder. Only three machines had been approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth and therefore only three could be the subject of the bids. Of the three, so approved, only two were the subject of proposals: The Automatic Yoting Machine Company of Jamestown, New York, and the Poole Engineering &amp; Machine Company submitted proposals; each bidder had the same specifications. The bid of the Poole Company was substantially less than the other bidder’s and was accepted. Counsel for the plaintiff-taxpayers stated during the trial that he did not contend that there was abuse of discretion in rejecting the bid of the Automatic Yoting Machine Company. The complaint of abuse of discretion is related solely to the acceptance of the Poole Company’s bid. In its proposal this company specified delivery as speedily as its manufacturing schedule would permit; the Automatic Company agreed to deliver provided the award was made within three days. The specifications, including the dates for delivery, were general, applicable to all proposals, and provided that they should be made part of the contract. The contract conformed to the proposals and embodies the specifications. No bad faith, collusion or favoritism in connection with <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>the contracts is charged; there is no evidence that any statutory requirement was omitted.</p>

Neither finding was excepted to; the statute did not require the Secretary to approve the manufacturer.</p>
    <p id="b68-5" data-blocks='[["BL_68.6",68,[244,985,1154,1004]]]'>Complaint is also made that the time of delivery was subsequently extended by the commissioners and that when the second and third contracts respectively were awarded the Poole Company was behind in its deliveries on the prior contract. This also is relied on as abuse of discretion. In rejecting the argument, it is sufficient to say that no fraud or collusion was alleged or sought to be proved; and that no reason for differing from the learned court below on this phase of the case has been suggested: compare <em>McKallip v.

The subject is dealt with at length in the reported opinions of the learned court below already referred to. To the suggestion that a bank cashier’s cheek accompanied the proposal instead of a certified check, as the specifications required, it is perhaps sufficient to <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>say that the refusal to sustain exceptions to the findings of fact on the subject is not assigned as error. But it may be added that the learned chancellor pointed out that the requirement of the specifications was made by the Commissioners and was not a requirement of the statute, thus distinguishing cases cited in which the provision is statutory and must be complied with. Immaterial departures are not ground for setting aside the contracts: <em>Brener v. Phila., </em><a href="/pa/305/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="305 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1134689" data-case-paths="/pa/305/0182-01">305 Pa. 182</a>, 187, <a href="/citations/?q=157%20A.%20466" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="157 A. 466">157 A. 466</a>.

After their delivery, the Secretary of the Commonwealth again had them examined by his examiners on December 2, 1931, and required certain additions, as he was empowered to do by the Voting Machine Act of 1929 as amended June 23, 1931, after these machines had been delivered. He again issued a certificate supplemental to that which he had originally issued. The Poole Company promptly indicated a willingness to make the suggested changes at its own cost (cf. <em>Glover v. Phila., </em>supra). The fact that changes or additions were required by the decree does not, as appellants contend, determine that the machines delivered were not in accord with the contract and specifications. Machines once delivered (though approved) were subject to reexamination. The statute authorized the Secretary of the Commonwealth to reexamine voting machines throughout the State and to require changes, etc., of the character specified in the statute; the Secretary’s power <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>originally conferred was enlarged: Act of June 23,1931, P. L. 1185. The findings of fact require the rejection of appellants’ contention on this phase of the case. Among them was a direct finding (the 49th) that all the machines delivered had the approval of the Secretary when the contracts were awarded, when they were executed and when the machines were delivered. There is also a finding (the 93d) that after the machines were delivered, the Secretary, on January 12, 1932, notified the Poole Company that the machines furnished were defective “under the terms of a new certificate issued by him on December 2, 1931,” and requiring them to “be reconditioned in accordance with said certificate which was based not only upon the requirements of the Voting Machine Act of 1929, but also the amendatory [Act] of June 23, 1931.” On this subject the decree ordered the Poole Company “ (1) To proceed with all expedition and without delay or excuse and recondition, without cost or expense to the County of Schuylkill, the 245 American Voting Machines, purchased by the County of Schuylkill from the Poole Engineering and Machine Company, in full conformity with the following requirements as contained in the re-approval certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under date of December 3, 1931, to wit: (a) Directions for resetting the ratchet at the left end of the machine must be printed and pasted on circular cover so as to be available to the Judge of Election, or other person authorized to remove same when it becomes necessary when machine fails to function when operated manually, (b) A hook used during electrical operation of the machine, which fell causing damage and delay, must be so held in place that possibility of such occurrence is negative, (c) Lock washers must be provided to prevent screws holding voting buttons from backing out. (d) A ‘T square’ or other similar suitable device must be furnished as part of the equipment of each machine to be used in identifying irregular ballots on the irregular ballot sheet. (2) In like <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>manner to furnish and attach dashpots to each of the said 245 American Voting Machines, at the top of each candidate column or row in the vote wedge rack.”</p>

Objections are also based on testimony of election officers that, out of 55 machines used, some did not work, as they were expected to, at the Primary Election; it was agreed that some of them worked satisfactorily. But the following findings are conclusive: “81. The voting machines purchased by and delivered to the County of Schuylkill will perform efficiently the intended use and purpose at elections if properly adjusted and rightfully used according to the printed instructions for the use, care and preparation of the machines for election purposes.” “82. The tests and manipulations of the two machines in court by the plaintiffs’ expert as well as the evidence of difficulty in the use of the machines at the polls in the Primary of 1931, did not exhibit structural defects and faulty design, but maladjustments and wrongful operation.” “70. The machines meet the requirements of subdivision (o) of the general specifications in that when they are properly operated they register or record correctly and accurately every vote cast.” “78. The electrical equipment of the voting machines functioned when properly adjusted.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> In referring to alleged failures <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>of machines in the Primary Election of 1931 he added: “. . . each . . . [failure] is conclusively shown to be due to wrongful preparation or adjustment of the machine for election purposes and failure on the part of the voter to follow the instructions for operation provided by the manufacturers. The demonstrations of plaintiffs’ expert were possible through purposed maladjustment, intentional lack of machine preparation, violent interference with the mechanism, and an expert’s design to interrupt the normal functions of the machine or misuse some parts of the voting mechanism.” These conclusions are supported by evidence. While we have some difficulty in appreciating from the printed record the exact significance of portions of the evidence of the experts’ demonstrations of the working of the machines as exhibited at the trial, we know that the learned chancellor witnessed the demonstrations, had the machines before him and participated in the examinations; he is therefore more qualified than we are to pass on the character and result of the examinations and the prejudice and credibility of the expert witnesses, and as nothing has been shown in argument to require otherwise, we accept his conclusions.</p>
