On October 5, 1931, the Secretary took possession of the United Security Trust Company pursuant to the Act of June 15, 1923, P. L. 809, as amended (7 PS section 1 et seq.).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> There was then on deposit the sum of $51,720.45 to the credit of trustees, and of receivers, of certain bankrupt estates. At that time, too, the clerk of the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held $20,000 United States Treasury bonds, delivered to him by the trust company, as security for the repayment of the deposits. He sold the bonds for $18,-892.48 and distributed the proceeds pro rata to the es<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>tates, leaving to their credit on the books of the trust company $32,827.97. Two dividends, one of 10% and one of 15% were declared in 1932. In his account the Secretary of Banking allowed dividends only on the amount of the deposits remaining unpaid after crediting them with the proceeds realized by the sale of the collateral, that is, he allowed dividends on $32,827.97, as the balance due, instead of on $51,720.45, the original debt. The common pleas dismissed the exceptions,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the Superior Court affirmed and an appeal to this court was allowed.</p>

The rule for which appellants contend is known as the Equity or Chancery Rule; that for which the appellee contends, the Bankruptcy Rule.

The Bankruptcy Rule subsequently found enactment in state insolvency legislation providing for distribution of insolvent estates. Under this rule, the sum realized on the collateral, or its value if unconverted, is treated as payment on account; the balance due is the provable claim.

Super. 437" data-case-ids="625338" data-case-paths="/pa-super/65/0437-01">65 Pa. Superior Ct. 437</a> (1917), involving a claim for interest presented in the orphans’ court by a secured creditor against the estate of an insolvent decedent. No question was made as to which of these rules was applicable. The court applied the Equity Rule, but, we think, erroneously; we now disapprove that decision as contrary to the policy of the law declared in the Act of 1901, supra. In <em>Fulton’s Est., </em>Head, J., at page 441, said: “The estate of the decedent was insolvent. His death, under such circumstances, practically effected an assignment of all of his property to his creditors and thereafter it belonged to them in proportion to the amount of the debt due to each.” In support of their contention, the learned counsel for appellants in the present case quote from the opinion of Head, J., (page 442) as follows: “The fact that he [the creditor] thus had recourse to two funds in no way impaired his right to proceed against either or both so long as he did not claim or secure more than was justly due.” If this statement be unobjectionable in the case of a solvent debtor, it is not accurate in its implications when applied to an insolvent’s estate. The creditor can of course still go against his collateral, but the finding of insolvency has produced a change in the status of the claims upon, and the custody of, the insolvent’s assets; and the duty of the court to decree equality of distribution to those entitled by the application of equitable principles has also intervened. Though the creditor retains the right to deal with the collateral, the necessity for equality of distribution enables the court to put him on terms in asserting his right to recourse to the general assets; in effect, the distributing court says to him, “You do not have two independent sources of payment; <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>you have, in the collateral, an asset of the insolvent with which your contract enables you to deal, but it will be inequitable to' permit you to claim on the fund (the remaining assets of the insolvent) available for distribution among creditors pro rata, unless you do equity by surrendering to that fund (or by accounting for its value) the insolvent’s property held as collateral; you cannot enforce or retain the collateral and also prove for the whole claim as an unsecured creditor; you may prove only for the balance due for that is all you could have done if insolvency had not intervened.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b313-3" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[175,1064,1151,1074]]]'>While the Insolvency Act of 1901 dealt with assignments for the benefit of creditors, the legislature, in substituting the Bankruptcy Rule for the Equity Rule theretofore applied, made a radical change in the policy of the law. The court may declare the scope of the change affected by the statute. “For although courts sometimes have been slow to extend the effect of statutes modifying the common law beyond the direct operation of the words, it is obvious that a statute may indicate a change in the policy of the law, although it expresses that change only in the specific cases most likely to occur to the mind”: <em>Gooch v.

We think, therefore, that desirable uniformity of administration will be attained by applying the Bankruptcy Rule in all cases of the distribution of the assets of insolvents whether living or dead, individual or corporate, and that as this court, since the Act of 1901, is not committed to the application of any other rule, the Bankruptcy Rule should hereafter be considered of general application.</p>

Nat. Bank of Jacksonville, </em><a href="/us/173/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="173 U.S. 131" data-case-ids="8297910" data-case-paths="/us/173/0131-01">supra,</a> at page 148. “Is it not evident that if one creditor is allowed to reap the whole benefit of his security, and at the same time take from the general assets a dividend, on his whole claim, as if he had no security, he thereby obtains an advantage over the other general creditors, and that he gets more than his ratable share of the general assets ? Let me illustrate the unavoidable consequence of the doctrine now recognized [by the majority opinion applying the Equity Eule]. A loans a national bank $5,000, and takes as the evidence of such loan a note of the bank for the sum named, without security. The lender is thus a general or unsecured creditor for the sum of $5,000. B loans to the same bank $5,000, without security. He is applied to for a further loan, and agrees to loan another $5,000 on receiving collateral worth $5,000, and requires that a new note be executed for the amount of both loans, which recites that it is secured by the collateral in question. While theoretically, therefore, B is a secured creditor for $10,000, he practically has no security for $5,000 thereof. Insolvency supervenes. The general assets received by the comptroller equal only fifty per cent of the claims. Now, under the rule which the court establishes, A on his unsecured claim of $5,000 collects a dividend of but $2,500, thereby losing $2,500; B, on the other hand, who proves $10,000, taking no account whatever of his collateral, realizes by way of dividends $5,000, and by collections on collaterals a similar amount, with the result that though as to $5,000 he was, in effect, an unsecured creditor, he loses nothing. B is thus in precisely as good a situation as though he had originally demanded <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>and received from the borrowing bank collateral securities equal in value to the full amount loaned. It is thus apparent that the application of the rule would operate to enable B — who, I repeat, virtually held no collateral security for $5,000 of the sums loaned— to he paid his entire debt, though the assets of the insolvent estate of the borrower paid but fifty cents on the dollar, while another creditor holding an unsecured claim for $5,000 fails to realize thereon more than $2,500.”</p>
