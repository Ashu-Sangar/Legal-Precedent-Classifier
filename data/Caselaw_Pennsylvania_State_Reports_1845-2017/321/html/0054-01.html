Section 13 of the Act of 1836 (17 PS, section 281) vests the court of common pleas with chancery powers in such cases “as the said courts have heretofore possessed such jurisdiction and powers, under . . . the laws of this commonwealth.” (See also article V, section 20, of the Constitution.) Furthermore, section 13 of the Act of 1836 (17 PS, section 282) confers equitable jurisdiction on the Philadelphia common pleas “so far as relates to,” inter alia, “The prevention or restraint of the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals.” The plaintiffs are engaged in performing, in the “interests of the community,” fiduciary duties resulting from the acceptance by the city of fiduciary obligations imposed by the wills or deeds creating the trusts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> They possess both an individual and a common official interest in the preservation of the trust property.

Fox, </em>supra, the right of the plaintiffs to these documents was determined. In performing their duties, they are not to be molested by unauthorized persons. They are not required to test the alleged right of such person by forcibly resisting his unlawful efforts to seize the books and records of their administration, or, for defiance of the committee’s subpoenas, by subsequently justifying their resistance in proceedings for contempt or in habeas corpus (cf. <em>Ex Parte Caldwell, </em><a href="/w-va/61/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="61 W.
