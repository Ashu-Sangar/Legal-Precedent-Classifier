At the time the attachment was issued, on April 18, 1935, the real debt was reduced to the sum of $36,500, upon which interest had been paid to March 31,1935.</p>

The dates and amounts of these policies were respectively, November 22, 1922, for $15,000; March 11, 1923, for $10,000, and June 15, 1926, for $10,000. They were substantially alike in form, and each contained a provision that “the insured, or in case the insured shall not have done so, the beneficiary after the insured’s death, may, by written notice to the Company” make the proceeds of the insurance under the policies payable under one of five optional methods of settlement. One of these, designated option No. 3 in each <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>policy, provided for a life income settlement with, annual payments “in equal installments for 20 years and for as many years thereafter as the beneficiary shall survive.” The amount of each payment was set forth in tables contained in the policies. All three policies provided that the benefits or installments under the options should not be transferable nor subject to commutation or encumbrance during the lifetime of the payee.</p>

On January 8, 1935, the defendant beneficiary made due proof of his death, following which, on January 16, 1935, the insurance company delivered to her in settlement of the amounts due under the policies, three of its checks, totaling $30,272.13, and payable to her order. On February 1, 1935, the defendant returned to the company the checks, unused and unendorsed, accompanied by a written request that the latter issue to her in settlement of $30,000 of the insurance money, annuity certificates, referred to above as the third optional method of settlement contained in the policies. The insurance company accepted this instruction and cancelled the three checks by stamping them “Cancelled and Credited, February 7, 1935.” At the same time it transferred $30,000 of the proceeds of the policies to its fund known as the “Consideration for Annuities Supplementary Account,” remitting to defendant a check representing the balance of the proceeds of the three policies. It then issued to defendant as of January 8, 1935, the date upon which proof of loss had been received, two continuous installment annuity certificates, providing for monthly payments of $101.73 and $36.25, respectively. There were two annuity certificates issued, because of a variance between the rates of income payments fixed in the tables contained in the original insurance policies. Each certificate provided that should the death of the beneficiary, Nettie Rothman, occur before the expiration of the twenty years, the remainder of the twenty years’ <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>payments with interest compounded at a designated rate, would he payable to her children and their survivors.</p>
    <p id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[165,461,1150,585]]]'>The annuity certificates set forth upon their face that they were issued in exchange for the original insurance policies which had become claims by the death of the insured.

    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[165,1057,1150,692]]]'>The material question in the case is whether the proceeds of the insurance policies converted, as stated, into annuity payments, are exempt from attachment execution or other adverse process, in accordance with the terms of the annuity certificates. Such is the principal allegation of the petition to quash the writ. The answers of plaintiff aver, in substance, that the transaction was a purchase of an annuity by the defendant with her own funds; that the defendant obtained the annuity certificates with intent to transfer her assets in fraud of her creditors at a time when she was insolvent; that such funds are not exempt, but are in the possession of the garnishee, subject to the attachment.</p>

The Act of 1923, amended the earlier Act of May 17, 1919, P. L. 208, in one respect only, viz., by extending its provisions to policies issued by foreign as well as domestic insurance companies.</p>
    <p id="b210-4" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[281,671,1149,1015]]]'>It is asserted that the Act of 1923 defines the expression found in the annuity certificates reading “to the extent permitted by law.” This act permits insurance companies to retain the proceeds of any annuity or life insurance policy for the benefit of a person under spendthrift trust provisions, where terms to such effect are contained in such annunity, policy of life insurance, or written agreement supplemental thereto. The proceeds of the three insurance policies in the instant case have been retained by the insurance company, excepting the relatively small amount in excess of $30,000. The fact that the garnishee here issued checks to the defendant for the proceeds of the policies is immaterial, for the reason that the checks were returned to the company for cancellation, unendorsed and unused, within a short time after their issuance. The beneficiary was entitled to have a period of grace after the insured’s death within which to elect which one, if any, of the optional methods of settlement she desired to accept.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[281,1698,1147,420]],["BL_211.1",211,[174,341,1153,2052]],["BL_212.1",212,[272,347,1144,151]]]'>Was there a substantial compliance made with the conditions of the Act of 1923? In our view the annuity certificates are agreements supplemental to the original policies of life insurance within the meaning of this act. It is argued that a supplementary agreement is limited to one made by the parties who made the original contract of insurance, that is, insurer and insured; therefore, that the provision means that only the insured has <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>the right to create a spendthrift trust by supplementary agreement, if he failed to do so in the first instance, when the policy was issued to him. We do not so construe the act; we think it should be given a liberal and less technical construction in cases such as the present one. As showing the connection between the insurance policies and the annuity certificates, it should be noted that the defendant, Nettie Rothman, who is entitled to receive the income under the annuity certificates, is the identical person designated as beneficiary by the insured in his original contracts of insurance. The certificates on their face state that the policies of insurance (referring to them specifically by numbers) have become claims by the death of the insured, and have been surrendered to the company in exchange for the annuities. The amount of the monthly income payments guaranteed by the certificates is definitely fixed in the tables set forth at length in the original insurance policies. In other words, when the insured took out his policies, the contracts of insurance then issued to him fixed the amount which his beneficiary would receive after his death, if she selected the optional method of settlement calling for income payments. While it is undoubtedly true that defendant might have used the checks in payment to her of the policies in a lump sum, the fact remains that she elected instead to exercise the option which the original policies gave to her as beneficiary to make the supplemental agreement for the annuities. Clearly, the parties considered the annuity arrangement as supplemental to the policies, and the fund from which the monthly income installments are paid is shown by its name to be devoted to annuities supplementary to policies of insurance. While it may be that defendant, in declining payment in full of the policies, wished to place the proceeds beyond her creditors’ reach, she did so in the exercise of an optional right given to her by the policies themselves, and granted to her by statute. For these reasons it seems to us the contention of plaintiff that the annuities <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>were separate and independent contracts which the defendant purchased with her own funds, is not sustained by the record.</p>
    <p id="b212-4" data-blocks='[["BL_212.5",212,[270,511,1148,636]]]'>That the insured did not direct in writing that the benefits under the policies be not “subject to encumbrance during the lifetime of the payee” does not deprive the beneficiary of the exemption. One of the policies reads: “The insured may direct in writing that the benefits under the above options shall not be transferable nor subject to commutation or encumbrance during the lifetime of the payee,” while the two remaining policies provide: “If the insured shall so direct in writing, the installments payable under this option shall not be transferable nor subject to commutation nor encumbrance during the lifetime of the beneficiary.”</p>
    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[266,1160,1151,852]]]'>This language in the policies respecting such action by the insured is directory merely, not mandatory, as its language clearly indicates. It gives to the insured the right to exempt such funds from transfer, commutation or encumbrance, but it does not prohibit the beneficiary from doing the same thing. Nowhere in the Act of 1923 is there language which limits such direction to the insured, and it is fair to assume that the beneficiary has the same power of direction. However that may be, we are convinced that the exemption claimed by the garnishee and defendant herein is amply covered by the words “no payment of interest or principal hereunder shall be subject to any debts, contracts or engagements, nor to any judicial process to levy upon or attach the same for payment thereof,” appealing both in the annuity certificates, and in the Act of 1923, itself.</p>

Where the legislation provides for the protection of the widow and kindred of an insured, the law will be liberally construed so that the provision <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>made for the dependents may not be stricken down by the omission of some such really immaterial formality. . . .

Upon the death of the insured, this court held that the wife was entitled to the proceeds of the policy not only because there was fraud in procuring the assignment, but by reason of the operation of the act. We said: “the very object and purpose of the act was, to enable insolvent persons to make provision in this way for their families or dependent relatives, which should be good and effective as against, and free and clear of, all claims of creditors.”</p>

St. John, Trustee, </em><a href="/us/296/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="296 U.S. 489" data-case-ids="5727859" data-case-paths="/us/296/0489-01">296 U. S. 489</a>. There, an insurance exemption statute of the State of Tennessee was construed by the court, and while life insurance was “exempt from all claims of the creditors,” monthly disability benefits were held to be for the benefit of insured himself, and not for his wife, children or dependents; therefore, disability benefits were not exempt. See also opinion of Clark, District Judge, <em>In re Pinals, </em>38 Fed. (2d), 117 (1930), at page 122, wherein he refers to eases in seventeen states where similar exemption statutes are in force.</p>
