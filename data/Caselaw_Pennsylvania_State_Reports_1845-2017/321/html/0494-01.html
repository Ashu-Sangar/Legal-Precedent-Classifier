    <p id="b523-9" data-blocks='[["BL_523.11",523,[165,1003,1152,693]]]'>The judgment cannot be sustained. The plaintiff, a guest in an automobile, was injured when the car crashed through a defective railing on Heth’s Eun Bridge, a part of a city street in Pittsburgh carrying a public highway over a deep gully. It became necessary for the driver of the car to avoid colliding with another car that suddenly stalled in front of it on the bridge; she attempted to avoid it by passing around it, but, by some mishap, crossed the center line of the bridge and “the left half of the road, mounted a five inch curbstone on the bridge” and proceeded “across a ‘fourteen foot’ sidewalk and hit the railing of the bridge . . . crashed through the railing and fell into the gully below.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

The learned trial judge asked the jury to answer special interrogatories; one was as follows: “The first question you have to determine is whether or not that accident was such accident as should have been reasonably anticipated by the City of Pittsburgh in the construction and maintenance <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>of that guard rail at that particular place.” The jury was instructed that if the interrogatory was answered “No,” further deliberation was unnecessary, and a verdict for defendant was required. The jury answered “No” and accordingly found for defendant.</p>

On this record the issue for the jury was Avhether the city had performed that duty and, if not, whether its failure was a substantial factor in producing the plaintiff’s injury. The negative answer to the single question answered, without more, was not decisive. Compare <em>Panek v. Scranton Ry. Co., </em><a href="/pa/258/0589-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="258 Pa. 589" data-case-ids="1035033" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0589-01">258 Pa. 589</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20A.%20274" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="102 A. 274">102 A. 274</a>. “If the actor’s conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another, the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred does not prevent him from being liable”: <em>Restatement, Torts, </em>section 435.
