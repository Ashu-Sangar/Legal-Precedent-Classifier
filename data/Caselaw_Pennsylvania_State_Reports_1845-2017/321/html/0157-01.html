This suit is to recover that sum. The wrong was accomplished, plaintiff avers, by means of a common management in charge of International Railway Company and Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. In holding that no cause of action was pleaded, the learned court below said: “The difficulty with Plaintiff’s case is that Defendant does not have in its hands money belonging to Plaintiff, but money which belongs either to Defendant or to International Railway Company.

The inquiry is, Has the defendant, in the circumstances stated, received money or prop: erty which he is not entitled to keep and which in equity and good conscience should be paid to plaintiff in accordance with principles of natural justice? If he has, the plaintiff may recover. Section 10 (1), <em>Restatement of the Law of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment, </em>Tentative Draft No. l/states the rule as follows: “If a person, intending thereby to pay a debt, has paid money to another in the mistaken belief that such other is the creditor, the person who in fact was the creditor is entitled to obtain the money from the payee, unless the payee is a bona fide purchaser [or] unless the payor reclaims.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Certainly if a third party, receiving payment by mistake, must account to the creditor, a party should not escape who, by fraud, procured payment of money, due another, to be made to himself. The principle has been applied in this Commonwealth for a long time. In <em>Durdon, Exr., v. Gaskill, </em><a href="/yeates/2/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Yeates 268" data-case-ids="812652" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0268-01">2 Yeates 268</a>, 272, (1798) recovery was allowed in indebitatus assumpsit. The court said: The action “was brought against her as a devisee, who received moneys in trust for Springet Penn, to which she had no just claim.” In <em>M’Coy v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%20221" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Rawle 221">2 Rawle 221</a>, 222, (1828) an administrator had collected rents of property “leased by the intestate in his lifetime; and the qtiestion is, whether the administrator be a trustee for the creditor or heirs.

While the verdict for the defendant was set aside for error in the exclusion of evidence, this court said: “The <em>gravamen </em>of the plaintiff’s suit is a fraud of the defendant, for which, under the circumstances of this case, the action for money had and received is the appropriate remedy.” In <em>Longenecker v. Zeigler, </em><a href="/watts/1/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Watts 252" data-case-ids="1838093" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0252-01">1 Watts 252</a>, (1832) the suit was to the use of Bossier, a judgment creditor, for a .sum alleged to have been an overpayment to another judgment creditor in distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale. The question was whether the action was properly brought in the name of the legal plaintiff. In holding that it was not properly brought the court said: “It might also, perhaps, have been safely brought in the name of Bossier, the creditor ultimately entitled; for,, though there is no privity between him and the defendant, the money, when it has been received <em>mala fide, </em>may be pursued specifically on the owner’s right of property. Here there would seem to be enough in the case to authorize a jury to find that the money was received <em>mala fide; </em>or perhaps, a legal presumption to that effect would necessarily arise from the facts.” In <em>Owens v. Goldie, </em><a href="/pa/213/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="213 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="943350" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0579-01">213 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20A.%201117" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="62 A. 1117">62 A. 1117</a>, it was held that the plaintiff instead of proceeding in equity to recover his share of the consideration of personal property sold, which share the purchaser had not paid to the nominal vendor on notice of plaintiff’s claim, should have proceeded in assumpsit for money had and received. In <em>Gaffney’s Est., </em><a href="/pa/146/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="146 Pa. 49" data-case-ids="827887" data-case-paths="/pa/146/0049-01">146 Pa. 49</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20A.%20163" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="23 A. 163">23 A. 163</a>, the principle was applied in allowing recovery of a claim presented in the orphans’ court.

Lestapies claimed the right to recover his proportionate share of the sum received (pursuant to the French treaty) by Laussat’s assignee. It was held in an opinion by Gibson, C.
