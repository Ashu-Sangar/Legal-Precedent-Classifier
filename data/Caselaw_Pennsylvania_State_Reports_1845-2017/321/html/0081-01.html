That letter stated that there was a firm and widespread belief that criminal gangs and racketeers regularly employed members of the bar; that they obtained professional advice and guidance from these attorneys in their systematic lawbreaking; and that the actual defendants, gangsters’ agents, are represented by counsel whom they have never seen or heard of until the attorneys appear beside them at the bar of the criminal court, and that the fees of these attorneys are paid by the heads of the organizations.</p>
    <p id="b121-7" data-blocks='[["BL_121.10",121,[187,1384,1153,845]]]'>The letter asked for the appointment of a committee to conduct an investigation for the purpose of ascertaining the nature, terms and conditions of the employment of lawyers who practice largely in the criminal courts or who might have improper and unprofessional relations with organized crime. The Board of Governors, with the concurrence of the Chairman and the Chancellor, appointed a committee of five to conduct the investigation, and, on petition, this committee was authorized by the Court of Common Pleas to issue subpoenas and administer oaths as provided by the Act of June 12, 1931, P. L. 543. In the order approving the request for such powers the court specifically stated that the appointment was approved “for the purpose of investigating charges against the professional conduct of the members of the bar of the said court.”</p>

The scope of the inquiry embraced the calling of 425 witnesses and taking of approximately 4,000 pages of testimony. In the course of the investigation of the numbers racket it became aware of a number of other irregular practices involving chiefly the defense of drunken drivers of motor cars. It is to be noted with some regret that the officers of the law offered but little cooperation, and the work pursued by the committee was accordingly rendered more difficult. The committee found from the testimony before it that certain attorneys were guilty of improper conduct in connection with the numbers racket, the drunken drivers racket and with another individual case. They set forth their conclusions in the form of a report which also contained a summary of the evidence. The report was made to the court, and thereupon it issued a rule against the various appellants noted in the above numbers and terms, to show cause why they should not be disciplined for professional misconduct. The action of the court in issuing the citation was based on the report of the committee, the summary of the testimony and the recommendations involved in the report. No petition, complaint or affidavit was filed against any of the parties against whom the rule issued.</p>

They filed an answer and requested leave to examine the notes of the testimony taken before the committee.

In The Canons of Ethics of the American Bar Association the following question was asked: “Is it professionally proper for an attorney to employ a ‘runner’ who, under the guise of a ‘Bail Procurer,’ persuades those accused of crime to employ the attorney to represent them?” It was answered as follows: “It is disreputable ... to employ agents or runners . . . or to pay or reward, directly or indirectly, those who bring or influence the bringing of cases to an office, or to remunerate policemen, court or prison officials, physicians, hospital attaches or others who may succeed, under the guise of giving disinterested friendly advice, in influencing the criminal, the sick and the injured, the ignorant or others to seek professional services. A duty to the public and to the profession devolves upon every member of the Bar, having knowledge of such practices upon the part of any practitioner, immediately to inform thereof to the end that the offender be disbarred. Canon 28.” The employment of runners is most unethical and highly improper, and should not be tolerated by any court to whose attention the facts are shown, nor by any <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>association of lawyers wbo adopt and abide by tbe canons of professional etbics.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b125-5" data-blocks='[["BL_125.5",125,[145,893,1156,1456]]]'>An attorney who agrees in advance to defend persons if and when arrested for criminal offenses whose future commission is a planned certainty, or from whose conduct such an agreement may be inferred, forfeits all right to practice law. Such conduct not only obstructs justice but prevents the due administration of law. An attorney is under no obligation to aid his client in crime. His duty is to prevent its perpetration, if possible. An attorney may defend persons accused of participating in the numbers racket as writers, pick-up men or bankers, and their clients need not be limited. It is not the number of persons defended that counts, but it is the regularity, character and purpose of employment. When the purpose is to guide and aid a combination of persons engaged in crime, an attorney becomes part of the criminal system. Where a large number of cases of the same kind of crime are regularly defended by the same lawyer, where the defendants do not know and never have seen the lawyer prior to the moment of representation, and where the attorney’s fees are paid by men known to be the leaders of a criminal system, a court may not only infer knowledge on his part of the criminal combination but, from the frequency of his performance and knowledge, conclude that he becomes an actual participant therein. While ostensibly defending the writers, pickup men and the like, the real employment is from the heads of the criminal organizations.</p>

    <p id="b126-4" data-blocks='[["BL_126.5",126,[282,459,1150,1713]]]'>If the profession is to be kept to the standard which it claims as part of its heritage, then punishment must be visited on those whose professional conduct transgresses these standards. If attorneys are permitted to accept regular employment from criminal leaders to defend members of the criminal band there will be an end to law and order. Obstructing or preventing the administration of law has been held sufficient to merit disbarment in many cases of conduct less reproachable than here: 2 <em>R. C. L. </em>1091. If the practice of the law is to degenerate into a scramble through its commercialization by attempts to secure business through runners, bail procurers and the like, then it is useless to set up or claim any ethical standards as guides for the incoming attorneys. They seek to practice in a profession that has been known for generations to set up for its government and control the highest ethical standards. These standards are not to be corrupted. It is the element of commercialism run riot with consequent lack of fidelity to court and client that strikes at the dignity of the courts, the practice of the law and the judicial system as a whole. It has a tendency to wrest that system from its high position as a part of and as a potent influence in government and to destroy the courts as the last line of defense in the preservation of a free people as a nation. If this practice is to be continued, the legal profession forfeits its lofty position in the community and fast loses the respect of the humblest citizen. The public, keenly alive to professional conduct, will cease to be influenced by such a body and will in time erect some other system or body in which the public will have confidence.</p>

The committee was given wide powers. They assembled their facts from the evidence and submitted a report; it was on that report that the court acted in issuing its citation as noted.

It would indeed be sad if courts could not inaugurate their own system of investigation into the unlawful practices of members of the bar. But our courts are not so helpless. The law is otherwise. In supervising the activities of the court and its members, courts have an inherent power to investigate unprofessional conduct with or without complaint. When the matter is the investigation of a vicious practice grown to a system, a system which is itself criminal or grossly unprofessional and unlawful in its purposes, and which can only be broken up by an impartial investigation into its activities to find out what members of the bar were associated or connected with such system of organized crime, it is not necessary that specific charges be leveled at some one individual; the court may take cognizance of the condition and, of its own motion, call for explanations from those of its members involved therein. The court was clearly right in appointing this committee to furnish it with the necessary information. When it received information leading to a case or cases for discipline it was well within its authority in issuing citations to the offending members. Thereafter, as to them, the procedings were and are de novo. The burden rested on the committee or those in charge to prove their case by evidence which left clear the conclusion of unprofessional conduct prejudicial to the practice of law and subversive of their oath of office.</p>

W. 919</a>, the court likewise condemned the practice of securing legal business by the use of paid solicitors. In so doing the court stated, “There is a wide difference between the unprofessional and undignified practice of personal solicitation of business and the indefensible and vicious one of employing agents and runners to go about soliciting business and stirring up strife and litigation for a stipulated consideration or a contingent fee. Such agents and runners as these are not restrained in their activities by any professional or ethical sense of propriety. Their only object is to secure clients for their employers, and they use in their efforts such arts and schemes as will get results, without giving any thought or attention to the disturbing and objectionable nature of the business in which they are engaged. The friends, acquaintances, and associates of an attorney have, of course, the unquestioned right to sound his praises and divert to him such clients as they persuade, in a legitimate way, to engage his services. But there is a manifest difference between securing business through the influence and efforts of friends, acquaintances and associates, and securing it through the methods employed by the strictly commercial enterprise of paid agents. . . . "When men accept employment to render such services as these men are expected to render, and their pay depends on the volume of business they can get for their employer, everybody knows that many of them will use any means to obtain the business without any regard to the method that may be used to secure it.” See also: <em>Re Shay, </em><a href="/ny/196/0530-02" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="196 N.Y. 530" data-case-ids="4462057,4462601" data-case-paths="/ny/196/0530-02,/ny/196/0530-01">196 N.
