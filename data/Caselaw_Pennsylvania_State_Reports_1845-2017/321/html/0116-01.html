On its face the conveyance was absolute. The land has not been sold. On July 23,1927, Rotherham died, testate, devising his entire estate in equal shares to his sister and brothers without, however, specifically referring to the land conveyed to McCorkle. Plaintiffs claim the land under that will. Appellant answered in defense that Rotherham had orally instructed him, if the property was not sold until after Rotherham’s death, to distribute the proceeds among certain named beneficiaries (all relatives), one of whom was the appellant-defendant, and that he held title accordingly and was ready and willing to perform his undertaking.</p>
