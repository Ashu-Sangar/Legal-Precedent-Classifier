Warren Bowman, on and prior to December, 1930, trading as By-Gum Company, was engaged in the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. The insoluble chewing gum base, or principal ingredient used in manufacturing his product, he purchased from one of the defendants, Sweets Laboratories, Incorporated, hereafter called Sweet. On December 3, 1930, a somewhat informal agreement in writing was signed by the plaintiff, and by Franklin V. Canning, acting on behalf of Sweet, the effect of which was that for $15,000, paid by Sweet, it became the owner of a half interest in the business theretofore conducted by Bowman, with the understanding that the enterprise should be incorporated, each interest to receive one-half the capital stock; it was also agreed that the new company would execute obligations and deliver them to Sweet for money then owed for material purchased by Bowman. They agreed <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>that each interest should have equal representation on the board of directors. Instead of incorporating immediately, the business appears to have been conducted informally until May, 1932, when the contemplated corporation was formed and the business transferred. The name of the corporation is Gum, Incorporated, hereafter called Gum. It took over the business May 15, 1932, with a capital contribution by plaintiff of $2,826.52 and by Sweet of $15,000. At that time the corporation assumed the indebtedness of By-G'um to Sweet in a sum in excess of $70,000, incurred, as Mr. Bowman testified, for “money advanced by Sweet for the use of the business.” The plaintiff was made president of the company and he and his wife were elected directors. At the same time, on behalf of Sweet, Messrs. Barker and Ryan were elected directors. For each year from 1932 to the time the bill was filed, the business increased and became very profitable. By the consent of both interests in January, 1935, the number of directors was increased to six.</p>

The bill also avers and the answer admits that, as of December 31, 1935, the assets of Gum “(after full allowance for depreciation, obsolescense, bad debts and losses) was the sum of $261,-293.68 as against total liabilities of $100,290.34” and that, of the liabilities, $86,059 was due to Sweet. It also appears that $56,000 of that indebtedness is represented by a demand note for part of the account assumed by Gum at the time of the organization in 1932. Defendant, Sweet, from time to time demanded payment of Gum’s debt, but the plaintiff, Bowman, as president and <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>in charge of the operations of Gum, was of opinion that the corporation was unable to pay. By the end of 1935 Mr. Bowman thought “a better chewing gum base was available from another manufacturer at a cost of 20% cents per pound” instead of 34 cents then being paid to Sweet; the price was reduced to 34 cents from 36 cents in November, 1935, as we understand the record. Bowman began experimenting with other bases; Sweet objected to the experiments. The ground of objection was the threat to Sweet’s outlet for the sale of base manufactured by it. These differences between the two interests — the nonpayment of Gum’s debt and the threat to Sweet’s market — seem to be the ostensible causes of this litigation.</p>

Half the shares are held by the plaintiff and half by Sweet. If each half-interest continues to oppose the other, the business will of course stop. It has been said that such corporations may be regarded as having provided their own legislatures,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and to these the parties <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>now resorted. The plaintiff began by giving notice for a special meeting of the stockholders to be held February 11, 1936, at 3 o’clock. His intention (as subsequently carried out) was to remove the then existing board of directors and to elect a new board by the vote of his half-interest in accord with a section of the by-laws so permitting. His move was countered by the Sweet interest by the written request of three directors desiring Bowman, as president, to call a special meeting of the board to be held on February 10, 1936; when they concluded that he would not comply with their request, they themselves, under a provision of the by-laws, called a special meeting of the board to be held on that date. This meeting was held at the time and place designated in defendant’s manufacturing plant and was attended by five of the six directors, the only absentee being the plaintiff. Instead of attending, he set up a dictograph in the meeting room with an arrangement by which he, in another room in the same building, hoped to hear the discussion.® At that meeting the plaintiff was removed from the presidency by the unanimous vote of the other five directors who then elected Hamilton to that office.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The bill makes no pretense of stating a case within the Business Corporation Law of 1933, P. L. 364, sections 1101 et seq. After this appeal was taken, the plaintiff filed a petition in this court for leave to amend the bill by adding a number of averments, some of them specifically designed to bring the case within provisions of the Business Corporation Law; as the proposed amendment would have resulted in such radical departure from what the defendants had been asked to meet and, in fact, had met in the first instance, we could not allow the amendment.</p>

Sections 1107 and following sections of the statute deal with involuntary proceedings for winding up and dissolution. No prior statute specifically provided for the involuntary winding up of a solvent business corporation. Without attempting, by what is now said, to limit the action of the parties, or of the learned court below, on the return of the record, if leave to make appropriate amendments to the pleadings is asked by either party, it is to be noted that section 1107 vests the common pleas with power, on the petition of the shareholder, inter alia, to “entertain proceedings for the involuntary winding up and dissolution of the corporation, when it is made to appear. . . . That the directors are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs and the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock, and that irreparable injury to the corporation is being suffered or is threatened by reason thereof.” Section 1108 provides that in the course of such a proceeding the court may appoint a receiver pendente lite, and, after hearing, may appoint a liquidating receiver. Under section 1109, when it appears “that the deadlock in the corporate affairs has been broken or the management or control of the corporation has been changed, the court, in its discretion, may dismiss the proceeding and direct the receiver to redeliver to the corporation all its remaining property and assets.”</p>

It does appear that plaintiff, who, as president of Gum, was in executive charge of its business, became dissatisfied with the base supplied by Sweet under the contract referred to and that Sweet gave inadequate consideration to plaintiff’s complaint at the end of 1935, save as the price was reduced, if we correctly understand the evidence, to 34 cents a pound. On the other hand, Sweet was within its rights in continuing to call for payment of Gum’s demand note and other accounts due it. There is no evidence of agreement that the debt should not be paid as specified in the note. But (apart now from the Business Corporation Law) in the absence of fraud, mismanagement of the corporate property, or like wrongful conduct, equity will not, at the instance of a stockholder appoint a temporary receiver <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>for a solvent corporation: <em>Hlawati v.

Here there is no evidence of fraud, mismanagement or wrongful conduct. There is no evidence that, as now managed, the corporation may not do as well as it did under Mr. Bowman’s presidency. A temporary receiver may not he appointed for a solvent corporation on the mere conjecture of a stockholding interest (even if it represents one-half the shares) that the other half may not succeed. Save as authorized by the Business Corporation Law, equity has no power to order the involuntary dissolution of such a corporation. It is, of course, a laudable hope, as was said below, that if a temporary receiver is appointed, quarreling interests will compose their differences; they may, or they may not; in this case they did not.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Each interest chose to stand on its legal rights. But that fact, on the averments of the bill and the evidence, did not authorize the court to take the property from the management and control of the owners and turn the management over to a receiver; prima facie, neither party had violated any law when the temporary receiver was appointed. “Receivers are appointed only in aid of some recognized, presently existing legal right, and will not be appointed where receivership is the sole relief asked”: <em>McDougal v.
