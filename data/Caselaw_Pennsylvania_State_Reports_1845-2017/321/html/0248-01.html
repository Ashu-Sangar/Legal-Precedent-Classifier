    <p id="b279-9" data-blocks='[["BL_279.12",279,[171,1223,1155,963]]]'>George W. Pusey was born October 22, 1845, in Pittsburgh, the fifth of six children. His mother was a native of Pittsburgh and his father, while not born in Pittsburgh, early adopted that city as his home. Their principal family residence was at 518 Sherman Avenue. By reason of deaths in the family Pusey became its absolute owner, and continued in its ownership up to the day of his death with the original furnishings, family portraits and contents intact. It was his only Pittsburgh residence for some fifty years prior to his death, and was in a neighborhood once distinguished by solid, well-to-do families who carried on the social and commercial life of the city. Although the neighborhood deteriorated in part, some of these families continued to reside on Sherman Avenue. None of the Pusey children, including George, ever married; he survived them all, and succeeded to all of their property including their interests in 518 Sherman Avenue.</p>

    <p id="b280-5" data-blocks='[["BL_280.5",280,[266,461,1151,736]]]'>Pusey purchased stock shortly after the trust company’s formation and for a few years served as director and for a year as chairman of the board. Although he thereafter ceased to share in its management, he continued as a stockholder and the bank remained his principal depository up to the time of his death, when he owned 112 shares and had approximately $50,000 there on deposit. He kept a safe deposit box in its vaults where his securities were lodged. Mr. Dahlinger of the Allegheny Trust Company had in his possession a cash book showing Pusey’s receipts and expenditures. In Mr. Pusey’s absence the key to this vault was entrusted to Mr. Dahlinger. The bank also handled the collection of his income while he was in Florida.</p>
    <p id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.6",280,[262,1217,1153,913]]]'>Mr. Pusey was a pious man and his social life was centered around the church. In 1893 upon the organization of the Calvary M. E. Church, he became a charter member. He was a trustee, vice-president and chairman of its finance committee up to the very moment of death and its principal financial supporter. He was also concerned with various other Pittsburgh charities, among which were those sponsored by the Pittsburgh Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Young Men’s and Young Women’s Christian Associations of Pittsburgh. Until July of 1933 he was a member of the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, and he exhibited a constant interest in the municipal affairs of the city. Even when it was apparent to him that he would probably never be physically able to return to Pittsburgh, he wrote thanking a friend for having traffic lights installed in the neighborhood of his home.</p>

Pusey, George’s invalid sister, died in 1920, he was left, at seventy-two years, a lonely bachelor, the sole survivor of the direct line of a family early identified .with Pittsburgh activities. Having succeeded to the property of his brothers and sisters, he was inde<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>pendently wealthy; his fortune in 1929 was estimated at more than $2,000,000. Those who lived with him at 518 Sherman Avenue were Katherine Gr. McIntyre, originally a nurse and companion to his sister, afterwards Pusey’s housekeeper, and William Sepp, his handyman and chauffeur. There were also two domestics.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[173,678,1152,480]]]'>In 1921 Pusey went to Florida, and visited Dr. Roland T. White for two months. The latter had lived in Pittsburgh where he had met Pusey and been active in the Calvary Church. Pusey, after his first experience with Florida climate, made regular trips to that state. They commenced in the fall and ended in the spring. At first he stayed at a hotel; then for two years lived in a leased cottage; but when the lease was repudiated in 1925, he purchased a cottage in Orlando for $25,000.</p>
    <p id="b281-6" data-blocks='[["BL_281.6",281,[173,1170,1153,693]]]'>The sojourns to Florida over winter and return to Pittsburgh in summer were made regularly up to and including the summer of 1931. On June 12,1929, Pusey made a will describing himself as domiciled in Pittsburgh. Mr. Dahlinger, who had drawn the wills of most of Pusey’s brothers and sisters, also drew up this will and he and the Allegheny Trust Company were appointed executors and trustees therein. In the fall of 1931 Pusey again made his trip to Florida, but never returned to Pittsburgh alive. He died in Florida on August 31, 1933. In accordance with his testamentary directions his body was taken to Pittsburgh to be buried in the family plot.</p>

In the winter of 1931-1932 he was often confined to bed, and he wrote stating that he felt weak and that he suffered from a severe cold and from pains and stiffness in his back and right leg. He resorted to an osteopath in an effort to find relief, but the pains persisted. There is a notation in his diary on March 20th that he had missed church, and a similar notation on March 27th. On April 10, 1932, he noted in <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>his diary attendance at church for the first time in six weeks. This was evidence of serious indisposition for to George W. Pusey religion, the religious affairs surrounding the church, and the persons associated with the church, constituted an integral, if not the main part of life. In June of 1932 he notes that he can only hobble about a bit with a cane and in the same month, in an effort to rid himself of the cause of the pain which so seriously circumscribed his activities, he had six of his teeth removed. He was confined to bed for a long interval thereafter suffering from the reaction. On August 12, 1932, he wrote that he was again in bed suffering from pains, which prevented him from moving or turning over and that the writing of a one-page letter was tiring to him. During all this time Pusey was under the care of Dr. White. In July of 1932 he wrote to Mr. Dahlinger asking that his 1929 will be sent to him, setting forth that he believed his will was too extravagant; his annual income which had previously ranged from $130,000 to $200,000 having fallen to $64,000. However, after he received the will from Mr. Dahlinger, he sent it back stating that he desired to make no change. His health continued to fail and in his letters he stated to various parties his physical inability to return to his home in Pittsburgh during that summer. At the same time, in a letter to his real estate agent in Pittsburgh, he requested that his home at 518 Sherman Avenue be cared for, that the pavements be kept clean and free from chalk marks. To the new preacher of the Calvary M. E. Church he expressed the hope that he would again be able to make a trip to Pittsburgh in the summer of 1933. During the fall of 1932 and the winter of 1933 there was no improvement in Pusey’s health. He was confined to his bed almost all of the time except for intervals when he would hobble about the house, or sit up for a few hours or, perhaps, attempt a walk in front of the house or around the block.</p>

      <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>In February of 1933 a change of doctors seemed necessary for Mr. Pusey and Dr. Spenser A. Folsom was selected to replace Dr. White. A trained nurse also was engaged and, from that time until his death, he was continuously attended. We infer from the evidence that Dr. White had been treating Pusey for a kidney condition, dropsy, and an enlarged prostate gland, but we may be in error as to the correct nature of the ailments treated by him. Dr. Folsom diagnosed the principal ailment as pernicious anemia and commenced treating him for that disease with liver in various forms. He also prescribed for the kidneys and applied antiseptics for the urinary tract condition. Under his care Mr. Pusey was much improved. In March of 1933 Miss Eegina Sullivan, who had formerly nursed Pusey’s sister, came to nurse Mr. Pusey at Miss McIntyre’s request, replacing the nurse engaged in February. On May 24, 1933, Dr. Folsom was relieved and Dr. White again assumed charge. Dr. White changed the form of treatment, and in July, Pusey’s physical condition had grown so much worse that he was no longer able to take care of his correspondence. On July 30th, his entire bank account at Orlando, Florida, consisting of some $17,000, was transferred by check to Miss McIntyre, the housekeeper. In August a letter was sent to Dahlinger written by Miss Eegina Sullivan and signed by George W. Pusey requesting that the 1929 will be sent to Pusey. Dahlinger complied with this request and sent the will by registered mail, but feeling, due to Pusey’s weak condition, that this was an unwise move went by airplane to Orlando, Florida. On the seventh day of August, within an hour after the will was delivered to Mr. Pusey’s residence, he arrived at the Pusey home. After consulting with Mr. Pusey, he was directed to take the will back to Pittsburgh. Mr. Dahlinger states he found Pusey in a most serious state. Mr. Pusey had been suffering with an attack of vomiting, inability to retain food and the charts kept by his nurse, Miss Sullivan, show that he was in distressing straits. <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>Dr. White, informed by Miss McIntyre of Mr. Dahlinger’s visit and that he had taken the will, went to see Mr. Dahlinger, stating, as Dahlinger testifies, that he was pressed for money and asking Mr. Dahlinger to arrange for a new will in which he would get $500 a month for life. Dahlinger refused to accede to this request.</p>
    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[280,731,1154,1671]],["BL_285.1",285,[167,334,1152,860]]]'>Pusey continued critically ill, as is evident from the charts prepared by his nurse, by statements of various persons who observed Mr. Pusey and by letters written by Miss Sullivan, the nurse. On the evening of August 19th, Dr. White states he was called on the ’phone by Miss Sullivan and told that Mr. Pusey wanted to see him on business. Dr. White arrived and discussed with Pusey the drawing of a new will, suggesting the employment of Mr. Wells, an attorney who had done work for Dr. White but who had no personal acquaintance with Mr. Pusey. Dr. White telephoned Mr. Wells that same evening and arranged an appointment for the following morning which was Sunday. On Sunday morning Dr. White consulted with Mr. Wells and left with him a black memorandum book of Pusey’s, which contained some notations regarding the contents of the 1929 will. From the information contained in that book and with information imparted to him by Dr. White, Mr. Wells made a rough draft of a will. On Sunday afternoon Wells was taken to Mr. Pusey by Dr. White for the first time. A conference was held and that evening Mr. Wells prepared a final draft of the will, working on it until half past one in the morning. On Monday morning, August 21st, Dr. Folsom again appeared on the scene, having been reengaged by Dr. White on Sunday evening. After an examination Dr. Folsom advised a blood count and intravenous injections of liver extract. That afternoon Wells, accompanied by two employees of his office, visited the Pusey home and the will was executed by Mr. Pusey. Signature on each page and at the end therof was suggested. Although told to sign this will “George <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>W. Pusey” the testator was unable to do so, and in some instances wrote “G. W. Pusey.” In others he put down his full signature, but the writing shows it to be scrawled and rather difficult to understand. The following morning, August 22d, Mr. Wells redrafted the will and brought it in for execution under a form requiring only one signature at the end. When Mr. Wells arrived, he brought with him Mr. Lemire, one of his law partners, for the purpose of witnessing the will. Dr. Christ who, for the first time had ben called upon to attend the testator by Dr. White, although Dr. Folsom had been there the day before, served as the other witness. By this will Dr. White and the Florida National Bank of Jacksonville are appointed executors and trustees, Dr. White and Miss Sullivan, the nurse, receive annuities, and many other changes were made from the 1929 will.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[166,1206,1153,914]]]'>On the same day, the 22d, there was signed by Pusey a power of attorney prepared by Wells empowering the latter to receive and bring back with him to Florida from the bank in Pittsburgh all of Pusey’s securities valued at about $1,000,000. For this purpose Wells and Dr. White immediately left for Pittsburgh by airplane, leaving Mr. Pusey under Dr. Christ’s care. Dahlinger and the bank refused to give them the securities. They returned to Orlando on August 27, 1933, but did not report to Pusey the fact that they had been refused the securities. On the same day Mr. Pusey was removed to a hospital where he died in a few days, on August 31,1933. The court below concluded that his death was the result of pernicious anemia and uremia (a condition secondary to his nephritis, prostatic enlargement, and chronic urinary tract infection) ; the “principal cause” of death being a terminal broncho-pneumonia.</p>

The proceedings in Pittsburgh were heard forthwith. On September 14, 1933, the matter was certified to the orphans’ court, and the 1929 will was offered and proved. Counsel representing the executors under the Florida will then offered to prove the existence of the later will. The caveators were not able to produce in court the Florida will nor any adjudication thereon as the contest in Florida was pending. Their only proof was an exemplified copy of a writing offered for probate together with other parts of the record relating to the offer. The court below excluded this evidence as incompetent; counsel relied on <em>Crawford v. Schooley, </em><a href="/pa/217/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="217 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="953670" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0429-01">217 Pa. 429</a>, but in that case the later will was actually produced, not a mere copy.

    <p id="b286-5" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[264,1154,1153,738]]]'>Dahlinger who filed the caveat in Florida failed to show cause why that writing should not be admitted to probate and therefore the caveat was taken as confessed by him. However, the Women’s Home Mission Society of Pittsburgh Conference, which operated the Deaconness’ Home in Pittsburgh, one of the beneficiaries in the 1929 will, but omitted in the 1933 will, did appear to contest the Florida will, and, on October 27,1933, about a month after the probate of the 1929 will had taken place in Pittsburgh, a decree was entered wherein it was adjudged that George W. Pusey was domiciled in Florida at the time of his death, that he had testamentary capacity at the time of making his 1933 will and that it was not the result of undue influence.</p>

The appellants Avere the Lavely sisters, three collateral relatives of Pusey, who were named in the 1933 Avill for larger amounts than they had been left in the 1929 will. Their petition alleged that at the time of Pusey’s death he Avas domiciled in Florida where he executed a will in 1933, and prayed that the decree admitting the 1929 will be opened and the Florida will be ad<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>mitted to probate and ancillai*y letters issue. An answer was filed by various charities named in the 1929 will in which it was denied that Pusey’s domicile was in Florida and it was averred that his domicile in Pittsburgh had never been changed. It was also alleged that the 1933 will was invalid because Pusey lacked testamentary capacity at the time of its execution, and that it had been procured through the undue influence of persons alleged to be in confidential relation with testator.</p>

The hearing on the petition and answer extended over six weeks. The court below found that “for eighty-seven years, ten months and nine days this old man (George W. Pusey) was domiciled in the City of Pittsburgh and never considered an abandonment of that city as his domicile. His provenance was at Pittsburgh, his friends were here, his property was here. His winter home in Florida was nothing but a substitute for hotels or rented cottages or other places for temporary residences where he and Miss McIntyre sojourned in previous years when they left the city both in winter and summer.” That there was no reliable testimony “to show that Mr. Pusey abandoned his domicile of origin.” That “he was residing in Florida at the time of his death but he had not abandoned his domicile at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.” It was also found that Miss McIntyre, Dr. White and Miss Sullivan stood in a confidential relation to the testator, because of his weakness and helplessness, their intimate and dominant association with him as housekeeper and financial agent, physician, and nurse and secretary, and the making of substantial gifts to them under the Florida writing. That they were all strangers to the testator’s blood and that they failed to produce credible testimony to show <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>that they had overcome the burden arising from the confidential relationship. That “it does not show that no deception was used and that all was fair, open, voluntary, and well understood.” It also found that “it is clear from all the credible testimony that Mr. Pusey was not competent to execute the writing of August 22d [the Florida will],” and lacked testamentary capacity. It accordingly dismissed the petition and from that dismissal this appeal is taken.</p>

The mere fact that a judge in the course of a trial or a hearing or any proceeding in court makes an order of an interlocutory nature or an order upon which further proceedings may be based does not convict him of prejudgment when later findings are made sustaining his original action. There is no merit in the argument that because an order was made the judge would support it on further investigation no matter what future evidence might show.

Tbe ancestral home was never leased or sold, and was admittedly occupied by Pusey until 1931. It never passed out of Pusey’s ownership; it contained a substantial portion of his personal effects, and remained furnished ready for use with the same interior arrangements and with its furnishings intact. There was associated with its existence in this condition the sentiment naturally created by a “home.” His former business associates lived in Pittsburgh, and throughout his entire life it remained the center of all his interests: it was the center of his life’s religious and charitable activities; the overwhelming bulk of his fortune remained there at all times; and his personal and intimate business or financial affairs were always centered there. He never changed the location of his securities, and almost every matter concerning his income, its collection and disbursement, was handled there. All of his securities, including those acquired during his last illness, were, at his direction, registered from the Sherman Avenue address. His federal income tax returns, including his last for the year 1932, all gave that address; they were filed at the collector’s office in Pittsburgh, and the tax shown to be due was paid to the collector there.'- His private automobile was registered with the Bureau of Motor Vehicles in Pennsylvania, and there only, so that at the date of his death his car in Florida bore 1933 Pennsylvania license tags. He paid state and local taxes as a citizen of Pennsylvania, and refused to vote elsewhere, notwithstanding his deep interest in the presidential election in 1932. Even though his illness had progressed very far, he still maintained a marked interest in Pittsburgh municipal affairs and, twenty-four days before his death, he signified his approval of his 1929 will (in which he described himself as a Pittsburgher) by returning it to Pittsburgh for safe keeping. In contrast with this, we have the fact that he purchased in 1926 a cottage in Florida, and that he remained in Florida for 23 months preceding his death.

He had an opportunity to observe Pusey a few days before the Florida will was drafted. He testified that at that time Pusey was emaciated and worn, his arms were thrown over his head, his eyes were closed and his mouth open; he appeared in a condition resembling stupor, although indicating to Norton by a pressure of his hand that he knew he was there. Not on one occasion but on at least three separate times between August 1st and when the will was written this scene took place. Life had ebbed so far with this aged man that he Avas unable to make an audible greeting, much less exhibit an interest in life.
