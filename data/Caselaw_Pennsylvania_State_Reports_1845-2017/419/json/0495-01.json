However, in open court and while represented by counsel, McCode entered a plea of guilty to murder generally.\nWe have examined the instant record and conclude that the entry of the plea of guilty by McCode, when represented by competent counsel who did not question the validity of McCode\u2019s confession, constituted a waiver of any right to later question any possible infirmities in such confession. See: Commonwealth ex rel. Adderley v. Myers, 418 Pa. 366, 211 A. 2d 481; Commonwealth ex rel. Knowles v. Rundle, 419 Pa. 300, 302, 213 A. 2d 635, 636.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.",
