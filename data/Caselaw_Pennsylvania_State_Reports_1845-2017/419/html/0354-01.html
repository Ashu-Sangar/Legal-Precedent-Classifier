Margaret Hitzelberger was appointed executrix of her estate. Under decedent’s will, certain Delaware County realty became a part of her residuary estate Avhich slie directed be divided equally among four named persons, one of whom was Charles Fox. The will further provided that, should any of the four named persons predecease decedent, the share of the person so dying should pass to the survivors. One of said persons predeceased decedent and, therefore, under the will, said person’s share, e.g., one-fourth, passed to the three survivors. Upon decedent’s death and, by agreement among the three survivors, the executrix conveyed the subject Delaware <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>County realty to Charles Pox and, upon this conveyance, no- realty transfer tax was paid the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b430-4" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[218,494,1147,575]]]'>Acting under the authority of the Realty Transfer Tax Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Commonwealth made a determination of the tax due on this conveyance of realty. Since Charles Pox was entitled, under decedent’s will and in line with the circumstances existing at the time of decedent’s death, to one-third of this realty, the Commonwealth did not tax súch oné-third interest but only levied a tax on the two-thirds interest which, devised by the will to the two other named persons, had been conveyed by the executrix’ deed to Charles Pox.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[219,1088,1150,687]]]'>The Commonwealth’s determination of the tax was duly served upon the parties to the conveyance (the taxpayers) and they were advised, by written instructions, of their rights and remedies and the time within which a petition for redetermination of the. tax had to be filed under the Realty Transfer Tax Act and the Commonwealth’s regulations thereunder. The taxpayers ignored the Commonwealth’s determination of the tax and did not file a petition for a redetermination of the tax. On November 12, 1963, the Commonwealth notified the taxpayers of its intention to file a tax lien in Delaware County against the realty but such notice was also ignored.</p>

The Commonwealth then filed preliminary objections to this petition averring; (a) that, since the petition was directed against the Commonwealth, the appropriate venue of the action was in Dauphin, not Delaware County; (b) that the Realty Transfer Act, under which the tax was levied, provides an <em>exclusive </em>remedy which had to be exhausted before any recourse can be had to a court proceeding. After argument, the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County made absolute the taxpayers’ rule. The rationale of the court below was that, since the issue raised was not as to the amount of the tax but as to the validity of the imposition of the tax on this realty located in Delaware County, the statutory remedy under the Realty Transfer Act was not exclusive.</p>

This is an appeal under the Act of 1925 (March 5, 1925, P.

Effective September 3, 1957, the Department promulgated such regulations. These regulations provided, inter alia: (1) that a departmental examination be made of all realty transfer documents to ascertain whether the full amount of the tax had been paid; (2) in the event such tax had not been fully paid, then that a determination be made of the correct amount of the tax payable; (3) that notice be given, by mail, to all parties, subject to the tax, of the departmental action; (4) that, within 90 days after the notice to the taxpayer has been mailed, the taxpayer may petition the Department to redetermine the tax; (5) after departmental action upon such petition, that notice by mail of such action must be given the taxpayer; (6) within 90 days of the mailing of such notice, the taxpayer is given the right to petition for a review of the departmental action by the Board of Finance and Review.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The procedure outlined in these regulations has received legislative approval<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and provision has been made for an appeal from the action taken by the Board of Finance and Review to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County.

The Act provided a method for ascertaining the amount of contributions, if any, payable by employers, for appropriate notice to the employers of the assessment of such contributions, for a right to dissatisfied employers to petition for a reassessment of such contributions and for a right of eventual appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. In <em>Lents, </em>the Commonwealth made an assessment against Lentz for contributions and gave notice of such assessment but, as in the case at bar, the notice was ignored. The Commonwealth, after the passage of time provided in the statute whereby the assessment became final, then filed a lien for such tax in the county of Lentz’ residence and business and, with a view to eventual execution against Lentz’ property, issued a writ of scire facias to reduce the claim represented by the lien to judgment. At that point, for the first time, Lentz attempted to question the validity of the tax by filing an affidavit of defense to the scire facias. The Commonwealth then entered a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense which the court below discharged. On appeal, this Court reversed the action of the court below and remanded the record for the entry of judgment in favor of the Commonwealth.</p>

These conditions were fully met in the instant case. The defendant was given due notice of each step undertaken by the department, looking to the making of an assessment against him, and was given timely notice of the resultant action taken by the department. On the other hand, the defendant deliberately <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>refrained from contesting the assessment in the department, made no attempt to petition for a reassessment and, necessarily, therefore, did not seek to appeal the matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County as he otherwise would have had a right to do. Thus, the assessment became final and the contributions, embraced thereby, became due and payable.” (p. 103). Moreover, the Court in commenting on the provisions of the Act of March 21, 1806, P. L. 558, 4 Sm. L. 326, §13, 46 P.S. §156, stated: “In practice, that has meant that one who fails to exhaust his statutory remedies may not thereafter raise an issue which could have and should have been raised in the proceeding afforded by the statutory remedy, [citing authorities].” (p. 104). <em>Lentz </em>controls the instant situation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
