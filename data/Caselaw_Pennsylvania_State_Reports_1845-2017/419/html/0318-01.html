On March 7, 1965, defendant presented a petition<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> for <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>a rehearing on his prior petition for a writ of habeas corpus. This petition was denied by the lower Court without a hearing or further testimony. From the Order denying his petition defendant took this appeal.</p>

    <p id="b394-5" data-blocks='[["BL_394.6",394,[206,728,1149,635]]]'>Prior to trial, and indeed, prior to his confession, defendant was represented by an attorney who advised him that he did not have to make any statement to the police, if he did not choose to do so. Nevertheless, a few hours after being so advised, defendant made a confession to the police in which he admitted that he killed Robert W. Mays, and gave his version of the killing.. His confession was introduced in evidence at his trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">**</a> at which time he was represented by counsel and took the stand and testified in his own behalf. After sentence, defendant filed no post-sentence motions and took no appeal.</p>
    <p id="b394-6" data-blocks='[["BL_394.7",394,[205,1375,1149,580]]]'>Defendant contends that he was denied his Constitutional right to counsel at the accusatorial stage of the proceedings, even though before he made his confession he had engaged, we repeat, a lawyer who advised him of his right to remain silent and to refuse to answer any questions. More specifically, he contends that under <em>Escobedo v. Illinois, </em><a href="/us/378/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="378 U.S. 478" data-case-ids="6166688" data-case-paths="/us/378/0478-01">378 U.S. 478</a> (1964), the confession that he gave to the police under the above mentioned circumstances should have been excluded at his trial..
