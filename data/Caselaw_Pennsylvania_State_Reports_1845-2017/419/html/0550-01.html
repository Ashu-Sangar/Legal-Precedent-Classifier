Involved in this accident were two motor vehicles, one owned and operated by John J. Heffernan (plaintiff), and the other owned and operated by Ernest Rosser (defendant).</p>
    <p id="b626-4" data-blocks='[["BL_626.5",626,[244,603,1148,690]]]'>At the point of accident, Route 22 is a wide — 62 feet — highway, running in a general east-west direction and consisting of four lanes — two eastbound and two westbound — divided by a so-called “singing divider” elevated about three-quarters of an inch above the highway surface. The Holiday House Motel is situated along the northerly side of the highway; ingress to and egress from the motel to and from Route 22 are by means of three driveways, an eastern, a middle and a western, the latter two being 102 feet apart. At the time of accident, the highway was dry, weather clear, visibility good and, although it was nighttime, the area was well illuminated.</p>

Intending to proceed in an. easterly direction after leaving the motel, plaintiff drove his automobile to the edge of the berm on the northerly side of the highway. According to plaintiff’s testimony, he utilized the western driveway as the means of exit, he waited at the edge of the highway for five to ten minutes for an opportunity to enter the highway, he observed no cars approaching from the east in the westbound lanes but did see cars approaching from the west in the eastbound lanes, the nearest of which cars was in the “outside” eastbound lane and approximately 700 feet from where he would enter the highway, he then crossed the two westbound lanes and turned into the “inside” eastbound lane<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and he had proceeded in <a id="p553" href="#p553" data-label="553" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*553</a>such lane for approximately 140-150 feet when he was struck in the rear by defendant’s motor vehicle proceeding in the same eastbound lane. By reason of the collision, plaintiff’s motor vehicle was knocked out of control, it crossed the “outside” eastbound lane and came to rest against a telephone pole — situated about 65 feet from the point of impact — on the southerly side of the highway near a gasoline station which was located approximately opposite the middle driveway of the motel.</p>

After the impact between the two vehicles, defendant swerved to the left, crossed the two westbound lanes and came to rest on the northerly side of the highway against the side of the motel, having travelled a distance of approximately 140 feet from the point of impact.</p>

If believed, plaintiff’s testimony would indicate that he made the necessary traffic observations, that he “came out fast” on the highway, that he had successfully negotiated the passage over the westbound lanes and into the “inside” eastbound lane and that not only was he in the latter lane when struck but he had proceeded in that lane for 140-150 feet when the rear-end collision took place.</p>

Plaintiff states he entered the highway by coming from the western driveway of the motel, entering the eastbound lane at a point directly opposite such middle driveway and reached the point of impact only after travelling 140-150 feet in the eastbound lane. Defendant states that plaintiff reached the point of impact by entering the eastbound lane directly at the point of impact. The place of entry is not only significant but crucial in determining liability for this accident.

However, in the case at bar, our scrutiny of the record convinces us that there was evidence of such sufficiency on the question of contributory negligence as to preclude the court below’s judicial declaration that contributory negligence was not an issue evidentially supported.
