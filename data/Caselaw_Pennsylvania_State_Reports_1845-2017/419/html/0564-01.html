The alleged discrimination against Moy took place on May 11, 1964, the very same day that Price entered into an agreement to sell his property to Hanson.

An examination of the Ordinance reveals that §9-1107(3) <em>specifically </em>states that there shall he no appeal from a prehearing dismissal of the complaint. Section 9-1108 provides: “In the event the Respondent refuses or fails to comply with any order of the Commission or violates any of the provisions of this Chapter, the Commission shall certify the case and the entire record of its proceeding to the Law Department, which shall invoke the aid of an appropriate Court to secure enforcement or compliance with the order or impose the penalties set forth in Section 9-1109, or both.” The sections mentioned above suggest that the right to review a Commission order is covered by the Ordinance itself, that is, the respondent may contest an order only, after a full hearing, by refusing to comply with the order and requiring the City to take the matter to an appropriate Court to seek enforcement of the order.</p>

The difficulty inherent in this line of reasoning is, as the court below recognized, that Rule 1* (a) merely sets forth the appellate procedure <em>if an appeal does in fact lie. </em>It does not grant any right of appeal in itself but rather only those already “allowed by law”. The City’s reliance on <em>Robert C. and Shirley D. Watkins v. Pauline Schwinger, </em>C.P. 7, June T., 1965, No. 4663, which purported to follow Rule 1*(a) et seq. in securing a writ of certiorari from the common pleas court in another Commission case involving discrimination in housing is misplaced; <em>Schwinger </em>is not binding on this Court.

L. 744, §10, as amended, 43 P.S. §960, which <em>does </em>specifically limit review of the State Commission’s order. The relevant portion of the State Act (43 P.S. §960) reads: “When the Commission has heard and decided any complaint brought before it, enforcement of its order shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court, together with a transcript of the record of the hearing before the Commission, <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>. . . .” In <em>Cooney v.

    <p id="b645-4" data-blocks='[["BL_645.5",645,[115,1065,1153,1080]]]'>The City vigorously opposes this conclusion by pointing out that the historical purpose of the 1963 amendments, §9-1101 et seq. of the Philadelphia Code, was to strengthen the adjudicating powers of the Commission and to make it more like the State Human Relations Commission. If this Court finds that a trial de novo is required, the City argues, the Commission will be as weak as before the 1963 amendments. However, while accepting the City’s historical reasoning, we reject its conclusion. This history only makes the omission of legislative directives as to the scope of review the more meaningful. If City Council was indeed trying to model in 1963 a stronger Commission after the Pennsylvania State Commission, why did it not copy the State procedure of limitation of judicial review while copying everything else? Even if the answer to that question is that the City Council was uncertain whether it could legally limit judicial review, the Council’s motives for failing so to do cannot be persuasive in construing the Ordinance.</p>

      <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>The second factor is the Ordinance’s procedure for transcribing testimony. Section 9-1107 (6) states: “The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and <em>may </em>be transcribed.” (Emphasis added). This suggests also that a de novo trial is required in the enforcement proceedings because if the Ordinance is otherwise construed to call for a limited review of the record, the language of the statute would have to read: “The testimony . . . <em>must </em>be transcribed.” Without a <em>mandatory </em>transcription of the testimony the reviewing court would have no way of testing the validity of the Commission’s order against the weight of the evidence. The City has tried to counter this argument by declaring that pre-1963 Commission Regulations §400:06(g) (5) and §400:06(h) in fact do require a mandatory transcription of testimony before the Commission and that section 2 of the 1963 Ordinance permits these regulations to remain in effect. However, §9-1110 only permits those regulations to remain in force which are not inconsistent with section 2, and §9-1107(6) <em>is </em>inconsistent with regulations §400:06(g) (5) and §400:06(h) by making transcription permissive, not mandatory. Implicitly, the City concedes this contention by trying to explain the purpose of permissive transcription as an effort to save unnecessary expense if a case is settled during or immediately after a hearing.</p>

Because an administrative ordinance such as §9-1109 which imposes criminal penalties (here imprisonment and/or fine) can only be enforced in a de novo trial (cf. <em>Helvering v. Mitchell, </em><a href="/us/303/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="303 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="6141190" data-case-paths="/us/303/0391-01">303 U.S. 391</a>, 402, <a href="/us/303/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="303 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="6141190" data-case-paths="/us/303/0391-01">58 S.

The City’s counterargument that enforcement of a commission order and prayer for imprisonment or a fine are separate actions which should be tried in different courts following different procedures begs the question. The problem before this Court is not whether the criminal and civil proceedings under the Ordinance should be brought separately but rather what did City Council intend by failing to distinguish between the two. We conclude that the most reasonable construction of the Ordinance is that City Council contemplated the same procedure for both criminal and civil proceedings, that is, trial de novo.</p>

However, in an analogous situation under a Pittsburgh Fair Housing Ordinance (No. 523, 1958), a court of equity held that the City of Pittsburgh’s counterclaim to enforce a Commission finding of discrimination was to be in the nature of a trial de novo: <em>Stanton Land Co. v. City of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa-d-c2d/33/0756-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="33 Pa. D. &amp; C.2d 756" data-case-ids="1682369" data-case-paths="/pa-d-c2d/33/0756-01">33 Pa. D. &amp; C. 2d 756</a> (1963). The issue of scope of review of the Commission’s order was not explored in <em>Stanton. </em>We, therefore, dismiss as speculation the City’s effort to distinguish <em>Stanton </em>by contending a de novo trial was there held solely to avoid a Commission order from being attacked as an unlawful delegation of power due to lack of legislative stand<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>ards in tlie Ordinance. One could equally speculate that any procedure for review would have satisfied the court’s fear in <em>Stanton </em>of an unconstitutional delegation of power to the Commission as long as it did not permit the Commission to be “the last word for practical purposes” on the validity of its orders; <a href="/pa-d-c2d/33/0756-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="33 Pa.

    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[190,733,1156,1075]]]'>A trial de novo was also ordered in an enforcement proceeding, similar to the case at bar, in <em>City of New York v. 1001 Tenants Corporation, </em><a href="/misc2d/41/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="41 Misc. 2d 518" data-case-ids="1134437" data-case-paths="/misc2d/41/0518-01">41 Misc. 2d 518</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=247%20N.Y.S.2d%2052" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="247 N.Y.S.2d 52">247 N.Y.S. 2d 52</a> (1964). Just as in the case at bar, the New York court was asked to decide whether the City Commission of New York under Title X of Chapter 41 of the New York City Administrative Code had the same powers as the New York State Human Relations Commission to make conclusive findings of discrimination in the absence of any explicit language in the City Code. In ruling that New York City Council must have intended trial de novo in an enforcement proceeding because the statute gave the Commission no explicit power to make administrative determinations, the Court suggested a legislative remedy which is equally pertinent to the case at bar: “Alternately, the Commission could be given greater power to make findings, or more Teeth’ to make its own orders, subject only to judicial review. Such a change can only be acted upon by the law making body.” <a href="/citations/?q=247%20N.Y.S.2d%2052" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="247 N.Y.S.2d 52">247 N.Y.S. 2d at 56</a>.</p>

The New York court found significant, as we do here, that Council’s failure to use the State Commission’s explicit procedure of limited review as an example indicated that Council intended a different result — trial de novo.</p>

      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>The City’s reliance on <em>Lesniak v.

There the Supreme Court of Michigan held that, an anti-discrimination statute, with a procedure similar to the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance except that it specifically provided for de novo review, had to be construed to grant the more limited review of certiorari in order to avoid being declared unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of administrative authority. However, unlike the case at bar, the Michigan statute contained internal contradictions to its express provision for a de novo trial. “The most casual examination of the appeal provisions contained in sections 8 and 10 of the fair employment practices act reveals substantial ambiguities and inconsistencies <a href="/citations/?q=111%20N.W.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="111 N.W.2d 790">111 N.W. 2d at 793</a>. The courts’ reasoning is therefore based on the resolution of the contradiction of specifically providing for a de novo trial and equally specifically providing for appeal to be based on the transcript made before the Commission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> No such inconsistencies exist in the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance.</p>

While conceding that a de novo trial may not be the most efficient procedure under the Ordinance, we conclude that it is the procedure which the statute itself seems to require. We would add further that our decision will not destroy the efficacy of the Commission <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>as the City predicts. As defendants have pointed out, the report of the Commission indicates that out of the more than sixty complaints of alleged discrimination in housing in 1964, the case at bar is the only one in which the City was required to bring an enforcement proceeding. This implies that the procedures before the Commission <em>cure </em>effective in reaching settlement without need of a court order. Just as the City is reluctant to prove its case again in court, respondent will be reluctant to undergo the time and expense of defending his position at a full trial. Thus, it is still in the best interests of both the City and the respondent that the controversy be settled by the Commission.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[198,1056,1153,912]]]'>The City contends that, even if this Court holds that a trial de novo is required, the Court below erred in refusing to admit the Commissions’ report as “some evidence” at the trial. We reject this argument for the aforementioned reasons that we held that the Ordinance called for a trial de novo. It would be inconsistent to find that the failure of the Ordinance to dictate any procedure of limited review necessitates a new trial at an enforcement proceeding and then, in effect, grant a limited review anyway by admitting the entire record of the Commission as evidence.
