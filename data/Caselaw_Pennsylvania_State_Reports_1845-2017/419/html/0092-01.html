Moreover, in reviewing the proceedings in the court below, we do not pass upon or determine the credibility of the witnesses; that is a matter for the chancellor, not for this Court: [citing an authority].” See also: <em>Hunter Will, </em><a href="/pa/416/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="416 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1892975" data-case-paths="/pa/416/0127-01">416 Pa. 127</a>, 136, <a href="/citations/?q=205%20A.2d%2097" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="205 A.2d 97">205 A. 2d 97</a>.</p>

The first and second of these positions are totally without any semblance of evidentiary foundation. It may be conceded that contestants’ testimony would indicate that decedent for a loug period had been in<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>temperate, and possibly even an alcoholic. Such proof, in itself, however, is insufficient in the absence of a showing of drunkenness at the time of execution of the will: [citing authorities]. In the instant case, evidence is completely absent that decedent was under the influence of alcohol on the occasion of either of his visits to his lawyer’s office pertaining to the will; in fact, any intimation thereof is categorically negatived by the positive testimony of the subscribing witnesses, corroborated incidentally by contestants’ own witness, Albert Losink, who apparently saw decedent both shortly before and soon after one of the visits to his lawyer’s office.</p>

No other person accompanied decedent or made the arrangements for his consultation with his attorney on the subject. No one acting for Girard College in any manner importuned him to make that charitable institution the principal beneficiary of his estate. Indeed, according to the uncontradicted testimony of [the lawyer-scrivener], decedent was quite emphatic and definite in his decision despite questioning by the attorney on the subject at the time. Significantly, when reminded that he might reconsider his dispositive scheme some months later, decedent nevertheless did not make any changes.</p>
