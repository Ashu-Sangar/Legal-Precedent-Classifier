    <p id="b185-6" data-blocks='[["BL_185.10",185,[138,1084,1152,466]]]'>The Orphans’ Court of Montgomery County held that at the time of testator’s death the Pennsylvania “Iron Curtain Act”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> prevented distribution of his estate to the Rumanian legatees. Acting pursuant to the testamentary provision quoted above, therefore, the court awarded the residue of the estate to decedent’s Philadelphia friend. This appeal from that determination is taken by testator’s primary beneficiaries in Rumania.</p>
