At trial, he was represented by counsel retained by his family. No post trial motions were filed, and on March 27, 1958, the court sentenced him to serve an indeterminate term in a state correctional institution for a period of not less than ten and not more than twenty years. No appeal from the judgment ivas entered.</p>

He was also told that he had the right to consult an attorney before making any statement. This testimony was uncontradicted.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
