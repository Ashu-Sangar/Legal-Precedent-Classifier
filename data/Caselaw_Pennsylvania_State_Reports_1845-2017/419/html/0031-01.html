On appeal by Northern, the lower Court, in an exhaustive Opinion, fixed the actual fair market value of Northern’s property at $3,976,654, and the assessed value for tax purposes at $1,192,996. From the final Order which dismissed exceptions filed by both Northern and the Board, the Board took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.10",106,[215,1359,1149,532]]]'>The assessment fixed by the Board for the year 1961 represents a 40% increase over the tax assessment of the property which was fixed by the Court for the years 1959 and 1960. Between 1959 and 1961 no other buildings were erected, nor were any improvements made on Northern’s property. Moreover, since the 1959 assessment, a valuable tract of Northern’s property was sold by it and (of course) there were two years of further depreciation in the existing buildings.</p>
    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.11",106,[215,1899,1149,207]]]'>Northern produced three expert witnesses. One testified that the market value of the property was $3,-360,000, another $3,365,460, and Northern’s third witness $3,525,216.</p>

One witness testified that the market value of the property was $4,667,980, another $4,800,000, and the Board’s third witness, $4,965,000. The lower Court, as above noted, fixed the market value of the property at $8,976,654.</p>

    <p id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.6",107,[121,930,1151,530]]]'>The witnesses for Northern based their opinion as to the actual (fair market) value in 1961 principally on the capitalization of net income. Two real estate experts who testified in rebuttal on behalf of the Board used two methods in fixing the market value of Northern’s property: (1) Beproduction cost less depreciation; and (2) a capitalization calculation which combines (a) capitalizing the land, and (b) the reproduction cost, less depreciation for the value of the improvements and buildings.</p>
    <p id="b107-7" data-blocks='[["BL_107.7",107,[116,1471,1154,736]]]'>The Board’s principal contention is that reproduction cost less depreciation may be used in conjunction with the capitalization of net income in determining the actual (fair market) value for tax assessment purposes. While many factors may be considered in determining actual or fair market value, the lower Court properly rejected the testimony of the Board’s expert witnesses on the ground that reproduction cost less depreciation may not be used as a factor in determining the market value of property: <em>Buhl Foundation v.
