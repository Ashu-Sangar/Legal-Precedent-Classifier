    <p id="b611-9" data-blocks='[["BL_611.15",611,[131,1349,1150,591]]]'>Adderley filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging he was denied due process because he was arrested without a warrant and a coerced confession was used against him. The court below, in denying the petition for the writ, stated: “Relator’s plea of guilty in open court while represented by counsel resulted in a waiver of his right to question proceedings before the plea.
