None of the cases,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> cited in support of this position, is here applicable. Each of those cases deals with a banking (savings) account, held in trust for another, and to which additions were held to be presumptively in trust also. We note the separate body of law which has grown around such trusts since the decision of the New York court in <em>Matter of Totten, </em><a href="/ny/179/0112-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="179 N.Y. 112" data-case-ids="2318653" data-case-paths="/ny/179/0112-01">179 N.Y. 112</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20N.E.%20748" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="71 N.E. 748">71 N.E. 748</a> (1904), and note the differences which abound in the situation here present. Bank accounts of this nature are purely within the power of the settlor to augment or decrease, according to the daily exigencies of his life. Improved real estate, on the other hand, is substantially incapable of sudden and variable liquidation. Joe La Rocca stated his benevolent purpose in 1954 when he took title to the real estate in trust for his grandson. He should not be financially punished because he also saw fit to cause the trust to increase its earning power by advancing additional capital for improvements. Also, we have the testimony of the settlor as to what his intention was when he made these expenditures. The same would have been available to all the settlors in the cases cited by appellant (supra note 2) had the <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>court in each of them not been dealing with the intent of decedents.</p>

    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[144,815,1151,478]]]'>Appellant’s second contention is that the costs of construction were paid by the La Rocca Supply Co., Inc.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> (Company), not by the trustee. We conclude, with the exception of those items where payment was made by means of credits upon the various accounts of the subcontractors with the Company for the work performed, that the record supports the auditing judge’s conclusion that these improvements were made at the personal expense of the trustee.</p>

[Citing cases] . . .; in the second place, the removal of a trustee is a matter which lies in the discretion of the court below and, in the absence of an abuse of discretion, that court’s action will not be disturbed: [citing cases].” Restatement 2d, Trusts, §107, comment c, states that “mere friction between the trustee and the beneficiary is not a sufficient ground for removing the trustee unless such friction interferes with the proper administration of the trust.” Furthermore, comment f to that section states that the court should remove the trustee less readily when he has been named by the settlor. And this is even more apparent when the settlor himself is the trustee. Suffice it to say that we find no abuse of discretion in the lower court’s action in failing to remove Joe La Rocca as trustee, in view of its finding that his administration of the trust has resulted in substantial benefit to the estate rather than to place it in jeopardy of dissipation.</p>

As the court below pointed out, it is necessary first to establish what the estate balance should have been in 1958 in order to determine what portion of the above totaled expenditures is attributable to the trustee’s personal expense, and what portion would and should have been paid by the trust corpus. In so doing, we agree with the court below that interest on any balance in the trust estate should be allowed at the prevailing rate. This is done because the allowance of such interest is not to be looked upon as a penalty upon the trustee, but rather as what the estate would have realized had the funds been segregated. Empirical examination fails to afford us an indication of what the court below considered to be the “prevailing rate” during the period 1954-1958, and in lieu thereof we substitute the reasonable figure of 3%.</p>

Indeed, <em>Carpenter’s Appeal, </em><a href="/grant/2/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Grant 381" data-case-ids="227641" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0381-01">2 Grant 381</a> (1858), cited as authority by the court below, did allow a trustee to recover 6% interest on money lent by him to the trust estate. However, the question there was whether or not interest was allowable at all, not the amount thereof. Interest is, in fact, allowable (see also, <em>Lessee of Dilworth v. Sniderling &amp; Lewis, </em><a href="/binn/1/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Binn. 488" data-case-ids="1787900" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0488-01">1 Binn. 488</a> (1808)); however, we do not feel that the court below was compelled to allow interest at the rate of 6%. We are persuaded by appellant’s argument that it would be inequitable to allow the beneficiary interest “‘at the prevailing rate”, and to allow the trustee 6% for moneys advanced to the trust in the present complex situation. Since the court below concluded that the trustee was not deprived of interest on his advances by his conduct (in which we find no abuse of discretion), we declare that the trustee is entitled to simple interest at the prevailing rate, and in lieu of a specific finding on that point, we allow him 3%, as was done for the beneficiary.</p>
