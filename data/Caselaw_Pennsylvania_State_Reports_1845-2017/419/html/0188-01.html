In 1922, the stock split 8 for 1, giving the trustee 144 shares. In 1928, a 60% stock dividend of newly issued 7% cumulative preferred shares was declared and issued, giving the trustee 144 shares of common and 86 shares of new preferred. In 1938, pursuant to reorganization, the 144 shares of common were called and in return therefor the trustee received 16 shares of new common (no par), and in return for the 86 shares of 7% preferred, he received 86 shares of the new common, giving him a total of 102 shares of new common. In 1950, another split of 9 for 1 gave the trustee an additional 918 shares or a total of 1020 shares of the new common. Thereafter, in 1961, the Company merged with Bell &amp; Gossett Company, and the trustee received 18,615 shares of Bell &amp; Gossett on an 18% for 1 basis. Then in 1963, Bell &amp; Gossett Company merged with International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), and in return for his 18,615 shares of Bell &amp; Gossett, trustee received 6,236 shares of ITT common and 1303 shares of ITT preferred (plus a small amount of cash to cover fractional shares not issued).

Of this stock, 498 shares were sold to the public by the Company, and 2,130 shares were distributed to the then holders of the common stock of the Company on the basis of 6 shares of the new 7% preferred stock for each 10 shares of common held (or a 60% dividend). Into the record was read the following portion from the minutes of the Board of Directors of the Company for April 26, 1928: “The Board of Directors may declare a stock dividend of 2,130 shares out of the surplus of the corporation to the holders of the common stock.” Of course, the characterization as a “dividend” by the Directors is not controlling, but is one of the factors in determining whether or not an apportionable event has occurred. That it would not be unreasonable to find that it was, in fact, a dividend is bolstered by the testimony to the effect that in another year, 1922, cash dividends of 30%, 25%, and 5% (or a total of 60%) were declared and paid, and that cash dividends were paid regularly throughout the predepression years. It was also testified that the purpose of this dividend was to allow the holders of the common stock to diversify or liquidate more readily their holdings (the shares of this closely-held corporation being the major asset of most of the family members at that time) without relinquishing their proprietary interest in the Company. The dividend was to be paid from “surplus”, which was <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>represented to be, at the beginning of 1928, in the sum of $492,721. From the above, we think it is clear that this distribution was in fact an “extraordinary stock dividend” which represented an apportionable event under the Pennsylvania Rule of Apportionment. It is therefore necessary for the court below to reconsider this case to determine the apportionment which should have taken place in 1928 according to the rules then extant, and to declare what portion, if any, of the 7% preferred stock was required to be retained to maintain the intact value, and what portion was attributable to income.</p>

In that case, the device of corporate merger was used to obviate the necessity of paying past accumulated and unpaid preferred dividends and to reduce the preferred rate from 7% to 5%. The trust estate held <em>7% </em>preferred stock in a steel company which had both the 7% preferred and common stock outstanding. In order “ ‘to take care of accumulated dividends on the 7% preferred stock’ ”, <a href="/pa/344/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="344 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1210972" data-case-paths="/pa/344/0607-01">344 Pa. at 609</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20A.2d%20192" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="26 A.2d 192">26 A. 2d at 194</a>, the company merged with its principal subsidiary, and for each of the common shares in the old company of $100 par <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>the holders received one share of common in the new merged company with no par bnt a stated value of $25. And each of the 7% preferred shares in the old company was exchanged for 1.4 shares of 5% preferred stock (each of $100 par) in the new merged company. The court there held that the life tenant was entitled to an apportionment of the sale price on the basis of the reorganization, recognizing that part of the increased, realized value of the shares sold by the trust estate was attributable to the cancellation of accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred shares.</p>

And all of the stock of the Maryland company was transferred to a new Delaware (holding) company, whose stock was taken in return and distributed to the holders of the Illinois company. Thereafter, the Illinois company dissolved and can-celled its stock. In that situation, the Court held that an apportionment was necessary. While the facts are not quite apposite, the following language is relevant, <a href="/pa/323/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="323 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1169592" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0042-01">323 Pa. at 48</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%20754" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="186 A. 754">186 A. at </a>756: “Had the life estate ended when the transfer was completed there can be no doubt as to the division to be made.

In accepting such a transaction, the trustee was dealing with two sets of vested rights, to wit, the right of the remaindermen to have the corpus intact and the right of the life tenant to receive the dividends due her under the contract evidenced by the share certificates. In regard to this realignment of ownership, the sole witness in this case (here speaking in his capacity as Company officer) stated that the Board of Directors was “taking into consideration the cumulated dividends that were unpaid, taking into consideration the prior right of the preferred stockholders to both assets and earnings. I mean, not only taking into consideration the past but taking into consideration the future, because once the exchange was made then all stockholders were on the same basis.” The cases dealing with common shares and anticipated but undeclared dividends from accumulated earnings are quite different and distinct from the situation where preferred dividends have accrued without payment. True it is that the holders have no vested right in the surplus or other assets of a corporation, but such is not the case with the holders of preferred shares with cumulated and unpaid dividends from a going concern. As stated in <em>Daily’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/323/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="323 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1169592" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0042-01">323 Pa. at 47</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%20754" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="186 A. 754">186 A. at </a>756: “. . . the corporate management could not defeat the life tenant’s right to <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>a share in the earnings by the circuitous method of reincorporation here adopted.” Neither should the life tenant’s right here have been abrogated by a reorganization of the Company’s capital structure. Granted there was no surplus from which to pay these accumulated dividends, but the holders of the common shares agreed to a reduction in their interest in the Company’s capital in order to meet the obligation to these preferred shareholders, and “to be relieved of a very unrealistic dividend rate <em>of 7% </em>for the future”. Cf. <em>Fisher’s Estate, </em>supra. Thus, it is our conclusion that the transactions of 1928 and 1938 represented apportionable events, the mathematical determination of which must be decided below upon remand.</p>

Furthermore, this vernacular definition of laches or estoppel cannot stand the test of precedent or reason. No one relied to his detriment upon the failure of the trustee to make proper distributions of the “dividends”, nor is anyone seeking to penalize the trustee for his failure to so do. The life tenant having failed to claim the dividends in her lifetime, her executrix is not estopped from receiving them after her death: <em>Schulz Estate, </em><a href="/pa/374/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="374 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1241451" data-case-paths="/pa/374/0459-01">374 Pa. 459</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.2d%20176" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="98 A.2d 176">98 A. 2d 176</a> (1953), and <em>Martin’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/280/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="280 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="1084501" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0573-01">280 Pa. 573</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=124%20A.%20738" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="124 A. 738">124 A. 738</a> (1924).

The assets are all available, and the only question is to whom shall they go. That the life tenant should not be barred by her inaction is further evidenced by the family relationship between her and the trustee (who was, at the time of these disputed transactions, the life tenant’s brother-in-law — the settlor’s brother), which compels a conclusion that she relied upon his good services. Still further, she was receiving handsome cash dividends throughout the years, and probably never felt a pressing need to assert her rights (if, in fact, she knew about them — a proposition highly doubtful in view of the admitted confusion regarding the rules of apportionment which pervaded even practicing attorneys and the bench of that day).</p>

Thus, no inference can be drawn from the direction that dividends be “paid”, that only cash dividends were to be so treated.</p>

However, the clear direction of the will is to pay dividends, with no distinction as to whether they be stock or cash. In view of such a clear direction, we need not struggle hard to glean a contrary intent which would have had the effect of depriving the settlor’s wife (the natural object of his bounty) of her right to the dividends, as, when and however they were declared and paid by the Company.</p>
