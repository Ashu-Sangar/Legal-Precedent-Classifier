Harris, 87 years old, died as the result of a severe beating. The evidence of appellant’s guilt, although circumstantial, was overwhelming. He was apprehended by the police at the scene of the crime and in the presence of the victim. His clothing evidenced that he had been engaged in a struggle: his trousers were torn and blood was found on his topcoat and shirt. Testimony was adduced which tended to place the murder weapon in his possession prior to the slaying. Certain valuables identified as belonging to the victim were found on appellant’s person. And, although he sought to establish an alibi,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> he was unable to account for his activities at the <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>time the beating was believed to have taken place. Moreover, certain of appellant’s statements made at the scene, not controverted at trial, tended to connect him with the crime.</p>

Our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that appellant’s prior conviction, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, unlike the situation in <em>United States ex rel. Johnson v. Rundle, </em><a href="/f-supp/243/0695-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="243 F. Supp. 695" data-case-ids="407422" data-case-paths="/f-supp/243/0695-01">243 F. Supp. 695</a> (E.D.

The petition was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. (Misc. No. 2186, June 2, 1960) (Grim, J.). The opinion is apparently unreported.
