At that hospital he came under the service of a general surgeon who, after an examination, turned him over to Dr. Jones, a certified neurosurgeon. After performing a myelogram, which indicated a partial block of the spinal' cord, Dr. Jones performed a laminectomy involving the removal of the bony posterior arches of three thoracic vertebrae. During the course of that operation, Dr. Jones found the spinal cord “quite abnormal”, swollen to one and one-half times its normal size, not pulsating normally and pale.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Dr. Jones made an excision into the cord itself and, in so doing, discovered some tissue which he described as having “a mottled hemorrhagic appearance” and he then concluded, from a gross examination, that it was malignant. Dr. Jones excised a section of nerve tissue, — 2 mm. x 3 mm. x 4 mm. in dimensions — for biopsy purposes. The biopsy specimen was examined by á pathologist at Lankenau Hospital who later reported that the specimen “resembled” reticulum cell sarcoma which finding was later confirmed by a pathologist at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.</p>

Tobash, on his own volition, then went to Walter Reed Hospital, Washington, D. C.

It is now contended that Tobash can walk only with the aid of canes, his right leg functions improperly, his left leg is weak, his bladder is impaired, he is suffering pain in the chest and legs and his sexual power has been destroyed. It was Tobash’ theory at trial — supported by a medical witness — that “'the excision of the biopsy specimen from the fasciculus gracilis area of the spinal cord” caused a “traumatic reaction” which caused the cord to be swollen and which thus indirectly affected “the perambutal column of the spinal cord, which affects mobility”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and bladder function, that Tobash’ original condition was “transverse myelitis” or “myelopathy” and that the biopsy caused the present disability.</p>

On the morning set for commencement of the trial, attorney Krencewicz of the Schuylkill County Bar appeared and asked for a continuance on the ground he had been retained “a little more than a week before” to try the case and had had no opportunity to prepare for the trial.

The question to the doctor asked him to assume not only the truth of what Dr. Jones testified as to his clinical findings but also to assume that Tobash had “asymmetrical deficits with spasticity”— as testified to by Tobash — and from such testimony and assumption of facts to draw a conclusion.

The difficulty with this contention is that it points only to an isolated portion of the court’s instructions and, when the charge of the court is read in its entirety, it is clear beyond any question that the jury were not misled on the appropriate weight to be <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>given foreseeability in determining negligence nor tbe necessity of finding that the “final injurious consequence” flowed from the “first wrongful cause”.

    <p id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[143,781,1153,529]]]'>Tobash’ counsel requested the court to charge: “3. If you find as a fact that Dr. Jones knew or should have known that removing the portion of the nerve tissue described by him for the purpose of biopsy would necessarily do irreparable damage to the spinal cord and if you further find as a fact that there was no compelling necessity to remove á portion of the nerve tissue for diagnostic purposes, you may find Dr. Jones guilty of negligence.” The court refused to so charge; its refusal is now assigned as error.</p>

Such was not the issue presented nor was <em>necessity </em>the <em>sole </em>criterion. The court below well stated: “The issue was . . . whether or not the excision of such tissue for histological purposes of an infiltrating type tumor was a proper procedure. It was important that Dr. Jones perform the biopsy in order to confirm his tentative diagnosis of cancer. Dr. Jones was not certain that' this was [Tobash’] problem, and a diagnosis from a study of the tissue was needed in order to determine what methods were to be used in the treating of [Tobash’] malady.”. Our review of the record clearly supports the trial court’s refusal of this point for charge; it was certainly inapplicable in the case at <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>bar. <em>(Grzywacz v.

    <p id="b290-5" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[201,1039,1148,683]]]'>Tobash contends that the exposition of this doctrine was inapplicable to the facts and issues in the case at bar. A review of the record reveals that both Dr. Jones<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> and Dr. Groff testified that the excision of a small fragment of tissue from the spinal cord for histological purposes in the case of an infiltrating type tumor was proper surgical procedure. Dr. Dorsavage<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>, called on behalf of Tobash, testified that it was improper surgical procedure to excise such tissue for biopsy purposes under the circumstances.

The record presented conflicting views on the propriety of such procedure. From our examination of the court’s instructions we are convinced that, if the court erred at all, it was in the extension of more favorable instructions on Tobash’ side than the factual situation or the applicable law warranted; certainly, the instructions now complained of in no manner harmed or prejudiced the position of Tobash.</p>

In other words, in the face of conflicting reliable expert evidence as to what was the proper course to be pursued by the surgeon in charge of the case, twelve laymen, with no knowledge of medicine and surgery were called upon to decide a disputed scientific medical and surgical question upon which eleven physicians and surgeons of standing and experience could not agree. . . .” The jury in the case at bar was called upon to decide, in the face of conflicting and competent medical evidence, the propriety of the procedure followed by Dr. Jones in excising this tissue. Our reaction is that the instructions complained of permitted an inquiry by the jury unwarranted by the applicable law but that, instead of being harmed, Tobash was favored by such instructions.</p>
