Such a diversity of approach by the same legislative body on the same date to the same general problem of the taxation of foreign corporations is highly significant and indicative of a legislative purpose not to restrict the use of the apportionment formula in the Franchise Tax Act to foreign corporations whose “entire business” is not “transacted within this Commonwealth”.</p>

The thrust of the Commonwealth’s argument is that the holding of the Florida lots is unrelated and unconnected with Rieck’s Pennsylvania business activities, and to that extent, Rieck is engaged in multiform business. Assuming, arguendo, that the Florida lots are unconnected with Rieck’s Pennsylvania business activities, the Commonwealth’s argument encounters two obstacles: (1) under the rationale of the <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company </em>case the right to question the exclusion of assets of an unrelated business activity from the tangible property fraction lies with the taxpayer and not the Commonwealth; (2) under the language of the Franchise Tax Act the denomiator is expressly stated to be “the value of <em>all </em>the taxpayer’s tangible property <em>wherever </em>situated.” (Emphasis supplied.) Under the clear wording of the statute, Rieck was entitled to include in the denominator of the tangible property fraction the value of its Florida lots, even though such lots were unrelated to the business Rieck conducted in Pennsylvania.</p>
