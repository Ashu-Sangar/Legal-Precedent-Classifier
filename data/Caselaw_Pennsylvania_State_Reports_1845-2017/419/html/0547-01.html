Glass, Sheriff of Montgomery County for three successive terms (January 5, 1944 to January 3, 1956), received, as sheriff, funds applicable to unfinished business of his office and funds owing to litigants, attorneys and others, for which no demand had been made by the parties entitled thereto. Upon leaving office, Glass following the custom of his predecessors, retained these funds in a separate bank account entitled “Samuel M. Glass, Sheriff”. He honored certain proper demands made by his successor, Sheriff Peter J. Reilly, and others, so that the balance remaining in the account totalled on June 22, 1960, $35,119.87. On that date, his successor, having demanded this balance, Glass turned the funds over to Clay C. Hess, <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>Treasurer of Montgomery County, to be held in a special escrow account.</p>
    <p id="b623-4" data-blocks='[["BL_623.5",623,[139,434,1152,419]]]'>Glass then instituted tbe present action in equity against Reilly and tbe County of Montgomery to determine (a) tbe question of bis legal ownership to whole or part of tbe fund; (b) bis right to possession, custody and control of tbe fund; and (c) tbe respective legal rights of Montgomery County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and other individuals in tbe disputed fund.</p>
    <p id="b623-5" data-blocks='[["BL_623.6",623,[137,874,1152,318]]]'>It was Glass’s claim that be was entitled at least to tbe following amounts: (a) $2,750.65 as unpaid mileage on unfinished writs; (b) $2,600 as counsel fees for services in tbe present equity action; and (3) $2,500 for his, Glass’s efforts in connection with tbe present equity action.</p>
    <p id="b623-6" data-blocks='[["BL_623.7",623,[137,1204,1149,99]]]'>After bearing and audit ordered by tbe court below, tbe chancellor made tbe following adjudication:</p>
    <blockquote id="b623-7" data-blocks='[["BL_623.8",623,[132,1312,1155,706]]]'>“Tbe plaintiff has failed to establish by tbe weight or fair preponderance of tbe evidence his full claim of $2,750.65 for unpaid mileage on unfinished writs. It appears from tbe examination prepared by tbe court appointed auditors that 15,755 miles were traveled by the sheriff or bis deputies on uncompleted outstanding writs. It does not appear that this mileage was actual mileage or merely paper mileage. In an effort to be fair in this quest to do justice in this massive maze of accounts, we feel constrained to allow plaintiff ten cents a mile on tbe mileage found by our auditors. We will, therefore, award plaintiff tbe sum of $1,575.50 for mileage from tbe disputed fund.</blockquote>

Undoubtedly, counsel for plaintiff has worked arduously and effectively for many hours in plaintiff’s behalf to settle tbe ownership of tbe disputed fund, but it does not follow that counsel is entitled to full compensation out of a fund in which tbe plaintiff has only <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>a minor interest. Accordingly, we will allow plaintiff’s counsel the sum of $1,000 for legal services.</blockquote>

    <blockquote id="b624-7" data-blocks='[["BL_624.7",624,[212,751,1149,249]]]'>“The disputed fund of $35,119.87, as herein reduced by the claims of $1,575, $1,000 and $560, to $31,964.87 shall be held by the county for distribution pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Unclaimed Moneys Act.”</blockquote>
