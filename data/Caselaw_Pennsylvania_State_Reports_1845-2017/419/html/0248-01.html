    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[132,710,1151,88]]]'>The historical background may . be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[126,819,1158,1165]]]'>Van was organized in 1944, and engaged in the making of air vises. In 1951, it was contacted by O. Clair Norton, who claimed to have invented a unique air drier that could be used profitably in many areas of industry and manufacturing to prevent and eliminate fouling, rusting and shortened life in tools and machinery operated by compressed air. Norton’s brain child, following years of experimentation, was a deliquescent desiccant air drier. A desiccant is a substance which attracts and holds moisture; to deliquesce means to become liquid-like. Norton’s idea was to channel the compressed air through a chemical mixture which would absorb the moisture in the compressed air lines and deliquesce in an orderly fashion. Only the chemical had to be replaced. This type of device was a substantial improvement over the expensive and cumbersome driers then in general use, which required regeneration and the use of alternate driers. The chemical compound used, to be known as “Dryolite”, was in the form of a pellet consisting of 93 per cent sodium chloride impregnated with a small quantity of calcium chloride and sodium dichromate.</p>
    <p id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.7",325,[126,2003,1152,259]],["BL_326.1",326,[204,339,1147,86]]]'>On June 23, 1953, the United States Patent Office issued a patent to Norton for the drier. These rights were then assigned to Van for the purpose of further development and for the sale of deliquescent desiccant air driers. In August 1957, Norton applied for a pat<a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>ent on the desiccant used in the drier. This was never issued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[199,446,1152,1000]]]'>On September 1, 1953, Rapp was employed by Van. He had no previous experience in this field, and, at first, his duties’ involved handling Van’s mail operation. As the development and sale of the air driers grew in volume and importance in the Van system, Rapp’s position of importance and value increased, so that eventually he ran the gamut of tasks involved in this segment of Van’s business to become the general manager of the entire operation. During the course of this employment, he was intimately involved with purchasing, selling, advertising, plan and blue prints drafting, training and conducting field experiments to overcome customer difficulties. In short, Rapp was thoroughly imbued, through his industrious application, with all the problems, processes and advantages involved in the production, sale, and maintenance of this type of drier. He learned everything there was to know about Van’s drier, except the composition of the desiccant itself.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[195,1464,1152,743]],["BL_327.1",327,[131,335,1151,420]]]'>Beginning in 1952, General began to make, engineer and design parts for Van’s drier; then from September, 1953, to February 1, 1958, General manufactured the entire drier on behalf of Van according to Norton’s patent. It was in this connection that General and Rapp were introduced. Because of the complicated nature of the construction of these devices and the intimate knowledge of these matters possessed by Rapp, he began frequent visits to General to supervise construction. Then on February 1, 1958, suspecting that Rapp’s loyalty lay more with General than with it, Van terminated Rapp’s employment. One week later, Rapp was employed by General, and within days was actively planning the manufacture and sale of a <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>deliquescent desiccant air drier on General’s behalf. He broke down the secret of the composition of the chemical formula used in the Van drier. He substituted urea for sodium chloride which performed the same function. On April 1, 1958, General sold its first deliquescent desiccant air drier, which, while not an exact duplicate or physically similar to Van’s, was practically identical in function and concept.</p>
    <p id="b327-4" data-blocks='[["BL_327.5",327,[130,766,1152,196]]]'>On September 6, 1960, the United States Patent Office granted Rapp a patent for his desiccant. On March 16, 1965, Letters Patent were granted to Rapp and General for their drier.</p>
    <p id="b327-5" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[132,983,1150,257]]]'>On September 5, 1958, Van instituted this action for injunctive relief and an accounting. After prolonged hearings, the chancellor entered a decree in favor of Van. The court en banc subsequently made the decree final. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[133,1252,1150,464]]]'>The initial question for determination is whether or not the lower court had jurisdiction of the cause of action. Appellants strongly maintain that the issue basically involves patent rights, and that the decree of the lower court in effect deprives them of utilization of such rights and invalidates patents which they received. In short, they maintain that this is strictly “a patent ease”, and, therefore, exclusive jurisdiction is in the federal courts.</p>

The issuance of Letters Patent gives the patentee no more right to use his invention than he enjoyed before. See, Amdur, Patent Fundamentals, at 53 (1948). Therefore, viewed in this light, the existence of patent rights is not controlling. Infringement actions may be prosecuted in the federal courts, and existing patent rights may be unchallengable in a state court; however, appellants’ right to manufacture and sell the drier involved depends upon how the knowledge in connection therewith was obtained.

Relief may not be granted in this case because of the inextricable involvement of the alleged trade secrets with plaintiff’s and defendant’s patents thereby creating a possibility of conflict between state concepts of unfair competition and the uniform application of the patent law and patent policy. This field has been occupied exclusively by the Federal Patent Law. Two recent landmark <em>cases </em>— Sears, <em>Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., </em><a href="/us/376/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="376 U.S. 225" data-case-ids="379713" data-case-paths="/us/376/0225-01">376 U.S. 225</a> (1964) and <em>Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., </em><a href="/us/376/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="376 U.S. 234" data-case-ids="379739" data-case-paths="/us/376/0234-01">376 U.S. 234</a> (1964), clearly determine that the field has been preempted by the Federal Patent Law and that the state law of unfair competition is in conflict with the patent law and in the interest of uniformity and unburdened competition relief by way of damages or injunction based on the state law of unfair competition may not be allowed.</p>

Further, we would be doing these things under our state concept of unfair competition which the United States Supreme Court specifically said may not be done. We can neither extend the life of a patent nor have we the power to restrict its use even though the patent was obtained as a result of fraud and misrepresentation. Appellee recognized, as it did in its counter-statement of questions involved, that some aspects of the alleged secrets appropriated by appellants might be <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>the subject of a suit against appellants in the United States courts for infringement. The fact that the possibility of this federal action exists is sufficient to divest our state courts of jurisdiction and require that we stand aside so an action to rectify the alleged abuses may be pursued in the federal courts. I would require the lower court to acknowledge its lack of jurisdiction and dismiss the complaint.</p>
