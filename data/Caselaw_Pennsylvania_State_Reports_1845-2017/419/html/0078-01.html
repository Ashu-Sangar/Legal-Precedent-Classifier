The complaint alleged that the endorsement of one of the payees had been forged and that, therefore, Fidelity should not have paid the check. Fidelity joined the Philadelphia National Bank as an additional defendant claiming that if Fidelity were liable to plaintiff, PNB was liable over to Fidelity for having guaranteed the endorsements. PNB joined the Penn’s Grove National Bank and Trust Company as a second additional defendant claiming that if PNB were <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>liable to Fidelity, Penn’s Grove was liable to PNB for having cashed the check and guaranteed the endorsements. By way of defense all of the banks asserted that none of them were liable because the issuance of the cheek by the Title Company was induced by an impostor and delivered by the Title Company to a confederate of the impostor thereby making the forged endorsement effective.</p>

Edmund Jezemski was administrator and sole heir of his deceased mother’s estate, one of the assets of which was premises 1130 North Fortieth Street, Philadelphia. Mrs. Jezemski, without her husband’s knowledge, arranged for a mortgage to be placed on this real estate. This mortgage was obtained for Mrs. Jezemski through John M. McAllister, a member of the Philadelphia Bar, and Anthony DiBenedetto, a real estate dealer, and was to be insured by Philadelphia Title Insurance Company, the plaintiff. Shortly before the date set for settlement at the office of the title company, Mrs. Jezemski represented to McAllister and DiBenedetto that her husband would be unable to attend the settlement. She came to McAllister’s office in advance of the settlement date, accompanied by a man whom she introduced to McAllister and DiBenedetto as her husband. She and this man, in the presence of McAllister and DiBenedetto, executed a deed conveying the real estate from the estate to Edmund Jezemski and Paula Jezemski as tenants by the entireties and also executed the mort<a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>gage, bond and warrant which had been prepared. Mc-Allister and DiBenedetto, accompanied by Mrs. Jezemski, met at the office of the title company on the date appointed for settlement, the signed deed and mortgage were produced, the mortgagee handed over the amount of the mortgage, and the title company delivered its check to Mrs. Jezemski for the net proceeds of $15, 640.82, made payable, as we have already mentioned, to Mr. and Mrs. Jezemski individually and Mr. Jezemski as administrator of his mother’s estate.</p>

The exception asserted by the banks is found in §3-405(1) (a) of the Uniform Commercial Code — Commercial Paper which provides: “(1) An indorsement by any person in the name of a named payee is effective if (a) an. impostor by use of the <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>mails or otherwise has induced the maker or drawer to issue the instrument to him or his confederate in the name of the payee; . . . .” The lower court found and the Title Company does not dispute that an impostor appeared before McAllister and DiBenedetto, impersonated Mr. Jezemski, and, in their presence, signed Mr. Jezemski’s name to the deed, bond and mortgage; that Mrs. Jezemski was a confederate of the impostor; that the drawer, Title Company, issued the check to Mrs. Jezemski naming her and Mr. Jezemski as payees; and that some person other than Mr. Jezemski indorsed his name on the check. In effect, the only argument made by the Title Company to prevent the applicability of §3-405(1) (a) is that the impostor, who admittedly played a part in the swindle, <em>did not “by use of the mails or otherwise” induce the Title Company </em>to issue the check within the meaning of §3-405 (l)(a).

Although one form of the doctrine had existed in Pennsylvania for at least fifty-three years before the adoption of the Commercial Code, see <em>The Land Title and Trust Company v. Northwestern National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/196/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="196 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="916771" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0230-01">196 Pa. 230</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.%20420" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="46 A. 420">46 Atl. 420</a> (1900), no case has been found which decided whether or not the pre-Code doctrine would have applied to the instant factual situation — when the impostor, rather than communicating directly with the drawer, brings his impersonation to bear upon the drawer through the medium of the representations of third persons upon whom the drawer relies, in part, in issuing the check. But, regardless of the pre-Code form of the impostor doctrine and its applicability to the in<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>stant factual situation, the matter must be decided by statutory construction and application of the impostor doctrine as it now appears in §3-405(1) (a) of the Code.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[202,502,1151,1230]]]'>Both the words of §3-405(1) (a) and the official Comment thereto leave no doubt that the impostor can induce the drawer to issue him or his confederate a check within the meaning of the section even though he does not carry out his impersonation before the very eyes of the drawer. Section 3-405(1) (a) says the inducement might be by “the mails or otherwise.” The Comment elaborates: “2. Subsection (1) (a) is new. It rejects decisions which distinguish between face-to-face imposture and imposture by mail and hold that where the parties deal by mail the dominant intent of the drawer is to deal with the name rather than with the person so that the resulting instrument may be negotiated only by indorsement of the payee whose name has been taken in vain. The result of the distinction has been under some prior law, to throw the loss in the mail imposture forward to a subsequent holder or to the drawee. Since the drawer believes the two to be one and the same, the two intentions cannot be separated, and the ‘dominant intent’ is a fiction. The position here taken is that the loss, regardless of the type of fraud which the particular impostor has committed, should fall upon the drawer.”</p>

Naturally, the Legislature could not have predicted and expressly included all the ingenious schemes designed and carried out by impostors for the purpose of defrauding the makers or drawers of negotiable instru<a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>ments. Something had to be left for the courts by way of statutory construction. For purposes of imposing the loss on one of two “innocent” parties, either the drawer who was defrauded or the drawee bank which paid out on a forged endorsement, we see no reason for distinguishing between the drawer who is duped by an impersonator communicating directly with him through the mails and a drawer who is duped by an impersonator communicating indirectly with him through third persons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Thus, both the language of the Code and common sense dictates that the drawer must suffer the loss in both instances.</p>

On the other hand, the Code does include a separate provision, §3-406, wherein the drawer’s or maker’s negligence is quite material to his right to recover.
