Later by stipulation, Browns reserved the right to challenge the propriety of raising the Statute of Frauds by preliminary objections under Pa.

It is to be noted that in <em>Leonard </em>the particular statute of frauds therein involved provided “no action shall be brought” upon an oral guaranty unless it be in writing or there be some written memorandum thereof signed by the party sought to be charged and, therefore, the provisions of the statute went to the right of the plaintiff to maintain the action. We have taken the same position in construing §4 of The Sales Act of May 19, 1915, P. L. 543, wherein the statute went to the right to bring any action: <em>American Products Co. v.

The importance of <em>Sferra, </em>so far as the present appeal is concerned, is that it construed the identical provision of the Statute of Frauds herein involved as not affecting the right of a plaintiff to maintain the action but simply affording a permissive defense to the defendant. In line with the intent in framing the Rules of Civil Procedure logically the Statute of Frauds embodied in §1 of the Act of 1772, supra, should be raised only under Rule 1030 and not under Rule 1017(b).

In the case at bar, Hahns signed a written agreement with the auctioneer which provided for and directed the sale of their realty (specifically described) at an auction sale to be held “without limit or reserve”. This agreement provided, inter alia, that the realty was to be sold to the highest bidder at this auction sale, that the auctioneer should act as Hahns’ “attorney-in-fact” to make, execute and deliver a contract of sale to the highest bidder and that Hahns would give the buyer a deed in accordance with the agreement entered into by them. When, under the authorization of Hahns and subject to the term of the sale agreed upon by them, in writing, the auctioneer knocked down the property to Browns as the highest bidder, an oral contract was then created for the sale of the realty. Although no written contract of sale was entered into because Hahns refused to fulfill the terms of the written agreement under which the realty was offered for sale, such written contract is not required by the Statute of Frauds. All that is required is a memorandum in writing signed by the parties to be charged which sufficiently indicates the terms of the contract and the property to be conveyed: Mason-Heflin <em>Coal Co. v.
