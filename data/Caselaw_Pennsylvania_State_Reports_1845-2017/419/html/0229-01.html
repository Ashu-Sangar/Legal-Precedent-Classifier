He testified that, immediately after the fall, he observed grape juice on his wife’s left shoe and on the floor where she had fallen and a grape skin about a half a foot from where she was sitting.

The court below succinctly summarized his testimony as follows: “From his experience, he stated lettuce leaves, grapes and cherries tended to fall on the store floor with more frequency than other items although other things such as bottles of jams and jellies, oranges, etc., also occasionally fell' to the floor. He testified grapes had fallen from the counter on numerous occasions and customers would either step on them or carts would be rolled over them and there would be black stains left on the floor of the store. He stated these stains were present on the floor by the counter where the grapes were displayed on many occasions during 1960 and until the accident in 1961. One of his duties was to keep the produce area clear of debris and he was under instructions when he was in the area if he saw anything on the floor to remove it and he did keep the floor clean. He also swept the floor and the floor was mopped.”</p>

The writer of this opinion prefers the old fashioned store where you go in and tell the clerk what you want and he goes and fetches it like a faithful dog returns to its master a thrown stick. But in the self-service stores, especially in the vast auditorium-sized ones, you must search for your desired purchase with the hunting, ferreting, probing, testing, scouting and, sometimes, the perils the arctic explorers confronted in seeking the Northwest Passage. The self-serving purchaser must push through aisles encumbered with wire baskets, traverse lanes of travel menaced by sacks of potatoes, maneuver over floors strewn with, and lubricated by, vegetables and fruits, all of which frequently make a tour through a supermarket resemble an obstacle course in a steeplechase.</p>

Martino were cruising through the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Supermarket in Easton with a shopping cart into which they had piled a cargo of various food-laden cans, they had picked up a supply of fresh fish and were now in search of lemons to go with the fish. Daniel T. Martino was piloting the conveyor, and his wife trailed after him, as they both scanned the towering groceries-crammed cliffsides of the passageways for the other supplies they sought. Unsuccessful up to this point in locating the lemons to go with the fish, Ruth J. Martino was suddenly felled by an underfoot assault of grapes. Now, the Martinos <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>were not looking for grapes, they had no need or desire to obtain grapes, but grapes is what they got, together with, on the part of Mrs. Martino, a broken leg.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[221,483,1147,204]]]'>The grapeshot which shattered Mrs. Martino’s leg came from the floor where vegetable and fruit had been crushed by the heels and the shopping carts of previous food-hunting customers.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[216,699,1151,794]]]'>How did the grapes get to the floor? The evidence was uncontradicted that masses of grapes were piled on a counter which was separated, by a cruising lane, from the scales where they were to be weighed. Patrons would pick up the grapes and carry them loosely to the scales. As there is often a slip between the cup and the lip, there was often a slip of grapes from their clusters as they were being carried across the passageway to the scales. For grapes to detach from their stems and splash to the floor was something the owners of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Supermarket could anticipate. In addition, the floor showed that grapes fell like dancing raindrops and painted the floor with radiating spots which could not have escaped the notice of the store owners.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.7",310,[213,1506,1150,527]]]'>Not only that, an employee of the Supermarket testified that the cascading of grapes was accompanied in the splashing serenade by falling cherries and winging lettuce leaves. Oranges also rolled into the aisles and, on occasion, bottles of jams and jellies contributed to the concert by falling from the shelves or from customers’ hands and bursting on the floor. Into this terrestrial niagara came the faith-abiding Martinos to enrich the coffers of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company.</p>

The husband’s hand or arm was nowhere near the grape counter because, as has been said, he was looking for lemons, not grapes. As if this assumption by the court did not sufficiently defy the evidence and common sense, it said further that the grape “could have been knocked off by the wife plaintiff as she fell.” Knocked off <em>ichat? </em>The Court here was mixed up in its order of events. Mrs. Martino fell because of the grapes <em>already on the floor. </em>How could Mrs. Martino knock off a grape (from <em>what </em>we do not know) <em>after </em>she fell and then have it <em>precede </em>the fall and thus become the cause of the fall?</p>

Not content with essaying into the realm of fanciful conjecture, the majority opinion plunges over the brink of wilful negation by asserting that “there is no evidence from which the jury might reach a conclusion as to the cause of the presence of the grape in the aisle.” As one reads the record one can almost smell the grapes on the floor and see how they got there. J. F. Burnett, Jr., clerk in the store, testified: “there were some items that tended to fall on the floor more than others. Q. What were those items? A. Oh, lettuce leaves, <em>grapes </em>and cherries. Q. Would you say that those three items fell on the floor more often than any other? A. Yes, I would think so. Q. I assume that you on occasion saw these items fall on the floor, is that correct? A. That’s correct. Q. Or you saw them on the floor? A. That’s right. Q. Now, was there anything that you can recall as indicating that <em>grapes </em>had fallen on the floor numerous times at the edge of this Counter ‘A’? A. Well, <em>grapes would fall there and people would either step on them or carts would be rolled over them, and there would be a black mark left on the floor.” </em>(Emphasis supplied)</p>

The jury could find here that the defendant company was flagrantly negligent in not stationing a clerk at the grape counter, in not warning customers not to drop grapes, in not putting up signs to notify patrons of the grapes on the floor, and in not having the floor swept at such intervals as to make it reasonably safe for customer traffic.</p>
