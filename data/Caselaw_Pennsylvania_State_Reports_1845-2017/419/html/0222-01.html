Baker entered into a written agreement with Raynard Christianson under the terms of which the latter gave Baker an option to purchase a 70 acre tract of land and improvements thereon situated in Butler County, a tract owned by Raynard Christianson and six other persons (Christian-sons). Baker agreed to pay “a sum to be agreed upon” when the option was exercised which sum was not to be in excess of $30,000. <em>No time for the exercise of this option was provided. </em>Raynard Christianson signed this agreement as an individual, but, written in long hand at the beginning of the agreement and interlined on the original agreement after Raynard Christianson’s name, the following statement appeared: “In his own right and as agent for the other owners”.</p>

    <p id="b298-4" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[206,435,1149,584]]]'>From Baker’s pleadings, it appears that, from the time of the option agreement until the institution of this action, the following took place: (1) Christian-sons requested Baker to exercise the option on December 30, 1940 ;<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> (2) Baker and Christiansons entered into three new leases for the property — December 31, 1941, March 8, 1946 and December 23, 1948 — in none of which leases was any reference made to the option agreement; (3) on June 28, 1948, Baker notified Raynard Christianson of his desire to exercise the option to purchase and to pay for the property $30,000.</p>

On November 13, 1951, Christian-sons filed preliminary objections which raised the following defenses: (a) the Statute of Frauds barred the action since the complaint did not aver that Raynard Christianson’s authority to act as agent for Christiansons was in writing; (b) laches; (c) that the option had expired before its exercise, a reasonable time having elapsed since the grant of the option. Approximately five and two-thirds years after filing of the preliminary objections, Baker filed an amended complaint averring, inter alia, that Christiansons had ratified Raynard Christianson’s action in executing leases and the option agreement “by accepting the rent<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>als paid under the terms of the [leases] and subsequently on Dee. 30, 1940, requested [Baker] to exercise the said option.” On August 2, 1957, preliminary objections were filed by Christiansons. These objections, in addition to raising the defenses raised to the original complaint, averred (a) that there was no integration of the option agreement with the various leases and (b) that there could not be specific performance against Baynard Christianson unless it could be ordered against all the Christiansons.</p>
    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[137,887,1152,476]]]'>The preliminary objections were heard by President Judge Shumaker. After argument, on September 23, 1958, President Judge Shumaker overruled the preliminary objections stating, however, that the court did not pass on the merits of Christiansons’ position taken in the objections but considered that the matters raised were “matters of defense” to be disposed of “in disposing of the entire case on its merits”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Christiansons then answered the amended complaint.</p>

    <p id="b300-4" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[206,503,1151,1383]]]'>The rationale of Judge Kiester’s decree is: (1) that to permit an amendment of Baker’s complaint to aver the theory of possession and substantial improvements would constitute the introduction of an entirely new cause of action and to grant such amendment “after nearly thirteen years, with the delay, the death and change of counsel for [Christiansons] and the possibility of other prejudicial factors” would be an abuse of judicial discretion, Baker having been guilty of laches in-pleading this new cause of action; (2) in the absence of a provision for a specific time in the option agreement within which the option was to be exercised by Baker, the exercise of the option must take place “within a reasonable time” and the fact, <em>established by Baker’s pleading, </em>that more than nine and one-half years elapsed between the grant of and the alleged exercise of the option clearly indicates that Baker did not act “within a reasonable time” and, therefore, by June 28, 1948, the option had expired and could not be exercised; (3) that, even if the option had not expired prior to June 28, 1948, and, even if Baker did exercise the option on such date, the failure of Baker to take any legal action to enforce his rights under the option agreement for nearly three years after renewal of the leases constituted an abandonment of Baker’s cause of action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[117,1034,1153,696]]]'>In support of his claim that the delay or laches can be refuted, Baker points to some language in the opinion of President Judge Shumaker which indicated that the delay was harming neither Baker nor Christiansons and that neither party was pressing for an adjudication of their rights. What President Judge Shumaker was excusing, if at all, was delay <em>after </em>institution of the action, whereas the delay upon which Judge Kiester bottomed his ruling was Baker’s delay <em>prior </em>to the institution of the action in asserting his rights both to exercise the option and to enforce exercise of the option. Baker can find no solace on this score in President Judge Shumaker’s opinion.</p>

Insofar as presently pertinent, Baker avers: <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>(1) the grant of an option to purchase the property on <em>December 10, 1938; </em>(2) the exercise of such option on <em>June 28, 1948; </em>(3) an execution of two leases for the property — October 1 and October 10, 1938 — “as part of the same transaction” as the execution of the grant of the option; (4) renewals of these leases on December 31, 1941, March 8, 1946, and <em>December 23, 1948; </em>(5) a request by the optionors addressed to the optionees on <em>December 30, 1940 </em>to exercise the option. From a scrutiny of such averments and of the leases and the option agreement, attached to the complaint, certain conclusions are inevitable: (1) there was absolutely <em>no integration </em>of the 1938 leases or any subsequent lease with the option agreement; (2) there is a complete absence of any <em>fixed </em>time within which Baker was required to exercise the option to purchase; (3) even if the optionors did request Baker to exercise the option, Baker <em>delayed for 7-1/2 </em>years subsequent to such request before exercising such option; (4) Baker <em>delayed for </em>over 9-% years in exercising the option after its grant; (5) that, even after having exercised the option, Baker, six months thereafter, entered into a new lease for the property.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[221,1576,1149,743]],["BL_303.1",303,[114,338,1150,151]]]'>In the absence of any time designated for the exercise of an option to purchase land, the option must be exercised within a reasonable time considering all the circumstances: <em>Barr v.

Baker urges that what is a reasonable time is a question of fact to be decided only after a hearing. While that may be so under some circumstances, yet where, as in the case at bar, accepting <em>as facts </em>Baker’s own averments, it is inescapably clear from the pleadings that the option to purchase was not exercised in a reasonable time, such question may and should be resolved on the pleadings. Baker’s own pleading of facts indicates beyond any question that he did not, with reasonable timeliness, exercise <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>tbe rights granted him under the option agreement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> and that such option had terminated by the time he sought to exercise it.</p>
