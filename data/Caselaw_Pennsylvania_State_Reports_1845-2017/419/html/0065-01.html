In support of its preliminary objections, the New York corporation submitted an affidavit by its .executive vice-president setting forth that the New York corporation was organized in New York, was not licensed nor registered to do <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>business in Pennsylvania, had never filed tax returns nor paid taxes in Pennsylvania, owned the capital stock of the Pennsylvania corporation, but did not operate or control the latter’s business, filed state and federal taxes separately from its subsidiary, maintained separate minutes and bank accounts and conducted separate meetings, all outside of Pennsylvania.</p>

Ct. 250</a>. Cannon sued Cudahy Packing Company, a Maine corporation, in North Carolina. Service of process was made in North Carolina upon Cudahy Packing Company of Alabama, a subsidiary of the Maine corporation. To show the Maine corporation was doing business in North Carolina, Cannon sought to show the identity pro hac vice between the Maine and Alabama corporations. The Maine corporation owned all the capital stock of the Alabama corporation and “the [Maine corporation] dominate[d] the Alabama corporation, immediately and completely”; the Alabama corporation marketed the products of the Maine corporation not as agent but as a subsidiary and bought such products from the Maine corporation and sold such products to dealers. Each corporation maintained its corporate identity separately and distinctly. The United States Supreme Court, speaking through the late Mr. Justice Brandeis, refused to ignore the corporate existence, carefully maintained, in determining the existence of jurisdiction and set aside the service made on the subsidiary corporation, stating, inter alia: “Such use of a subsidiary does not subject the parent corporation to the jurisdiction” of North Carolina and “The corporate separation, though perhaps merely formal, was real. It was not pure fiction” (267 U.S. at p. 337). See also: <em>Cons. Textile Corp. v.
