    <p id="b634-4" data-blocks='[["BL_634.5",634,[175,568,1147,306]]]'>Barbara Eve Schwartz filed this equity action against her mother, Bertha Schwartz, and the Association, seeking to establish her title to and ownership of a certain savings account held by the Association and entitled “Bertha Schwartz in trust for Barbara Schwartz.”</p>
    <p id="b634-5" data-blocks='[["BL_634.6",634,[172,893,1151,1023]]]'>At the hearing on the rule for a preliminary injunction, the sole testimony was that of Barbara Eve Schwartz who testified: that in 1948, when she was then six years of age, her mother, Bertha Schwartz, took her to the Association’s place of business and her mother deposited $22 in an account, stating that she was opening a savings account for her; that various sums which were received by her from relatives on her birthdays, holidays and at graduation time were the source of other deposits; that, on one occasion, she deposited the sum of $1,000 in this account which money she had received from her grandmother; that she had accumulated savings of $900 which she had deposited in an account in the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, and she transferred the moneys in that account to the account in question; that the only withdrawal was in the amount of $2,300 which she had loaned to her mother for use in the latter’s business, a sum later repaid in installments with interest.</p>

By suggestion filed pursuant to Pa. R. C. P. 1032(2), Bertha Schwartz questions the jurisdiction of the common pleas court in this <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>equity action. In three separate rulings the court below held that equity does have jurisdiction over the subject matter, the last of such rulings being, made on February 1, 1965. On March 31, 1965 — 58 days after the final ruling was made — Bertha Schwartz filed the present appeal.</p>

L. 23, 12 P.S. §672, to obtain review of the lower court’s decision that jurisdiction was not lacking as to this subject matter, must be quashed as having been taken out of time. For this reason, we' need not pass on the merits of the contention that jurisdiction lies exclusively in the Orphans’ Court.</p>
