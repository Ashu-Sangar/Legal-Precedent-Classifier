    <p id="b616-11" data-blocks='[["BL_616.18",616,[215,1538,1153,644]]]'>The plaintiff and the defendants entered into a contract whereby the plaintiff was to exercise exclusively the right to locate and remove coal from the surface of lands owned by the defendants and to sell their findings to the defendants. After several weeks’ performance under the contract, the defendants notified the plaintiff to cease operation as they intended to do the work themselves. The plaintiff filed a complaint in equity asking that the defendants be compelled to live up to the terms of the agreement, that they be restrained from interfering with the plaintiff and be required to pay for coal already mined in their behalf.</p>

    <p id="b617-4" data-blocks='[["BL_617.5",617,[157,431,1152,428]]]'>The court below held that the demurrer could not be sustained because the facts as pleaded in the complaint took the case out of the statute of frauds <em>(Klingensmith v.

As to the adequate remedy at law the court said that “the primary purpose of the plaintiffs complaint was to seek equitable injunctive relief with an incidental request for money damage.”</p>
    <p id="b617-5" data-blocks='[["BL_617.6",617,[152,871,1155,916]]]'>The defendants appealed to this Court, limiting the appeal to the propriety of the court’s overruling their “Objection of Adequacy of Eemedy at Law,” their contention being that a substantial dispute as to a legal right to property was involved and it should be determined in a court of law. However, a dismissal of preliminary objections on the ground that there is an adequacy of remedy at law is not appealable. We stated in <em>Dozor Agency v. Rosenberg, </em><a href="/pa/403/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="403 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1299506" data-case-paths="/pa/403/0237-01">403 Pa. 237</a>: “However, generally speaking, an Order overruling preliminary objections is interlocutory and not appealable: Grosso v.
