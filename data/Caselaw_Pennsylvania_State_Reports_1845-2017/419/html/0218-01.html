The petitioner alleges: (1) that he was denied due process of law when he was arrested and confined in three different jails, where he was denied the right to call an attorney to determine why he was being held; (2) that he was held illegally for twelve full days, tortured, coerced, and denied the right to <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>liave an attorney; (3) that he was denied the right to have counsel during the preliminary hearing before a magistrate; (4) that the police questioned him without an attorney at three different police stations.</p>
    <p id="b294-4" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[198,553,1152,742]]]'>The record discloses that the petitioner was brought to trial December 6, 1948, at which time he was represented by counsel. At the trial of his case, disc recordings of statements made by the petitioner to the police were played to the jury and offered as evidence. Stenographic transcriptions of the recordings, signed by the defendant, were offered into evidence. The introduction of both the disc recordings and the signed statements were objected to by counsel for the defendant on the grounds that the statements were made without benefit of counsel and were obtained through coercion. As was the practice at the time, the issue of the voluntariness of the confessions was submitted to the jury and the jury found the defendant guilty.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[194,1305,1151,691]]]'>Appellant’s contention that he has been denied due process of law because he was without counsel at the preliminary hearing before the magistrate is without merit. As this court has said on many occasions, the preliminary hearing in Pennsylvania is not a critical stage in a criminal procedure, when none of the proceedings in the preliminary hearing were introduced at the trial. <em>Com. ex rel.

Therefore, we conclude that the lower court should hold a hearing to determine whether or not the incriminat-. ing statements made by Shaffer had been voluntarily given. It should be noted in this light that when a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleges an issue which, if proven, would be grounds for the granting of the writ, a hearing must be held to determine the validity of petitioner’s allegation.
