After nominating executrices, he signed his name in the testimonium clause after the words “In witness whereof, I”. This Court held that said instrument was not Glace’s will since it did not comply with section 2 of the Wills Act. The Court pertinently said (pages 94-96) : “The language of the Statute could not be clearer; to constitute a valid will, the writing must be signed by the testator <em>at the end thereof </em>— any exceptions, modifications or ‘ifs ands or buts’ would not only erode but would soon make the statutory requirement meaningless.</p>

Even if the testamentary intention of this particular testatrix is frustrated, it is much wiser to refrain from weakening the sound and well established mandate of the legislature.
