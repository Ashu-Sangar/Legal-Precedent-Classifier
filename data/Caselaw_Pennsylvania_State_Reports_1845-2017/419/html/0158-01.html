Before then, she operated the store together with her husband. As the Superior Court stated, “The only other specialized training that Mrs. Cobosco has ever had was as an elementary school teacher; but since she taught school lor only four years about twenty-eight years ago and has neither a college degree nor a teaching certificate, she is not now qualified in that field.” <em>Cobosco v.

These duties necessitated both mental and physical efforts, the latter including the driving of a car, going up and down a ladder, and the handling of items varying in weight from light to very heavy. Up to her injury on October 29, 1960, Mrs. Cobosco performed these duties almost entirely by herself, eight to ten hours a day, six days a week. The only assistance she had was from her son who made occasional deliveries and someone who handled the heavier items.</p>

Also, the jury could have reasonably found from the evidence that, for the period in question, Mrs. Cobosco could not drive a car, could not walk without a cane, could not climb steps, could not stand on her feet for long periods of time, and could not perform any strenuous physical work. The jury could have reasonably found further that, for the period in question, Mrs. Cobosco could attend to the duties of the store to the following extent only: she could come to the store on three days of the week, on each of these days she could remain there for one to three periods lasting from twenty minutes to one hour, during which time she could do light selling, dictate policy, and supervise others. Also, it is undisputed that most of what Mrs. Cobosco formerly did by herself is now done by others, her mother, sister, and son, particularly her son.</p>

    <p id="b237-4" data-blocks='[["BL_237.6",237,[126,1800,1150,362]]]'>This provision necessitates two main inquiries.

For example, in <em>Cooper v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/317/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="317 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="8846033" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0405-01">317 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.%2043" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="177 A. 43">177 Atl. 43</a> (1935), a clause which required total disability to engage “ ‘ in any and every occupation of employment for wage or profit’ ” was construed to mean “any occupation which the insured might be ordinarily capable of performing.” We said: “While the words of the policy must receive reasonable construction and, literally interpreted, the words total disability to engage ‘in any and every occupation of employment for wage or profit’ would require that an insured be a helpless invalid before he would be entitled to benefits under the policy, this cannot be what the parties intended. It is rare that any man is incapacitated from doing some work; many a blind man weaves baskets; a man with both legs and one arm off can sit in a doorway and sell lead pencils . . . but it cannot well be argued that either is not totally disabled.” Id., p. 408. <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>Similarly, it has been rightly held that “an insurance company cannot conjure up some imaginary occupation for its insured and defend upon the phantasy of its own creation. . . .” <em>Moskowitz v.

    <p id="b239-3" data-blocks='[["BL_239.5",239,[125,665,1154,854]]]'>It is clear that, in order to recover, Mrs. Cobosco had to show total disability only with respect to her occupation as a “hardware merchant.” This follows, not from the fact that she so stated her occupation in her insurance application, or that the parties intended to insure her in that occupation regardless of her ability to perform other occupations, but from a consideration of the evidence set forth above in light of the relevant contract clause and pertinent case law. Moreover, if the evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that Mrs. Cobosco is totally disabled from being a hardware merchant in connection with a store owned by her, then it also reasonably supports the conclusion that she is totally disabled from performing such occupation in connection with a hardware store owned by someone else.</p>
    <p id="b239-4" data-blocks='[["BL_239.6",239,[120,1533,1155,806]],["BL_240.1",240,[214,339,1152,1502]]]'>Thus, we turn to the second inquiry, which, in light of the foregoing, may be phrased: What degree of inability to operate her hardware store must Mrs. Cobosco show in order to be considered “totally disabled” ? The contract itself provides that “total disability” means “inability of the insured to perform duties,” of the occupation under consideration, <em>i.e., </em>the operation of the hardware store. We have consistently refused to attribute an unreasonable intent to the parties by construing such clauses to mean that an insured could not recover “total disability” benefits if he were able to participate in the occupation under consideration only in the slightest degree, regardless of its insignificance in relation to the occupation as a whole. Accordingly, irrespective of the literal meaning of such <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>clauses, an insured is not “barred from recovery because he may be able to perform a few trivial and desultory acts or light work of a limited character and at irregular intervals. . . .” <em>Pearlman v.

On the other hand, it is also well established that the inability of the insured to personally do everything required in carrying on the occupation, or do all things he did before his disability, or do the things he did before in precisely the same manner does not ipso facto establish “total disability.” <em>Moshowitz v.

Also, considering the total operation of the store it is clear that mental efforts, especially the exercise of “hardware business” judgment constitute an important part of the opera<a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>tion and, therefore, Mrs. Coboseo is not totally disabled merely because she cannot perform any or most of the physical work required. However, the jury might reasonably have found that in order to usefully contribute her mental efforts Mrs. Coboseo had to be present in the store so that she could directly supervise and dictate policy to others, and that the amount of time Mrs. Coboseo was able to be present in the store during the period in question was not great enough to make her contribution substantial and important in relation to the total amount and character of the work required to carry on the business. Thus, although they might reasonably have concluded otherwise, the jury’s conclusion that Mrs. Coboseo was totally disabled for the period in question cannot be considered unreasonable as a matter of law. Accordingly, the insurance company was not entitled to a judgment n.o.v. Cf. <em>Manzi v. Provident Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>supra.</p>
    <p id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.5",243,[135,1303,1154,1019]],["BL_244.1",244,[197,330,1149,1124]]]'>The insurance company has argued that we should consider the substantiality and importance of Mrs. Cobosco’s efforts only in relation to the duties of supervising and managing the store rather than in relation to all the duties involved in the operation of the store. The argument is based upon the fact that, in her insurance application, Mrs. Coboseo noted her “duties” as “manager supervisory”. Even if we were to accept the insurance company’s argument, the jury might have reasonably concluded that the limited amount of time that she was able to spend in the store prevented Mrs. Coboseo from making a substantial and important contribution to the fulfillment of the duties of a manager and supervisor. Moreover, we do not agree with the insurance company’s argument. Mrs. Coboseo was insured against her inability to “perform duties of any gainful occupation for which [she] may be reasonably fitted by reason of training, experience and accomplishment,” which, under the facts of this case, means in<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>ability to perform duties of operating her hardware store. The occupation which Mrs. Cobosco noted in her insurance application was that of a “hardware merchant”. This occupation reasonably implies the whole range of duties included in the operation of the hardware store and not just “manager supervisory” duties. Cf. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of United States v. Bomar, </em><a href="/f2d/106/0640-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="106 F.2d 640" data-case-ids="1050538" data-case-paths="/f2d/106/0640-01">106 F. 2d 640</a> (6th Cir. 1939). Thus, both her occupation, in fact, and that stated in her policy includes more than manager supervisory duties. There was no allegation or proof that Mrs. Cobosco’s description of her duties was in any way “false and fraudulent” and, therefore, <em>Indovina v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em><a href="/pa/334/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="334 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="1190768" data-case-paths="/pa/334/0167-01">334 Pa. 167</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.2d%20556" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="5 A.2d 556">5 A. 2d 556</a> (1939), cited by the insurance company, is inapposite.

Under such circumstances we see no reason why Mrs. Cobosco’s disability should be determined in relation solely to the duties stated on her application rather than all the duties which were actually involved in her occupation.</p>
