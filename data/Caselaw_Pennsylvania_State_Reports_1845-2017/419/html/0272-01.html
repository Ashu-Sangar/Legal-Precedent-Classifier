Shaw, Jr., was desirous of vacating the premises under his lease which still had to August 31, 1960, to run. On information and belief, defendant is informed said John J. Shaw, Jr., engaged Richard B. Herman, as agent to rent the property. Roslyn Sailor, trading as Roslyn Sailor Boutique was obtained by Shaw or Herman as a sublessee and defendant authorized plaintiff to execute a lease to that effect. On October 16, 1959, a lease was executed by plaintiff on behalf of John J. Shaw, whereby Roslyn Sailor, trading as Roslyn Sailor Boutique was made sublessee for the remainder of the unexpired term of Shaw’s lease and which contained a printed provision that should the premises be sold to the lessee the principal would pay to plaintiff a commission of five (5%) percent. Said provision as to payment of commission should the premises be sold was entered into between plaintiff and his principal Shaw <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>and was not part of any understanding or agreement between plaintiff and defendant.” And, the appellant further avers in new matter: “10. . . . Through error and mistake the said printed form of the lease contained a clause<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which was not applicable to the arrangement made between the parties and should have been deleted before signing.” There was a similar averment in defendant’s answer: “4. . . .

There is no part of the lease agreement that would, under any conceivable notion, warrant this construction. The plain language of the provision for the payment of commission in the event of sale is to the contrary and unequivocal in its terms that a commission is due the agent, appellee, by the principal, appellant. The terms of this provision of the paragraph are unequivocal. The appellant, under the lease, had the right to make payment to the appellee in full of all claims on rental commission due under the lease. The appellee was compelled to accept payment in full of all commissions due on rentals when that provision was invoked by the appellant. The payment of the amount of commuted rental commission to which the appellee was entitled is not consideration for the release of the other claim for commission in the event of the sale of the property, particularly when the lease agreement does not provide for it to be such a release.</p>

Herman &amp; Company, Inc., hereunder, regardless of whether or not Principal shall have obligated himself to pay a commission on said sale to anyone else.” There are many cases on the subject of real estate commissions, and when brokers are entitled to a commission, and what the requirements are to entitle a broker to commissions. It would serve no purpose for us to review the long line of cases. It is only necessary for us to point out the specific language in the lease agreement to show in the instant case that the broker is entitled to his commission whether he was the procuring cause of the sale or not when that sale was made to persons encompassed within the provisions of the agreement. The plain language of the agreement cannot be ignored.</p>

It is expressly provided in Section 35 of the lease that the lease sets forth <em>'. . </em>. all the promises, agreements, conditions, and understandings between the <em>lessor </em>and <em>lessee </em>. . .’. Nowhere is there any statement that the lease constitutes an agreement between the lessor and the broker. It is apparent that the contention of the Appellee is hanging upon the thread of fine print in the seven page lease agreement wherein appears the words Tease and agreements’. The approval therein contained refers only to the lease agreement made between the landlord and the tenant which contains many clauses. . . .

In section 35 of the lease agreement, it is provided: “. . . all the promises, agreements, conditions and understandings between the lessor and lessee . . .”, and no reference is made to any agreement between the lessor, appellant, and the broker, appellee. In paragraph 37 (B) of the lease agreement it is provided: “In consideration of the services of Richard B.

Herman &amp; Company, Inc., as his agents to collect the rent due or to become due thereunder during the continuance of the same, or for any renewal or renewals thereof, and to deduct and retain five per cent (5%) of the amount collected each month, and for this purpose to retain possession of the lease during said period. . .

That this particular agreement is contained in the lease agreement between the lessor, appellant and lessee, Sailor, is neither unusual nor legally objectionable.

Otherwise, its existence cannot be rational!y explained. •There is no legal or logical reason for prohibiting the inclusion of such promise. It is a practical manner of handling an everyday business matter in an efficient and legally effective manner, avoiding the necessity of other separate contracts. The simple matter is that the lessor, appellant, adopts the lease agreement prepared by his agent with the lessee as his own contract with the agent. The adoption of the contract in clear, unambiguous language, under seal, for the purpose for which it was executed, cannot be denied. This situation is a fundamental problem in ordinary contract law. There are many instances in which a party not a signatory to the writing may recover on the instrument, e.g., a payee of a check or note, a grantee under a deed. In these instances, only the maker or grantor signs the writing. Here, the action is on appellant’s promise to pay commissions as determined by that portion of the lease agreement between appellant and lessee and signed under seal by appellant. He is the party to be charged, and his signature to that promise is sufficient.</p>

The incorporated lease may then be fairly viewed as an averment that appellee offered to secure the execution of a satisfactory lease agreement in consideration for certain commissions and that appellee accepted that offer by reason of his ratification of the lease agreement.</p>

There the cpiestion was whether the Ohio Statute of Frauds, requiring brokerage contracts to be in writing, was satisfied.

Also, “in that contract . . . there was a provision . . . that [defendant-principal] was to pay a commission to the plaintiff - [broker].” The court said: “The contract which was signed by the defendant-[principal] was not a contract with the plaintiff-[broker] but with Dales.” However, the writing was considered a sufficient memorandum under the Ohio Statute of Frauds.</p>

Again, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that we are confronted with a judgment on the pleadings; in his pleadings plaintiff rests solely on the allegation of the existence of a signed writing constituting a contract between plaintiff and defendant.

It needs no citation of authority to support the rule that an agent owes his principal a duty of loyalty and must deal with him in good faith. It also needs no citation of authority to support the agent’s right to engage in' arm’s length bargaining with his principal on the matter of his compensation. But an agent <em>cannot </em>wear both hats at once. An agent cannot rightly argue that in handing to his principal for his signature a document which on its face purports to be a lease, executed by him as agent for the principal, he is at the same <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>time offering to enter into an arm’s length contract regarding his fee. Plaintiff argues that handing such a document to his principal is “analogous to the plaintiff’s <em>saying </em>to the defendant: ‘If you will promise to pay me the commissions set forth in section 37 (B), this lease is yours.’ ” It is obvious that the mere act of handing such a document to the principal is very different from expressly and unequivocally calling the principal’s attention to the fact that the broker is bargaining about fees as was done in the <em>Smith, </em>case. An agent’s duty of loyalty and good faith ivould require him to do more than merely insert his offer in the main body of a lease agreement which he has obtained and signed as agent for his principal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> It might be quite reasonable to bind the principal with respect to promises made to the tenant in a lease which he has failed to read.
