The two children, aged nine and seven respectively, were at that time residing with their natural father, Edwin L. Hookey, Jr. (natural father), and his present wife, Catherine T. Hookey. Three days after the filing of the custody petition, the natural father — joined by his present wife — petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Delaware County for the adoption of the two children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> After a hearing, President Judge van Roden of the Orphans’ Court granted decrees of <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>adoption of each child in favor of the natural father and his present wife.

    <p id="b659-4" data-blocks='[["BL_659.5",659,[134,526,1152,485]]]'>The children’s natural parents were married on February 11, 1956, and, of that marriage, three children were born; only two of these children are involved in these proceedings, Christine born in June, 1956 and Katherine, born February, 1958. In the wake of persistent marital discord, the natural mother left the matrimonial domicile on October 21, 1962, and this marital discord finally led to a divorce which terminated the marriage on April 19, 1963.</p>
    <p id="b659-5" data-blocks='[["BL_659.6",659,[133,1020,1153,916]]]'>Immediately after the natural mother’s withdrawal from the marital home in 1962, Madeline M. Kelly, <em>maternal </em>grandmother of the children, at the natural father’s request, came to the marital home to take care of the children. Three weeks later, Mrs. Kelly, with the natural father’s permission, took Christine to live with her at her own home and, shortly thereafter, the other child, Katherine, joined them. The two children remained in Mrs. Kelly’s care for a period in excess of two years. For the major part of this time, the natural father financially supported the children and made regular biweekly visits to see them. During the same time, the natural mother failed to aid them financially, probably due to her own unemployment, but she did not see the children until the date of the hearing in this matter — April of 1965 — a period of approximately <em>2y2 </em>years.</p>

The court below found there was sufficient evidence to sustain a finding of “abandonment”; it is this finding which the natural mother challenges on these appeals.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.6",660,[218,952,1150,1185]]]'>The Adoption Law of Pennsylvania (Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, §2, as last amended by the Act of June 30, 1947, P.

In explanation of her action, the natural mother stated that she could not take the children, they were too much for her, she only wanted Eobert (the third child). Into the breach caused by the natural mother’s departure and to take care of these two children, then only 6 and 4 years of age, very significantly the natural father called upon the natural mother’s own mother and she took upon herself, with the natural father’s aid, the care of these young children. By her own admissions, the natural mother made no attempt to see or to communicate with these children until after the summer of 1963 and the natural mother has no recollection, during this period, of having sent presents or other mementos to the children, although Mrs. Kelly, the maternal grandmother, recalled the receipt of a present for the children at Christmastime, 1962. It is most sig<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>nificant of the attitude of the natural mother that from October, 1962 — when she left the matrimonial domicile —until April, 1965 — when the hearing took place— that the natural mother had not seen these children.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[224,583,1149,589]]]'>As to the events transpiring after the summer of 1963 the record is somewhat contradictory. The natural mother contends that attempts by her to see the children were thwarted by threats of the natural father to place the children in a “home” if she persisted in seeking to see the children. The natural father, in substance admitting such threats, maintained they were not indicative of that which he planned to do. Similarly, the natural mother contends that during this period she did send cards and other mementos to the children, a contention denied by the natural father.</p>
    <p id="b662-6" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[219,1183,1153,1131]]]'>Our study of this record reveals three facts as established beyond question: <em>first, </em>assuming the veracity of the recitation by the natural mother of attempts to see her children, no such attempts were made until after the summer of 1963, a period in excess of six months from the time the natural mother left the children in the matrimonial domicile; second, in April 1964, the natural mother voluntarily relinquished any rights to the custody of these children by not contesting the natural father’s petition for the custody of the children and by signing a consent to such custody; <em>third, </em>from the time of the separation of the natural parents until May 1964 — when the natural father remarried — the natural mother made no attempt to communicate with the natural father concerning the welfare and well-being of these children. It was not until the natural father’s remarriage and the natural mother acquired knowledge of his plan to bring the children into the new home he was sharing with his new wife that the natural mother communicated with him concerning the possibility of seeing the children.</p>

      <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>From our study of this record, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to sustain the finding of an abandonment. The natural mother very candidly admits that, from the time of separation in October of 1962 until sometime in the summer of 1963, she made no attempt whatsoever to see the children or to communicate with the natural father or the maternal grandmother concerning the well-being of the children. This period of time was in excess of the statutory time necessary to establish an abandonment. To abandon a child does not necessarily mean that the abandoning parent make any formal declaration to that effect, that she ignore entirely the child’s existence, or that such parent entirely forego <em>any </em>interest in its welfare and its whereabouts; it means that the parent, by conduct, has acquiesced in a termination of that close relationship which normally exists between parent and child and in the assumption by others of complete parental rights and responsibilities: <em>Conlon’s Adoption, </em><a href="/citations/?q=53%20Lack.Jur.%2065" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="53 Lack.Jur. 65">53 Lack. Jur. 65</a>; <em>Adoption of Toner, </em>27 Leh. L.J. 88. Abandonment requires an intent to escape parental responsibility and conduct in effectuation of such intent and does not require that the parent cease to feel any concern for the child’s interest: <em>Davies Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/353/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="353 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="466036" data-case-paths="/pa/353/0579-01">353 Pa. 579</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="46 A.2d 252">46 A. 2d 252</a>. The natural mother, by her failure to have anything to do with the children from October 1962 until, at the very minimum, the summer of 1963, certainly revealed a refusal on her part to accept any parental responsibility and a lack of even minimal parental interest in the children.</p>

In the case at bar, the record indicates that these children are now living with their natural father and stepmother who stand ready and willing to provide them with the love, affection and <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>guidance which their best interests and welfare require. The court below saw and heard the parties and, by its decrees, determined that not only has the natural mother abandoned these children but that the adoptions would be in the best interest of these children. There is nothing on this record which would justify a finding that the adoptions would not enhance and assure the welfare of these children; the contrary is amply evident from this record.</p>
