In 1958, appellee, Dorothy M.

This request! was refused by the township zoning officer for the reason that the land area was insufficient under the four acre zoning requirement and because no plan for a subdivision, of which this house was to be but a part, had been approved. In his letter of refusal dated April 27, 1962, the zoning officer advised National’s counsel that National could “appeal . . . [its] case for a variance” to the board of adjustment. Within five days after receiving the refusal, National’s attorney replied that National was taking an appeal to the board of adjustment “for a variance from the terms of the Ordinance.” A hearing was scheduled for June 15, 1962, but was postponed because the board of adjustment was unable to muster a quorum for the meeting.</p>

Although National notified the board of adjustment of its appeal within a week after the building permit was refused, it simply advised the board that it would seek a variance. Not until six months later was the board informed that the appeal would attack the constitutionality of the ordinance in general. For this reason, the township argues that the appeal was not taken until six months after the denial of the building permit and that such delay constituted an unreasonable amount of time. We can not accept appellants’ contention in this regard.</p>

Such an exercise of the police power, however, may, in applications of the ordinance to specific properties, impose upon the owner of such properties an “unnecessary hardship”. When so applied, the ordinance can not be termed a reasonable or constitutional exercise of the police power. To preserve the validity of the zoning ordinance in its application to the community in general, therefore, the variance provision of the enabling act functions as an “escape valve” so that when regulations which apply to all are unnecessarily burdensome to a few because of certain unique circumstances, a means of relief from the mandates of the ordinance is provided.

It can be understood, then, if a request for a variance is denied, indicating that there is nothing about petitioner’s land or his hardship that is any different than that of everyone else with land similarly zoned, then petitioner’s most logical next step is to attack the validity of the ordinance as it applies to everyone.

When the four acre restriction was imposed, the number of available building sites in “Sweetbriar” was reduced by 75% and the value of the land, under the most optimistic appraisal, fell to $175,000. The four acre minimum greatly restricts the marketability of this tract because, with fewer potential lots, the cost of improvements such as curbing, streets and other facilities is thus greater on each lot. In addition, each building lot being larger, the cost per lot is automatically increased. The desire of many buyers not to be burdened with the upkeep of a four acre lot also makes “Sweetbriar”, so restricted, less desirable. Although there was some evidence in the record that lots of four <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>acres or more could eventually be sold, it is clear that there is not a readily available market for such offerings.</p>

The remainder of the lots in the township utilize on-site sewage disposal.

While in full agreement with these goals, we are convinced that four acre minimum zoning does not achieve the creation of a greenbelt in its technical sense and, to the limited extent that open space is so preserved, such zoning as is here involved is not a permissible means to that end.</p>

We are unmoved by this <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>contention since it appears to be purely and simply a makeweight. First, an examination of the map of historical sites in the township demonstrates that the overwhelming majority of snch sites, located in areas of dense population, can hardly be provided with proper settings by four acre zoning elsewhere in the township. Appellants cite two main historic places of interest. One is the home of General Anthony Wayne, a Revolutionary War hero. It is significant to note, however, that the township supervisors placed the Wayne home in a district zoned for only two acre minimum lots. The second historic site is Old Swedes Church which is not located in the township but whose cemetery is. It appears that both the Wayne home and the church are surrounded by land to protect them.

Appellants denominate this goal as falling within the ambit of promoting the “general welfare”. Unfortunately, the concept of the general welfare defies meaningful capsule definition and constitutes an exceedingly difficult standard against which to test the validity of legislation. However, it must always be ascertained at the outset whether, in fact, it is the <em>public </em>welfare which is being benefited or whether, disguised as legislation for the public welfare, a zoning ordinance actually serves purely private interests.</p>

Of course, the fact that these houses are old makes them architecturally and historically interesting. But it does not justify the creation of a special setting for them. They are all privately owned; most are already surrounded by substantial land holdings which, if their owners so desire, serve as protection against being “fenced in” by new residential development. In addition, there is nothing about south Easttown which differentiates it from any other area in the southeastern section of Pennsylvania. Surely, no one would seriously maintain that the entire southeast corner of the state should be declared immune from further development on areas of less than four acres simply because there are many old homes located there.</p>

The question posed is whether the township can stand in the way of the natural forces which send our growing population into hitherto undeveloped areas in search of a comfortable place to live. We have concluded not. A zoning ordinance whose primary purpose is to prevent the entrance of newcomers in order to avoid future burdens, economic and otherwise, upon the administration of public services and facilities can not be held valid.

It. agreed to purchase this property in July, 1961. It is not bearing any of the expenses-of this litigation, and its only connection with it is permitting-its name to continue as the appellee — its agreement has expired and its deposit has been returned. Its counsel, who originally filed the appeal to the court of common pleas from the action of the board of adjustment, has withdrawn from the litigation. Counsel for the seller to National Land, after a delay of many months, pursued the appeal for a variance. The seller is paying the expenses of this litigation and is the only one with an equitable interest in the property. Dorothy Ennis, who also appears as an appellee, is simply a straw party employed in the office of the real owner’s counsel. <em>No one has any real plans to build anything on the property. </em>All that is really involved in this lengthy and costly litigation is the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance and this is being litigated in vacuo. We should not assume the role of giving an academic or advisory opinion. <em>Sgarlat v. Kingston, </em><a href="/pa/407/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="121" data-cite="407 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1307430" data-case-paths="/pa/407/0324-01">407 Pa. 324</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20A.2d%20769" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="180 A.2d 769">180 A. 2d 769</a> (1962) ; <em>Home Life Insurance Company v. Board of </em>Adjustment, <a href="/pa/393/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="393 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="1279553" data-case-paths="/pa/393/0447-01">393 Pa. 447</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=143%20A.2d%2021" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="143 A.2d 21">143 A. 2d 21</a> (1958). Another procedural defect is apparent — the appeal to the zoning board was taken more than six months after the decision of the zoning officer. While it is true that the appeal provisions of the ordinance do not designate a specific number of days during which an appeal may be taken, it is required that an appeal must be filed within a rea<a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>sonable period. Six months is an unreasonable time, being double the longest time permitting an appeal to this Court from a decision of the court of common pleas. In <em>Kravitz v. Zoning Board of </em>Adjustment, <a href="/pa/415/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="125" data-cite="415 Pa. 97" data-case-ids="1891897" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0097-01">415 Pa. 97</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=202%20A.2d%2064" class="citation" data-index="126" data-cite="202 A.2d 64">202 A. 2d 64</a> (1964), we held that an appeal from a zoning board of adjustment decision not taken within the prescribed period must be quashed. I would apply that rule to this litigation and require the court of common pleas to quash the appeal to the board of adjustment from the zoning officer.</p>
    <p id="b609-4" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[82,915,1157,853]]]'>Still another glaring defect in the procedural history of this litigation is the failure of the appellees to coinply with §1207-A (May 24, 1951, P. L. 370, §16) of The Second Class Township Code, 53 P.S. §66257, which provides that in townships where subdivision regulations have been adopted, no permit to erect a building may be issued until a subdivision plan has been approved. The effect of the majority opinion is to order the issuance of a building permit for a one acre lot in a subdivision not yet approved. This circumvents the township’s lawful regulations adopted pursuant to Art. XII-A of the Second Class Township Code and to that extent nullifies the Township Code. This procedural defect would also require the disposition of this litigation without proceeding to the constitutional question.</p>

The four acre restriction was not applied to the entire township, but was only one part of a three part class “A” <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>residential zoning enactment — one of four acres, one of two acres, and one of one acre. This zoning determination for type “A” residential properties included 3,297 acres of the 5,157 acre township and included 2,468 acres of undeveloped property for which no public sewage was available and which also included areas of poor natural drainage and varied stream pollution. It seems a reasonable and proper'exercise of the legislative function for the township commissioners to take what is comparatively a small area (3,297 acres), divide it into residential zones and restrict a certain number of the residential zones to four acre lots — some to two and some to one.</p>
    <p id="b610-4" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[256,1080,1147,420]]]'>Hence, I differ with the majority in three basic areas: (1) I would never get to the constitutional issue by the exercise of proper judicial restraint; (2) I would not permit this Court to become township supervisors and legislate a zoning law as it does, and (3) I would not hold a properly enacted zoning code to be unconstitutional when the only argument in support of so doing is the appellees’ loss of profits.</p>
