As such, be was charged by the Borough of Waynesburg with violations of its municipal ordinance (enacted annually in 1960, 1961, 1962 and 1963) imposing a mercantile tax for failure to file tbe annual mercantile tax return required by tbe ordinance. He was found guilty of the charge and apparently sentenced to pay a fine of $100.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.8",179,[139,866,1151,360]]]'>Van Scyoc then filed a petition for an appeal with the Court of Quarter Sessions of Greene County. Tbe appeal was allowed, and, following bearing, that court found Van Scyoc guilty despite bis contention that the cooperative association was exempt from the local tax because of its payment of corporate net income tax to the Commonwealth.</p>

Tbe decision of tbe Superior Court must be vacated, the judgment of tbe court of quarter sessions vacated and tbe case remanded to tbe latter court with instructions to dismiss Van Scyoc’s appeal. It is now the settled law of this Commonwealth that an action for violation of a municipal ordinance is civil in nature and that an appeal from a determination of guilt and a judgment imposing a penalty thereunder will lie only to tbe court of common pleas. <em>Commonwealth v.
