    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.6",279,[116,385,1154,1396]]]'>In <em>Monaco v. Montgomery Cab Co., </em><a href="/pa/417/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="417 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1894028" data-case-paths="/pa/417/0135-01">417 Pa. 135</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=208%20A.2d%20252" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="208 A.2d 252">208 A. 2d 252</a> (1965), we did indicate that under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure the exclusive method of raising a question of jurisdiction encompassing lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or lack of jurisdiction over the person is by preliminary objections in accordance with Pa. R.C.P. 1017. However, I think we should treat the answer to the petition for severance of the causes of action as a preliminary objection to the petition for severance and the amended complaint raising the jurisdiction of the lower court to entertain either the severance petition or the amended complaint. It is clear that by our decision in <em>Drummond v. Drummond, </em><a href="/pa/414/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="414 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1890407" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0548-01">414 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=200%20A.2d%20887" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="200 A.2d 887">200 A. 2d 887</a> (1964), we determined that the claims of the plaintiff to the real estate and the brokerage accounts were vacated. Thereby, we terminated these proceedings as far as those items were concerned in that particular action. Our indication that plaintiff could commence a separate action without prejudice was only protective of the rights of the plaintiff and did not give further vitality to the terminated proceedings. Hence, treating this matter as if Rule 1017 had been complied with and that a proper preliminary objection raising a question of jurisdiction had been filed, I would determine the issue in the appellant’s favor.</p>
