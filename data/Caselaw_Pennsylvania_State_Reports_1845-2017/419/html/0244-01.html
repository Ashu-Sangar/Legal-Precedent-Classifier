'The, bartender testified at the trial of petitioner for murder that at the time of the aforesaid conversation defendant “seemed sober to me.” On that same evening, viz., the evening of the shooting, petitioner admits that he freely told trooper Harold Yost — after he had been warned that he did not have to make a statement and that anything he said might be used against him— that he shot his wife and that he made the statement of his own free will. It is difficult to imagine a case where a confession was so spontaneous. His contentions will be disposed of hereinafter.</p>

For each of two reasons there is no merit in this contention. In the first place, a preliminary hearing in Pennsylvania does not purport or attempt to definitely determine the guilt of the accused, nor is he required to plead or speak or offer testimony in his defense. The magistrate at such a hearing merely determines whether a prima facie case has been made out which is legally sufficient to hold the accused for the grand jury. <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
