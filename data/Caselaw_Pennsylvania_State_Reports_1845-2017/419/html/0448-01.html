The testimony of the sole eyewitness to the prelude to the shooting contradicted appellant’s assertion that he had acted in response to Landi’s provocative conduct. Moreover, in response to appellant’s assertion that he had secured the gun merely to frighten Landi, it was established that appellant was considerably larger than his victim and had at one time been a prize fighter.

And, although two of appellant’s prior convictions involved crimes against the person, they were neither so strikingly uncommon or sufficiently similar to the offense charged as to create the danger present in <em>Johnson. </em>Moreover, we are not here confronted with a situation like that presented in <em>United States ex rel.
