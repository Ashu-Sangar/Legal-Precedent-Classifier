He contends, inter alia, that be was denied due process of law (1) when be was interrogated by the police in the absence of counsel; (2) when be was given a preliminary bearing before a magistrate without representation by counsel, and (3) when his confession, which was made when unrepresented by counsel, was admitted into evidence at his trial after be pleaded guilty <em>while represented by counsel.</em>

At the preliminary hearing, the Commonwealth merely attempts to make out a prima facie case for the purpose of having the accused held for a possible indictment of a crime by a grand jury. The defendant is not required to plead or make any statement. In the <em>Butler </em>case, the Court said (pages 324-325) : “In the absence of unusual circumstances which transform the proceeding into a critical stage, lack of counsel at preliminary hearing in this Commonwealth does not constitute a deprivation of due process. No such transformation occurred in the instant case.”</p>
