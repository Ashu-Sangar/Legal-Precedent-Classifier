Wolenski (Wolenski) , before a Delaware County magistrate, was charged with haying, on December 9, 1953, committed the murder of one Edward Gack. Shortly thereafter, Wolenski was committed to the Delaware County prison. The warden .of that prison petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County for the appointment of a commission to determine the mental ability of Wolenski to stand trial and the court appointed such a commission. The commission examined Wolenski and reported to the court that Wolenski was then insane and <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>of criminal tendency and recommended that he be committed to a mental institution. The court, acting upon the recommendation of the commission<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and in the exercise of its own discretion, on December 21, 1953, committed Wolenshi to Farview State Hospital where he has remained until the present time. Subsequent to his commitment Wolenski was indicted for murder by a Delaware County grand jury but, by reason of his mental condition, has never been brought to trial.</p>

Dr. Herskowitz examined Wolenski and made a written report to the court on August 26, 1964. In that report Dr. Herskowitz stated, inter alia: “This patient is an acutely disturbed individual who is overwhelmed by his environment and tends to become depressed. His attention is limited and he often goes off into irrelevancies. Perception is very narrow and has room for little else than the products of his delusion. He is litigious and would sue those associated with his murder victim because of their involvement in the plot against him.</p>

The statutory mandate for a hearing to determine the question of the mental condition of a patient occupying Wolenski’s status is dependent on three factors: (a) the <em>request </em>for an examination by an independent physician which request, subject to the time limitations of the statute, must be granted; (b) an <em>examination; </em>(c) after examination, an <em>opinion </em>in affidavit form, by the physician, <em>that the patient is not mentally ill. </em>Once these requirements have been satisfied, the court <em>must </em>hold a hearing and, at such hearing, those responsible for the patient’s continued hospitalization have the burden of proving the patient is mentally ill. Wolenski proceeded outside the statute and, under the circumstances, is not entitled, therefore, to a hearing.</p>
    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[131,1210,1153,681]]]'>However, we are fully cognizant of the fact that Wolenski, unversed in the law, was probably ignorant of the statute and its requirements. To meet such a situation the legislature wisely provided that the initiation of proceedings under the statute could be by a “person acting on [the patient’s] behalf.” In order that full justice might be done we suggest to the court that, in another proceeding under The Mental Health Act, supra, some person be appointed to act on Wolenski’s behalf and, if such person can secure a certification by a qualified physician that Wolenski is not now mentally ill, then a hearing should be held to determine Wolenski’s mental condition.</p>
