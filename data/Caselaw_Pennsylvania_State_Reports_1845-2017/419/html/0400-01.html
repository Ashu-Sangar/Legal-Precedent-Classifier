Were a candidate permitted to withdraw at any time prior to the election, party leaders may be tempted to contrive such belated withdrawals in order to secure the election of those who might otherwise be unable to withstand the exposure and public scrutiny of a more extended campaign. Were both major parties able to secure belated withdrawals from subservient candidates in the same election, then the public would be denied any meaningful choice in light of the possible lack of time for a thorough examination and consideration of the qualifications of the substituted candidates.</p>

If due to the intervention of some fortuitous <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>event, sucli as the death or disability of a strong opponent or a late tide of public attraction to a particular party label, the prospects for victory of one side are significantly improved, great pressure may now be brought to bear on the duly selected nominee to withdraw in favor of a less qualified person whom the party leaders may seek to reward. Unfortunately, these potential abuses are now realistic possibilities under the majority’s reading of the Pennsylvania Election Code.</p>
    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.5",484,[219,831,1154,1335]]]'>The majority seeks support from those cases which provide that the Election Code “must be liberally construed so as not to deprive an individual of his right to run for office, or the voters of their right to elect a candidate of their choice.” <em>Ross Nomination </em>Petition, <a href="/pa/411/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="411 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="1885986" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0045-01">411 Pa. 45</a>, 48, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20719" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="190 A.2d 719">190 A. 2d 719</a>, 720 (1963). Neither of these factual circumstances is present in the instant case. Moreover, I fear that the construction which the Court today adopts will promote over the long run neither of these objectives. Rather, it may well promote a complete disregard, under the guise of liberality, for all the time limitations in the code and thereby provide an unfair advantage to those who may seek to subvert the democratic process. By affording the opportunity for such maneuvering, this Court today denies the electorate that protection which the spirit of liberality was designed to afford. What the majority has done in effect is to nullify all the time limitations in the code without a full appreciation of the purposes for which many were provided. The majority justifies its construction of the filing requirement for withdrawal as directory as necessary to avoid an unreasonable result. In my view, such an approach is unfortunate in that no such result would obtain by requiring compliance with the explicit statutory command.</p>
