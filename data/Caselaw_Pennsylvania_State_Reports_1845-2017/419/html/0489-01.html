In connection with this contract claimant executed a waiver of mechanics’ liens containing a warrant of attorney.

An affidavit of defense was filed, asserting, inter alia, the waiver agreement. After a pretrial conference the parties agreed to a trial before a judge without a jury. Thereafter, an attorney who had not theretofore appeared on behalf of either party exercised the warrant of attorney contained in the waiver by entering his appearance on claimant’s behalf and marking the mechanic’s lien satisfied. In its opinion, the lower court stated that this attorney acted at the instance of a title company. It is the action of this attorney which the lower court refused to expunge from the record.

While it is not clear whether the party who caused the exercise of the warrant of attorney had an interest in the property or proceedings sufficient under the statute to support its defending the assertion of the lien, see <em>Pagnacco v.

Claimant’s lien was filed September 9, 1963, and, therefore, is not regulated by the 1963 Law, except insofar as Article VII of said Act is applicable. Article VII directs the Supreme Court to promulgate Rules of Civil Procedure to govern “practice and procedure to obtain judgment upon a claim filed.” Pursuant to this directive Pa. R.C.P. 1651-1660 were promulgated. Neither Article VII nor the Rules became effective until January 1, 1964.
