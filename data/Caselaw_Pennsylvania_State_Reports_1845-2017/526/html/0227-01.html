      <em>Rivera </em>and <em>Auresto </em>thus dealt with two different issues under the RUA. The focus in <em>Rivera </em>was on the meaning of the word “land” in the RUA statute, while the focus in <em>Auresto </em>was on the distinction between private and public landowners. In the case now before us, we are asked to determine whether a municipality should be immune for injuries sustained by a youth using a public basketball court. Clearly, the instant case contains elements present' in both <em>Rivera </em>and <em>Auresto, </em>but requires us to go one step further in the analysis of the RUA.

Philadelphia Theological Seminary of St. Charles Borromeo, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/510/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="510 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1796969" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0001-01">510 Pa. 1</a>, 27, <a href="/pa/510/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="510 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1796969" data-case-paths="/pa/510/0001-01">507 A.2d 1</a>, (1986) (Nix, C.J., dissenting), from immunity. As I stated in <em>Rivera, </em>no basis exists in the RUA for an exclusion for improved land. The language of the statute expressly provides that “an owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangeroüs condition, use, structure, or activity on such premises to persons entering for such purposes.” 68 P.S. § 477-3. “Land” by definition includes the buildings and structures thereon. 68 P.S. § 477-2.</p>

Conversely, the Guerin Recreational Center is open to the public without restriction. Certainly this is the type of land use the Act was designed to encourage. Any interpretation of the Act which, denies the City immunity under these circumstances serves no function other than to frustrate the purpose of the RUA, which is “to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability____” 68 P.S. § 477-1.</p>

The first reason concerns the statement contained in footnote 3, which recites that the appellee, City of Philadelphia, waived the defense of immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8542. Recently in <em>In re Tax Claim Unit of Northampton County, </em><a href="/pa/522/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="522 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1818920" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0230-01">522 Pa. 230</a>, <a href="/pa/522/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="522 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1818920" data-case-paths="/pa/522/0230-01">560 A.2d 1388</a> (1989) this court determined that the defense of governmental immunity was a defense incapable of waiver. Here, although the claim arguably fell within one of the exceptions to that immunity, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8542(b)(3), the above referred to statement is in sharp contravention to our prior assessment of the law in that area. Secondly, a plain reading of the Recreational Use Act does not support the majority’s interpretation that the act was intended only to apply to owners of unimproved realty. In fact in the definition of land, as contained in the act, the term “land” was stated to include: roads; water; watercourses; private ways and buildings; structures and machinery or equipment when attached to the realty. 68 P.S. § 477-2(1). Clearly the inclusion of these items belies the majority’s conclusion that only owners of unimproved realty are protected. To so hold is to ignore the spirit of the legislature which in enacting the statute “balanced danger against a benefit to a great number of people; allowing a use of facilities with immunity from liability, great and <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>small, so that many could have what the possible consequences for an injury to one, would make improvident to give to any.” <em>Rivera v.
