The Petition for Review was granted limited to the construction of 42 Pa.C.S. § 7101 in the context of this case.</p>
    <p id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.8",537,[190,916,1153,424]]]'>Appellant, Sammie Walker, purchased a used 1980 Buick from Appellees in 1982. Five months later, while driving the car on a rainy day, Appellant failed to negotiate a right-hand curve and struck a tree on the opposite side of the highway. He and his passenger brother were injured in the crash. He brought this action against Appellees alleging a failure of the car’s braking system under a strict-liability theory.</p>
    <p id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.9",537,[190,1367,1153,313]]]'>While in the hospital emergency room, Appellant gave a statement to an investigating officer in which he stated that he had, "... probably skidded on some wet leaves.” A <em>motion in limine </em>was made to exclude the statement as barred by the provision of 42 Pa.C.S. § 7101 which provides in pertinent part:</p>
    <blockquote id="b537-9" data-blocks='[["BL_537.10",537,[233,1700,380,41]]]'>(a) General Rule.—</blockquote>

    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[267,758,1155,584]]]'>The trial court admitted the officer’s testimony as to Appellant’s statement. The trial court reasoned that since the officer was not enumerated as a prohibited person in subparagraph (a)(l)(iii) of the section, and since the statement was not made to be used for negotiating a settlement or obtaining a release, it was admissible in evidence. The Superior Court affirmed, but concluded that the omission of the words, “for use in negotiating a settlement or obtaining a release,” in subparagraph (2) was a mere legislative oversight and construed the legislature’s intention to prevent overreaching by insurance adjustors only.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.5",538,[266,1365,1153,420]]]'>The meaning of the two sections seems plain enough and needs no statutory construction to determine the legislative intent. Each subsection sets forth a general rule. Subsection (a)(1) prohibits <em>persons </em>with an adverse interest from negotiating, obtaining releases or taking oral or written statements. Subsection (a)(2) prohibits use of any <em>statement </em>taken from an injured person except those taken in accordance with the provision of the act (not here at issue).</p>
