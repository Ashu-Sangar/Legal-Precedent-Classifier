Moreover, DOH never informed appellant that HHS considered its termination of appellant from the Medicare program (participation in which was essential to participation in the Medical Assistance program) in February of 1984 to be irrevocable; and appellant fully complied with the terms of the settlement agreement, which compliance DOH had led appellant to believe would result in appellant’s continued participation in the Medical Assistance program.
