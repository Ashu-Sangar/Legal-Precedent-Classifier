What happened was that neither civilian was injured because each jumped out of the street and disappeared from view behind a parked truck. The Granada then appeared to head for Officer Tangradi who was by then near the corner of Venango and Livingston Streets. The Granada came to a stop on Venango Street, backed up and started north on Livingston Street. Lt.

      <blockquote id="b405-12" data-blocks='[["BL_405.13",405,[271,2030,1085,155]]]'>D. Shooting at a vehicle is considered the used of deadly force, and is only justified if the vehicle or its occupants present an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury. Shooting at a vehicle or its occupants merely to prevent flight is not justified at any time.</blockquote>

It should be noted that <em>two hours </em>passed between the time of the shooting and the time the forensic team found the first shell casing. With the excitement and the number of people milling about, it is <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>entirely possible that those shell casings were no longer in their original resting place by the time they were found. In any event, the physical evidence is contradicted by the testimonial evidence. Since the arbitrator did not find <em>all </em>the witnesses not credible, it was an abuse of his discretion to disregard <em>all </em>their testimony. There was not a scintilla of testimonial evidence that Officer Bojanowski ran down the street, chasing the vehicle and firing at it.</p>
