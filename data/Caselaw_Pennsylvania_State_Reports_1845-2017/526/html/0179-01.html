Before us, the appellant raises two issues: (1) whether the trial court exceeded its scope of review in vacating the award and (2) if the trial court did not, whether the trial court erred in vacating the arbitration award granting uninsured motorists benefits under the Motor Vehicle Fi<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>nancial Responsibility Law. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1701.

    <p id="b273-5" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[237,473,1154,1184]]]'>The underlying facts are not in dispute. The appellant is a police officer for Darby Township. On October 5, 1986, while driving a vehicle owned by the Township and insured by the appellee, the appellant’s vehicle was struck by an uninsured motorist. As the result of this collision, the appellant suffered personal injuries. At the time of the collision, the appellant was acting within the scope of his employment as a Darby Township Police Officer and therefore received both Workmen’s Compensation and Heart and Lung Benefits. Since neither the appellant nor any member of his household owned a vehicle, the appellant filed a claim for uninsured motorists benefits with his employer’s insurance carrier, Appellee. The appellee denied the claim resulting in the appellant requesting arbitration under the Township’s insurance policy in accordance with the Pennsylvania Uniform Arbitration Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7301 et seq. The arbitration panel awarded $15,000.00 to appellant. Appellee then filed a Petition to Vacate the Award with the Court of Common Pleas, which was granted. Appellant filed an appeal with the Superior Court which affirmed <a href="/pa-super/382/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="382 Pa.

Instead, the exclusive remedy was the Workmen’s Compensation Act because no intent to the contrary had been expressed by the legislature.</p>
