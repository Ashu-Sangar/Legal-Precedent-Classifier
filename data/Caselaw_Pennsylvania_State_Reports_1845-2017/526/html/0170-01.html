    <p id="b264-9" data-blocks='[["BL_264.8",264,[230,1026,1156,796]]]'>According to Appellant’s Amended Complaint, Appellees, John A. and R. Carole Zentek, submitted an application for a building permit to the City of Monongahela and its City Engineer. The application sought permission to build a “lawn building — storage accessory use to a residence.” The application was approved and a building permit issued in May, 1980. There is no controversy over the propriety of these actions. However, contrary to the permitted use, the Zenteks constructed a carrier pigeon loft in the rear yard which housed numerous courier pigeons. This was clearly contrary to the permissible uses' in the zoning ordinance and this fact is not in issue. They also constructed an additional building which was not within the scope of the original building permit. Moreover, they failed to obtain a second building permit.</p>

Appellant then filed a complaint (subsequently amended) in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County alleging causes of action against the City, its officers, and against the Zenteks. The mandamus claim against the City and its officers (including the City Board of Appeals) was dismissed due to Appellant’s failure to exhaust its administrative and statutory remedies <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>under the Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. § 11001.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> That dismissal is not currently before us. The claim against the Zenteks which was in equity, however, was also dismissed under the rationale that the requested enforcement relief was the same as in the mandamus claim and that the response, therefore, should also be the same. The Commonwealth Court affirmed in a reported decision, Judge MacPhail dissenting, 113 Pa.Cmwlth. 292, <a href="/pa-commw/113/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="537 A.2d 73" data-case-ids="1369325" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/113/0292-01">537 A.2d 73</a>. In affirming, the Commonwealth Court briefly and summarily concluded that the equity claim against the Zenteks was properly dismissed because that Court thought that while couched in the form of a misrepresentation in a zoning application, Appellant was simply employing a device to do indirectly what it could not do directly, that is, it was attempting to use equity to adjudicate a zoning matter. The Commonwealth Court concluded that equity had no right to decide preliminarily or otherwise the validity of a zoning permit. This was clear error since the validity of the zoning permit was never in issue. The permit was properly issued for a proper purpose. The Zenteks ignored the permit and went on a binge of their own and built a structure not covered by the permit or authorized by the zoning ordinance. We granted allocatur (solely on the issue of whether the equity claim was properly dismissed) because the Commonwealth Court’s decision on this point appears contrary to our previous decisions, and because their reported opinion might confuse future litigants as to the proper procedure to pursue in order for neighbors to vindicate a blatant zoning violation. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.</p>

If one suffers an injury special and peculiar to one’s property, or a direct disturbance in the quiet enjoyment thereof, that person is entitled to maintain an injunction action against the continuance of the encroachment without application to the relevant authorities.

      <em>Burne v. Kearney </em>is instructive on the limits of the reach of equity: “as a prerequisite to the attachment of equity jurisdiction, the adjoining or neighboring property owner must aver — and later prove — that the alleged violation of the zoning ordinance has resulted in an injury not common to all the neighboring property owners but 'special and peculiar’ to his property.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="225 A.2d 892">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/424/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="424 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1904935" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0029-01">424 Pa. at 32</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="225 A.2d 892">225 A.2d at 894</a>. Further, “diminution in value of a property per se, does not equate the requisite 'special and peculiar’ injury to property.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="225 A.2d 892">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/424/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="424 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="1904935" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0029-01">424 Pa. at </a>33 n. 4, <a href="/citations/?q=225%20A.2d%20892" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="225 A.2d 892">225 A.2d at </a>894 n. 4. Nothing in our <em>Leopardi </em>decision, quoted so extensively by the majority, necessitates or even suggests a change in this longstanding rule.
