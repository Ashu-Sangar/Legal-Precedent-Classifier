    <p id="b377-4" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[197,405,1158,945]]]'>Appellant, a construction contractor, was a general contractor on three public works projects<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> which were audited by the Prevailing Wage Division of the Department of Labor and Industry (Division) for compliance with the PWA. In 1986, the Division claimed that appellant had not paid prevailing wage rates to three (3) of the fifty-four (54) workers on these projects, Michael Matis, James Terrain and Terry Robinson. These three workers testified before a hearing examiner appointed by the Secretary at a hearing held on August 15, 1986. No representative of the appellant attended that hearing therefore another hearing was held before the hearing examiner on December 17, 1987. In this hearing the three workmen were cross-examined. Also testifying were Michael Leard, a field investigator for the Division, and Richard S. Fiore, appellant’s superintendent of all field construction. The Secretary eventually determined that appellant intentionally violated the PWA by failing to pay Robinson prevailing wage rates.</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[194,1369,1156,578]]]'>Robinson, who had worked for a five week period on the Student Apartments project, claimed that he had worked one hundred percent (100%) of the time as a carpenter but had been paid only at the laborer’s wage rate for all his hours of work. The prevailing minimum wage at the time of these projects was $13.58 per hour for a laborer and $18.28 per hour for a carpenter. The PWA provides that “Not less than the prevailing minimum wages as determined hereunder shall be paid to all workmen employed on public work.” 43 P.S. § 165-5. He worked 163 hours over the five week period and was underpaid $766.00.</p>

He never complained to any of the appellant’s corporate officials but instead complained to the Prevailing Wage Division of the Department of Labor and Industry after he was laid off.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[262,558,1155,577]]]'>Appellant contends that it did not violate the PWA because all of the carpenters who worked at the three public works projects also performed laborer tasks and therefore Robinson’s claim that he worked all of his hours as a carpenter must be disbelieved. Nevertheless, even crediting appellant’s argument as true, it remains uncontradicted that Robinson worked at least some or most of his hours as a carpenter and was paid entirely as a laborer. Therefore, it is ineluctable that appellant violated the requirement of paying prevailing wages. Whether appellant intentionally violated the PWA is another question.</p>

The Secretary determined that appellant intentionally violated the PWA because it was “aware” that Robinson worked solely as a carpenter and yet paid him a laborer’s wage. Additionally, in dismissing the appellant’s contention that its corporate officials were not “aware” of the misclassification of Robinson’s hours, the Secretary stated that appellant’s corporate officials were “being oblivious to the obvious____” <em>Citing Dale D.

This conclusion was based upon Richard S. Fiore’s explanation of appellant’s method of determining the wages to be paid to workmen. Appellant employed a job superintendent to “intermittently” observe the employees, record the tasks being performed, and estimate the time required to perform the task. The superintendent would then report this information to Richard S. Fiore on a weekly basis for classification and payroll purposes.</p>

It first argues that it neither had actual knowledge of the misclassification of Robinson nor was the misclassification so obvious that it should have been aware of the misclassification.

Fiore, who was ultimately responsible for the classification of each employee, testified that he was not aware of the misclassification. Appellant argues that it was reasonable to believe Richard Fiore because there is uncontradicted evidence of record that many employees on the project performed solely laborer work and therefore there was no reason to discover the superintendent’s mistake. The Hearing Examiner chose to believe Richard Fiore’s testimony as “logical, consistent, credible and persuasive.” The Secretary determined that Robinson was credible. However, Robinson did not testify that Fiore, or any other of appellant’s corporate officials, was aware of the misclassification of his hours and admitted that he never complained to the appellant. Therefore, there is no conflict in the credibility determinations of the Hearing Examiner and the Secretary as to Richard Fiore’s aware<a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>ness of the misclassification. Furthermore, since the Secretary did not reverse the Hearing Examiner’s finding that Richard Fiore testified credibly, but merely found Robinson to be credible as well, we must accept the Hearing Examiner’s credibility determination with regard to Richard Fiore’s awareness of the misclassification. See 1 Pa.Code § 35.206 which states that the report of a hearing examiner shall be examined as part of the whole record.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Therefore, all that is required is evidence that the contractor performed or failed to perform any act which it knew to be in disregard of workmen’s rights.

      <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>The Commonwealth Court determined that since Fiore testified that classifying an employee was a critical determination upon which he made the final decision, and because he did not break down the precise amount of time a worker spent at a particular task, but would instead round out the time to the nearest hour, that this was evidence of a knowing disregard of workers’ rights. However, this evidence is greatly outweighed by other evidence of record, and therefore, the determination of an intentional violation is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Kent v. Schweiker, </em><a href="/f2d/710/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="710 F.2d 110" data-case-ids="1866439" data-case-paths="/f2d/710/0110-01">710 F.2d 110</a> (3d Cir.1983).</p>

Michael Leard, the field investigator for the Division in this audit, testified that only the three workmen previously mentioned, of the fifty-four (54) workmen on the projects, complained about not being paid prevailing wage. These three men each admitted that they did not complain to the appellant. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that appellant’s method of rounding to the nearest hour the number of hours worked did not create a problem of which appellant was aware.</p>

In fact one of the three complaining workmen, James Termin, admitted that he performed 140 hours of “layout” work but was paid at the higher wage rate of a laborer.
