Subsequently, Appellees amended their complaint to include a count in mandamus to require the school board to seek an injunction to end the work stoppage. (Preliminary objections filed by both the Education Association and the School District were dismissed by the Court.)</p>

The trial court on March 8, 1989, refused to issue an injunction restraining the work stoppage, however, on the grounds that only the School District Board of Directors itself had standing to seek injunctive relief under Act 195, not Appellees who are students and parents of students. After a second hearing on April 12, 1989, (after the teachers had returned to work) the trial court, on June 9, 1989, entered its final Order merely declaring that the limited right to strike permitted by Act 195 was unconstitutional.</p>

Once the trial court held that Appellees had no standing to seek injunctive relief against the striking teachers, an issue not presently before us,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> it becomes moot whether, in the abstract, the teachers had a theoretical right to strike under our Constitution. It was unnecessary to reach the constitutional issue and by doing so, the trial court rendered an advisory opinion which our courts are not entitled to do. The trial court’s decision on standing ended this case. The complaint should have been dismissed. In not doing so, the trial court improperly reached to decide a constitutional issue and then decided it in a vacuum where it would have no practical effect on the parties. This was error, and a waste of judicial resources. This Court routinely attempts to avoid deciding cases on the basis of broad constitutional issues if at all possible and our trial courts should adhere to the very same principle. Ordinarily, the granting of a petition for a declaratory judgment is a matter lying within the sound discretion of a court of original jurisdiction. <em>Greenberg v.

There was an abuse of that discretion here. The presence of antagonistic claims indicating imminent and inevitable litigation coupled with a clear manifestation that the declaration sought will be of practical help in ending the controversy are essential to the granting of relief by way of declaratory judgment. <em>In re: Lifter’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/377/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="377 Pa. 227" data-case-ids="1249621" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0227-01">377 Pa. 227</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20670" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="103 A.2d 670">103 A.2d 670</a> (1954); <em>Petition of Capital Bank and Trust Co., </em><a href="/pa/336/0108-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="336 Pa. 108" data-case-ids="1195567" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0108-01">336 Pa. 108</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20790" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 A.2d 790">6 A.2d 790</a> (1939); <em>In re: Quigley’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/329/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="329 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="1181434" data-case-paths="/pa/329/0281-01">329 Pa. 281</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=198%20A.%2085" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="198 A. 85">198 A. 85</a> (1938).
