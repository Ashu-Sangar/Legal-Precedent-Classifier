The Superior Court correctly recognized that the Mental Health Procedures Act does favor voluntary treatment for mental illness. From this expression of legislative intent, the Court concluded that the procedure followed by the medical professionals in the case at bar was violative of the Mental Health Procedures Act. The Court essentially reasoned that to allow an involuntary commitment procedure under 50 P.S. § 7302 to follow a voluntary commitment procedure, with a 72 hour delay period, would result in a possible eight days of inpatient treatment before the necessity of a hearing, thus “penalizing” those who decide to accept voluntary inpatient treatment. The Superior Court, emphasizing the patient’s liberty interest, held that a hearing on the involuntary petition must be held in the time period within which the patient agreed to remain in treatment following expression of a desire to withdraw from voluntary treatment. We accepted the petition for allowance of appeal filed by the Philadelphia County Office of Mental Health and Mental Retardation to resolve this important issue of first impression. We now reverse the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

Given the serious nature of her mental condition on October 1, 1987, medical professionals at Jefferson Hospital followed the letter and spirit of the Mental Health Procedures Act in taking action to continue her medical treatment. On that date, J.S. was so ill that her physician believed she represented a clear and present danger of harm to herself and to others. Given the expressed intent of the legislature in enacting this Act, we are convinced that under such grave circumstances, our General Assembly envisioned that continued inpatient treatment would be available to this person in the interests of her welfare as well as community safety.</p>

There is simply no statutory authority for this proposition.

It is clear from the language used in 50 P.S. § 7302 that when an individual is properly admitted to involuntary inpatient treatment, he will be provided with court intervention within 120 hours or less. The language of this statutory provision is unambiguous and admits of no exception to the 120 hour time frame. We do not doubt that the 120 hours represents a necessary allotment of time within which medical professionals, friends, and family members, may prepare to present testimony concerning an individual’s mental health.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

When J.S. provided notice of her decision to withdraw from voluntary inpatient treatment, medical professionals acted promptly and, on the same day, her status was converted from that of a voluntary inpatient to that of an involuntary inpatient. There has been no claim in this case that the medical professionals could have acted more quickly in changing J.S.’s patient status, or in providing J.S. with a hearing, or that J.S.’s October 5,1987, hearing was purposely or unduly delayed. We find that the provisions of the Mental Health Procedures Act require no more of medical professionals faced with such circumstances.
