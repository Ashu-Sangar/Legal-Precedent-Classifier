One of those telephone numbers belonged to Michelle Kulick. <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>The monitoring of her phone spanned a four day period. During that time, approximately 346 calls were intercepted, 134 of which contained evidence of possession or distribution of controlled substances. The substance of one of the calls, however, was unrelated to drugs, but involved a crime nonetheless. On December 17, 1982, a call was placed by Appellant to Ms. Kulick, warning Ms. Kulick of the wiretaps on her phone and on the phones of her associates. Subsequently, Ms. Kulick’s voice was intercepted warning another person of the monitoring.</p>

Prior to the hearing, the Commonwealth had not obtained authorization to disclose the contents of the wiretap, pursuant to § 5718 of the Act. Neither had authorization been obtained when the evidence was again disclosed by the District Attorney with the filing of the criminal information against Appellant. In fact, it was not until two years and two months after the final report had been filed, following the above disclosures and Appellant’s filing of a motion to suppress them, that the Commonwealth finally moved to amend the final report and requested a judge of the Superior Court to authorize use of the evidence pertaining to Appellant at his trial.</p>
