Mitzelfelt and Lewis Mitzelfelt (hereinafter “appellants”) against the named defendants and another physician, Dr. Robert Kamrin (hereinafter “Kamrin”). Riddle Memorial Hospital (hereinafter “Riddle”) filed a cross claim against Kamrin and the estate of Dr. Andre (hereinafter “Andre”). On the first day of trial, appellants settled with Kamrin and Andre (the surgeons) and Neurological Associates (a partnership consisting of Kamrin and Andre) and provided them with a joint tortfeasor release. The appellants proceeded against Riddle on a theory that the hospital was responsible for the acts of their employees and on a theory of vicarious liability for the acts of an anesthesiologist, Dr. Villasis. The appellants presented no evidence against Kamrin, Andre and <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>Neurological Associates, and the trial court granted their motion for a directed verdict in their favor.</p>

    <p id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[255,749,1152,204]]]'>An appeal was filed by Riddle and the Superior Court reversed the decision of the trial court, finding that the Mitzelfelts had failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of medical malpractice.</p>

    <p id="b150-7" data-blocks='[["BL_150.7",150,[249,1095,1156,681]]]'>In August, 1981 the Appellant, Nancy Mitzelfelt was admitted to Riddle Memorial Hospital in response to progressive difficulty with gait, spasms of the upper and lower extremities, and urgency of urination. A cervical laminectomy was performed. Immediately after the surgical procedure, Mrs. Mitzelfelt developed partial paralysis of all four extremities, known as quadriparesis. She is now substantially confined to a wheelchair and is unable to care for herself. Among the other medical difficulties from which she suffers are the inability to control her bowel and bladder functions, spasticity in her arms and legs, and constant pain in her extremities. Her husband is required to care for her most basic needs.</p>
    <p id="b150-8" data-blocks='[["BL_150.8",150,[247,1806,1154,527]],["BL_151.1",151,[188,305,1153,628]]]'>During pretrial discovery, Dr. Lawrence F. Marshall, a California neurosurgeon who had been retained by the Mitzelfelts, stated in a report that the degree of neck flexion during the surgery was “probably the most logical explanation for the quadraparesis.” Dr. Marshall stated in his report that he found “no evidence of any kind of major change in the blood pressure or heart rate which would be consistent with some sudden untoward event during the procedure.” Thirteen days before trial, the defendant surgeons submitted the expert report of Henry Shenkin, M.D. <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>In that report, Dr. Shenkin stated that he did not believe that the medical records indicated that there was neck flexion during the surgery. His report also indicated that he “disagree[d] with Dr. Marshall that there is no evidence of any kind of major change in the blood pressure or heart rate which would be consistent with some sudden untoward event during the procedure.” Dr. Shenkin went on to state that assuming there was a substantial drop in blood pressure, it was sufficient to compromise the blood supply to the spinal cord. Dr. Shenkin stated that he was not certain whether there was a substantial drop in blood pressure because he had trouble reading the anesthesia record.</p>
    <p id="b151-5" data-blocks='[["BL_151.4",151,[187,951,1154,363]]]'>Once the surgeons had agreed to settle their portion of the case, the Mitzelfelts proceeded against the hospital. Counsel for the Mitzelfelts did not call as a witness Dr. Marshall, the expert they had retained. Rather, they called Dr. Shenkin, the expert for the surgeons, as a witness. Dr. Shenkin’s theory of liability was directed at the acts of the anesthesiologists and the attending hospital staff.</p>
    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.5",151,[185,1333,1154,577]]]'>During trial, the appellants called as a witness, Marlene McGrath, a nurse-anesthetist who had been one of the operating room staff responsible for Mrs. Mitzelfelt’s anesthesiology. During her deposition prior to trial, Mrs. McGrath had testified that Appellant’s blood pressure upon arrival in the operating room was 124/78 (systolic/diastolic). She testified that it would have been negligence to allow the systolic pressure to drop thirty points (which would be 94). There was testimony (from three different witnesses) during the trial that Mrs. Mitzelfelt’s systolic pressure fell either to 80, 85, or 88.</p>

She stated that the blood pressure reading of 124/78 should have been discounted, and the controlling blood pressure was that taken on the hospital floor before going to the operating room; 110/70. According to her trial testimony, Mrs. Mitzelfelt’s systolic pressure should not have been allowed to fall to 80. Dr. Smith, the expert for the hospital, <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>stated in his report that her systolic pressure had fallen to 80, although his trial testimony was that he did not know how he arrived at that figure and was concerned that it was from misreading a poor reproduction of the medical records. The appellants did not call Dr. Marshall as an expert witness at trial, but rather called Dr. Shenkin, the expert witness originally retained by the defendant surgeons, who had settled prior to trial.
