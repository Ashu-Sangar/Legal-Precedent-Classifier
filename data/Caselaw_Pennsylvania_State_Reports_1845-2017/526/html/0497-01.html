The vehicle had been borrowed by Irving Hammond at the request of Wilson for the purpose of driving Wilson to specified locations. At the last location, Hammond parked the car while Wilson went into a nearby store. Shortly thereafter, Wilson returned to the parked vehicle and Hammond began to leave his parked position. Hammond then noticed someone crossing the street behind his vehicle, pull out a gun and fire four or five shots into the passenger window, wounding Wilson. Hearing the first gunshot, Hammond panicked, left the vehicle and ran south down Broad Street. When <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>the shooting ceased, Hammond returned to his vehicle and drove Wilson to the hospital where he later died.</p>

After Appellant surrendered to the police, he was interviewed by detectives. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given, but Appellant was in the company of his attorney. The Appellant was asked several questions, including whether he owned a vehicle, in order to complete a form identified as 75-229.

Generally speaking, general information such as name, height, weight, residence, occupation, etc. is not the kind of information which requires <em>Miranda </em>warnings since it is not information generally considered as part of an interrogation. <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required when a suspect is in custody and subjected to interrogation. <em>Commonwealth v.

As such, trial counsel believed that Cecil’s testimony would be considered self-serving since it would relieve the Appellant of any wrongdoing and therefore remove the conspiracy charge filed against Cecil. Thus, rather than helping the Appellant’s case, trial counsel believed that Cecil’s testimony would actually bolster the Commonwealth’s position. Finally, trial counsel testified that his strategy was discussed with and concurred in by the Appellant. Because trial counsel had a reasonable basis for his actions and the Appellant concurred in this course of action, trial counsel cannot be considered ineffective.</p>

At the post verdict <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>hearing, Jay Jackson testified that he was not with Key the night of the shooting but was with John Jackson playing basketball.

The Appellant would have us read this question as expressing a lack of understanding by the jury of the term “knowingly”. He then suggests the jury should have been given a definition of “knowingly” such as is found in Section 302(b)(2) of the Crimes Code. 18 Pa.C. S.A. § 302(b)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> This we decline to do. The term “knowingly” used in Section 9711(d)(7), does not require a unique understanding of the word. In fact, the definition which Appellant suggests should have been given to the jury is similar, if not identical, to the definition contained in Webster’s dictionary. Accordingly, there is no unusual legal significance to the term “knowingly” in this instance which would require knowledge other than its common usage. Therefore, trial counsel’s failure to require a jury instruction of “knowingly” does not constitute ineffectiveness.</p>
