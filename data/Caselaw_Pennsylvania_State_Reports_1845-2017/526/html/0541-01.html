We have also required that the party against whom a plea of collateral estoppel is asserted must have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in question in a prior action. <em>In re Ellis’ Estate, </em><a href="/pa/460/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="460 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="482787" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0281-01">460 Pa. 281</a>, 287, <a href="/pa/460/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="460 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="482787" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0281-01">333 A.2d 728</a>, 731 (1975). The issue in the first case was whether Mrs. Muhammad had authorized the settlement. The issues in the case before us are whether the attorney appellants were negligent and/or deceitful in their representation of the Muhammads and, if so, whether the Muhammads suffered harm as a result. It is thus evident that the matter is not barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel as there are issues in this case that were not litigated in the medical malpractice case.</p>
    <p id="b638-5" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[245,1513,1153,257]]]'>Although we find that collateral estoppel does not bar this action, we do not believe that our inquiry need or should cease there.

The essence of a settlement is contractual in nature. There is an offer (the settlement figure), acceptance, and consideration (in exchange for the plaintiff terminating his lawsuit, the defendant will pay the plaintiff the agreed upon sum). Thus, the trial court’s enforcement of that settlement was merely upholding the terms of a binding contract.</p>
