    <p id="b387-10" data-blocks='[["BL_387.8",387,[211,1386,1155,735]]]'>Appellant, Lawrence Jackson, was tried in February, 1988, for murder, manslaughter, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. During the trial, appellant’s counsel moved to preclude the Commonwealth from using his 1973 conviction for robbery to impeach his credibility if he should testify. Appellant had been convicted of robbery in 1973, was sentenced to serve four to ten years, and was paroled on June 30, 1976, more than ten years prior to the trial in this case. While on parole, however, he was convicted of theft, a parole violation which resulted in revocation and recommitment, so that appellant served approximately fifteen months in 1983 and 1984 on his 1973 robbery conviction. The latter incarceration was within ten years of trial in this case.</p>

We adopted the essence of the federal evidence rule prohibiting impeachment by prior conviction only when “a period of more than ten years has elapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release from confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative value of the conviction supported by the specific facts and circumstances substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect.” Fed.R.Evid. 609. We noted that “the vitality of <em>Bighum </em>and <em>Roots </em>will not be totally extinguished, as the considerations therein will be relevant in determining whether convictions which fall in the exception category are admissible.” <em>Randall, </em><a href="/pa/515/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="515 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1806048" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0410-01">515 Pa. at 415</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="515 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1806048" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0410-01">528 A.2d at 1328-29</a>.</p>
    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.4",389,[202,1433,1154,257]]]'>The question is whether, in this case, appellant’s incarceration in 1983 and 1984, a recommitment on his 1973 robbery sentence due to a parole violation involving a theft conviction, counts as confinement for purposes of the ten-year <em>Randall </em>rule. Logic dictates that it does.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.5",389,[203,1709,1153,517]]]'>We held in <em>Rivenbark v.

Appellant served time in 1983 and 1984 on his 1973 robbery conviction, not on the later theft conviction which constituted the parole violation.</p>

The <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>“last day of confinement” for an offense involving dishonesty or false statement would include any time served on the sentence whether it was during the original commitment immediately following the sentencing or whether it was during a recommitment following a parole violation, unless a strained interpretation is placed upon the language in the <em>Randall </em>opinion. The last day appellant was confined for his 1973 robbery conviction was in 1984 — less than ten years prior to the 1988 trial in this case. <em>Randall </em>would therefore permit impeachment on the basis of the 1973 conviction.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[229,915,1162,1173]]]'>A salient feature of the <em>Randall </em>rule and the federal rule on which it is based is that a prior conviction for an offense involving dishonesty may be used to discredit a witness for ten years following the conviction <em>or the last day of confinement for that offense. </em>It would not have seémed unreasonable if the rule, alternatively, had maintained the impediment only for ten years from the date of the offense, based on reasoning that the dishonest act, the offense itself, is presumed to be relevant as to credibility for only ten years. But instead, the rule establishes an impediment which extends for ten years from the last day of confinement for the offense. The relevancy of the dishonest act is expiated only by the passage of ten uninterrupted years of <em>freedom; </em>time spent in confinement for the offense does not count in the passage of the ten-year impeachment period. The necessary implication is that time spent in confinement, without normal opportunity to commit additional criminal offenses, does not demonstrate rehabilitation. That being the case, a recent confinement for an old conviction, due to a parole violation, interrupts the- ten-year period because the witness has not demonstrably mended his mendacity for the requisite ten years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>Appellant’s argument offends our sense of logic in another way. Had he served the full ten years of his sentence for the 1973 robbery conviction, his last day of confinement would have been in 1983. <em>Randall </em>would then unquestionably permit impeachment on the basis of the 1973 conviction. But because he was paroled in 1976, appellant seeks suppression of the 1973 robbery conviction despite his recommitment in 1983. It would be anomalous, however, to grant appellant a legally sheltered position due to the fact that he took advantage of society’s leniency by accepting a parole in 1976 when he used the freedom obtained on parole to commit another crime. We cannot subscribe to an interpretation of <em>Randall </em>which would produce such an anomaly.</p>
