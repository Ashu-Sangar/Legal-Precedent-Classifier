The issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to open or strike the judgment based on its holding that the excuse for failing to appear for trial was not reasonable. Appellant claims, inter alia, that <em>Tracy v.

On May 16, 1986, on petition and after hearing, appellant’s counsel was permitted to withdraw his appearance, and the trial court entered an order to that effect, whereafter appellant proceeded pro se. In October 1988, appellant’s case was listed for trial. On November 3, 1988, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 440 and the directive of the trial court, appellee’s counsel sent notice of the trial date by certified mail, return receipt requested, to appellant at her last known address. On November 15, 1988, the date scheduled for trial, appellant failed to appear and no return from the postal authorities had yet been received by appellee’s counsel. The trial court entered a judgment of non pros against appellant for failing to appear at her trial. Subsequently, on November 22, 1988, the notice of trial was returned to appellee’s counsel with a post office notation that the mail had been forwarded to a new address but had been unclaimed at that address.</p>

      <em>Tracy </em>involved a real estate tax sale in which the tax claim bureau had complied strictly with the notice requirements of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, 72 P.S. § 5860.101 et seq., but did not provide notice to the current record owners of the property subject to sale. The current owners were not listed in the tax bureau’s records, and the notice mailed to the former owner was returned to the tax bureau prior to the sale. This court set aside the sale, holding that the notice of sale, though it satisfied the statute governing the sale, nevertheless did not comport with due process. We stated:</p>

Third, and perhaps most important, the parties who failed to receive actual notice in <em>Tracy </em>and <em>Geier </em>were not similarly situated with the appellant in this case.</p>

Chesner, </em><a href="/pa/422/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="422 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1901746" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0138-01">422 Pa. 138</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=221%20A.2d%20305" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="221 A.2d 305">221 A.2d 305</a> (1966); <em>March v.

Requiring the tax bureau in <em>Tracy </em>to check the records of sister government agencies before permitting the forfeiture of real property did not constitute “extraordinary efforts.” Appellant argues in her brief that appellee “had reason to believe” that the notice had not been delivered to appellant because fifteen days had elapsed between the date of mailing and the date of <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>trial yet the postal service had not delivered a return receipt to appellee. Appellee, as a private party, however, had no way of interpreting the meaning of the fact that the postal service had not provided a return receipt as of November 15, the trial date. Appellant argues that appellee should have contacted the postal service “to trace the certified letters and to secure any forwarding address.” We cannot subscribe to such a requirement. Should this be necessary “several days after the letters were sent,” as appellant suggests, or after a week, or two weeks, or three, or more? We think any such requirement would mandate <em>extraordinary </em>efforts on the part of a litigant.</p>

Hutchison, <a href="/pa/492/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="492 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1767186" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0118-01">supra.</a> </em>In <em>Tracy, </em>the property owners who failed to receive notice prior to the upset tax sale were individuals who had no reason to be in communication with the tax claim bureau. Though they were not entirely without fault, it was excusable that they had not specifically notified the bureau of a change of address. In <em>Geier, </em>where an individual’s real estate was subjected to tax sale without actual notice to her, there is an even stronger case to justify her failure to be in contact with the taxing authorities: she had a contractual arrangement with her cotenant which obligated the cotenant to make all tax payments. By contrast, appellant was not only a litigant in a case pending in common pleas court, she was the plaintiff. In view of the fact that service of all legal papers in a case other than original process can be made upon a pro se party by mail at his or her residence or last known address, <em>see </em>Pa.R.C.P. 440(a)(1) and (2), it was obviously incumbent upon appellant to keep the court and opposing counsel apprised of her address. That her failure to do so resulted in her failure to receive actual notice of her own trial should not require the adverse party to take <em>extraordinary </em>steps in order to secure her presence. Appellant’s fault in this respect vitiates the excusability of her failure to attend her own trial. A petition to open or strike a judgment is <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>addressed to a court’s equitable powers. <em>Hutchison v.
