The two men entered into a limited <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>partnership agreement, and appellant provided an $18,-000.00 loan to the business.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> As a limited partner, appellant took no part in the operation or management of the bicycle shop. McKelvey, as general partner, handled all of the purchases, sales and financial aspects of the business. Identifying himself as the partnership’s “principal” partner (we interpret this as meaning the partnership’s <em>general </em>partner), McKelvey filed an application for sales, use and hotel occupancy license with the Department of Revenue of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and designated appellant as a limited partner in the business, which was known as “Different Spokes.”</p>

The total assessment amounted to $27,974.21 with penalties and interest. No challenge was made to this assessment nor was the assessment paid.</p>
