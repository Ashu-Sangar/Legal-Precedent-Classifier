      <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>On April 8, 1987, Mark Vultaggio, as a partner in C.M.S. Enterprises (“Buyers”), entered into a written agreement of sale with Robert Wassel for real property located in Paradise Township, Monroe County, Pennsylvania. Although the property in question was owned by Robert Wassel and Loretta B. Wassel (“Sellers”) as tenants by the entireties, Mrs. Wassel was not a party to the written agreement. Mr. Vultaggio tendered $2,000 as a down payment at the time of executing the contract. Subsequently, he tendered an additional $5,000. Mrs. Wassel deposited both these sums into the Wassel’s business account. When the Wassels refused to participate in a closing scheduled for July 3, 1987, Vultaggio et al. brought an action for specific performance. The Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County granted Wassels’ motion for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the Wassels and against the D’Alessandros, Mark Vultaggio, and C.M.S. Enterprises on the ground that the transaction was barred by the Statute of Frauds. Subsequently, the chancery court amended its order to enter judgment for $7,000, the amount of the down payment, in favor of the buyers. On appeal Superior Court affirmed the lower court.</p>

The trial court entered summary judgment against Buyers and in favor of Sellers on the grounds of collateral estoppel and res judicata. Buyers took a timely appeal, and on May 1, 1990, Superior Court once again affirmed the lower court. Superior Court’s rationale was that the action was barred by Pa.R.C.P. 1020, which, according to Superior Court, required Buyer to join all causes of action arising from the same transaction in one action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Since Buyer failed to do this, it waived the claim that was not joined. Buyer thereafter petitioned for allowance of appeal and this court granted allocatur to address <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>the question of whether Buyers’ second action was barred because it was not joined with the first.</p>

This is confirmed by the note to Rule 1020(d)(1), which refers to subdivision (a) in distinguishing the meaning of (d)(1) from (a). The sense of the note is that 1020(a) allows <em>permissive </em>joinder of <em>unrelated </em>causes of action, whereas 1020(d)(1) <em>requires </em>joinder of <em>related </em>causes of action. The term "causes of action” is used in discussing both rules, and subdivision (a) is cited to clarify the meaning of this term. Since subdivision (a) concerns causes of action heretofore asserted in assumpsit or trespass, the term “cause of action” refers to actions heretofore brought in assumpsit and trespass. Both 1020(a) and 1020(d)(1), therefore, concern causes of action sounding in assumpsit and trespass, not equity.</p>
