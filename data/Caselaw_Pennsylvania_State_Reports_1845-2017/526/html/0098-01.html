Helen Holeva was appointed Executrix of the estate and was authorized by the decedent’s will to sell any estate property “for such price or prices and upon such terms and conditions as she, in her sole discretion, may deem best.” (Record Oa). At the time of her death, the decedent owned two parcels of real estate, property situate on Church Street and a farm in Charleston Township, Chester County. In an effort to settle the estate promptly, the Executrix decided to sell both properties. To assist her, the Executrix hired J. Puleo and Sons to appraise both properties for estate tax purposes and engaged them to sell the Church Street property. At this time, the Executrix was already undertaking negotiations with a prospective buyer for the purchase of the farm. Appellant, acting on behalf of J. Puleo and Sons, appraised the farm at between <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>$65,000 and $80,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> Negotiations for the sale of the farm were protracted. It was during this process that Appellant overheard a telephone conversation between the Executrix and a prospective buyer in which the buyer offered $75,000 for the farm.

In spite of the disparity between the appraisals, the Executrix entered into an agreement for the sale with the Appellant for $81,000.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a>

Hughes’ daughter, Mrs. Solomon, the Administratrix, entered into a sales agreement for the purchase of real estate with James Granito for $42,000. Prior to accepting the offer, the Administratrix had two appraisals performed. The sales agreement was contingent upon court approval. In accordance with the agreement, the Administratrix petitioned the court and provided notice to her brothers and sisters. As a result of this notice, the brothers and sisters tendered a subsequent offer from John Haretos in the amount of $60,000. After taking testimony, the eourt authorized the Administratrix to accept the second offer notwithstanding the first agreement. Granito filed exceptions to the order. The court <em>en banc </em>granted leave to the estate to file a request restraining the sale to Granito. The court then granted the relief, restrained the sale to Granito and authorized the conveyance of the property to Haretos. Granito again filed exceptions which were dismissed and that dismissal was affirmed by the Superior Court.</p>

This was coupled with an expressed finding that no fraud had occurred here. As an alternative theory, the trial court determined that a confidential relationship existed here, that a breach of that relationship occurred, and that the breach made the agreement <em>prima facie </em>voidable. While the trial court’s conclusion here is sound, that court’s reasoning is confused. We find that the trial court was expressly authorized to restrain the sale here under the express language of Section 3360(a), and under <em>our </em>decision in <em>Estate of Hughes, </em>for the following reason.</p>

In such cases, if the superior party obtains a possible benefit, equity raises a presumption against the validity of the transaction or contract, and casts upon such party the burden of proving fairness, honesty, and integrity in the transaction or contract. He must show that there was no abuse of the confidence, that he has acted in good faith, and that the act by which he is benefited was the free, voluntary, and independent act of the other party, done with full knowledge of its purpose and effect. Moreover, it has been held that where the relations between contracting parties appear to be of such a character as to render it certain that they do not deal on terms of equality, but that from one party’s superior knowledge of the matter derived from a fiduciary relationship, or from overmastering influence, weakness, dependence, or trust justifiably reposed, unfair advantage in the transaction is made probable, the transaction is presumed void, and the burden is shifted to, and it is incument upon, the stronger party to show affirmatively that no deception was practiced and that all was fair, open, voluntary, and well understood.
