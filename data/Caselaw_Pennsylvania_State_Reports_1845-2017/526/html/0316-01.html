    <p id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[271,439,1151,314]]]'>The question in this case is whether Commonwealth Court exceeded its authority in modifying an order of the State Board of Medical Education and Licensure (hereinafter “the board”) which revoked the medical license of a doctor for three months because he failed to secure medical malpractice insurance for a nine month period.</p>
    <p id="b410-6" data-blocks='[["BL_410.6",410,[271,770,1152,422]]]'>Paul M. Slawek, M.D., has practiced medicine in Pennsylvania since 1967. From 1968 to 1985 he maintained a general medical practice in Philadelphia. In 1979, Slawek enrolled in a diagnostic radiology program at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, and he completed the program in 1983. During the time Slawek was enrolled at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, he hired other physicians to maintain his private medical practice.</p>
    <p id="b410-7" data-blocks='[["BL_410.7",410,[269,1210,1154,691]]]'>When Slawek completed his training at the end of 1983, he was offered a position on the faculty, to begin in February 1984. Slawek accepted the position, but in January, while he was on vacation, he was notified that the doctor who was then servicing his medical practice in Philadelphia abruptly left, without notice, and that there were patients in the office waiting to be seen. Slawek immediately chartered a plane, returned to Philadelphia, and began seeing patients shortly after his arrival. Slawek’s efforts to persuade the other doctor to return were unavailing, as were efforts to hire a replacement, and Slawek himself remained in his private practice in lieu of assuming his teaching position.</p>
    <p id="b410-8" data-blocks='[["BL_410.8",410,[269,1918,1152,258]]]'>In February of 1984 the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund notified Slawek that he did not have the required medical malpractice coverage.

Commonwealth Court denied his appeal on the ground that he had waived the issue he was attempting to raise on appeal. This court granted allocatur and remanded the case to Commonwealth Court for consideration on the merits.

    <p id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[184,1164,1155,528]]]'>Among the questions addressed by Commonwealth Court was whether the board had abused its discretion. The court determined that it had not. This determination was based upon Section 701(f) of the Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 P.S. § 1301.701(f), which provides that a physician’s failure to carry medical malpractice insurance “shall result in the suspension or revocation of the health care provider’s license by the licensure board.” As Commonwealth Court put it, the board did not abuse its discretion because it had no discretion to abuse. We agree.</p>

As Commonwealth Court correctly stated, the revocation of the license was not an abuse of discretion because the statute requires it. If that is what the case is about, all discussion should end here, for Commonwealth Court properly resolved this question against Slawek below. We believe, however, that a more accurate statement of the question in the case is that presented by the board: whether Commonwealth Court exceeded its scope of review when it reversed the order of the board revoking Slawek’s license for a three month period.</p>

At a bare minimum, it refers to this court’s statement of the broad guidelines governing review of agency decisions. In what is perhaps this court’s seminal case on appellate review of administrative decisions, <em>Blumenschein v. Pittsburgh Housing Authority, </em><a href="/pa/379/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="379 Pa. 566" data-case-ids="1253580" data-case-paths="/pa/379/0566-01">379 Pa. 566</a>, 572-73, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.2d%20331" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="109 A.2d 331">109 A.2d 331</a>, 334-35 (1954), some rather fundamental principles were established:</p>

It is true that the mere possession of discretionary power by an administrative body does not make it wholly immune from judicial review, but the scope of that review is limited to the determination of whether there has been a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion or a purely arbitrary execution of the agency’s duties or functions. That the court might have a different opinion or judgment in regard to the action of the agency is not a sufficient ground for interference; <em>judicial </em>discretion may not be substituted for <em>administrative </em>discretion.</blockquote>

It is conceivable, of course, that our requirement that the agency not act capriciously might, in a given case, be coterminous with Commonwealth Court’s requirement in its <em>Hendrickson </em>case that the penalty be reasonable in light of the violation. As a general rule, however, Commonwealth Court’s statement of its rule is overbroad in that it invites the court to substitute its view of what it reasonable for that of the agency. For that reason, we believe that the proper review of the agency’s action, assuming that it is not defective under the self-explanatory requirements of the Administrative Agency Law, is <em>not </em>whether its order was reasonable, but whether it was made in “accordance with law” (i.e., whether it was made in bad faith, and whether it was fraudulent or capricious).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As the <em>Blumenschein </em>court put it, a reviewing court may interfere in an agency decision only when “there has been a manifest and flagrant abuse of discretion or a purely arbitrary execution of the agency’s duties or functions.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Since there is no allegation of fraud or bad faith — also mentioned <em>supra </em>by <em>Blumenschein </em>— our <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>inquiry in this case resolves itself into whether the agency’s action was capricious or a flagrant abuse of discretion.</p>

    <blockquote id="b415-4" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[245,458,1113,1095]]]'>The Board’s burden is to craft a disciplinary order that takes into account mitigating factors, yet, deter others from engaging in similar conduct, and maintains public confidence in the integrity of the medical profession. If there was a market for professional liability insurance which covers a past uninsured period, the Board would order that the Respondent’s license be revoked and that after a designated active period of revocation, the revocation be stayed if and when the Board would receive evidence that such insurance was secured. However, the Board recognizes that it is extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, to find an insurance carrier that will write insurance to cover a past uninsured period. Alternatively, the Respondent could self-insure his liability for the presently uninsured nine-month period of his practice, but the Board recognizes that this is a prohibitively costly alternative. Consequently, the Board has decided to issue an order which will preclude the Respondent from practicing medicine for a brief time, but which does not require him to cure his past insurance violation as a pre-condition to returning to practice.</blockquote>
