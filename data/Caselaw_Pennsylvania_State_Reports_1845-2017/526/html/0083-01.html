S.A. The complaint was actually filed with a district justice on April 6, 1987. For reasons not appearing of record, the complaint and summons were not mailed to Appellant-defendant until April 21, 1987. The <em>initial </em>date set by the <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>district justice for the preliminary hearing under Pa.R.Crim. P. 141 was June 17, 1987. Appellant then requested a continuance, and a new preliminary hearing date was set for July 1, 1987. The delay between the time of filing the complaint and the June 17, 1987, original hearing date was primarily due to the police schedule as to hours they were working and vacation days according to the findings of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Memorandum Opinion of trial court, p. 1). Hence, seventy-two days of delay were attributable to the Commonwealth. The defense was responsible for the fourteen day delay between June 17 and July 1, 1987. The preliminary hearing was held as scheduled on July 1, 1987. No attorney for the Commonwealth entered an appearance in the proceedings at the district justice level, and no attorney for the Commonwealth was present at this preliminary hearing.</p>

See Pa.R.Crim.P. 143. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, the district justice prepared and served on Appellant a document entitled “Notice of Arraignment,” as is the practice in the judicial district comprised of Lancaster County. The Notice of Arraignment is signed by the district justice and indicates that Appellant “will be arraigned on Wednesday, the 30th day of September, 1987.” (R., 4a). Appellant’s signature also appears on the Notice of Arraignment, dated July 1, 1987, as as acknowledgement of his receipt thereof.</p>
    <p id="b178-6" data-blocks='[["BL_178.5",178,[221,1798,1155,415]]]'>A transcript was forwarded by the district justice to the court, and the clerk of courts for Lancaster County received the same on July 8,1987. Amongst the papers is the Notice of Arraignment to Appellant.

Particularly in light of the Lancaster County District Attorney’s heavy responsibility under Local Rule 303 (with respect to conducting arraignments) (see footnote 1 above), it is not unreasonable or erroneous to expect the District Attorney’s Office to track arraignment dates on a routine basis to determine whether prosecution under Rule 1100 is thereby jeopardized. That office and those like it must, to be diligent, have simple systems in place to carry out the routine duties of the office. Sound reason requires no less. It would be easy to maintain a diary book where the relevant dates in a given prosecution could be promptly entered and checked against the Rule 1100 run date as a matter of course. Practicing lawyers must maintain docket books to make sure that they appear in court on the right date, file pleadings on time, complete discovery in a timely fashion, and do not run afoul of statutes of limitation. No less is required of a properly administered district attorney’s office. Here, the District Attorney’s Office “blew it” and they did so because a routine diary or docket system was apparently not in place. That constitutes a failure to exercise due diligence. It has been held that “due diligence” imposes the obligation on the government to “read its mail and respond intelligently.” <em>United States v. Salzmann, </em><a href="/f-supp/417/1139-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="417 F.

We hold that due diligence likewise imposes on the government the duty to employ simple recordkeeping systems in circumstances such as this. Unlike <em>Commonwealth v. Monosky, </em><a href="/pa/511/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="511 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1798740" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0148-01">supra,</a> the delay here was not the fault of the minor judiciary (the district justice), but must be fully attributed <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>to the district attorney’s office itself.

In fact, argues Appellant, the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>Commonwealth's Brief in the Superior Court suggested that there existed a "cut-off date" supplied to the district justices in Lancaster County By the District Attorney such that, for example, cases in which preliminary hearings were held prior to July 1, 1987 were to be assigned a July 29, 1987 arraignment date, while cases in which preliminary hearings were held on or after July 1, 1987 were to be assigned an arraignment date of September 30, 1987. The reason behind this “cut-off date” system devised by the District Attorney becomes apparent, asserts Appellant, when one considers the fact that in Lancaster County it is the District Attorney who prepares and publishes both the list of defendants to be arraigned at Arraignment Court and the list of cases to be tried during the corresponding trial term. Thus, Appellant argues that it is for his own convenience in preparing those lists that the District Attorney assigns “cut-off dates.” In view of such power of control that resides with the District Attorney, Appellant argues that the Superior Court conclusion that the delay here was caused by the district justice and the scheduling policies and practices of the Court of Common Pleas amounts to nothing more than sophistry. In view of our disposition of this appeal below, it is unnecessary to comment on this argument of Appellant, but it is obvious that Appellant's contentions provide a lucid explanation of what happened in the instant case consistent with the District Attorney’s extensive responsibilities under Local Rule 303.</p>

Instantly, while we have a timely petition from the Commonwealth, we lack a stipulation as was made in <em>Lamb. </em>We, however, do not find the lack of a stipulation to be fatal to our analogy. Here, there is absolutely no dispute that, given the September 30th arraignment date, there was no possibility that appellee’s trial could have been held before the November trial term. Even the trial court stated that it was simply a matter of changing <em>the arraignment date. </em>(Trial Court Opinion at 3). However, as we discussed earlier, it was the <em>district justice </em>who scheduled the arraignment date. Even though the Commonwealth was sent notice of the date of the September arraignment before the July 29th arraignment term ended, we will not condemn the Commonwealth for not acting as “watchdog” over the actions of the district justice, just as we have not held the Commonwealth responsible for derelictions on the part of other agencies within the system.

This, along with the acknowledgement by all concerned that the September 30th arraignment date was the reason for the tardiness of the trial date, is sufficient to satisfy the test of <em>Commonwealth v.
