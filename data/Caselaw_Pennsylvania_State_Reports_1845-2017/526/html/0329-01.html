The petition was filed by the appellant, Guy Homer Glass, seeking discharge from criminal liability on the ground that his constitutional rights to a speedy trial and due process were violated by a fifty-one month delay between conviction and sentencing. Appellant was awarded a new trial by the Superior Court, on the basis that representation by trial counsel was flawed by a conflict of interest.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The sole issue on appeal is whether habeas corpus relief should have been granted.</p>

Appellant was convicted of attempted rape, conspiracy, attempted involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, corrupting the morals of a minor, and simple assault.</p>
    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[262,507,1153,627]]]'>The fifty-one month delay in sentencing was attributable to the following sequence of events. A verdict finding appellant guilty was entered on June 10, 1983, and post-verdict motions were filed on June 20, 1983. The trial transcript was not filed, however, until March 4, 1986. The delay in filing the transcript was caused by a court reporter, who, although she had promptly transcribed the testimony, neglected to file the transcript. She left her employment with the county in June of 1984, having forgotten about the transcript. As to why she did not file it until March of 1986, she stated that “no one had asked for it or anything or it would have been at their disposal.”</p>

Appellant then sought, through a <em>pro se </em>petition, to have trial counsel dismissed and new counsel appointed. On April 21, 1986, the petition was granted. The order appointing new counsel provided that supplemental post-verdict motions could be filed <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>limited to claims of ineffective assistance of prior counsel. The supplemental ¡motions were filed on June 5, 1986, and, by September of 1986, the motions had been briefed.</p>

On December 14, 1986, the case was reassigned to the president judge, who, in March of 1987 conducted oral arguments, and, on July 22, 1987 denied appellant’s post-verdict motions. Just before the post-verdict motions were denied, appellant filed, on July 20, 1987, a <em>pro se </em>petition for writ of habeas corpus seeking discharge on the ground that delays in sentencing had infringed his constitutional rights to speedy trial and due process. The petition was denied on August 5, 1987. Another petition for writ of habeas corpus raising the speedy <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>trial and due process issues was filed, this time by counsel, on August 18, 1987.

    <p id="b425-6" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[187,801,1156,1268]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that the speedy trial issue was not timely presented to the trial court and that it was, therefore, waived. As stated in Pa.R.A.P. 302(a), “[ijssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.” It cannot be said, however, that the issue of delay in sentencing was not raised in the trial court, for, plainly, it was raised in July and August of 1987 via the petitions for writs of habeas corpus. The Commonwealth argues that it should have been raised at the earliest possible time, i.e., in the supplemental post-verdict motions filed in June of 1986, when appellant’s newly acquired counsel was permitted to assert prior counsel’s ineffectiveness. Specifically, it is argued that an ineffectiveness claim could have been framed in terms of prior counsel’s failure to assert a speedy trial claim or a demand for prompt sentencing. Nevertheless, the very nature of the claimed wrongful delay is such that, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that it <em>could </em>have been raised in June of 1986, its constitutional implications grew as the delay lengthened. It is, therefore, to be distinguished from claims of trial error which remain constant in substance and must be raised through timely post-verdict motions. See <em>Commonwealth v. Gravely, </em><a href="/pa/486/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="486 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1757600" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0194-01">486 Pa. 194</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="486 Pa. 194" data-case-ids="1757600" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0194-01">404 A.2d 1296</a> (1979).</p>

Counsel should not be required to assert speedy trial claims, seeking discharge of defendants, when they do not regard the claims as having attained sufficient substance to warrant relief. It does not follow, however, that they should refrain from requesting prompt sentencing. See discussion infra. Appellant’s speedy trial claim was certainly of greater substance in July and August of 1987 than it was in June of 1986. The claim had not, therefore, been waived when it was asserted in 1987 through petitions for writs of habeas corpus.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

The letter informed the Superior Court that an opinion on the habeas corpus issue would not be provided.

As such, appellant had an obligation to follow up on the status of the transcript, including its filing with the court, so that the court could rule on his motions.
