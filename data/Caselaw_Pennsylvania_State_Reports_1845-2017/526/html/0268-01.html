The informants had also told the police that when appellant and her husband came into the York area, they would distribute the cocaine very quickly.

The police observed a tan Ford Mustang with New Jersey license plates parked half a block from the house. A check of the registration revealed that the vehicle was registered in appellant’s name.

The informant stated that appellant frequently drove different vehicles on drug-dealing trips to York, and that it was uncertain whether the same vehicle would be used that had been observed on previous occasions. The informant also stated that appellant always carried a firearm, and that appellant and her husband always made distributions of cocaine as rapidly as possible to minimize the time that they held cocaine in their possession. In response to this information, police set up a surveillance point along a highway leading into York. Shortly after noon, police observed appellant’s vehicle travelling past the surveillance point. It was the same vehicle that had been observed on November 15 and 23. Police were unable to follow the vehicle, due to traffic conditions; hence a search for the vehicle was soon commenced. Around 1:45 p.m., police found the vehicle parked in front of the residence of Stephen Conn. At 2:00 p.m., appellant and her husband departed from the Conn residence in the vehicle. Within several minutes, and without having obtained a warrant, police stopped the vehicle and conducted a preliminary search. The search yielded cocaine and a large sum of money, $1,500.00. Appellant and her husband were placed under arrest. Police returned to the Conn residence and searched it.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> Appellant’s vehicle <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>was then taken to a police barracks, where an inventory-search was conducted.

The informant who told police that appellant would be driving into York to sell drugs on November 27, 1985 had previously supplied information to police regarding appellant’s trips to York. Police observations had confirmed the accuracy of this information. The other informant, who also supplied information about appellant’s earlier drug-dealing trips to York, had on prior occasions provided accurate information to police in connection with other drug cases. This information had led to the issuance of four search warrants, the arrest of four persons, and the confiscation of large quantities of drugs. This informant was a multi-drug user who was very knowledgeable about drugs. Thus, prior to November 27, 1985, police had on multiple <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>occasions received information from two independent and reliable informants that appellant was using a vehicle to transport drugs into York for the purpose of conducting drug sales. Upon learning between 10:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. on November 27, 1985 that appellant was again going to transport drugs into York, police should have obtained a warrant to search appellant’s vehicle.

Nor is it an excuse that police did not know the exact location, within the York vicinity, where appellant’s vehicle would be found. A warrant could plainly have been issued to allow a search of <em>whatever </em>vehicle appellant might be driving into the York vicinity on November 27, 1985. The requirement that search warrants be particular in their description of the areas to be searched would not have been violated by such a description, for, under the circumstances, it would have been impossible to provide a more particular description. See Pa. Const, art. 1, § 8 (“[N]o warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be, nor without probable cause____”); <em>Commonwealth v.

Indeed, upon receiving a tip from one of their informants, at least three and one-half hours before stopping appellant’s vehicle, police had grounds for obtaining a warrant. During this three and one-half hour period, police observed nothing overtly suspicious or criminal in <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>appellant’s behavior. The stop was not, therefore, based upon grounds other than those which existed when police received information from their informant that appellant would be transporting drugs into York that day. Police knew that appellant had previously delivered drugs at the Conn residence, so it cannot be said that the discovery of appellant’s vehicle in front of the Conn residence was new information supplying probable cause. The Conn residence was merely one of the destinations in York that police knew to be a destination for appellant’s drug deliveries. The case is not one, therefore, where additional or independent grounds for a search arose after receipt of the informant’s tip. Further, it should be noted that the record of the suppression hearing indicates that a magistrate’s office was located just a ten minute drive from the surveillance point where police observed appellant’s vehicle entering the York vicinity around noon on the day in question. Despite their earlier failure to request a warrant, police did not attempt, even after having observed the vehicle, to obtain a warrant.</p>
