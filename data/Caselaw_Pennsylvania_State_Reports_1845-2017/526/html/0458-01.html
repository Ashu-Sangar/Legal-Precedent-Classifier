When police officers arrived at the pay phone from which the call was made, they observed a woman who was “visibly shaken” and who repeatedly stated to the officers, “You have to help me.” (N.T. 6/21/88 at 274). After the officers were able to calm the woman, Josephina Rivera, she told them that she had been held captive in a basement by a man named Gary Heidnik (appellant) for the last four months and that three other women were still being held in the basement. Ms. Rivera explained that appellant was parked nearby, waiting for her to return from what appellant believed was a visit to her family.</p>

Ms. Rivera provided the officers with a description of appellant and told them where he was parked. When the officers apprehended appellant, he asked, “What’s this all about, Officer? Didn’t I pay my child support?”</p>

In the basement of the home were two females lying on a mattress. The women were naked from the waist <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>down, and their bodies were bruised. On the ankle of each woman was a heavy shackle with a long chain. In a corner of the basement the officers removed bags of dirt from a board covering a hole. In the hole lay a naked woman with her hands handcuffed behind her back and her ankle shackled. On returning to the first floor, the officers found in the kitchen six plastic bags containing human body parts.</p>

Each had agreed to accompany appellant to his home after being approached by him as he drove along the streets of North Philadelphia. Each had engaged in consensual sex with him before being choked until unconscious. While unconscious, each was carried to appellant’s basement and chained to a sewer pipe. As many as three women at a time were confined in the hole appellant had dug in the basement floor. Each of the women was beaten by appellant, and with the exception of the last woman taken captive, each was raped by appellant repeatedly. Although Josephina Rivera and the three women rescued on March 24, 1987 survived the brutalities inflicted on them by appellant, two other captives, Sandra Lindsay and Debra Dudley, did not.</p>

One method of punishment consisted of forcing the disobedient woman to stand suspended by her handcuffed wrist from a hook which appellant had installed in the basement rafters. Such punishment was administered to Sandra Lindsay for a period of three or four days in the first week of February, 1987. During that time, and for the preceding week, Ms. Lindsay was fed only bread and water. Also during that time, appellant forced one of the other captives to beat Ms. Lindsay because Ms. Lindsay was <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>taking too long to eat the bread she was given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On the third or fourth day of her punishment, Ms. Lindsay collapsed after telling the other women that she felt sick. Appellant removed the handcuff from Ms. Lindsay’s wrist and kicked her body into the hole in the basement floor. When appellant was unable to find Ms. Lindsay’s pulse, he announced to the other women that Ms. Lindsay was dead and carried her body to the kitchen. He then decapitated and dismembered the body. Ms. Lindsay’s head was placed in a large pot on the stove and boiled. Other of her body parts were shredded in a food processor and mixed with dog food, which appellant then fed to the other women. Still other parts of Ms. Lindsay’s body were put into plastic bags and placed in his freezer.</p>

Appellant told Ms. Dudley that unless she changed her attitude she would end up the same way Ms. Lindsay did. Appellant had previously stated to Ms. Rivera that he considered Ms. Dudley to be “a pain in the ass” and that he “wanted to get rid of her.” (N.T. 6/20/88, p. 231, p. 154). On March 17, 1987, appellant administered an electrical shock to Ms. Dudley and two of the other captives as they lay trapped in the basement hole which appellant had filled with water. Appellant attached an electrical wire to Ms. Dudley’s metal chain causing her to scream out in prolonged pain. When Ms. Dudley’s screaming stopped abruptly, appellant lifted the board covering the hole and removed Ms. Dudley’s body. Appellant then placed the body in a freezer in his basement; he later disposed of the body in a state forest in New Jersey. After Ms. Dudley’s death, appellant ordered Josephina Rivera to write the following note: “Gary Heidnik and Josephina Rivera electrocuted Debra Dudley on March 17th in the basement of 3520 North Marshall Street by electrocution.” (N.T. 6/20/88 at 161). Appellant then told Ms. Rivera that she <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>would no longer need to be handcuffed because the incriminating note would prevent her from going to the police. Appellant also told Ms. Rivera that, even if he were arrested, he would simply go into court and “act crazy” by saluting the judge, among other things. Appellant explained to Ms. Rivera that somewhere in the law it states that if a person acts crazy for a certain amount of years, his case is eventually thrown out. (N.T. 6/20/88, p. 168).</p>

Dr. McKenzie stated that appellant’s conduct during this time period was controlled by an “infant brain” with the chronological age of seventeen months. Dr. McKenzie reached this conclusion based on the fact that appellant’s mother gave birth to another child when appellant was seventeen months old. When appellant’s estranged wife notified appellant in October, 1986 that she had had a baby, Dr. McKenzie concluded that, “This took him back to the first time when the most <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>important woman in the world to him, his mother, left him and had a baby. And at that point, the trauma in the present [being told that his estranged wife had borne a child] returned him to a trauma at age seventeen months, and he began to experience the world through the eyes of the seventeen month old.

Sandra Lindsay’s killing occurred during a kidnapping, supporting the finding that appellant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony. The evidence that Ms. Lindsay was hung by the wrist from a ceiling hook for three or four days, was fed only bread and water during that time, and was subjected to beatings as she hung from the hook is sufficient to support the finding of the sentencing jury that appellant killed Ms. Lindsay by means of torture.</p>

As with Ms. Lindsay, Ms. Dudley’s death occurred during a kidnapping, supporting the jury’s finding that appellant killed her during the perpetration of a felony. The evidence that Ms. Dudley’s death occurred as the result of electrical charges being administered to her while she lay in a water-filled pit and screamed in agony, supports the jury’s finding that Ms. Dudley also was killed by means of torture. The fact that two other women in metal chains were in that water-filled pit with Ms. Dudley when appel<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>lant administered the electrical charge, supports the finding of a grave risk to others. The death of Ms. Lindsay, which occurred prior to Ms. Dudley’s death, supports the finding of a murder committed before the offense at issue.</p>
    <p id="b563-5" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[207,526,1153,523]]]'>In addition to the foregoing aggravating circumstances, the sentencing jury found the existence of the following mitigating circumstance with regard to the murders of both Ms. Lindsay and Ms. Dudley: “The defendant has no significant history of prior criminal convictions.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1). The jury then unanimously found that this mitigating circumstance was outweighed by the aforementioned aggravating circumstances and, pursuant to 42 Pa.C. S.A. 9711(c)(l)(iv), fixed appellant’s sentence at death for the murder of each woman.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
