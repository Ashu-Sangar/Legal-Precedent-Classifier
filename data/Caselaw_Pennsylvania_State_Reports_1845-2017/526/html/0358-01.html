Section 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, however, is clearly a special provision since it concerns a narrow class of accidents (those involving employees who are making claims against their employers), and it prevails over the more general terms of the MVFRL unless it is the <em>manifest intention of the General Assembly </em>that the general provision prevail. The legislature has not manifested such an intention. We conclude, therefore, that section 303(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Law is an exception to the general rule of Section 1787 of the MVFRL, and that under the terms of the MVFRL a self-insured employer may not be required to pay both uninsured motorist benefits and workers’ compensation benefits to an employee who has received a work-related injury.</p>

According to the majority interpretation, the claimants whose claims are covered by insurance companies are entitled to uninsured motorist benefits and workmen’s compensation benefits, while the claimants whose claims are covered by a self-insured employer are <em>only </em>entitled to workmen’s compensation benefits.</p>
