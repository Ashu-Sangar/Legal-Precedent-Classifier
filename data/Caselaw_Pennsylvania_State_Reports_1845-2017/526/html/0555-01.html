    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[213,382,1154,1051]]]'>Viewed in accordance with that standard, the evidence presented at trial established the following facts. On June 16, 1988, Sally Weiner received a telephone call purportedly from a congressman’s office asking that she meet with the caller to discuss arrangements for the presentation of a civic award to her husband. The next day, around noon, she drove to the agreed meeting place, parked her car, and was never seen again alive. Several hours later, her husband, Harry, manager of the Corry office of Pennbank, received a telephone call playing a recorded message from his wife telling him she had been kidnapped and that the kidnapper demanded ransom money from the bank. Mr. Weiner was directed to retrieve a duffel bag from the parking lot outside his bank; the bag contained additional threats and instructions. Mr. Weiner called a vice president of the bank, as well as the bank’s security office, local police, state police, and the FBI. Mr. Weiner never received the additional radio instructions necessary to follow the directions contained in the duffel bag and therefore did not comply with the kidnapper’s demands.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[211,1451,1154,195]]]'>Sally Weiner’s body was discovered two days later on June 19, 1988, in a rural area north of her home. She had died as the result of a gunshot wound to the back of her head.</p>
    <p id="b651-6" data-blocks='[["BL_651.6",651,[212,1672,1153,468]]]'>Initial investigations by the FBI, state police, and local police resulted in the discovery of a series of computer-generated notes and instructions, each one leading to another, which had been concealed at various hiding places in and around Corry, Pennsylvania. The investigation also produced several possible suspects, including appellant, David Copenhefer, who owned a nearby bookstore, had had unproductive transactions with Mr. Weiner’s bank, and apparently had bad personal relations with the Weiners.</p>

Subsequent search warrants resulted in seizure of incredibly <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>comprehensive evidence against appellant. This included evidence tying appellant’s fingerprints, computer, weapons and ammunition, clothing, automobile, and materials from his home and office to the victim or the murder site.</p>
    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.4",652,[259,495,1157,1102]]]'>His fingerprints appeared on the original ransom note and on some of the hidden notes. Police discovered rough drafts of the ransom note, a map of the hidden notes, as well as the notes and directions themselves in appellant’s handwriting, some of which bore his fingerprints. Appellant had a collection of guns, including two which might have fired the fatal bullet. He also had glazier ammunition, a nonstandard composition designed to fragment on impact so that after entering a body it will not exit and injure another person, of the type used to murder Mrs. Weiner. A metal rod from his home had been used to secure one of the hidden notes. Crepe paper torn from a roll at his store had been used to help secure another note. Human female skin tissue was found on his clothing. Tread marks matching appellant’s automobile tires were found at one hiding place and at the murder scene. Finally, appellant’s computer contained a series of drafts and amendments of the texts of the phone call to Mrs. Weiner on Thursday, the phone call to Mr. Weiner on Friday, the ransom note, the series of hidden notes, and a twenty-two point plan for the entire kidnapping scheme.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[257,1617,1154,202]]]'>Taken together, the circumstantial evidence presented at appellant’s trial pointed overwhelmingly to his guilt. We conclude that there is sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict against him.</p>
    <p id="b652-6" data-blocks='[["BL_652.6",652,[254,1843,1155,470]],["BL_653.1",653,[232,273,1154,415]]]'>Appellant’s first argument, to be fully understood, requires some knowledge of computer terminology and technology. Appellant, after using his computer to draft documents related to the kidnapping and ransom of Mrs. Weiner, attempted to erase or delete them from his computer’s memory. In fact, what he accomplished was to delete the names of the documents from the directory or index of files contained in the computer’s memory. But employing the “delete” function on his computer did <em>not </em>actually <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>eliminate the files from his computer’s internal “hard drive.” The files remained in the computer’s memory until subsequent usage might have required the hard-drive storage space occupied by the “deleted” files, at which time the files would have been written over by new data and thereby displaced. In appellant’s case, however, subsequent usage never displaced the files in question and they remained in the memory of his computer.</p>
    <p id="b653-4" data-blocks='[["BL_653.4",653,[232,706,1153,311]]]'>There are software programs designed to retrieve such documents from a computer’s hard drive after they have been deleted from directories of files in storage. FBI agent A1 Johnson, a computer expert, employed such a software program to delve into appellant’s computer and retrieve the files which appellant mistakenly believed he had destroyed.</p>
    <p id="b653-5" data-blocks='[["BL_653.5",653,[230,1036,1155,523]]]'>Appellant now argues that even though his computer was validly seized pursuant to a warrant, his attempted deletion of the documents in question created an expectation of privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment. Thus, he claims, under <em>Katz v. United States, </em><a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">389 U.S. 347</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">88 S.Ct. 507</a>, <a href="/us/389/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="389 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="11339173" data-case-paths="/us/389/0347-01">19 L.Ed.2d 576</a> (1967), and its progeny, Agent Johnson’s retrieval of the documents, without first obtaining another search warrant, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and the documents thus seized should have been suppressed.</p>
    <p id="b653-6" data-blocks='[["BL_653.6",653,[229,1578,1153,736]]]'>Appellant appears to be arguing that there is a constitutionally significant difference between 1) intentionally storing a document in a personal computer’s memory and 2) unintentionally leaving the document in the computer’s memory by failing to delete it properly. In the first instance, a warrant authorizing seizure of the computer would authorize reproduction of any documents stored therein. Appellant argues that his attempted deletion or destruction of the documents creates a new and different legally and constitutionally protected right of privacy, requiring a second or additional warrant prior to conducting a search. He informs us that this is a question of first impression, never having been addressed directly by any appellate court in the country.</p>
    <p id="b654-4" data-blocks='[["BL_654.3",654,[257,264,1153,465]]]'>
      <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>We cannot accept appellant’s argument. A defendant’s attempt to secrete evidence of a crime is not synonymous with a legally cognizable expectation of privacy. A mere hope for secrecy is not a legally protected expectation. If it were, search warrants would be required in a vast number of cases where warrants are clearly not necessary. Although we are aware of no cases addressing appellant’s specific argument, many analogous situations do not require police officers to obtain a <em>second </em>search warrant.</p>
    <p id="b654-5" data-blocks='[["BL_654.4",654,[252,749,1156,681]]]'>A paper tablet, seized pursuant to a valid search warrant, may be subjected to scientific and physical manipulation and analysis without a second search warrant. Appellant would argue that if the owner of the tablet had removed and destroyed the top page on which he had written a message, a second search warrant would be required to permit the state to decipher the message by enhancing the second-page indentations caused by the pressure of the pen upon the missing top page. Yet no one would deny that a second search warrant is not required in those circumstances despite the writer’s obvious attempt to mask his message, as his hope for privacy does not amount to a legally protected expectation of privacy.</p>
    <p id="b654-6" data-blocks='[["BL_654.5",654,[249,1449,1155,522]]]'>The same would be true of a diary recorded in a private code. If we accepted appellant’s argument, after seizing the diary pursuant to a valid search warrant, the state would be obligated to obtain a second warrant before it could attempt to read the diary by deciphering the code. Yet the diarist’s obvious attempt to achieve secrecy does not create a legally protected expectation of privacy nor the need to obtain a warrant before subjecting legally seized physical evidence to scientific testing and analysis to make it divulge its secrets.</p>
    <p id="b654-7" data-blocks='[["BL_654.6",654,[247,1990,1153,310]],["BL_655.1",655,[204,303,1154,370]]]'>These examples prove the fallacy in appellant’s argument. An attempt to destroy evidence is not equivalent to a legally protected expectation of privacy. Appellant’s unsuccessful attempt to delete documents or files from his computer did not create a legally protected expectation of privacy which would have required a second warrant before <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>the prosecution applied technology to elicit the content of files buried in the memory of the computer. At best, appellant had the hope of achieving secrecy, but his hope did not prohibit the state from subjecting validly seized physical evidence from any scientific analysis possible within current technology. We therefore reject appellant’s second argument.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[204,711,1154,905]]]'>The next issue is whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress statements made by appellant to members of the district attorney’s office while appellant was in pretrial confinement. In reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must first determine whether the issue underlying the claim is of arguable merit. If the claim lacks merit, the inquiry ceases, as counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a baseless issue. If the claim has merit, we must determine whether the course of action chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests. Finally, appellant must show that counsel’s ineffectiveness so prejudiced his case that he was denied a fair trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Rollins, </em><a href="/pa/525/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="525 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1823774" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0335-01">525 Pa. 335</a>, 344, <a href="/pa/525/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="525 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1823774" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0335-01">580 A.2d 744</a>, 748 (1990).

When the district attorney received appellant’s letter requesting a meeting, he wrote to appellant, with copies to defense counsel, stating that a meeting could be held, with or without the presence of counsel, but that a witness would have to be present. Appellant expressed his continued desire to hold the meeting, without defense counsel, and subsequently met with the assistant district attorney and Erie County detective Mark Watts. At the beginning of the meeting, appellant executed a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>

When asked whether he ever did anything like that, he said he demonstrated how to shoot someone in the head without severing the medulla so that the victim would linger for hours before dying. He explained that his demonstration took place in June, 1988, on the twentieth anniversary of the assassination of Senator Robert P. Kennedy.</p>

      <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, you must now decide the sentence, to sentence this defendant to death or life imprisonment. Your sentence will be dependent upon what you find about aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and as I have stated, the Sentencing Code defines aggravating and mitigating circumstances as those things that make a first degree case either more terrible or less terrible. A mitigating circumstance is anything about the defendant or the crime which in fairness and mercy should be taken into account in deciding punishment. Even when there is no excuse or justification for the crime, our law requires consideration of more than just the bare facts of the crime.</blockquote>

Mitigating circumstances are any facts relating to the defendant’s character, education, environment, mentality, life and background, or any aspect of the crime itself which may be considered extenuating, or as reducing his moral culpability, or making him less deserving of the extreme punishment of death. You may consider as mitigating circumstances any circumstance which tends to justify the penalty of life imprisonment.</blockquote>

On the other hand, each of you is free to regard a particular mitigating circumstance as present despite what other jurors may believe. This different treatment of aggravating and mitigating circumstances is one of the law’s safeguards against unjust death sentences. It gives a defendant the full benefit of any mitigating circumstances. It is closely related to the burden of proof requirements. Remember, the Commonwealth must prove any aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, while the defendant need only prove any mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. If you do find that an alleged aggravating circumstance was proven, that does not automatically or necessarily mean that you should sentence Mr. Copenhefer to death. Instead, such a finding only means that you must consider other factors, and more specifically, mitigating circumstances, before deciding whether a sentence of death or life imprisonment is appropriate.</blockquote>

I’m dealing specifically with part 2 b, in which you must check off either one or two as it is applicable. You didn’t check off either one of them. I think I understand which one it is, I don’t know that it’s necessary for you to leave the jury box. I’m going to return this to you, to the foreman so that he can look at that, and determine — and make a determination.

Where the absence of a prior record is not in dispute, as in this case, the sentencing jury has no discretion whether or not to consider it as the General Assembly has made it clear that this circumstance is a <em>mandatory </em>subject for jury consideration. Indeed, it would be nonsensical to suppose that the General Assembly actually intended to vest the sentencing phase jury with the discretionary authority to find that a defendant <em>did </em>have a prior record when there was <em>no </em>evidence to that effect. This is especially true where the prosecution and the defense had in fact stipulated to the contrary.</p>

Therefore, the jury was precluded from reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence as to this mitigating circumstance.</p>

The magnitude of the trial judge’s failure to properly charge on this point is readily apparent in this case, as the jury did find two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. Although it could be argued that the two aggravating circumstances as found outweighed the one mitigating, which should have been found, the legislature has specifically stated that such a decision be made by the jury. Thus, it was reversible error for the trial judge to have accepted the sentence as recommended by the jury.</p>

In <em>Lemanski, </em>the defendant was charged with various criminal acts which revolved around the growing of marijuana plants in his home. The Commonwealth had entered into a stipulation with the defense that the marijuana in question was for "personal use.” However, during his closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor argued that the jury could disregard the stipulation and use their own judgment to decide if the defendant intended to sell the marijuana. The trial court then instructed the members of the jury that it was their decision to determine what "personal use” meant under the circumstances of the case. The Superior Court properly held that the prosecutor's disregard for the stipulation and the trial court’s interpretation of the stipulation constituted reversible error. The Court nonetheless found the error harmless in that case as the defendant was not convicted of possession with intent to deliver.</p>
