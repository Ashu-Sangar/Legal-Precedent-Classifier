Post-trial motions were filed and denied by the court and the appellant was sentenced to an aggregate period of incarceration of from five (5) to ten (10) years. He then appealed his judgment of sentence to the Superior Court and during the pendency of that appeal requested a remand of his case to the Court of Common Pleas based upon after-discovered evidence. The case was remanded and a hearing was conducted for consideration of the after-discovered evidence which evidence consisted of the recantation of the trial testimony of the victim’s sister. After this additional evidence was heard, the Court of Common Pleas reaffirmed its order of sentence dated July 16, 1984 and the case was returned to the Superior Court which affirmed <a href="/citations/?q=387%20Pa.%20Super.%20652" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="387 Pa.

H. A.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> petition. During the course of representation the appellant informed counsel that he was approached by one of the alternate jurors who stated that several of the jurors, in the presence of all others, expressed their distaste for sex offenders, their feeling that he was guilty and their desire to conclude the matter promptly in order that they might return home. Present counsel, in a P.C.H.A. petition <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>filed with the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County on October 1, 1986, alleged that the appellant was denied his right to a trial by an impartial jury and that trial counsel was ineffective. The petition was denied by order dated April 28,1989, without a hearing, and affirmed on appeal by the Superior Court which in a Memorandum Opinion, dated December 13, 1988, held that the appellant had waived the right to raise the issue of the impartiality of the jurors. Thereafter a timely application for reargument was filed with the Superior Court which denied reargument by order dated January 31, 1989. A petition for allowance of appeal was filed with this Court which was granted by order dated August 2, 1989.</p>

Additionally he asserts that trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in that regard constitutes an extraordinary circumstance which should not act as bar to Post-Conviction relief and that the denial of his petition by the P.C.H.A. court without the holding of an evidentiary hearing was error.</p>

This practice, we determined, violated the defendant’s right to an impartial jury for the reasons that: 1) since the prosecution’s evidence is presented first, any initial opinions formed by the jurors are likely to be unfavorable to the defendant, and there is a tendency for a juror to pay greater attention to evidence that confirms his initial opinion; 2) once a juror declares himself before his fellow jurors he is likely to stand by his opinion even if contradicted by subsequent evidence; 3) the defendant is entitled to have his casé considered by the jury as a whole, not by separate groups or cliques that might be formed with the jury prior to the conclusion of the case; 4) jurors might form premature conclusions without having had the benefit of the court’s instructions concerning what law they are to apply to the facts of the case; 5) jurors might form premature conclusions without having heard the final arguments of both sides. <em><a href="/pa/508/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="508 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1794077" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0418-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/508/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="508 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1794077" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0418-01">508 Pa. at 422, 423</a>, <a href="/pa/508/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="508 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="1794077" data-case-paths="/pa/508/0418-01">498 A.2d at 831-832</a>.</p>

By instructing the jurors to “keep an open mind throughout the trial” and that their duty was to be “the kind of juror that if you were vitally interested in the outcome of this case, you’d want someone like yourself to be a juror,” the majority concludes that any prejudice from preconceived impressions or opinions has been vitiated. Finally, the majority concludes that any reliance upon our decision in <em>Commonwealth v.

It is for this reason that we permit peremptory challenges and challenges for cause. Pa.R.Cr.P. 1106. In the later case, a judge makes a determination that some response has been given which demonstrates a prospective juror’s inability to determine the case to be heard on the record to be made, <em>Commonwealth v.

See Opinion p. 145-146. Here the jurors <em>emphatically </em>expressed their opinion that Appellant <em>was </em>guilty and that it was an “open and shut case.” I am hard pressed to conclude in this instance as the majority has <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>that the jurors’ statements reflect a lack of predetermination of guilt and an ability to set aside these preconceived impressions and opinions.</p>

As such, it should make no difference that the jurors’ preconceived notions were not discovered until after the trial. The critical factor is not the lack of discovery, but rather the lack of impartiality and the effect of that lack of impartiality.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.5",240,[237,941,1153,568]]]'>In its zest to affirm the actions of the lower courts, the majority parenthetically concludes that even if Appellant’s underlying claim of ineffectiveness had merit, the strategy chosen by trial counsel in pursuing a new trial on the basis of recantation of a witness’s testimony rather than the juror’s impartiality, though unsuccessful, was reasonable. Unfortunately, the majority reaches its conclusion without the benefit of any testimony from trial counsel explaining his reasoning for not pursuing the impartiality issue. Without trial counsel’s insight, the majority’s reasoning is based upon mere speculation and conjecture and thus flawed.</p>

However, I read our Constitution as requiring that prospective jurors not be predisposed. Since it is arguable that several jurors were <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>predisposed and trial counsel failed to pursue that issue, I would find that the lower court erred in dismissing the Appellant’s Post-Conviction Hearing Act Petition without a hearing and would remand this matter to the Court of Common Pleas for the development of a full record.</p>
