The tires were delivered with holes in them which rendered them worthless.

Thus, if the buyer of the tires proved that he would have resold the tires for $5,000, he would be able to claim an additional $2,500 for loss of tire profits; the difference between what he would have earned from the sale of the tires and what he actually did earn from the sale (or lack of sales) from the tires.</p>

The lost gasoline sales are comparable to the lost <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>cattle sales in <em>Kassab. </em>The distinction between the two cases is that the Kassabs had bought the feed all at one time and thus all their livestock was affected. The instant plaintiffs bought their gasoline in regular intervals and could only earn a profit on what they could sell per month. The defendant’s argument — that the plaintiffs sold all the gasoline they bought — misses the point. While they may have sold every gallon, they sold significantly fewer gallons during the period that ARCO allegedly delivered nonconforming gasoline. Thus, during this period, the plaintiffs’ lost sales were just as directly attributable to the defective gasoline as the lost profits were attributable to the defective tires in the example we used previously.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

It is reasonable to assume that if the gasoline sales dropped dramatically, there was a ripple effect on the mini-mart sales. Additionally, when a primary product does not conform to the warranty, we believe that it is foreseeable that there will be a loss of secondary profits. Thus, permitting these damages would correspond with the requirement of foreseeability as set forth in <em>Lampus, supra, </em>and the Code.

Additionally, we do not believe that our case law or the Uniform Commercial Code authorizes a legitimate claim for exemplary damages and thus affirm the lower court’s dismissal of such claim.

There are a number of different ways that damages may be removed from the realm of speculation and be submitted to the jury with a rational basis from which the amount can be inferred. As long as the method of proof provides the jury with “a reasonable basis” for calculating damages, the issue should be submitted to the trier of fact.

Recovery of good will damages, meaning loss of prospective profits and business reputation, is not at issue in this case. The majority states that the plaintiffs did not make a claim for good will damages. Where no claim for such damages has been made, it is jurisprudentially unsound for this Court to raise and decide the issue. While the discussion and what might be seen as a purported decision on this point is readily dismissed as dicta, and I am inclined to disagree with it, it would be preferable, to say the least, that the issue not be addressed until we are presented with a case where good will damages are at issue.</p>
