Costigan, an attorney licensed to practice law in this Commonwealth, was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County upon two counts of theft by deception, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3922; two counts of theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3927; two counts of theft, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3921; one count of criminal conspiracy, 18 Pa.C.S. § 903; and one count of aiding in the consummation of crime, 18 Pa.C.S. § 5107. The convictions arose from <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>actions taken by Costigan in the course of assisting certain of his clients in the settlement of an estate. In June of 1984, Costigan was sentenced to a two to five year term of imprisonment, and a fine of $5,000 was imposed. Consequently, on July 13, 1984, pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 214(d) (relating to attorneys convicted of crimes), this Court suspended Costigan from the bar.</p>

The convictions were affirmed. In 1988, a hearing committee received testimony on the petition, and, in September of 1989, it recommended that Costigan be suspended from the bar for a period of five years, that the suspension should end upon completion of Costigan’s prison and parole obligations,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and that the suspension should be retroactive to the period during which Costigan was suspended under the July 13, 1984 order of this Court. The Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed exceptions to the recommendation of the <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>hearing committee, and requested that the Disciplinary Board (Board) find that Costigan should be disbarred.</p>
    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[196,408,1154,570]]]'>On February 7,1990, the Board filed a report recommending that Costigan be disbarred retroactive to July 13, 1984. The report rejected Costigan’s contention that his conduct reflected only poor judgment, and concluded that he was guilty of misconduct and must be disbarred in order to protect the public and maintain the integrity of the bar. It also concluded that Costigan’s actions reflected a serious lack of judgment, and that, although his prior disciplinary record was unblemished, he allowed himself to be manipulated by his clients into the commission of numerous unethical acts.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[196,1007,1154,1001]]]'>In light of Costigan's convictions, there is no question presented as to whether misconduct occurred. Pa.R. D.E. 214(e) states that a certificate of conviction serves as <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the commission of a crime in any disciplinary proceeding commenced against an attorney based upon the conviction. Further, there is no question that some form of discipline is warranted, for Pa.R.D.E. 203(b) establishes that conviction of a serious crime is in itself a basis for discipline. In pertinent part, Pa.R.D.E. 203(b) provides: “The following shall ... be grounds for discipline: (1) Conviction of a crime which under Enforcement Rule 214 (relating to attorneys convicted of crimes) may result in suspension.” Hence, although pertinent Disciplinary Rules were certainly violated by Costigan’s criminal conduct, see fn. 1 supra, a precise recitation of the Rules and determination of which of them were violated is unnecessary since the criminal convictions provide a <em>per se </em>basis for discipline. We must decide, therefore, only the extent of discipline that is warranted.</p>

    <p id="b112-6" data-blocks='[["BL_112.6",112,[244,1521,1157,795]]]'>In May of 1981, Steven Booras, alleged to be a drug dealer, loan shark, and organized crime figure, was murdered in a restaurant in Philadelphia. On May 31, 1981, Costigan was contacted by John Booras, a brother of the deceased mobster, concerning administration of the decedent's estate. John Booras had been referred by a local political functionary. The following day, Costigan met with John Booras and Chryais Fiammetta, the sister of John and Steven Booras. At this meeting, Fiammetta and Booras related that decedent had one other brother, Henry Booras. The siblings told Costigan that decedent had also had a son named Theodore, but that Theodore died years earlier. Fiammetta mentioned, however, that the undertaker arranging the decedent’s funeral had received a phone call from someone claiming to be Theodore Booras.</p>

Fiammetta revealed that she was the beneficiary of a bank certificate of deposit in the amount of $140,000 and three smaller certificates of deposit totaling $40,000. The parties told Costigan that they were certain that decedent had a will, but that they had conducted a search and were unable to locate it.</p>

Fiammetta stated that she had given this information to the F.B.I. and that she was going to provide it to the I.R.S. That same day, Costigan discovered that John Booras had removed some money from a safe-deposit box which he had jointly owned with the decedent at Provident Savings Bank. John Booras also attempted to remove cash, jewelry, and coins from a safe-deposit box which he had shared with the decedent at Philadelphia National Bank, but officials at that institution were aware of the death of Steven Booras and did not permit any property to be removed from the box. Officials at Philadelphia National Bank conducted a search to determine whether the safe-deposit box contained a will, but none was found.</p>

John Booras brought a flight bag to this meeting, at Costigan’s office, and the bag contained the money taken from the house. Costigan determined that the three siblings should serve as co-administrators of their brother’s estate, inasmuch as <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>there was substantial animosity between the family members. He also prepared a petition for letters of administra-, tion, listing the three siblings as co-administrators. The petition disclosed that the decedent had a son, Theodore Booras, who had not been seen in thirteen years and might be deceased. As assets of the estate, Costigan listed personal property in the amount of just $50,000 and no real property. Costigan claims that he planned to revise upwards the value of the, property declared when an estate inventory was filed. After filing the petition for letters of administration, the parties returned to Costigan’s office, at which time they counted and divided up all of the money contained in John Booras’ flight bag. The cash totaled in excess of $270,000. Each of the siblings took a one-third share, i.e., approximately $85,500, and Costigan kept $10,-000 as a retainer to be credited towards his total fee for handling the estate. He also retained $4,000 in cash and $1,000 in rental checks from the New Jersey property, which he used to open a checking account for the estate.</p>
    <p id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[224,1311,1155,577]]]'>The next day, June 5, 1981, the three administrators and Costigan met again at Costigan’s office. John Booras brought with him two cases containing coins and bills of numismatic value and jewelry, which he had removed from the house he shared with the decedent. The jewelry was subsequently appraised at approximately $27,000. A ring which was not brought to this meeting but which nevertheless belonged to the decedent was appraised for an additional $10,000. The jewelry was eventually divided among the siblings. Decedent’s estate also included a Mercedes automobile appraised at approximately $25,500.</p>

The attorney requested that the siblings resign as co-administrators of the estate. On June 12, 1981, Costigan met with the attorney and one of the attorney’s partners. Costigan informed them regarding the Mercedes and certain other property included in the estate. He recounts that he “basically told them everything that had transpired with the <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>estate with the exception of the distribution of the cash and jewelry that had occurred in my office.” He asserts that he did not reveal the distribution of cash and jewelry because of attorney-client confidentiality. The attorney for Theodore Booras subsequently prepared a petition to have the letters of administration revoked. Costigan answered the petition with a denial of Theodore Booras’ existence. Steven Booras was in fact survived by Theodore Booras, but Costigan claims that he was not certain of this at the time.</p>

The petition contained a statement that there were no persons more closely related to the deceased than those who were signing.

The petition was prepared by th'e attorney who had been representing Theodore Booras, and it asserted that Costigan had counseled the siblings to conceal and dispose of assets to avoid having property fall into the hands of Theodore Booras. Costigan was subsequently convicted of the aforementioned conspiracy and theft-related crimes, largely on the basis of testimony given by Fiammetta. The convictions stand as a rejection of Costigan’s claim, at trial and in this disciplinary proceeding, that he did nothing to conceal assets.</p>
