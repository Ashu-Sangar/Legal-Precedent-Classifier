In balancing the competing interests of zoning restrictions and property owners’ rights, <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>this Court has never before considered a zoning ordinance which expressly provides for the amortization of a pre-existing, lawful, nonconforming use. I believe that a <em>per se </em>prohibition against amortization provisions is too restrictive. A community should have a right to change its character without being locked into pre-existing definitions of what is offensive. As this Court has also noted, “nonconforming uses, inconsistent with a basic purpose of zoning, represent conditions which should be reduced to conformity as speedily as is compatible with the law and the Constitution.” <em>Hanna v. Board of Adjustment of Borough of Forest Hills, </em><a href="/pa/408/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="408 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1308422" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0306-01">408 Pa. 306</a>, 312-13, <a href="/citations/?q=183%20A.2d%20539" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="183 A.2d 539">183 A.2d 539</a>, 543 (1962). I believe that amortization provisions are an effective method of reconciling interests of the community with those of property owners. Where the provisions are reasonable in consideration of the elements herein discussed, they provide adequate notice to the property owner so that no deprivation of property or use thereof is suffered, yet they simultaneously afford a township the opportunity to alter the character of its neighborhoods when the alteration takes the form of a reasonable land use regulation.</p>
    <p id="b290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_290.4",290,[254,1405,1154,796]]]'>In this case, however, the amortization provision is not a reasonable one because it fails to provide adequate time for elimination of the nonconforming use. The period allowed for the dissolution of appellant’s business is ninety days. Certainly ninety days is an insufficient period of time to allow a merchant to close a business. Any contractual obligations appellant has incurred in anticipation of operating the business probably cannot be terminated within such a short period of time without severe hardship on appellant’s part. Three months also would not permit appellant to obtain an alternative means of income. Moreover, forcing appellant to liquidate his enterprise within ninety days could prevent him from obtaining a reasonable return on his investment. I therefore agree that the instant provision is confiscatory.</p>
