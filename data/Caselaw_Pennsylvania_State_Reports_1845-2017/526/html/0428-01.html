      <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>Any difficulty in answering this question springs primarily from two factors. First is the hybrid nature of a probation revocation hearing, which has elements approximating the adjudicatory stage of a juvenile proceeding as well as elements partaking of the dispositional phase of the juvenile process. Determining whether to treat the probation revocation as adjudicatory or dispositional is tantamount to determining the ultimate issue in the case, <em>viz., </em>whether traditionally inadmissible hearsay testimony can be the sole basis for a deprivation of liberty. Second, the guidance of precedent is almost entirely limited to analyses under the federal Constitution. That is, most cases which shed light on the question<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> are analyses of the strictures imposed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Although binding, the federal due process clause may not be controlling if the due process clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution sets a higher standard.</p>
    <p id="b523-5" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[220,1242,1153,690]]]'>The Pennsylvania Constitution was adopted prior to the federal Constitution, and using the language of the Magna Charta (“Nullus liber homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut dissaisiatur, aut utlagetur ... nisi per legale judicium parium suorum, vel per legem terrae”) which has been incorporated virtually word for word in Article I, Section 9, states that an accused cannot “be deprived of his life, liberty or property, unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.” The phrase “law of the land” is equivalent to the due process language in the federal Constitution, and has been referred to as “the due process clause of our state constitution.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Merely calling it adjudicatory, for instance, does not make it so. In reality, juvenile probation revocation is neither adjudicatory nor dispositional, strictly speaking, but has elements in common with both. Analogizing to adult criminal proceedings, we recognize that due process requires in probation and parole revocation proceedings some but not all of the safeguards necessarily afforded criminal defendants at trial, due to the unique character and purpose of the revocation proceeding. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em><a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">408 U.S. 471</a>, <a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">92 S.Ct. 2593</a>, <a href="/us/408/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="408 U.S. 471" data-case-ids="1782797" data-case-paths="/us/408/0471-01">33 L.Ed.2d 484</a> (1972); <em>Gagnon v.

However, I do not view this to be the posture of the case. Here the juvenile had been returned to the family home upon condition that he attend school “... without absences, lateness, or suspensions, and [the court] directed his probation officer to file a motion for unsatisfactory probation should Davis have more than two unexcused absences from school.” Majority op. p. 430.

It also reflected the court’s assessment that the household would <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>provide a structure for the rearing of a socially compatible individual. The father’s complaint, without regard to its validity or assigning blame to the minor, clearly reflected that the placement was not serving the intended purposes.

The information supplied to the court amply supported the conclusion that the home placement was not providing the support and stability expected. The Center afforded the opportunity to observe the minor and to determine his needs for a more appropriate placement.</p>
