At the time of argument, we entered an order remanding the case to the trial court for the appointment of new counsel and for an evidentiary hearing to determine the effectiveness of trial counsel. The trial court conducted hearings in accordance with that order and determined that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to file a pre-trial motion to suppress Appellant’s oral statement to the police and in using a particular trial strategy (admitting guilt and then arguing that the homicide rose no higher than second degree murder, or, in the alternative, that the death penalty was unwarranted).

(Appellant had become acquainted with Owens five months earlier.) On their first day in Meadville, Wednesday, October 16, 1985, Appellant and Owens discussed their lack of money and the fact that Owens knew the victim, Gerald Gase, an eighty-four year old man, who they could rob and may have to kill to prevent him from identifying Owens. Appellant and Owens visited the victim during the afternoon on that day but left without incident.</p>
    <p id="b342-6" data-blocks='[["BL_342.5",342,[253,1378,1159,954]],["BL_343.1",343,[192,317,1155,421]]]'>During the afternoon of Friday, October 18, 1985, Appellant and Owens went to the victim’s home again. The victim was in his front yard raking leaves. The couple’s plan was for Appellant to distract the victim while Owens snuck into his home to steal money. This plan was foiled when the victim went into his home for unknown reasons and locked the door behind him upon returning to the yard. Appellant and Owens left the victim’s home and went to a local bar. The relentless pair then returned to the victim’s home a third time at approximately 6:00 p.m. that same evening. Appellant, Owens and the victim talked in the kitchen for about thirty minutes and then moved into the living room to watch television. The victim received a phone call and went into the kitchen providing the couple with an opportunity to discuss the fact that they needed “to find some type of weapon to knock him [the victim] out with”. Trial Transcript (T.T.) March 19, 1986 at p. 298. Some time after the victim returned to the . living room, <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>Appellant went into the kitehen and feigned that he was getting a drink of water. In the kitchen he seized a pair of scissors from the kitchen table and tucked them into the waistband of his pants. When the victim left the room again to answer another phone call, Appellant positioned himself in front of a mantelpiece near the fireplace so that he would be hidden from the view of the victim when the victim returned to the living room.</p>
    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[191,769,1155,581]]]'>At this point Owens told Appellant, “Roger, I’ll tell you when to do it. I’ll tell you when he comes in”. T.T., March 19, 1986, at p. 305. When the victim entered the room Owens shouted, “Now” and the Appellant stabbed the victim with the scissors. The victim fell to the floor and was still living when Appellant removed his wallet and handed it to Owens. Owens removed approximately $100 from the wallet and then went through various drawers and closets wherein she found approximately $40 more. The couple left the victim’s home and Appellant threw the murder weapon into a bush at a neighboring house.</p>
    <p id="b343-5" data-blocks='[["BL_343.5",343,[190,1381,1155,305]]]'>The body of the victim was discovered on Sunday, October 20, 1990, by friends who became concerned when he did not answer his phone. The victim was discovered lying on the floor of his living room in a fetal position with a pool of blood under his head. He had been stabbed fifty-seven times.</p>
    <p id="b343-6" data-blocks='[["BL_343.6",343,[189,1724,1155,635]]]'>After beginning an investigation, the Meadville Police discovered that Owens and a traveling companion named Roger (the Appellant) were seen in the vicinity of the victim’s home around the time of the murder. Appellant and Owens became suspects. After tracing the couple’s whereabouts from Franklin, to Oil City and finally Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Meadville police learned that Owens may attempt to return to Forest Park, Ohio to pick up a welfare check at a residence where both she and Appellant were receiving mail. Meadville Police alerted the Forest Park Police Department to its investigation and to the fact that Appellant and Owens may be returning to Forest Park.</p>

Forest Park Police also checked Ohio’s “Regional Crime Information System” for outstanding warrants on Appellant and learned that there was a <em>capias </em>warrant (Pennsylvania’s equivalent to a bench warrant) for his arrest. The <em>capias </em>warrant was due to Appellant’s failure to appear after sentencing to pay a fine on a misdemeanor traffic violation (leaving the scene of an accident). Appellant would have been unable to post bond to secure his release because of a “no bond” stipulation placed on the <em>capias </em>warrant by the issuing judge.</p>

Meadville Police were immediately notified of the arrests. A Meadville police officer arrived in Forest Park, Ohio at 8:00 p.m. Saturday, November 2, 1985, to interview Appellant and Owens. The police officer read Appellant his Miranda rights and Appellant gave an inculpatory statement concerning the murder. Upon agreement, Appellant was moved to a room that was acoustically suited for tape recording and repeated his statement which was recorded on tape. During the course of the statement Appellant admitted killing the victim, identified the murder weapon as a pair of scissors and stated that he disposed of the murder weapon in a bush at a neighboring home. A warrant for Appellant’s arrest for the killing of Gerald Gase in Pennsylvania was issued shortly after midnight on Sunday, November 3, 1985. Appellant voluntarily waived extradition and was returned to Crawford County, Pennsylvania. Appellant testified at his own trial and admitted to killing the victim, he testified however, that he only stabbed the victim three or four times.</p>

Initially, Appellant questions the legality of his arrest and detention in Ohio asserting that it was merely a ruse to hold him until the arrival of Pennsylvania authorities.

Therefore, we must look to the law of Ohio to determine the legality of Appellant’s arrest.</p>
    <p id="b345-6" data-blocks='[["BL_345.6",345,[189,1192,1156,636]]]'>In this case Appellant was arrested pursuant to an outstanding non-bondable <em>capias </em>warrant issued by an Ohio judge before whom appellant failed to appear to pay a fine. The fine was imposed due to Appellant’s conviction for failure to stop at the scene of an accident. Ohio’s criminal statutes provide that a warrant may be issued for the arrest of an offender who fails to pay a fine imposed as part of a sentence in a criminal case and that “[a]ny offender held in custody pursuant to such an arrest shall be entitled to a hearing on the first regularly scheduled court day following the date of arrest ...”.

At the time of Appellant’s arrest the Hamilton County court system, which encompasses the city of Forest Park, Ohio, operated on a six day basis, excluding Sundays. It was the policy of that Court that anyone arrested after 5:00 a.m. on any particular day could not be placed on that day’s docket and was held until the following court day for arraignment. Since Appel<a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>lant was arrested on Saturday at 9:00 a.m. he could not have been taken before the judge who issued the <em>capias </em>warrant until Monday morning.

In relation to the issues discussed above, Appellant also argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing: 1) to determine the facts regarding his detention in Ohio; 2) to file a motion to suppress his statement to the police; and 3) to file a motion to suppress the physical evidence obtained as a result of that statement. Since we have already resolved the merits of the issues underlying these claims of ineffectiveness against the Appellant, we find that there was no ineffectiveness on the part of trial counsel. It is reasonable for counsel to decline to file motions or enter objections which are <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>without merit, reasonably certain to fail, or unsupported by law existing at the time of the proceedings. <em>Commonwealth v.

At the Sentencing Hearing the Commonwealth argued, in addition to the aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(8), that the Appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(6). The jury found both of these aggravating circumstances. Appellant offered as mitigating circumstances his underprivileged background and past work history, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8), his lack of a significant history of prior convictions, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1) and the fact that he acted under the substantial domination of another, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(5). As mitigating circumstances the jury found and listed the following: "underprivileged background — childhood”, "prior employment history and lack of known convictions for a fourteen-year period," and "influenced by another". T.T., March 20, 1986, at p. 423. In weighing the circumstances the jury determined that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and, thus, sentenced Appellant to death.</p>

Appellant raises several additional claims of ineffectiveness including that counsel was ineffective: in failing to question Appellant’s extradition from Ohio; in not permitting Appellant to proceed non-jury; in following a particular defense strategy; and in not preparing properly for the sentencing phase. We find each of these arguments meritless. Additionally, Appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective in failing to object when the trial court permitted the jurors to read a transcript of Appellant’s tape recorded confession while the tape was being played in court. The record reveals that counsel did object to this procedure. However, we find no abuse of discretion in the use of this procedure and have previously sanctioned the same. <em>Commonwealth v.
