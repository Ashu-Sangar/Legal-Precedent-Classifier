    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[224,902,1159,1310]]]'>We disagree with the court of common pleas that the statute is unconstitutional. First, it is inaccurate to say that the civil contemnor can never purge himself of contempt after the investigating grand jury has gone out of existence. By the plain terms of the statute, he may purge himself by testifying before the court. This Court has held that “the only limitations on civil contempt sentences are that they must be conditional and may not exceed the period in which the contemnor is able to comply,” and a civil contemnor may not be sentenced “conditioned on the performance of some act that is incapable of performance.” <em>In Re Martorano, </em><a href="/pa/464/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="464 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1710345" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0066-01">464 Pa. 66</a>, 84, 80, <a href="/pa/464/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="464 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1710345" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0066-01">346 A.2d 22</a>, 31, 29 (1975). That requirement has been met by the statutory provision that the civil contemnor may testify before the supervising judge, even after the investigating grand jury has gone out of existence, to purge himself of contempt. We also disagree with the trial court’s observation that confinement beyond the term of the grand jury does nothing to aid the grand jury in procuring the witness’s testimony, for if the contemnor purges himself of contempt before the supervising judge, the court may make a record which may be used in the event the Commonwealth elects to convene another investigating grand jury based upon the contemnor’s new testimony. For these reasons, we conclude that the statute is constitutional.</p>

Both of these claims are without merit.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[201,521,1156,1060]]]'>At the root of Simon’s argument that the interruption of his underlying sentence during the pendency of the contempt sentence, and the reimposition of that sentence upon expiration of the contempt sentence constitutes double jeopardy is the assertion that the interruption and reimposition of the underlying sentence constitutes multiple punishment for the original drug offense. Simon was not sentenced more than once for the underlying felony. His sentence was three to fifteen years before he was found in civil contempt; it remained three to fifteen years during the pendency of the civil contempt sentence, which temporarily interrupted the original sentence; and when the civil contempt sentence ended, his original sentence remained three to fifteen years. It was never increased. It never changed. Rather, Simon himself caused the trial court to interrupt this sentence through his contemptuous behavior. As we have said, the trial court was well within its lawful powers in interrupting Simon’s sentence, and Simon will not be heard now to argue that his own contumacy somehow bootstrapped him into the position of a constitutional victim.</p>

It is also apparent that if the court were not able to suspend Simon’s previously imposed sentence while Simon was serving a sentence for civil contempt, the court would be powerless to give effect to its civil contempt citation, for Simon was already in prison and would be able to use his drug-related sentence to insulate himself from the coercive impact of a civil contempt sentence. But this Court has previously held that courts have the <em>inherent </em>power to enforce their orders by finding a contemnor in civil contempt of court, <em>Commonwealth v. Martorano, </em><a href="/pa/464/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="464 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1710345" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0066-01">464 Pa. 66</a>, 77, <a href="/pa/464/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="464 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="1710345" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0066-01">346 A.2d 22</a>, 27 (1975), <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>and 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(e) confers express statutory power to adjudge a contemnor in civil contempt.

Simon also argues that (1) the lower court improperly failed to consider his assertion that he was denied due process by not being allowed to challenge the original grant of immunity prior to his assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege; (2) the lower court erred in failing to consider his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; (3) he was denied due process by the trial court’s failure to appoint a "certified” interpreter; (4) he was denied due process because he was not advised either by the court or his counsel of his right to appeal his contempt convictions; (5) the lower court erred in failing to consider the due process implications of alleged prosecutorial misconduct during the grand jury proceedings; (6) the trial court failed to consider the argument that Simon was improperly subjected to punitive rather than coercive use of civil contempt. We have considered all of these arguments and have determined that they are without merit.</p>

Under the applicable statute, the contemnor is given no such opportunity since the basis for his contempt will not be relieved by the remedy provided by the legislature.

A trial judge’s role in our system of justice is not that of investigator, but a trier of fact. He is not concerned with supposition or prima facie evidence, but whether sufficient evidence has been establish to prove guilt or innocence. In the course of a trial, this significant role difference requires hearing evidence of both parties rather than exclusively the evidence of the Commonwealth. Finally, a trial judge functions in the context of an adversary proceeding. Section 5947(e) ignores this function by not only requiring a judge to take jurisdiction in a matter in which no proceeding is pending, but also reduces the role of the Supervising Judge to an adjunct investigator for the prosecuting attorney. Neither the Supervising Judge nor the Grand Jury can use any information obtained from a contemnor’s testimony. Rather the prosecuting attorney will be the only one to benefit from this testimony. Thus, the legislature is per<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>mitting the prosecuting attorney to use the Supervising Judge as a discovery tool.</p>

In support of its position that § 5947(e) is constitutional, the majority holds that permitting a witness to testify before a supervising judge aids a grand jury investigation by creating a record of that testimony which can be used if the Commonwealth elects to convene another grand jury. (See Slip Opinion at p. 10). Under this analysis the court <em>becomes </em>merely an appendage or vehicle of the grand jury and the prosecuting attorney’s office. I cannot accept this concept of relegating our judiciary to a conduit from whom the prosecuting attorney receives his requested information much as a house or senate committee reports to their respective bodies. The judiciary is not an arm of the prosecutor’s office, but an independent branch of government with specific constitutional powers and duties.</p>
