The charges consisted of three counts of “theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3927(a), and arose from Turrell’s misuse of funds from an escrow account while he was engaged in the practice of law. At issue is whether prima facie cases were established upon these charges and whether criminal liability was negated by the fact that Turrell returned to the escrow account all of the funds that he had misappropriated and eventually delivered the escrowed funds to the persons entitled thereto. The facts established at the preliminary hearing, on the three counts of theft, are as follows.</p>

On December 12, 1985, inasmuch as no action had been filed, BACC demanded an immediate return of the funds. This demand was repeated a number of times in the ensuing months. During this period there were numerous occasions when Turrell’s escrow account was overdrawn and when funds in the account were far below the level needed to cover the $7,000 in question. Turrell had used the $7,000 received from BACC to pay his own federal income taxes. Turrell belatedly returned the funds to BACC, with interest, on October 16, 1986.</p>

On October 15, 1986, Carter had his bank deliver to Turrell the sum of $7,912 which was to be transmitted to a third party to settle a claim against Carter. There was no discussion or agreement between Turrell and Carter regarding the manner in which the funds were to be kept pending their transfer to the third party, or as to the speed with which that transfer was to be made. Upon receipt of the $7,912, Turrell transferred nearly $7,300 of this sum to BACC. Approximately one month later, Turrell obtained a bank loan to replenish his escrow account. It is undisputed that, until the loan was obtained, there were insufficient funds in the escrow account to cover the $7,912. On November 28, 1986, Turrell delivered to the third party a check in the amount of $7,912 as settlement for the claim in question.</p>

On <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>approximately April 10, 1986, Turrell received $3,000 at a real estate closing when an estate which he represented sold certain real property. This sum, tendered by the purchaser, was subject to a written “Escrow Agreement,” signed by Turrell, providing that “the sum of $3,000 would be withheld from the closing proceeds and placed in escrow by J. Joel Turrell as Escrow Agent for the parties for the purpose of paying the inheritance taxes as soon as said taxes can be computed and a return filed.” As of July 18, 1988, the date of the preliminary hearing in this case, Turrell had not filed an inheritance tax return or paid the taxes. Turrell claims that various actions of the estate’s executors and beneficiaries hindered him from filing the tax return. On the date of the preliminary hearing there were sufficient funds in the escrow account to pay the taxes, and Turrell asserts that the taxes were subsequently paid. It is undisputed, however, that between April 10, 1986 and April 14, 1988, the period covered by this count, there were numerous occasions when Turrell’s escrow account was overdrawn or had a balance substantially below $3,000.</p>
    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[229,1396,1155,580]]]'>The question presented in this appeal is whether the courts below properly dismissed the charges heretofore described. A review of Turrell’s actions from the standpoint of professional ethics is not presently at issue. That Turrell’s actions fell below the standards set forth in the Disciplinary Rules governing members of the bar of this Court is not questioned. In August of 1988, by order of this Court, Turrell was disbarred by consent. This appeal concerns, therefore, only the question of whether the Commonwealth has established a prima facie case on each of the charges presented.</p>

A legal obligation to hold the funds in an escrow account (element 2) was plainly present, for the funds were accepted upon BACC’s express stipulation that they be held in escrow. As to whether there was a failure to make the required disposition (element 4), Turrell argues that inasmuch as funds were belatedly delivered to the one entitled thereto, i.e., BACC, that the required disposition was adequately made. In essence, Turrell’s contention is that the required distribution (“required payment or disposition,” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3927(a), supra at footnote 1) consists only of the ultimate and final distribution. We do not agree. In any given case, the required disposition may consist of one or more parts. There were clearly two components to the required disposition in the present case: <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>1.) holding the funds in escrow, and, 2.) delivering them from escrow as required. Holding the funds in escrow was not a mere option; rather, it was plainly and expressly required. Thus, it cannot be said that the first component was satisfied, even if the second was eventually met.</p>
    <p id="b140-5" data-blocks='[["BL_140.4",140,[241,566,1154,724]]]'>The same reasoning applies to count # 88-165, wherein Turrell accepted funds from a purchaser of real estate upon an express agreement that the funds would be held in escrow to pay certain inheritance taxes. Turrell plainly obtained the funds of another (element 1), and, by misappropriating them, dealt with them as his own (element 3). An agreement had been signed by Turrell obligating him to perform two actions: 1.) hold the funds in escrow, and, 2.) pay the inheritance taxes. Thus, there were two components to the required disposition (element 2). The first component of the required disposition, holding the funds in escrow, was plainly not met. This conclusion is not altered by the fact that Turrell may ultimately have secured payment of the taxes.</p>
    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.5",140,[239,1317,1153,247]]]'>We conclude, therefore, that prima facie cases have been established with respect to counts # 88-163 and # 88-165.

    <p id="b140-7" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[236,1596,1154,735]],["BL_141.1",141,[203,293,1152,259]]]'>In count #88-164, Turrell accepted funds from a client (element 1) to be transmitted to a designated third party but instead transferred the funds to BACC to cover his earlier misappropriation of BACC’s funds (element 3). Clearly, Turrell had an obligation to deliver the funds to the designated third party (element 2). The question arises, however, as to whether Turrell had an additional legal obligation to hold the funds in escrow pending their delivery to the third party. This question is pivotal, for, unless there existed such an obligation, a prima facie case on this count cannot be sustained. Turrell did, approximately five weeks after receiving the funds from his client, deliver to the third party the requisite sum. There had been no discussion between the client and Turrell regarding how <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>quickly this delivery was to be made. Given that the delivery was made, without apparent adverse consequences to Turrell’s client, we do not find that a delay of five weeks in itself provides a sufficient basis for finding that there was a failure to make the required disposition (element 4).</p>
    <p id="b141-5" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[202,587,1155,1170]]]'>We turn, therefore, to the question of whether there was an additional component to the required disposition, to wit, whether Turrell was obliged to have held the funds in escrow pending their disbursement to the third party. It is undisputed that there had been no discussion or agreement between Turrell and his client about the manner in which the funds were to be held. The Commonwealth alleges that an obligation to escrow nevertheless arose under the Code of Professional Responsibility which governed the conduct of members of the bar at the time Turrell performed the actions from which the present charges arose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The Code of Professional Responsibility plainly mandated that commingling of the funds of clients with those of lawyers be avoided, and that clients’ funds be held in identifiable bank accounts commonly known as client fund trust accounts. EC 9-5; DR 9-102. Without question, Turrell violated these requirements. As noted supra, discipline has been imposed in the form of disbarment by consent. The present issue is not, however, whether Turrell breached the requirements of professional responsibility, but rather whether he breached a “legal obligation” (element 2) to hold funds in escrow.</p>

In <em>Estate of Pedrick, </em>supra, we quoted the following language from the preamble of the Rules of Professional Conduct, subsequently adopted by this Court, see footnote 2 supra, as a proper indication of the scope of application to be afforded the Code of Professional Responsibility: “[N]othing in the Rules should be deemed to argument [sic] [augment] any substantive legal duty of lawyers or the extra-disciplinary consequences of violating such [a] duty.” <a href="/pa/505/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="505 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1788873" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0530-01">505 Pa. at 543</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="505 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="1788873" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0530-01">482 A.2d at 221-22</a>. Accordingly, insofar as Turrell’s failure to hold a client’s funds in escrow, and his consequent breach of the Code of Professional Responsibility, it cannot be said that there has been a breach of a substantive “legal obligation” for which a prosecution can be maintained under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3927(a). Count # 88-164 must, therefore, be dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[225,1099,1155,577]]]'>Thus, commingling of funds, although ethically reprehensible, does not in and of itself constitute a criminal violation of § 3927(a) of the Crimes Code. Instead, a criminal violation occurs when an attorney evinces an intent not to make the required payment or disposition. Until such time as payment is due, an attorney cannot be considered in violation of § 3927(a), although he very well may have violated the Rules of Professional Conduct. However, assuming all the other elements have been satisfied, once payment is required and an attorney fails to make such payment, then a violation of § 3927(a) has occurred.</p>

Thus, the Superior Court was not presented with a factual situation where there had been a return of funds to complaining witnesses, and it was not jurisprudentially appropriate for it to engage in speculation as to what the holding would be in a case where a return of funds had in fact occurred.</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[251,771,1155,774]]]'>Turrell further claims that, regardless of whether the language upon which he relies in <em>Crafton </em>is regarded as dictum, he is entitled as a matter of due process to have it applied in this case. It is a well-recognized principle of due process that criminal statutes must give fair warning of the conduct which they prohibit. See <em>Commonwealth v. De Francesco, </em><a href="/pa/481/0595-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="481 Pa. 595" data-case-ids="1747271" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0595-01">481 Pa. 595</a>, 606-08, <a href="/citations/?q=893%20A.2d%20321" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="893 A.2d 321">893 A.2d 321</a>, 327 (1978). Turrell reasons, therefore, that he is entitled to have the criminality of his conduct determined in accordance with whatever judicial interpretations of the statute were in effect at the time of his conduct. As stated in <em>Bouie v. Columbia, </em><a href="/us/378/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="378 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="6166404" data-case-paths="/us/378/0347-01">378 U.S. 347</a>, 354-55, <a href="/us/378/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="378 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="6166404" data-case-paths="/us/378/0347-01">84 S.Ct. 1697</a>, 1703, <a href="/us/378/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="378 U.S. 347" data-case-ids="6166404" data-case-paths="/us/378/0347-01">12 L.Ed.2d 894</a>, 900 (1964), retroactive judicial interpretations of criminal statutes can indeed present due process problems:</p>

Rather, it constitutes a straightforward application of the plain language set forth in the statute. See <em>Commonwealth v. Pope, </em><a href="/pa/455/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="455 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="582168" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0384-01">455 Pa. 384</a>, 389 n. 9, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20887" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="317 A.2d 887">317 A.2d 887</a>, 889-90 n. 9 (1974). Nowhere in the statute is there any language suggesting that restitution negates criminal liabil<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>ity. Further, our holding, declining to recognize and give efficacy to the dictum in <em>Crafton, </em>does not constitute a rejection of what was announced by the <em>holding </em>in that case. Turrell had no right to rely upon pure dictum in a Superior Court decision, and his due process rights are not violated when we choose not to adopt that dictum as law.</p>
    <p id="b145-4" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[210,620,1154,1121]]]'>When one undertakes to hold funds in escrow, one assumes a duty of trust, committed to preserving the identity of funds and keeping them safe and apart from one’s own funds. Turrell, by accepting funds that were to be placed in escrow, became obliged to make a proper disposition of the funds. Failure to do so provided a basis for prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3927(a). This result comports with other decisions holding that breach of a duty to deposit and maintain funds in appropriate accounts can serve as a basis for criminal liability under this section of the Crimes Code.
