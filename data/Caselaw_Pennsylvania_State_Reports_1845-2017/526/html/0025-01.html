Pieper from an order of the Commonwealth Court reversing an order of the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (“Board”) affirming a Referee’s reinstatement of benefits to Pieper. On October 8, 1982, Pieper suffered a lower back injury during the course of his employment with Ametek-Thermox Instruments Division (“Ametek”). As a result of that injury, and pursuant to a notice of compensation dated December 6, 1982, Pieper was paid temporary total disability benefits for a “Herniated Disk L4 L5” until April 11, 1983, at which time he returned to work and executed a “final receipt”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> On April <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>22, 1983, Pieper suffered a recurrence of his injury and benefits were reinstated by “supplemental agreement”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> On May 31, 1983, Pieper returned to work on a part-time basis and he received partial disability benefits until they were terminated by a supplemental agreement dated June 21, 1983,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> which resulted from his return to full-time employment on June 20, 1983. Two days later, on June 23, 1983, Pieper was laid off, and commencing August 26, 1983, he received <em>unemployment compensation </em>for twenty-six weeks.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

When Pieper was laid off he was still experiencing pain in his lower back and in his leg, and he continued to wear a back brace. On September 18, 1984, Pieper filed a petition for reinstatement of benefits with the Board alleging a change in his condition as of January 25, 1984.</p>

The Board concluded that the factual findings of the Referee were supported by competent evidence based upon: (1) Pieper’s testimony; (2) the extensive record of agreements by the employer to pay compensation subsequent to the original injury; (3) Pieper’s back operation to improve the disability caused by the injury; and (4) the testimony of Pieper’s treating physician. While the Board recognized that the testimony of the physician focused upon the continuing nature of Pieper’s disability rather than upon its causation, it nevertheless found that the evidence taken in its entirety was adequate to support the Referee’s decision particularly where Ametek offered no medical evidence to contradict the causal relationship.</p>
    <p id="b122-5" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[266,1374,1153,621]]]'>Ametek appealed the determination of the Board to the Commonwealth Court claiming: (1) Pieper failed to show a deterioration in his condition; (2) Pieper failed to show a <em>causal connection </em>between his work-related injury and his present disability; and (3) that the Referee and the Board erred in awarding total disability benefits to Pieper with only a credit to Ametek for part-time work performed by Pieper. The Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the Board upon a determination that the necessary finding of causation was not supported by substantial evidence. We granted Pieper’s Petition for Allowance of Appeal, and we now reverse the Commonwealth Court.</p>
