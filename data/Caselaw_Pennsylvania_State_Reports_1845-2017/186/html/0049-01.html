Sec. 314. The established inference of law,” says Chancellor Kent, “is that a conveyance of land hounded on a public highway carries with it the fee to the centre of the road as part and parcel of the grant. The idea of an intention in a grantor to withhold his interest in a road to the middle of it, after parting with all his right and title to the adjoining land is never to be presumed. It would be contrary to universal practice; and it was said in Peck v. Smith, that there was no instance where the fee of a highway, as distinct from the adjoining land, was ever retained by the vendor. It would require an express declaration, or something equivalent thereto, to sustain such an inference, and it may be considered as the general rule, that a grant of land bounded upon a highway or river, carries the fee in the highway or river to the centre of it, provided the grantor at the time owned to the centre, and there be no words or specific description to show a contrary intent. The soil under the highway, if it passes at all, passes as parcel of the land and not as an appurtenant. Therefore, whether the soil passes or not is purely a question of intention, to be ascertained from the description contained in the deed, explained and illustrated by all the other parts of the conveyance, and by the localities and subject matter to which it applies. Sec. 315. It may be stated as the fair conclusion from the authorities, that a grant of land, described as bounded generally <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>‘ by,’ or ‘ on,’ or ‘ along,’ a highway, carries the fee to the centre of the highway, if the grantor owned so far; and, on the other hand, where the descriptive words are ‘ by the side of,’ ‘ by the margin of,’ or ‘ by the line of,’ or expressions equivalent thereto, the soil of the way is excluded.”</p>

The law with respect to public highways and to fresh-water rivers is the same, and the analogy perfect as concerns the right of soil, and the presumptions from grants of land bounded thereon. Such grants carry the grantee to the middle of the river, unless there are expressions in the terms of the grants, or something in the terms taken in connection with the situation and condition of the land granted, that clearly indicate an intention to stop at the edge or margin of the river. There must be a reservation or restriction, express or necessarily implied, which controls the operation of the general presumption, and makes the particular grant an exception.”</p>

It cannot be presumed that a grantor would part with his interest in the adjoining land and yet retain the fee of the highway subject to the public easement. The general rule is, therefore, well settled that a 4 grant of land bounded upon a highway or river carries the fee in the highway or river to the center of it, provided the grantor at the tizne owned to the conté:’, and there be no words or specific description to show a contrary intent.’ Thus a deed conveying land described therein as bounded ‘by,’ ‘on,’ ‘upon,’ or‘along’a highway prima facie carries the fee to the center of the highway.”</p>

In 2 Am. &amp; Eng.

If the state or municipality owns the bed of the road the boundary line of the abutting land is the nearer edge of the roadway. But if the public only have a right of way over the land, not a title to the soil, then the location of the boundary line depends upon the intention of the grantor as manifested by the language of the deed, and the same rules of construction apply as are found in practical use in the case of non navigable streams. If the land is described as “bounded on,” “running along” the highway and the like, the boundary liné is the centre of the highway, although the dimensions of the lot would exclude the highway; and in all cases of doubt the presumption is always in favor of the boundary being the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>centre of the road.’ This is the rule laid down in 2 Washburn on Real Property, p. 680, and in numerous decisions of this court, among which we may mention Paul v.

But the rule has its origin in the nature of the grant ” — and then, illustrating the immediate case under consideration — lands bounded upon a street in a city — the learned justice said: “ Where land is laid out in town lots, with streets and alleys, the owner’receives a full consideration for the streets and alleys in the increased value of the lots,” and discusses the benefits to which the abutter is entitled, such as the right to erect houses fronting on the streets, with windows and doors,' — and doorsteps and vaults extending beyond the line of the street; the right of entry into or exit from the house, and of all the enjoyments of light and air; all of which might be prohibited by the original grantor, if his right of property remained after parting with the lots.</p>

And when it is remembered that the present litigation is in relation to the ownership of the coal underlying the railroad — that coal in place is land — and that to occupy the coal in the legal sense, and mine and carry it away, cannot require any of the incidents essential to occupation of the surface, except the right of ingress or egress, it would seem that the distinction sought to be drawn in the nature of the properties is not well founded.</p>

The nearest analogy is in Wyoming Coal &amp; Transportation Co. v. Price, <a href="/pa/81/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="81 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1044164" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0156-01">81 Pa. 156</a>. Coal was conveyed to Price under separate conveyances for two pieces of land lying on each side of a canal, and the question before the court was whether the company was liable to Price for the coal under the canal. The court below charged that, “ in regard to the canal, Price owned the land and the coal under the canal subject to the right of way of the canal company.” This was assigned as error. In delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice MerCUR said: “ They (the errors assigned) involve the question whether the defendant in error owned the land and the coal under the canal. If the question were a new one, untrammeled by previous decisions, I should feel disposed to answer in the affirmative. If, however, the authorities have settled it otherwise, we must assent to them as the true exposition of the law,” and, after reviewing the legislation leading to the construction of the canals by the state, he concludes : “ It must therefore, now be declared as the settled law of this state, that whenever the commonwealth took land for permaneilt use under the acts in question, and constructed and operated a canal thereon, she acquired an estate in the lands so taken in perpetuity, and she may dispose of the same in fee.” It is a fair inference from this <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>opinion that the reason why Price did not own the coal under the canal was because the statutes under which the land was taken gave the land to the state in fee and that aside from the statutory provision the general principle applicable to lands bounded on a highway would have governed. In Commonwealth v. McAllister, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20197" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Watts 197">2 Watts, 197</a>, the court held that the making of public ways through a man’s land does not divest him of his right to the land so appropriated, for he is still considered the owner of it, subject merely to the right of passage upon it which the public acquires by the appropriation of it to that end. The different effect as to land used by the state in the construction of a canal is predicated upon the express terms of the act of assembly authorizing such construction; and by which the state becomes the owner: 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 507. And where canals are constructed under private charter the land reverts, upon abandonment, in the same manner as is the rule under any other form of highway which becomes abandoned: Pittsburg &amp; Lake Erie R.
