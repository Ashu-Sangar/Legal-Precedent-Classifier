The bill is filed by a taxpayer, and the affidavit of one Jasper Jackson is submitted as the injunction affidavit required by law. The object of such affidavit is the support of the plaintiff’s allegations, under oath, by one who has some knowledge of the facts alleged. The affidavit filed does not allege the affiant’s means of knowledge of the facts to which he swears, and there is nothing in its terms to indicate, either by his official character or the nature of his employment, that he has any special information upon the subject. The affidavit of Mr. J. H. Mack, filed on behalf of the defendant, denies all collusion whatever, negatives any alleged fraud or collusion on the part of the defendant with any one, and is a specific denial of the facts set forth in the affidavit of Mr. Jackson, as well as those in the bill. Mr. Mack is president of the company, and, therefore, appears as one who must necessarily be cognizant of the facts to which he swears.</p>

Primarily, the authority given councils to pave our streets, gives them full discretion, save as curtailed or controlled by law, to select the kind of material they may think proper and advantageous.

In view of the unanimity of action on the part of the city authorities, we should not be asked to enjoin without the clearest kind of a case of illegality warranting and compelling interference. Otherwise, to regulate, hinder, delay or control their legislative action would be an unbecoming species of government by injunction. Were the contract clearly shown to be the offspring of fraud, illegality or fraudulent collusion, it would be our duty, in the interest of the taxpayers, to interfere with all the power the law affords. So far as the city authorities are concerned, the affidavit filed by the plaintiff does not charge them with fraud or collusion, and in this respect fails to support the plaintiff’s bill. So far as the Pennsylvania Asphalt Company is concerned, its president, by affidavit, denies every allegation that the bill contains, in any way of a serious or compromising character.</p>

The director of public safety, in advertising for proposals, went beyond the ordinance, and in the specifications required that “the Lake Asphalt should be composed of refined Trinidad or Bermudez Lake Asphalt, obtained from the so-called Pitch Lake or Asphalt Lake in the Island of Trinidad, or from Bermudez, South America; or from Lake Asphalt, which in quality and durability would be equal to the standard of the Lake Trinidad or Bermudez.” The court below held that neither the standard <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>of Trinidad or Bermudez was fixed; that the director had no right in the proposals “ to impose limitations in the specifications by setting up a standard with a double head in that he limits the standard to the two grades of Trinidad and Bermudez, which invokes a standard which is quite variable and in result limits the bid of parties who control those two classes of asphalt.” The court below granted the injunction asked for. The Supreme Court reversed the action of the court below, thereby establishing that the injunction, under the circumstances, was improperly issued.</p>

The power of the city to contract and the regularity of the proceedings by which the contract in question was authorized were not challenged by the bill. The ground on which the application for an injunction was based was that the specifications limited the material to be used for street paving to two kinds of asphalt which were owned and controlled by a monopoly, while there were other kinds of asphalt in the market equally good. In reviewing the action of courts of common pleas in granting or refusing preliminary injunctions, our rule is to consider only the question presented, whether a preliminary injunction under the circumstances of the particular case should have been granted or refused, and not to pass upon matters affecting the general merits of the controversy until they are presented after final hearing and decree.</p>
    <p id="b272-7" data-blocks='[["BL_272.8",272,[243,1438,1170,798]]]'>In this case there was no evidence whatever of fraud or collusion between the city officials and the successful bidder. The specifications opened the doors to competition for the two kinds of asphalt which the councils in the exercise of their discretion considered best adapted to the needs of the city, and excluded only those differing in kind, which they did not want. There was competitive bidding, and the allegation in the bill, which was based upon inference only, that the bidders for the work were not in fact competitors, but were parties to a plan by which a monopoly was secured to each in certain districts, was met by distinct proof that there was no arrangement or understanding of any kind between them. We do not suggest that proof that the materials required by the specifications were controlled by a monopoly would have justified any action by the court. On the case presented at the hearing there was no ground for its intervention.</p>
