There is no evidence to show that the Tacony stock was used in any way for the benefit of the firm. Mr. Laughlin had many individual dealings, irrespective of his firm, and there is no reason to suppose that he did not appropriate this stock and use the money obtained upon it for his individual purposes.

No evidence was offered by the receiver or by any of the other creditors to answer the testimony produced by Mrs. Summers.

Mrs. Summers states that she knew her husband had used her stock about two years before the receivership, but not prior to that period. The testimony, however, of Mr. Summers, to the effect that his wife paid $5,000 for the purpose of redeeming one hundred of the four hundred shares of Pennsylvania Railroad stock originally- deposited, as far back as 1885, is the strongest possible evidence that she must have known at that time that she was not entitled to take her stock back upon demand, or that it was simply loaned as she states she had originally intended it to be; and when we couple this with what is appar<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>ently undisputed, that for two years prior to the failure she did know that her husband had used her stock, and yet took no steps to recover it back and made no inquiries of Laughlin &amp; McManus, the conclusion is almost irresistible that in this case, as with the rest of her fortune, she knew what her husband was doing, trusted him, and made no objection, hoping that his investments or speculations would prove profitable in the end. In the opinion of your auditor she acquiesced in the disposition of her securities by her husband, and sanctioned it by her silence since 1885. She cannot, therefore, come in as against the creditors of the firm and ask that the value of her property be returned to her, and leave a large debt unpaid which her husband was able to incur with the firm of Laughlin &amp; McManus, by reason of her acquiescence in his use and disposition of her stock for so manjr years. The creditors are innocent parties in this matter, and however innocent and wronged Mrs. Summers may be by her husband’s actions, she has not been without fault. The large loss might have been prevented if she had not remained inactive. Even under her own testimony, she had ample information to put her upon notice; she should have taken steps at once to prevent the improper conversion of her securities, if she considered it improper for her husband to use them. In this appeal to a court of equity, she is sadly deficient in the vigilance that is a necessary prerequisite to assistance from this forum.</p>

This proposition would be answered by a quotation from Leiper’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=108%20Pa.%20877" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="108 Pa. 877">108 Pa. 877</a>, if it were not for the apparent complication by reason of the conversations and understandings Mr. Summers had with Mr. Laughlin at the time he first got this stock and placed it with the firm.</p>

It might reasonably be argued that as there is no evidence that any part of the conversation between Mr. Summers and his wife was detailed to any member of the firm of Laughlin &amp; McManus, they might consider that Mr. Summers had authority, not only to use the stock for the purpose of an exchange of collateral, but for any purpose that he saw fit. Mr. Summers had apparently been accustomed to doing pretty much as he liked with the property of his wife; but there is no doubt that upon this occasion he promised her not to use the stock for his own speculations or transactions. This promise was not, however, known to Laughlin &amp; McManus, and Mrs. Summers did nothing to give them notice that it had been made, and never had any intercourse with them except through Mr. Summers. Her husband was given the apparent authority to do as he liked, and was furnished with blank powers to transfer the stock, and there is no evidence to show that Mrs. Summers had made any inquiry of him as to what he had done with the stock until years afterwards. Under these facts it hardly seems equitable to say that, because Mr. Laughlin knew that Mr. Summers went to his wife to ask the privilege of loaning her stock to the firm, it was the duty of the firm to presume that she deviated from her usual course and gave him only the right to use it for that special purpose; but if such should not be the opinion of the court it would still be going very far in the opinion of your auditor to hold that Mrs. Summers is so free from negligence that she can now, as against these creditors, take advantage of the improper assumption of Laughlin &amp; McManus.</p>

The claimant seeks to enforce the original contract, and claims that under it the Pennsylvania stock is the original debt, and the Titusville stock is the collateral. Your-auditor, however, does not see how such a claim can be sustained when the whole testimony in this case is considered. The evidence shows that in this transaction the Titus-ville stock was a substitute for the Pennsylvania stock, and the former stock was practically to belong to Mr. Summers if he did not demand the return of the latter. He never did make a demand for the latter, and if we are to consider the original contract as still in force, Mrs. Summers has no title whatever to the Pennsylvania Railroad stock if she takes the position that she is entitled to the Pittsburg, Titusville &amp; Buffalo stock; and the converse is equally true, if she claims the Pennsylvania stock, she must surrender the other.</p>

Lauglilin &amp; McManus took this stock from Mr. Summers, who had it in his possession, with proper powers of attorney for its assignment, executed by his wife and witnessed by himself. The firm had no knowledge of any agreements made between Mr. Summers and his wife; and under the decisions already quoted; the fact that the stock is in her name is not sufficient to put them upon notice. They were legally entitled to consider that his wife had either given or loaned him the stock without restriction or limitation. Stress has been <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>laid upon tbe fact that Mr. Laughlin said he would not transfer the shares out of the name of Mrs. Summers; but this must be taken to mean that he would not do so as long as it was unnecessary to sell the securities for the payment of Mr. Summers’s debts. This promise does not prove that Mr. Laughlin knew that Mr. Summers had no right to use this stock, and it is entirely consistent with the theory that the stock was merely placed as collateral for a debt which Mr. Summers no doubt expected to pay by means of the profits of his transactions. Neither is the testimony material which shows that, during all of the time that this stock was in Laughlin &amp; McManus’s possession, they paid over to Mr. Summers the dividends which ■were declared upon it. This is the ordinary course of brokers when securities are left with them as collateral, and this course is usually continued until the collateral has been appropriated to the payment of the debt, which was not done in the present ease until after the firm had failed.</p>

We find nothing in the record that requires either a reversal or modification of the decree.</p>
