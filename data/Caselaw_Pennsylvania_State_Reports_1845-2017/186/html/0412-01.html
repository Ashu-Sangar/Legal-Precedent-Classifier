Cake, Jr., March 19,1891. On February 13,1894, an attachment execution was issued out of the court of common pleas of Northumberland county to No. 52, May term, 1894, attaching any and all moneys in the hands or possession of J. Adam Cake, administrator of Joseph W. Cake, deceased, on which there was trial and verdict of jury, April 8,1895, against <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>defendant, and on September 1, 1896, a scire facias was issued on the said original judgment to revive and continue the lien thereof. This fund is claimed by J. Adam Cake, executor, as aforesaid : first, by virtue of a lien on the real estate, and, second, by virtue of an attachment execution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[181,576,1165,1784]],["BL_438.1",438,[268,328,1171,802]]]'>It is claimed, on the part of Mr. Dewart, attorney for J. Adam Cake, executor, as aforesaid, that the issuing of the attachment execution and verdict of the jury revived the lien of the original judgment and thus continued it as a lien against the real estate out of which the fund for distribution arises. This certainly cannot he the case. The method of reviving judgments for the purpose of continuing the lien thereof on real estate is specifically set forth in the acts of assembly providing for such proceedings, and being a statutory proceeding must he strictly followed. The attachment execution issued February 13,1894, does not contain a clause of scire facias for the purpose of reviving the judgment and continuing the lien thereof against the real estate of the defendant, Joseph W. Cake. It simply calls upon the defendant and garnishee to appear before our judges, at Sunbury, at our court of common pleas aforesaid, there to he held the second Monday of A larch next, to show cause, if any they know or have to say, why the said judgment shall not he levied of the effects of the defendant in their hands. The only scire facias contained in this writ is to the garnishee and not to the defendant. The act of April 4, 1798, directs that the scire facias shall he served on the defendant or his representatives and the act of 1827 does not change the law in that respect; neither does the act of 1887. This might possibly have-been the case had the attachment issued within a year and a day from the entry of the judgment hut Ave do not meet that question here. In Davis v. Elirman, <a href="/pa/20/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 Pa. 256" data-case-ids="972296" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0256-01">20 Pa. 256</a>, it was said that, since the act of March 26, 1827, limiting the lien of judgments on real estate, nothing but an amicable revival, or the issuing of ásciro facias within five years from the entry of the judgment, Avill continuo its lien beyond that period. The issuing of a fieri facias Avithin such period and levying on the land will not- extend the lien beyond five years, even for so long a time as to allow a sale to be effected ; and in Jameson’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/6/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="954582" data-case-paths="/pa/6/0280-01">6 Pa. 280</a>, it Avas said a judgment and an execution thereon have not, under our act of assembly, distinct and independent liens upon the <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>same land. It is clear that the land out of which the fund for distribution arises could not have been sold on a fi. fa. without first issuing a scire facias, hence it must have lost its lien: Sloan v. McMullen, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Pa.%20D.%20480" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Pa. D. 480">5 Dist. Rep. 480</a>; <a href="/pa/147/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="147 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="829817" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0545-01">147 Pa. 545</a>. As between plaintiff and defendant it might hold; not as against subsequent lien creditors. An attachment execution as issued to No. 52, May term, 1894, is a specific and statutory remedy for the purpose of attaching goods, moneys, etc., belonging to the defendant in the hands or possession of third parties, and would therefore inquire a special proceeding to operate as a scire facias for the purpose of reviving the judgment to continue its lien. Judgment No. 231, May term, 1891, having lost its lien, numerous other judgments have slipped in and become prior liens on the share or interest which Joseph W. Cake, Jr., had in the land sold under and by virtue of the partition proceedings under which the funds now for distribution arose.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[264,1147,1168,1212]]]'>As to the second grounds on which J. Adam Cake, executor, as aforesaid, claims or seeks to found his claim to this fund is by virtue of an attachment execution. Tins judgment having-lost its lien on the real estate sold, it cannot be said that, by virtue of an attachment execution, other judgments having a lien on the land sold at the time of the sale can be defeated by attaching creditors.' The money arising from the sale of the lands must be applied to the payment of judgments which were liens at the time of the sale in the order of their priority. The share or interest of J. Adam Cake in the fund now for distribution is claimed by J. W. Cake by virtue of an attachment execution issued out of the court of common pleas of Northumberland county to No. 615, September term, 1896, attaching the moneys, etc., in the hands or possession of J. Adam Cake, administrator of Joseph W. Cake, deceased, belonging to J. Adam Cake. No claim to this fund is made by any person having a lien against the land sold at the time of the sale, and out of which the fund now for distribution arises. Your auditor therefore awards the said fund, which would otherwise belong to J. Adam Cake, to J. W. Cake, upon condition that he sustains the attachment execution, and if not, then to J. Adam Cake, to whom one-fourtli interest in said land descended by virtue of the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, and who would be entitled to said fund if attachment is not sustained.</p>
