By the specifications the committee and engineer were empowered to direct the work, to discharge incompetent workmen employed by the contractor, to reject materials, to determine the amount due, and to settle all disputes which might arise as to the meaning of the specifications, and upon these subjects their decision was to be final and conclusive. The evidence showed that the highway committee had accepted the work, and that the city had paid a portion of the claim. There was no evidence of fraud or collusion. <em>Held, </em>that the city was bound by the action of the committee, and could not introduce evidence that the work was improperly done.</p>

This contract was certified, although it is contended that the certificate was irregular. If we were to grant that the certificate was irregular, we think when the contract was offered in evidence it should have been objected to. It was not objected to in this case and it went into the evidence. The irregularity was, therefore, as the court thinks, waived, and defendant cannot now at this late day raise that question. And, if the certificate was not proper then the whole contract was void. It should not have been received in evidence if defendant had objected to it, but as there was no objection the court received it without objection, by the acquiescence of the defendant; and it would be a veiy irregular way to try a lawsuit, to allow it afterwards to raise this question, when both parties have closed their case, and at the very last present a point of that kind, which was unthought of by anybody except the defendant up to this period. Now, it would be unfair, for the reason that if this contract had been objected to because of its irregularity at that time, it would have enabled the plaintiff to have brought an action in another way, in all probability, and recover either upon a quantum meruit, or recover by showing that the contract, although irregular, was affirmed and ratified by the city. If we would permit defendant to'raise this question now, we would have to open this case and permit the plaintiff to introduce evidence to show that notwithstanding its irregularity, it has been ratified. But we will not dispose of that point at this time. We will reserve it and your verdict will be subject to that point. [16]</p>

The agreement is obscurely worded, and contains no clear expression of the intention of the parties on the subject. The ordinance, advertisement, proposal and specifications are all made parts of the contract, and an intention which might have been expressed in a few words must be ascertained partly from expression and partly by inference from a long rambling agreement.</p>
    <p id="b280-7" data-blocks='[["BL_280.9",280,[244,2067,1168,299]],["BL_281.1",281,[234,319,1165,1072]]]'>The ordinance authorizes the highway committee to appoint inspectors of the work, and it directs the city engineer personally to supervise the work, but it expressly provides that no waiver of performance or acceptance of any part of the work by the inspectors or engineer “ shall bind the city, unless the same be ratified and accepted by the highway committee.” Payment <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>for the work is to be made on acceptance by tlie committee, and the guarantee for ten years commences with the date of acceptance by the committee. By the specifications the committee and the engineer are empowered to direct the work, to discharge incompetent workmen employed by the contractor, to reject materials, to determine the amount due and to settle all disputes which may arise as to tlie meaning of the specifications, and upon these subjects their decision is to be final and conclusive. The provision that the inspection and approval of the work by the inspectors and the engineer shall not bind the city, and that it shall not be bound unless the highway committee ratifies the approval of these officers, gives rise to the implication that tlie acceptance by the committee is to bind the city. Other provisions of the contract imply that the acceptance by the committee was to be conclusive, and not merely a condition precedent in the nature of preliminary proof without which tlie contractor could not recover. Taking the contract as a whole we are not satisfied that tlie construction given by the court is erroneous. No collusion was alleged, and the fullest opportunity was given to show that there liad been fraud or imposition practiced by the contractor.</p>
    <p id="b281-5" data-blocks='[["BL_281.4",281,[233,1400,1166,555]]]'>It is true, that generally tlie cases in which estimates and decisions of engineers have been held to be conclusive rest on a positive stipulation in the contract, but a necessary implication may have all the force of a positive stipulation. In this case the final decision and the acceptance were not left to the defendant’s engineer, but to a committee of councils which was charged with the duty of constructing tlie work, and which represented the city in that regard. If the construction of the contract by tlie court was correct the case is governed by Hartupee v. Pittsburg, <a href="/pa/131/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="131 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="810260" data-case-paths="/pa/131/0535-01">131 Pa. 535</a>, and Bowman Bros. v. Stewart, <a href="/pa/165/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="165 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="862046" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0394-01">165 Pa. 394</a>, and the line of cases of which they are a part.</p>

No objection to the validity of the contract was suggested in the proceedings preliminary to the trial, and it was offered in evidence and admitted without objection. The objection was first made at a time when it was too late for the plaintiff to show ratification. In City of Erie v. Moody, <a href="/pa/176/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="176 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="882215" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0478-01">176 Pa. 478</a>, it does not appear that <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>objection to the execution of the contract was first raised by a point submitted for charge, and that proceeding was by the city to collect an assignment against a property owner whose liability did not depend on contract or consent, but on the strict observance of legal requirements. In this case a defective certificate would not have been necessarily fatal to the plaintiff’s case, and if the objection had been made at the proper time it might have been successfully met. The city solicitor did not join in the defense based on this ground, and any objection to the form of the certificate was properly considered as having been waived.</p>
