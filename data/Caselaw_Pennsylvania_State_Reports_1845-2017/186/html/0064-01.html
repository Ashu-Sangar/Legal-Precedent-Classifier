There is a trustee named in the leases who collects from the lessees and turns the funds over to the accountant. The collections run from April 21, 1892, to March 9, 1897, and aggregate $117,955.24. The payments and distributions were generally made monthly, and averaged nearly $2,000 per month. There wras no agreement made as to charges. This fund is corpus of tlie trust, but under the will it is ordered to be distributed at once, and when that is done, the trust is ended so far as that fund is concerned, and compensation is due for services. The accountant claims three per cent upon the receipts, and we are referred to several cases in sup<a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>port of the charge — Stevenson’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20104" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Whart. 104">4 Wharton, 104</a>; Pusey v. Clemson, 9 S. &amp; R. 204; Walker’s Estate, 9 S. &amp; R. 223; Whelen’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="70 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1028161" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0410-01">70 Pa. 410</a> — hut none similar to the case at bar; all final settlements of estates. In Stevenson’s Estate, in which the court says that for the receipt and. disbursement of money two and one half per cent should be the uniform measure, and in which a total of three per cent was allowed, there was a will with twelve codicils, and in will and codicils reference to one hundred and two items. The legatees were scattered in five states and five foreign countries. Some of the claims due the estate were in foreign countries, and it appears that for two years one of the executors devoted one third of his time to the affairs of the estate. The total amount was $356,075.93. In Pusey v. Clemson, an estate of $100,000,'three per cent allowed; $37,000 was collected by suits. Not less than fifteen suits were brought or defended by the executors. They attended to the interests of the estate in several states. They were allowed three per cent, which the cotrrt referred to as “ quite sufficient.” In Walker’s Estate, $37,000, in which three per cent was allowed, executors, they were to clothe and look after a number of children; to expend a sum of money in charity, in clothing for poor children; to pay a number of small annuities for the life of the annuitants. In Wheelen’s Appeal, an estate of $168,000, three per cent allowed. The estate was in litigation nearly six years, and important questions were decided.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[267,1647,1184,607]]]'>In above case in which two and one half per cent is spoken of as the proper percentage for receiving and disbursing funds, it cannot be that the court meant the simple clerical work of 'receiving the money and paying it out, but must have meant compensation for the labor and attention requisite in the settlement of an ordinary estate, and allowed the extra one half per cent for the more than usual trouble met with in them. In Stevenson’s Estate the court speaks of an allowance for special services as distinguished from those usually rendered. The fact that no contract was made in the case at bar simply leaves the question of compensation where it belongs. There can be no arbitrary rule. Each case stands by itself.</p>

Further says: “ If I were an executor of an estate in which there was #100,000 cash assets in bank, I should charge one per cent.” David P. Ayars, cashier of Miners’ Savings Bank, says : “We receive coal rents and distribute them. ... If there were nothing more to be done than to draw a few checks the rate is about one per cent in the absence of any agreement, although we have made other agreements for a less rate.” A. A. Sterling, cashier and trust officer of the People’s Bank of Wilkes-Barre, says: “Wehave been in such business as this about twenty years ” — speaking of tbe work done by accountants — “ I think we 'would be glad to do it for one per cent.”</p>
