The <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>state authorized the company to supply water in the locality named in its charter; the borough, if it so desired, could not prevent the water company from acting. It is a misapprehension of the law of June 2, 1887, that suggests the view that the rights of the water company vest by consent of the borough. The act of 1887 provides such condition only in the case of gas companies (sec. 1, Act of June 2,1887, P. L. 310). This provision is contained in section 2 of said act, which amends clause 1 of section 34, act of April 29, 1874, which clause relates to gas companies only.</p>

Immediately following the decision in that case, a number of the taxpayers of the borough made application and obtained a charter for the People’s Water Company, to supply water to the same borough; then, an ordinance was presented in borough councils, which passed first reading, enacting that the borough should execute a contract with the new company to supply it with water for fire and other purposes, for the period of ten years from January 1, 1898, at an annual compensation of 64,000; further, that the company should furnish to all citizens, by the latest improved methods, water at certain rates; an elaborate table of which rates was to be embodied in the contract; further, that the borough should have the right to purchase at any time after the completion of the plant the fire hydrants put in by the company, at the price of $6,000; further, that after the completion of the plant, the borough should have the right to purchase the plant of the company at a price not exceeding the cost of same. The court below, after hearing, enjoined councils from adopting that part of the contract providing for the purchase of the plant after completion, but declined to otherwise interfere.</p>
    <p id="b605-5" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[181,1415,1163,864]]]'>The proposed contract is palpably an attempt to evade the decree of this Court in Metzger v.

It might build its own works, as many boroughs have done, or it might contract with a private corporation for the same purpose; but it could not have both methods in operation at the same time; the adoption of either was the exhaustion of municipal power on that subject. When a contract is made with a private water company, authorized usually, only to build its works and'maintain its plant at one place, it would be grossly inequitable to hold that the municipality, after inviting the construction of such works, and contracting with the company for the water supply, could at any time thereafter destroy them by constructing its own works. To authorize such municipal action the statutory right must be explicit; it will not be implied from doubtful language.</p>

But it goes further and, by enumerating no less than twenty-two special uses in a long table, prescribes what shall be the water rates, from a drug store to a water-closet, and from a dwelling to a urinal; treating the new company as a municipal institution, and as if already under municipal control. &gt;</p>

It is true, that provision unmistakably discloses the purpose to evade our former decree; but this purpose is still to a large extent carried out by the provisions for introduction of the water, and the absolute payment of the sum of $4,000 annually, and the right to purchase the hydrants for $6,000.</p>

That question is not before us.
