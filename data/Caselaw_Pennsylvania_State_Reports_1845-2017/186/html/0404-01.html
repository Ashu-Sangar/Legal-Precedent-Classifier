Decisions upon other wills may assist, but cannot control the construction. The order in which clevises are made in wills, is rarely of much importance: ” Fox’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/99/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="99 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="446165" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0382-01">99 Pa. 382</a>. The question to be settled in giving construction to a will is not so much, what did the testator mean, as in the meaning of the words he has employed: Hancock’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/112/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="112 Pa. 532" data-case-ids="546641" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0532-01">112 Pa. 532</a>. But words must be read according to their plain ordinary meaning, taking the immediate context into view: Howe’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/126/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="126 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="968942" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0233-01">126 Pa. 233</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[258,1636,1172,604]]]'>In regard to the bequest to Ida C. Bushey the auditor decides that the language of testator “subject to the following request,” and though immediately followed by the positive direction to invest, and for the disposition of the interest during the life of the legatee and the principal at her death, is only precatory, and therefore does not affect her bequest, so as to limit it during the life of said Ida C. Bushey. We are aware that in Pennsylvania mere precatory words will not convert a legatee or devisee of an absolute gift into a trustee, unless it affirmatively appear that they were intended to be imperative. But words expressive of a desire, etc., as to the direct disposition of the estate will constitute a bequest or devise.</p>

A will must be so construed as to give effect to every part of it and harmony to the whole instrument: MeDevitt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/113/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="113 Pa. 103" data-case-ids="457615" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0103-01">113 Pa. 103</a>. Although a foe be given in the first part of a will, it may be restrained by subsequent words so as to convert it into a life estate: Ulrich’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/86/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="86 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1056661" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0386-01">86 Pa. 386</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[226,835,1163,964]]]'>In the light of these well-established principles, governing the constructions of wills, can the auditor be sustained? Do not the words “subject to the following request” coupled with the direction to invest immediately following, unmistakably express the intention of the testator to create a trust for the benefit of Ida C. Bushey’s children, as he did for the children of his other legatees? Especially in view of the fact that the whole will shows the testator’s intention to equalize his children. We think the only difference in the devise of the shares of the testator’s children in case of Ida C. Bushey is that she is to act as trustee of the shares devised, while in case of the other daughters the executor is made the trustee. A trust is created in the will for all of their respective children. By the express language used, the parents are only entitled to the annual interest for life, and at their respective deaths the devises are in remainder as provided in the will.
