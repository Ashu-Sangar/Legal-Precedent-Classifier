If the jury believes John Holdeman was such an agent of this company, and, on taking the application for insurance from the plaintiff, was informed by the plaintiff .that he had #3,000 of other insurance, then it was the duty of Holdeman to so inform the company in order that the proper officer of the company might indorse on the policy notice of such other insurance, and the fraud or mistake of Holdeman, the agent, in failing to so inform the company, will not enable the company to avoid the policy to the injury of the plaintiff, if the plaintiff innocently became a party to the contract. <em>Answer: </em>This we affirm; the company could not adopt the acts of its agent so far as it inured to its own benefit and then repudiate it when the other party sought to enforce it.

It was its duty when it learned this fact (if it did so learn it), that this insurance had existed upon the property from the time that this policy was issued and before the application <a id="p573" href="#p573" data-label="573" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*573</a>was made, to have notified Kalmutz that it would not accept his policy — to have returned, his premium note and not to have held out the belief to him that his policy was of binding force and effect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b597-5" data-blocks='[["BL_597.4",597,[184,530,1170,1483]]]'>Now, Mr. Holdeman denies this. He denies that Kalmutz told him that he had additional insurance. He denies that he had any knowledge of the fact until in the month of October, 1894; that when he was there at the place of Mr. Kalmutz, and after he had collected the assessment, which was laid upon this policy for Kalmutz, that it was then that Kalmutz told him that he had additional policies upon this property, and that was the first time he knew of it. Then, he says, he did learn the fact and he communicated it to the secretary of the company at the meeting of the board of directors in the first week of November, I believe, 1894. There is again a discrepancy in the testimony. Mr. Kalmutz testified that when Holdeman called upon him for the assessment, he told him that his policy was of no use; that he had it read, and that he had learned that it was void because there was no notice indorsed upon it in writing that he had other insurance, and he testifies that he did this before he paid the assessment that was levied upon his policy. Now, how is that ? There is a conflict in his testimony and it is for you to determine. If the company, after the notice of this fact, and its attention was called to it by its agent, went on and collected this assessment and kept the money, then it would be estopped from denying the validity of the policy; but it could not be es-topped unless it did that after it had knowledge of this fact. Now, you will take this case into consideration, and if you find the company had knowledge before it levied an assessment, then it would clearly be liable, but I do not recollect that there is any testimony, and I think there is not, in the case, to show that it had knowledge until after that assessment had been collected and paid over.</p>

As is usual in such cases, there was more or less conflicting testimony as to what passed between the plaintiff and the defendant’s agent at the inception of the contract. In the court below, as well as here, it was iorcibl}1' contended on plaintiff’s behalf that the testimony referred to was sufficient to warrant the jury in finding such facts as legally constitute an estoppel; but, inasmuch as the record discloses other undisputed evidence which necessarily leads to the same conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider in detail the conflicting testimony that was submitted to the jury on that question.</p>

In all cases where the insurer, at the time the policy was issued, knew of other insurance, and there is no agreement for its cancelation or non-renewal, or when notice is given that other insurance has been obtained, it is bound either to indorse consent upon the policy or cancel it, or, failing to do either, it will be treated as having assented thereto Wood on Ins.

It would be an estoppel, which is the true ground upon which the doctrine of waiver in such cases rests.” In Wilson v. Mutual Fire Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=174%20Pa.%20557" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="174 Pa. 557">174 Pa. 557</a>, substantially the same doctrine is applied to the case of additional insurance.

    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.4",601,[194,527,1162,1727]]]'>In Farmers’ Mutual Insurance Co. v. Taylor, <a href="/pa/73/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="73 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="1032311" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0342-01">73 Pa. 342</a>, an application was made to the agent of an insurance company for a risk of $4,000; the agent, in forwarding the application, said if the company could not take $4,000, he would place $1,000 in another company of which he was agent. The secretary agreed to take only $3,000, and this amount was placed in the first company, and $1,000 in the other, both policies being issued at the same time. The conditions of the first company avoided the policy unless other insurance was indorsed thereon. Eight months thereafter, and before any loss, the agent indorsed the insurance on the policy, notified the company, and no objection was made. This Court, in disposing of the question presented, said: “ So far as appears, the defendants were entirely satisfied with the acts of their agent. If they were dissatisfied, then was the time to have indicated it. If they desired to repudiate the policy, then was the time to have done so. They could not, after a full knowledge of the facts, retain the money paid for the insurance and withhold their objections until after the loss, thereby inducing the assured to rely on the validity of his policy.” The language of this Court, in Light v. Countrymen’s Mutual Fire Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/169/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="169 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="870585" data-case-paths="/pa/169/0316-01">169 Pa. 316</a>, may be aptly applied to tbe ease before us : “This company demanded and received from bills plaintiff, as the lawful bolder of this policy, all the benefits and advantages which it was entitled to receive under it as a valid, subsisting policy, up until the moment of the fire. It would be a perversion of justice to permit it now to deny its liability and allow it to escape the payment of its just dues under tbe contract. That is precisely wbat estoppel means.” Further elaboration of the subject is not required. Enough has been said to show that upon the undisputed evidence in the case the learned trial judge would have been warranted in holding, as matter of law, that the defendant was estopped from setting up the condition above quoted as a bar to plaintiff’s claim, and in instructing the jury accordingly.</p>
