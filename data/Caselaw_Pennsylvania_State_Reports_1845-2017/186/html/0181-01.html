It was also provided that K. was to pay upon a one-eighth interest the one-eighth part of the expense of drilling the well, B. to pay the share of the other one quarter of the lease in drilling the well. The agreement continued as follows: “ But in case said well is a paying well the one quarter of the expense of drilling said well carried by said B. to be paid out of the proceeds of the first production of said well, and after the payment thereof in the manner aforesaid each one shall thereafter <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>bear his proportionate expense of drilling and operating said leasehold.

If under the instructions contained in the preceding point, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then the measure of damages is seven eighths of the cost arid expense of drilling a well on said leasehold to the oil-bearing rock, during the time mentioned in the contract, less seven eighths of the market value of the rig, drive pipe and casing in place, to which is to be added interest from the first day of April, 1892. <em>Answer: </em>We answer that point in the affirmative. In our judgment that is the correct measure of damages. Knupp was to pay one eighth of the cost of drilling the well, therefore Bright was only to pay seven eighths of it, which would be seven eighths of the cost of drilling the well to the sand rock, less the value of the materials used in so drilling, which may be made useful afterwards, together <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>with interest from the time when the w'ell should have been completed.

    <p class="summary" id="b204-6" data-blocks='[["BL_204.5",204,[244,496,1179,608]]]'>2. The plaintiff not having drilled the well himself, which the defendant agreed to drill on the property, and not having employed or paid anybody for drilling such well, he cannot recover the expense of drilling such well, or any part thereof ; in other words he cannot recover expense which he never incurred, or damage which he never sustained. <em>Answer: </em>That part of it we answer in the negative. We think the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, notwithstanding the fact that he did not actually drill the well himself. The concluding part of the point, as a general statement of law, is correct. “ He cannot recover expense which he never incurred, or damage which he never sustained.” [3]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b204-7" data-blocks='[["BL_204.6",204,[240,1113,1177,558]]]'>3. The plaintiff’s only interest in the well was one fourth of the oil that might be obtained therefrom, and in the absence of evidence showing that there was oil there "which he could and would have obtained by the drilling of the well, nominal damages only can be recovered, nothing having been expended by the plaintiff in drilling the well agreed to be drilled by the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>We answer that in the negative. We think the question of damages is not to be determined by the question whether or not there might be much oil or little oil in the well, but the cost of performing the work which Mr. Bright agreed to perform.

Only .such damage can be recovered as- may fairly be supposed to have entered into the contemplation of the parties when they made their contract, or such as might naturally be-expected to follow its breach. <em>Answer: </em>That part of the point as a general proposition we affirm; but the application of it which follows, we are unable to agree to. [5] And the parties having provided in the contract for a forfeiture of the consideration, namely, the defendant’s interest in the lease, in case he failed to drill the well within the time stipulated, that is the only damage that could fairly and reasonably be supposed to have entéred into the contemplation of the parties, and that having been forfeited to the plaintiff by the terms of the contract, nominal damages only can be recovered in this case. <em>Answer: </em>
      <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>That part of the point we answer in the negative. The clause in the agreement providing for the forfeiture relates to the rights of .Bright under that agreement, viz : his right to an assignment and to contribution by Knupp to the expense of the well. When Knupp voluntarily executed his part of the agreement without waiting for performance by Bright, and Bright accepted that performance — whether or not that happened is a question of fact for the jury — but if it did happen and Knupp executed and delivered the assignment before the 1st of April, 1892, and Bright accepted that performance, then that agreement became so far executed that it could no longer be forfeited by either. But Knupp inserted in the assignment a clause of forfeiture, at his option. In the copy which Knupp says he delivered to Mr. Bright, it is put in this way at the end: “ In case said Bright fails to drill a well upon said premises as agreed to in said above recited contract, this conveyance to be forfeited, null and void at my option.” There is no evidence that this option was exercised. Under these circumstances this point, except the general statement in the first part of it, is answered in the negative. And it means, notwithstanding this clause of forfeiture in the papers, that if you find for the plaintiff upon the questions of fact which we shall submit to you relating to the actual delivery of this paper, he would be entitled to recover substantial damages notwithstanding those clauses.

If the jury should believe that the plaintiff did deliver an assignment of the lease on March 10, 1892, to the defendant, and should also believe from the evidence that there was not sufficient time to drill the well between March 10 and April 1, the time the contract required it to be completed, there can be no recovery in this case. <em>Answer: </em>We answer this point in the negative. And we think that even if there was- not sufficient time to drill the well between the time when Knupp delivered (if he did deliver it) the assignment of this contract and the expiration of the time in which the defendant was to drill the well, nevertheless he might be entitled to recover. The covenant to drill a well in this agreement is absolute, and the execution and delivery of the assignment by Knupp was not a condition precedent. Knupp’s agreement is expressly put in consideration of the performance by Bright and not merefy in consideration of Bright’s covenants. The plaintiff would not be <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>prevented from recovering, therefore, by Ms failure to execute and deliver the assignment so as to enable the 'defendant to complete the well after its delivery and before the first of April, 1892. The defendant was not justified in waiting for the delivery of the assignment before commencing his performance, and especially not since there is no evidence of any demand by the defendant for the assignment, or refusal by the plaintiff to execute it.
