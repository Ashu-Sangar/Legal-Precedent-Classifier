That is the first inquiry that naturally suggests itself to your minds. What did transpire there ? What were the actual representations and declarations made there at that time ? That naturally would seem to be the first question that should suggest itself to your minds. Did the plaintiff know that the property of this company was in West Virginia, or did she not? It is one of the allegations on the part of the plaintiff that it was represented to her that the company operated its works, and that its property was located, in the Wyoming valley, in Pennsylvania, and not in Handley, <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>West Virginia. Now, gentlemen of the jury, what is the evidence on that point ? Did the plaintiff know, on December 18, 1883, or about that time, particularly on December 18, that these works were in West Virginia, and not in the Wyoming valley, in Pennsylvania ? The first witness called in the case, and called by the defendant (and right here let me state that it does not matter on which side of a ease a witness is called in order to ascertain the truth, he may be called for the plaintiff, he may be called by the defendant, but the question is, what does his testimony prove), as I have it upon my notes, upon this question, was Mrs. Kries. She states that she met Mrs. Rosenagle in the month of May, 1883, at the residence of the defendant, and at that time that she had with her a book relating to this West Virginia company; that she stated to her that she was going to enter into it, or invest her money in it, I do not remember which, you will recall that to your minds, that she was going to enter into this compamy in West Virginia. The next witness I call your attention to is Richard Evans, who says, as I recollect his testimony, that in the morning of December 18, he was in the defendant’s office, that there were present there the plaintiff and the defendant and himself, and I do not remember whether anybody else or not, and that he had a conversation with the plaintiff, that this prospectus of the Wyoming Manufacturing Company was there, and he explained it to her, particularly explained the map to her; that she inquired of him as to what kind of a place this town at West Virginia would be to keep a boarding house, and that he made some answer to that inquiry which you gentlemen probably remember! Of course I am not giving you all the testimony, I am simply calling your attention now to the witnesses who testified to some of these material facts, or facts alleged to be material. Then you have the testimony of J. C. Evans, the superintendent of this company. He says that he was at the residence of the defendant some time about Christmas, in 1883; that he met the plaintiff there; that they had dinner together, and that she made the same inquiry of him in regard to whether this place in West Virginia, where the company’s works were, would be a good place to keep a boarding house, and whether it would be a good place for her husband, who was a mason. And then we have the testimony of Rose Locher, who is now <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>dead, but under the rule of law her testimony was allowed to be read in evidence, because she had testified at a former trial of this case. You remember substantially what her testimony was, that the plaintiff' came to her hotel or her house, in this city, and had a conversation there, in which she said that she had invested her money in this company in West Virginia; that she intended or wanted to go down there to keep a boarding house. The same testimony comes to us also from the lips of Harry Locher, disclosing the fact that the plaintiff knew where the location of this company’s operations was, that it was in West Virginia. We also have the testimony of George Reed. I do not remember the date of the interview testified to by Mr. Reed, but I believe it was some time in 1884 or 1883, but there it seems that Mr. Reed explained to her something about the operations of this company in West Virginia, and the same inquiry was made by her of him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-5" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[185,1152,1173,663]]]'>Now, gentlemen, the testimony of these witnesses is introduced for the purpose of showing that Mrs. Rosenagle knew on December 18, 1883, when she purchased this stock, and when she had this business transaction with the defendant, that the property and the operations of the Wjmming Manufacturing Company were located in West Virginia, and not in the Wyoming valley, in Pennsylvania. So this evidence will guide you, gentlemen of the jury, in view of the principles of law that I have laid down, in arriving at an answer to the question, as to whether she knew, on December 18, 1883, that this property was located in West Virginia, and not in the Wyoming valley, Pennsylvania. The testimony that T have referred to will enable you to come to a conclusion on that question.</p>

Now, those three subdivisions, as it were, of the same branch of facts are closely related to each other, because the value of the property has something to do with the solvency of the company, and the value of the property and the solvency of the company have something to do with the value of the stock.</p>

You heard the testimony of Thomas Jifkins, who, it is true, was called by the plaintiff, but as I have stated to you before it makes no difference on which side a witness is called, the question being as to the relevancy of his testimony to the issue in the case. Thomas Jifkins testifies that he bought stock in 1882, and in September, 1883; that he bought it after an investigation of the company’s property : that in pursuance of the opinion he received from his son he bought this stock, and bought $2,000 worth of it in September, 1883. He states that at this time, in 1883, in December, the company had money in the bank; that as far as he knew there were no judgments against it, and that he believed it to be solvent. He was one of the directors of the company, and was necessarily in a position to know something about it. He says that they were mining coal in December; that in his judgment the stock was worth $100 a share; he considered it a valuable property; he had sent other people down there besides his brother. That is the testimony of Thomas Jifkins in regard to the value of this property, the solvency of the company and the value of the stock in December, 1883.</p>

He says there were no debts against the company in December, 1883, except the ordinary current debts incident to the business and operations of mining; that there were no judgments, no suits ; that there was some royalty due, but none in arrear; he thought that the lease was valuable; that the company declared no dividends. He states, as to the property that the company held in 1883, that there were eight houses worth from $1,500 to $2,000 each, a sawmill worth about $7,000; that there were forty or fifty houses altogether, the major portion of them new, ten or eleven worth about $500 a piece, and others worth about $400 a piece; that the tipple, the meaning of which has been explained to you, cost $7,000 or $8,000; that there was a rail<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>road track; that they were mining coal, the mine was opened, had cars, had two cables costing from $1,000 to $1,500, had a store and stock of goods, and that the financial condition of the company was sound; that they had four or five hundred acres of land under lease.

You remember what he stated as to the property that this company had in West Virginia, the nature of it, the extent of it, and value of it. There is also the testimony of Mr. S. B. Mott, who stated to you that he had been down there and had made some investigations, and that he purchased stock and received, I think, $8,000 for $1,500, that is $8,000 worth of stock for $1,500.</p>

As I have already stated to you, it is your province to find out which of these parties is corroborated, and to what extent they are corroborated, by the other testimony in the case. The plaintiff contends that she is corroborated, so far as the financial condition of the company is concerned, by several matters outside of her own testimony. She refers particularly to the letter to J. C. Evans, dated September 17,1888, and written by the defendant. Now that letter has been read to you by the counsel in the case, and you know the contents of it probably better than I do, or at least as well as I do. It expresses, as I understand it, dissatisfaction with the management of the company, and other incidents in connection with the need of money, and the amount of money expended, and the amount of money to be expended again; at any rate the letter you have heard read, and you will be able to <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>place your own construction upon that. The plaintiff also refers to other letters received from the defendant during the years 1884, 1885, 1886, and 1887 probably. They are used for the purpose of corroborating this plaintiff as to the unsoundness of the financial condition of this company in December, 1888; that if the property was so valuable in December, 1883, if the company had so much property, and if it was in good, sound financial condition at that time,- the plaintiff contends here that the embarrassments that soon came upon the company must have existed, or the causes of them must have existed at the time, and that, therefore, the company was not financially sound. This is one of the purposes why these letters were offered in evidence, and to some extent why they were admitted by the court. And again, the plaintiff calls the attention of the court and the jury to the sale of this property in 1886, first selling I think for $6,000, and afterwards selling for §3,000 or §4,000. While this is quite remote, the court has permitted it to come in, because taking it altogether, the condition of the company in 1881, and in 1882, and in December, 1883, and then the subsequent embarrassments in 1884 and 1885, and the final culmination of the embarrassments in 1886, give you apparently the whole history of this company from the beginning to the collapse and the end. But it is for you gentlemen to find whether these letters, whether the evidence of these embarrassments and these losses, throw any light upon the question of the solvency of this company in December, 1883, and whether, in your judgment, they corroborate the testimony of the plaintiff in this case.</p>

The answer made to that by the defendant is, that it is true that the company’s stock was selling at the rate of two shares for one, but it was for the reason that they were paying no cash dividends, and that all the profits and money made by the company went into the improvements of the company.</p>

The defendant contends that when the plaintiff was upon the witness stand she denied giving these papers, and when the papers were shown to her she admitted her signature, admitted her handwriting to these papers. You understand, gentlemen of the jury, that the door has been opened quite wide in this case, both for the one side and the other, which is necessarily so when there is an allegation of fraud. That is the reason that the testimony in regard to the insurance case has been so freely admitted into this case, because it showed the relation of these parties one with the other. It showed what business transactions they had, and what it was that led up to the investment of this money in December, 1883. But the defendant claims that the plaintiff is contradicted b}r these three papers. It is for you, gentlemen of the jury, to decide how much it goes to her discredit, the fact that she denied at first signing these papers, and afterwards, after seeing them, admitting that they were signed by her.

    <p id="b62-9" data-blocks='[["BL_62.12",62,[268,1236,1173,453]]]'>In the court below, this case depended on the determination of disputed questions of fact which had to be submitted to and passed upon by the jury. In submitting these questions the learned trial judge, -in a clear and adequate charge, directed the jury’s attention to the evidence relating to them, and fully instructed them as to the law applicable to the case. The result was a verdict in favor of the defendants, which necessarily implies a determination of the controlling facts adversely to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b62-10" data-blocks='[["BL_62.13",62,[266,1699,1172,297]]]'>Many of the thirty-six specifications are to the rulings of the court during the course of the trial; others are to the charge, etc. We find nothing in any of these specifications that requires special notice. A careful consideration of the record, with special reference to each of them, has failed to convince us that there is any substantial error therein.</p>
