That point is simply this: Was Mr. Turtle a warehouseman in the sense defined by the act of assembly which authorizes a warehouseman to give a receipt for goods taken on storage ? Now, that is the only question in the case ; everything else seems to be regular and fair. If you find that Mr. Turtle was a warehouseman, then I charge you that, having received the goods in his warehouse, and having given a warehouse receipt for them, and that receipt having been indorsed over by Keen-Sutterle Company to the plaintiff, I instruct you that it had a full, absolute title to the goods, as collateral security for the note it discounted for Keen-Sutterle Company. I instruct you that nobody has authority to issue a warehouse receipt, as it is known, unless he be a warehouseman. A warehouseman is one whose business it is to receive goods on storage for compensation, that is a warehouseman. Was Mr. Turtle such a man ? [The first evidence that he was a warehouseman is that he called himself one before there was any trouble. Two years before he rented the property, he took a lease in his own name for the storehouse, and he called it a storehouse. Now what is the next ? Why, Keen-Sutterle Company called him a warehouseman. They agreed that he was, they recognized him as a warehouseman, and they put the goods in his storehouse and accepted a receipt, a formal receipt, acknowledging that their goods were there on storage, and that he was the custodian of the goods as a warehouseman. Then, here are two parties to the transaction that certainly are estopped from denying it. They have put it in writing and induced other people to act upon it. Mr. Turtle made the writing, Keen-Sutterle Company accepted the writing, so they are certainly estopped from denying that he was a warehouseman. Now, the bank acted on it, they recognized him undoubtedly as a warehouseman, because the man who owned the goods said he was a warehouseman; he was the one man, then, who was interested in it; he was not insolvent at the time; he had not failed then ; that is, when I say “ he,” I mean the firm of Keen-Sutterle Company. They had not failed; they had the dominion over the goods ; they could have sold them to anybody; and while they had the dominion over the <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>goods they acknowledged that Mr. Turtle was a warehouseman and put them in his hands — what for ? Why, probably for the very purpose of doing this ; but that does not affect it.] [16] Although you may find that this warehouse was used for the purpose of having a place where goods could be stored and money borrowed by means of the receipts, that does not affect the question, and I think it is altogether likely that KeenSutterle Company had something to do with the creation of this storehouse. I think that is altogether likely, and they for their own convenience, in order to increase their dividends, thought best to have one of their own persons in control. Now, suppose it was Mr. Sutterle’s own son, what difference does that make ? Suppose he said, here, we will want to be constantly pledging our goods, and instead of sending them to other places where we have to pay high storage rates, suppose I place my son in business and he rents the Wood street -warehouse, and we do our business through him, and put our goods in there, and take his warehouse receipt, and thus be able to raise money when we need it from the bank, there is no crime in that. I cannot see any fraud in it; I think Mr. Sutterle or Sutterle Company had the right to induce a clerk, if they chose, to take the responsibility and rent a storehouse for the purpose of giving them facilities for the borrowing of money on goods stored in it. They could not have done that if the goods were in their own possession. I think that is probably the truth of it. It is for you to say. I do not say it is true, but I think it is altogether likely that Keen-Sutterle Company did induce their clerk, Mr. Turtle, to rent that place as a warehouse for their special accommodation, and perhaps it was also understood that they were to be the principal customer, but I instruct you that a warehouseman if he has but one customer, if he keeps a warehouse for the purpose of storing goods and the profit there is in it, it is a warehouse just as much as if he had one hundred. It is not as easy to prove, but still he is a warehouseman if he receives goods on storage and charges storage for them, and that is his business ; he is a warehouseman. I also charge you that it is not necessary that it be his only business. He may be a clerk, as well as a warehouseman ; a lawyer may be a merchant, or he may be a banker, if he sees proper; he may be a preacher; it is not often, I believe, that he is, though. [It has been said <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>that lie received no compensation. Well, 1 am not so sure of that. There are receipts in one book for $40.00 a month, it is stated, as storage paid. It must be conceded that KeenSutterle Company paid the storage by paying his rent. What if they did ? He had his rent to pay. Suppose he goes to them and says, here is the receipt for the goods stored there ; I am liable for the rent; won’t you pay that storage for me ? He was liable to the landlord, who could have levied upon the goods there for rent, and if they gave the money to him to pay the rent with, it was virtually paying that much storage. But that is not the question. Suppose they never paid the rent; suppose they never paid one cent, could he not have recovered it ? It is not necessary that cash should pass ; the right to cash in law is the same thing. So far as the parties are concerned, Keen-Sutterle Company recognized him as a warehouseman; they put the goods in his warehouse and he could have sued them for storage if payment was refused, or under the act of assembly, could have refused to let the goods go until the expenses were paid. He had the goods in his hands.] [17]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[207,1330,1169,1120]]]'>[Let us take another view: suppose the bank had done what the learned counsel says it should have done, before it advanced the money, — sent a man over to see if the goods were there; what would the result be ? The man would have found a storehouse, he would have found the identical goods stored there, he would have inquired of Mr. Sutterle whether he was the keeper of the storehouse, and Mr. Sutterle would say, Certainly I am, and then he would have said, I want the proof of it; and Mr. Sutterle would say, there is my' lease; that is my lease; it is in my name; and the man would say, You have pledged certain goods by this receipt; are those goods in Mr. Turtle’s warehouse, the ones you pledge? and Mr. Sutterle would answer, They are; take your receipt and look at them; and when the man went there he would find the goods. What more could he do? If he had inquired, what information would he have got? Just what he had on the face of the papers. It, therefore, seems to me that the evidence is pretty strong that as far as the parties are concerned Mr. Turtle was a warehouseman; and if you find that he was, that is an end of the question. Then I charge you that the plaintiff has a better title than the defendants to this wool, and it will be your duty to find a verdict for the plaintiff.] [18]</p>

      <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>Now take the other view. There is some evidence from which the jury could find that there was some fraud in the transactions between Mr. Turtle and Keen-Sutterle Company. .... Now, first, if he was a warehouseman, the law has made it a crime in him to let the goods get away from his possession without having the receipt presented. ... I say, therefore, if he was a warehouseman, he is liable for permitting the goods to get out of his custody without the receipts; if he was not a warehouseman he is liable, for he is guilty of a fraudulent and criminal conspiracy in holding himself out to the world as one and giving a receipt upon which money has been given on a false pretense. It is not wonderful that he is not inclined to answer under the advice of his counsel. . . .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b584-5" data-blocks='[["BL_584.4",584,[277,999,1176,967]]]'>There is something we cannot get light upon, and I say it is no wonder that the defendant contests the case, for there is enough in it to make any man contest it. These circumstances are all suspicious. Here is Keen-Sutterle Company depositing goods and taking them away again without any receipt, from one of their places, and it is pretty strong evidence that there is something wrong, something fraudulent, and that there is some intent to form a criminal conspiracy between him and Mr. Sutterle ; but there is no evidence at all that the plaintiff had any intimation of that fact or of any circumstances such as would induce it or put it on inquiry to ascertain before it passed the money. That is the present condition of the case. If this were a contest between the defendant and Keen-Sutterle Company there would be no difficulty about it, the defendant would have title to the goods; if it were a contest between him and another creditor he would have the goods; if it were a contest between him and the sheriff he would have the goods, but it is a contest between him and a man or an institution that claims it has a prior right by virtue of these warehouse receipts.</p>

But, I say here was a warehouseman, here was a lease, and here the goods were actually on storage in a house at the time the receipt was issued and negotiated, and that it is the strong part of the plaintiffs case.] [20] The weak part of his case is that Mr. Turtle was a clerk under the control and employ of the Keen-Sutterle Company, and that he never had anybody there in charge; that the key was there; that any one could get the goods when they pleased and all that. There is some evidence that he had a desk there in which he kept the papers locked up. The only evidence I remember was that he had a desk in the Keen-Sutterle Company house and that he had the key for it, and that is the only evidence of it. [There was nobody on the premises to deliver goods; no watchman there. The goods were stored, and it seems that KeenSutterle Company could get them whenever they wanted them, but there is no evidence that the plaintiff knew that.] [21]</p>

The appellants have the actual possession, having received the wool in the regular course of business from the Keen-Sutterle Company and made advances upon it to nearly its full value.

By the general law governing such instruments this means that the transfer of the receipt is a constructive delivery of the goods.

The act prohibits the issue of a receipt unless the goods shall have been actually received into store or upon the premises of the warehouseman; the issue of any second or duplicate receipt while the first is outstanding, without writing the word duplicate across the face of the second; the delivery of any goods receipted for except on surrender of the receipt; and the sale, incumbrance, etc., by the warehouseman of goods receipted for. These provisions plainly contemplate that the warehouseman shall be one engaged in the business, and also that he shall be another than the owner of the goods. A large part of the security of the holder of the receipt for the actual jmoduction of the goods when called for is tbe business interest and good faith of the warehouseman, and the penal consequences of any breach of duty by him.

    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[273,582,1169,809]]]'>In the present case one Turtle issued the receipt in question, in sufficient form as already said, purporting to be from “ Turtle’s Warehouses, 220, 222 and 224, Wood St.,” and plaintiff at the trial showed the issue of a number.of similar receipts by Turtle, over a period of about two years ; the negotiation of loans by several'New York banks to the Keen-Sutterle Company, on these receipts; and the lease by Turtle of the premises on Wood street in his own name as a warehouse. Many exceptions are raised by appellants to the method of proof of these facte, and to their relevancy. But it is not necessary to discuss them, though some of them are clearly well founded. For present purposes it may be conceded that, standing alone, the facte so proved would make out a prima facie case of warehouse receipt, though the case would be weak in the respect that nearly all the evidence was of the kind that may be called corroborative rather than positive in character.</p>

On the contrary they were accompanied by an array of others, undisputed, or so feebly contested as to be practically admitted, that deprived them of all real weight. It appeared that Turtle, during all the time he was nominally keeping the warehouse and issuing receipts for goods on storage there, was a clerk in the employ of the Keen-Sutterle Company, at a salary; that the rent of the so-called warehouse was not paid by Turtle, but by the Keen-Sutterle Company or by F. W. Sutterle, one of the partners, and the rent due to Turtle from the subtenants of a part of the warehouse was not paid to him but to the KeenSutterle Company or F. W. Sutterle, and the only explanation given was that there was some private arrangement, not disclosed, between Turtle and Sutterle, on this subject; that no storage charges were paid by the Keen-Sutterle Company to Turtle on account of this warehouse, nor any credit given him on their books; that no iiersons other than the Keen-Sutterle Company deposited any goods in the so-called warehouse, though a few receipts were issued in the name of J. B. Moors <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>&amp; Company, under some arrangement with the Keen-Sutterle Company, which the learned judge declined to permit to be inquired into ; and that Turtle had no sign on the warehouse to indicate his proprietorship, kept no books of the business except a book of blank receipts, bad no office or even a desk in the warehouse, did not keep the key in bis possession, was rarely there, and left the whole charge, including the depositing and removal of goods, to the employees of the Keen-Sutterle Company. On these facts it is perfectly clear that there was no real warehouse at all in the case and that Turtle was a mere employee or man of straw used by the Keen-Sutterle Company to cover their own operations with their own goods.</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[194,937,1166,803]]]'>The counsel for appellee have argued very strenuously the proposition that if Turtle held himself out to the world as a warehouseman, and plaintiff had no knowledge to the contrary, it would he sufficient to put plaintiff under the protection of the statute. And the learned court below seems to have fallen into the same view. But this is not enough. To defeat the title of defendants as a consignee without notice, for value, and in good faith, Turtle must have been a warehouseman in fact, and plaintiff’s tide derived through an actual valid warehouse receipt. It is not a question of good faith, or even of diligence, on plaintiff’s part, but of the possession of a good title by means of a valid and genuine receipt. Tliis the plaintiff has failed to prove. The paper given to it was not such a receipt, but a fraudulent imitation, and the bank must, unfortunately for it, bear the Loss. On the practically undisputed facts the verdict should have been directed for defendants.</p>
