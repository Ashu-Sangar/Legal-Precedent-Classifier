This stock was subsequently handed back by Mr. Summers to Laughlin &amp; McManus, without Mrs. Summers’s knowledge, as collateral in certain speculative transactions of his, but there is no evidence that she was aware that her husband had received this stock in exchange or as security for her Pennsylvania Railroad stocks. The Green &amp; Coates stock was given to Laughlin &amp; McManus by Mr. Summers, without the knowledge of his wife, as collateral in the purchase of one hundred shares of Columbia gas stock for him by them. These one hundred shares were afterwards sold by him. Laughlin and McManus knew that the Pennsylvania and Green &amp; Coates stock originally belonged to Mrs. Summers, for the certificates were in her name when they came into their possession.</p>

Snyder, May 28, 1891; one hundred shares of Green &amp; Coates to Walter H. Snyder, December 15,1891. New powers were executed by Mrs. Summers, at her husband’s request, and witnessed by him on August 23 and September 13,1889, for the two hundred shares of Pennsylvania transferred to Walter H. Snyder. Mr. Summers knew at the time that the bank had required the new powers in order to make transfers.</p>

She never made any demand from them from the time o£ delivery, March 21, 1883, and January 21, 1889, until the bill was filed, July 17,1893. She knew that they had been transferred out of her name in October, 1891. She never personally received anything for these stocks.</p>

The two blocks of stock were treated by the receiver and by Laughlin &amp; McManus as having been deposited with them as the property of, and as security for, the transactions of Mr. Summers. These transactions were speculative, but they appear to have been regular contracts of purchase and sale as far as Laughlin &amp; McManus were concerned. With the usual result in such cases Mr. Summers made heavy losses, involving most of the securities belonging to his wife which were capable of hypothecation.</p>

At the time of the failure of Laughlin &amp; McManus, on March 2, 1893, they had not returned either block of stock to Mr. Summers or to the plaintiff, but the receiver credited Mr. Summers’s account on the books of Laughlin &amp; McManus with the sum of $28,125 received as the proceeds of three hundred shares of Pennsylvania stock, and one hundred shares of Green &amp; Coates stock. Mr. Summers owed Laughlin &amp; McManus at the time of their failure about $100,000 on various accounts.</p>

When the receiver was appointed there were in the possession of the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank certain shares of stock of various corporations and other securities of the value of $103,288.29, as collateral for the loan to Laughlin &amp; Mc-Manus of $89,500. The difference between the value of the securities held by the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank and the debt due by Laughlin &amp; McManus, after adjusting the interest, amounted to $12,276.19 in their favor, but among tire securities in the bands of the bank were $27,790.52 in public building <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>due bills which were claimed by Douglass Bros., who bad, according to their claim, merely hypothecated the due bills in a lot of $150,990.04 with Laughlin &amp; McManus for a loan of over $117,000. For various reasons, as these due bills were in danger of being sacrificed, your honorable court made an order under date December 20, 1893, on petition, in consequence of which collection was made upon the building certificates by joint action of Douglass Bros, and the receiver, and the sum of $21,498.88 was conceded to Douglass Bros., and $6,000 to the receiver, and the said amounts respectively paid to them. This division was made in respect of the said entire blocks of building certificates, in compromise as aforesaid of conflicting claims to ownership by Douglass Bros, and the receiver. This $6,000 in due bills was all that the receiver actually obtained in adjustment of the indebtedness between Laughlin &amp; McManus and the various parties, including the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank,- who held the public building due bills as collateral for loans to Laughlin &amp; McManus, and the claim of the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank having thus been settled, it handed over to the receiver ten shares of Kensington Bank stocks as surplus collateral.</p>

Summers, and the one hundred shares of Green &amp; Coates stock were in a certificate likewise issued in the place of one for a similar amount in Mrs. Summers’s ñamé. The above may be considered as the stock originally belonging to her, but it is impossible to thus identify the other one hundred shares of Pennsylvania stock, as they'had passed through a number of hands and were mixed up with other blocks of the same stock in which Laughlin &amp; McManus were interested. The evidence on the subject is that one hundred shares of Pennsylvania stock passed under the power dated March 21, 1883, from Mrs. Summers to Walter H. Snyder. He transferred them to Shoemaker &amp; Co., and on March 11, 1892, <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>Shoemaker &amp; Co. transferred a block of one thousand shares back to Walter H.

    <p class="summary" id="b537-6" data-blocks='[["BL_537.5",537,[188,528,1173,1106]]]'>It is difficult to see, under the facts as found, how the plaintiff is entitled to recover her stock or the value thereof from the receiver, by way of preference over the other creditors, .as prayed for in the bill. According to her own testimony and that of her husband she loaned both blocks of stock to Laughlin &amp; McManus to use as collateral. This they proceeded to do from the time of delivery, and thus they appeared to have remained until the receiver was appointed. Whether Laughlin &amp; McManus used the money raised upon the stocks for their own use, or for the use of Mr. Summers in speculation, is of no moment in this controversy, for having used the stock in one way or the other in accordance with the purposes for which the plaintiff says it was put in their possession, they cannot be said to be guilty of any breach of trust. If they have not committed a breach of trust, the plaintiff is not entitled to follow, claim or recover the value of the stocks by way of preference from the receiver. She is no more than a common creditor in this respect: Bank of Commerce v. McMurray, <a href="/pa/98/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="496926" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0538-01">98 Pa. 538</a>. Her counsel now concedes that she cannot recover the stock itself or its full value, but claims only whatever may be the value of it beyond the amount for which it was hypothecated by Laughlin &amp; Mc-Manus.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b537-7" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[185,1654,1167,338]]]'>The total indebtedness to the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank was $89,500, and the value of the stocks deposited at various times was $103,287.29. The list of collateral produced from the books shows the approximate value of each item of collateral, and the master is asked to apportion the equity of the plaintiff’s stock, hnd to decide that she is entitled to a preference as to that.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b537-8" data-blocks='[["BL_537.7",537,[183,2012,1168,348]],["BL_538.1",538,[261,327,1178,861]]]'>Now, while it may be said that she has succeeded in directly tracing some of the stocks formerly belonging to her from Laughlin &amp; McManus to the Farmers’ &amp; Mechanics’ Bank they were converted long before the receivership, and so commingled with other securities as collateral that the master is of opinion that she cannot point out or claim as belonging to her any proportion of the balance of the proceeds of the sale of all <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>of the securities after the loan was repaid. It is true that the stocks were not sold or turned into cash until after the appointment of the receiver, but they had passed out of the control of Laughlin &amp; McManus, and were sold, not by them or the receiver, but by the pledgee who had held them since January, 1893, if not before that time. The balance after the sale of all the collateral was turned over to the receiver or accounted for to him, but it is impossible to distinguish, under the circumstances, between any right of the plaintiff to share in the fund thus realized and the right of the owners of the other stocks or of every other creditor. We do not know how much the stocks were hypothecated for, what was the amount loaned on their security from time to time, or what was the proportional amount loaned on .the other securities. None of these except the Kensington Bank stock belonged to Laughlin &amp; McManus. The proportional value of the securities to the balance furnishes no equitable standard of adjustment under such circumstances.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[170,456,1170,954]]]'>It appeared in the testimony that the stock was transferred out of Mrs. Summers’s name in consequence of the requirements of the bank with which it was used as collateral. The lender was unwilling to loan money on stock in the name of a married woman without actual transfer. Now, as Mrs. Summers assented to the use of her stock as collateral by Laughlin &amp; Mc-Manus, her assent carried with it the right to do what was necessary in carrying out such purpose. There is nothing to show that she made any conditions about transfer from her name when she handed the stock to her husband, and in giving him the powers of attorney she furnished him with the appropriate means by which the transfers were made possible. He in turn handed these papers to Laughlin &amp; McManus. Their assurance (which there is nothing to show occurred, when they received the Pennsylvania stock originally) that it should never go out of Mrs. Summers’s name, and that the Green &amp; Coates stock would be placed back in her name, gives her no further rights than such as she would have as an ordinary creditor as lender of the stock to them for their use as collateral.</p>

He certainly had sufficient experience in stock transactions to know what that meant, and cannot rely upon a promise inconsistent with the rise for which, according to his own testimony, he delivered it. It is also in evidence that Mr. Summers actually knew that some of the stocks were to be transferred out of his wife’s name, for new powers of attorney for two hundred shares were executed by her on August 23 and September 13, 1889, for this purpose; the demand of the bank which held them as collateral, and the reason therefor having been communicated to him at the time.</p>

If the stocks were <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>loaned to Laughlin &amp; McManus for their benefit, they would naturally pay her the dividends as they accrued, because they only required the use of the stocks as collateral, while if Laughlin &amp; McManus regarded the stocks as collateral for the transaction of the husband, and as belonging to him, they might well pay him the dividends or let him collect them until he chose to pay his debts, for which they claimed to. hold the stocks, or until he redeemed them by return of the securities given in exchange, according to his account of the affair.</p>
