The Jackson Farm Company, prior to the making of the contract of October 12, 1894, with the Conemaugh Company, had a number of producing wells in Armstrong county, the gas from which it supplied at wholesale largely to two consumers, the West Penn Gas Company and P.

In the negotiations leading up to the contract it was stated <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>by the officers of the defendant company that they had a large supply of gas, estimated by them to be about 12,000,000 cubic feet per day. The officers of the plaintiff company stated that they would need a large supply of gas, anticipating that they ■would take on additional business, and that the daily amount they would likely need would be five or six million feet. These statements on both sides were made in good faith, and expressed the honest convictions of the officers as to the respective capacities and needs of their companies.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.4",467,[185,801,1169,298]]]'>5. It was also a matter of discussion at that time as to which party should lay the supply pipe connecting the Avonmore station with the wells of defendant company. If laid by the defendant they wanted four cents a thousand for their gas. It was finally agreed, as stated in the contract, that this line should be laid and owned by the Conemaugh Company.</p>

The nearest point of the system of pipes of the plaintiff to the wells of the defendant was the borough of Avonmore. The distance was some four miles and was intersected by the Kiskiminetas river, at a distance of some three miles from Avon-more. The plaintiff company laid an eight-inch gas main from its Avonmore lines to a point about one hundred feet distant from the wells of the defendant. The connection with the wells was then made by the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b467-7" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[182,1518,1171,859]],["BL_468.1",468,[278,344,1169,144]]]'>7. There was much conflicting testimony on the question as to the condition of the supply pipe from the wells of the defendant company to the station at Avonmore; the witnesses varying to the extreme in the matter of opinion as to the extent of the leakage and the manner in which the line was laid and maintained. The most conservative estimate was given by S. W. Day, an employee and witness of defendant, who, at its request, had made a careful examination of the leaks about May 1, 1895. This testimony indicates that while there were a number of noticeable leaks, the aggregate of these leakages amounted to some 22,800 feet in every twenty-four hours. There were a number of smaller leaks at the collars, where the gas could be just heard escaping, but the witness could not say how many of these there were, as he paid no attention to them. The line was a surface line laid of second-hand pipe, and carrying gas at a pressure of from seventy to eighty pounds on the average. The referee finds that the supply main from the wells to <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>Avonmore leaked to some extent, but not more than might reasonably be expected of a surface line carrying gas at a high pressure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[273,498,1172,708]]]'>8. From time to time the superintendent and other employees of the plaintiff company went over the line to inspect it and make necessary repairs. Owing to the fact that the line lay on the surface of the ground, much trouble was experienced in keeping the Teaks closed, as the expansion and contraction of the line loosened the lead filling under the sleeves, w'hich were put over the larger leaks, and caused the gas to break out again. The superintendent of the Conemaugh Company at one time requested the superintendent of the Jackson Farm Company to take his own men and put the line in repair at the expense of the former company. This was accordingly done. The referee finds that the plaintiff company, through its officers and employees, used due diligence in endeavoring to repair and maintain the supply main in proper condition.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b468-6" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[270,1215,1169,298]]]'>9. The line broke twice in the Kiskiminetas river, by reason of the high water in that river canying out the séction of the line which crossed it. The first of these breaks was on March 1; the second on April 9. On each occasion notice was sent as promptly as possible to the employees of the defendant company, and the gas turned off without unnecessary delay.</p>

The system of mains and pipes of the plaintiff company was so arranged that by placing gates at certain points of intersection, the field supplied could be divided into two separate parts, and the gas supplied by the defendant company could be run-through certain lines and supply certain consumers without mingling with the gas of the plaintiff ■ company, which could thus be used to supply the remaining consumption. This arrangement of gates was perfected on February 1, 1895. After this date the gas supplied by the two companies did not intermingle, but was used to supply separately the consumers set apart to each.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b468-8" data-blocks='[["BL_468.7",468,[263,2080,1170,298]]]'>11. After this separation was affected the plaintiff company made its monthly settlements and payments to the defendant company on the basis of the meter readings of the consumers of the plaintiff. The defendant sent its employees with those of the plaintiff to ascertain that these meter readings were correctly taken.</p>

When gas was about to be first delivered under the contract, that is, about November 1,1894, the officers of the plaintiff stated to the officers of the defendant that they need not purchase a meter for the present, until the plaintiff could ascertain whether or not it could then separate its own gas supply from that of the defendant. In accordance with this notice or statement, the defendant hired or borrowed a meter, and used same for temporary purposes. Afterwards, about December 1, 1894, the plaintiff’s officers notified the defendant that they could not make the separation as expected, and that the defendant should go ahead and procure the meter as provided for in the contract. The defendant, in accordance with this latter notice, at once gave an order for a proportional meter to be placed at Avonmore, at a cost of about $2,000.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b469-5" data-blocks='[["BL_469.4",469,[192,1051,1167,1015]]]'>13. The meter placed at Avonmore was used to measure the gas delivered from the defendant to the plaintiff company. Any leakages on the line from Avonmore to the wells came out before the gas was measured. It was what was known as a proportional meter, being arranged on a system by which the gas was separated in the meter, a fractional part, one per cent or two per cent, measured separately, and from the tally kept of these measurements and by proper multiplication the whole volume of gas passing through the meter could be determined. The meter was tested before being put in place and found to be accurate, and again tested on May 6, 1895, and found to be accurate. It is, of course, impossible to say with certainty that the meter made no mistakes, or that no mistakes were made in taking and reducing the reading. The presumptions, however, are all in favor of the fact that the meter accurately measured the gas delivered through it. The referee finds that the proportional meter placed by the defendant company at Avon-more, was, so far as the tests and evidence in the case can make the fact appear, accurate in its measurement of gas delivered through it to the plaintiff company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[190,2075,1167,290]]]'>14. After February 1, 1895, although, as found above, the readings of the meters of the plaintiff’s consumers were taken as the basis of settlement and payment with the defendant company, yet the latter company still continued to measure the gas delivered to plaintiff through its proportional meter, and to preserve a record of these measurements.</p>

The measurements of gas as delivered through the proportional meter of the defendant and the measurements of gas as taken from the readings of the consumers’ meters of the plaintiff did not agree ; the former showing a much larger volume delivered than the latter showed consumed. The details of these differences are given in the next finding.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[249,636,1175,1109]]]'>16. From February 1, 1895, to February 21, 1895, the meter readings of the plaintiff company showed a consumption of 28.384.000 feet. From February 1, to 1 P. M. on February 16, the meter of the defendant company showed a delivery of 23.464.000 feet. On that day the recording tally of the meter was removed, and no actual record of the gas delivered through the remainder of the month was kept. It was estimated, however, by the treasurer of the defendant company, that the aggregate of gas delivered through the month was 43,995,000 feet. On March 1 the line was broken in the river, and no gas was delivered until March 19 at noon. From this time until April 1, the measurements of the plaintiff company aggregated 3,716,000 feet. The meter of the defendant showed a delivery through the same period of 8,764,000 feet. From April 1 to April 9, when the line finally broke, the plaintiff company’s meters showed a consumption of 2,742,857 feet; the defendant’s meter for the same period showed a delivery of 5,731,000 feet. So that on April 9, 1895, when gas ceased to be delivered, the meter of the defendant showed that since February 1, 1895, there had been delivered 23,287,143 cubic feet of gas more than that which was registered by the meters of the plaintiff’s consumers.</p>

There is no explanation to be found in the testimony for the variation between these two sets of meter reading. There have been various conjectures or suggestions, but there is nothing in the testimony upon which a finding of fact can be based adequate to explain the large difference between the measurement by consumption and supply.</p>

It would hardly be fair to either party to attempt to summarize the contents of the several letters which are spread in full upon the notes of testimony. Briefly noting the outline of the controversy, it appears that the first subject of discussion was the meaning of the word “ preference ” used in the contract, the plaintiff contending that this gave it the right to draw on the surplus of the defendant whenever it saw proper, the defendant contending that it merely gave the other party the right <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>to an offer of the gas at the same price which a third party might offer for it, before a contract could be closed with such third party. In a letter of May 17, 1895, Mr. Eaton, president of the defendant company, directs attention to the fact that according to his computation the declaration of the minimum is insufficient, that it should be for 1,074,000 cubic feet; that the supply line was defective and leaking badly; that the meter-readings of the two companies varied greatly, showing a loss to his company of nearly sixty per cent of the gas delivered; that the defendant company would place a meter at the end of its line and measure the gas there; that the plaintiff must pay for the March gas according to the meter of the defendant; and that, for the last time, it offered plaintiff a preference for all the gas it would take. This letter also inclosed a certificate of the test of the proportional meter. The reply of Mr. Stone, president of the plaintiff company, of the date of May 30, 1895, after discussing the subject of the preference, refers to the declaration of the minimum, and while assenting to its correctness, suggests that it is a matter for conference between the treasurers of the two companies. It denies that the supply line was in bad or leaky condition, and asks that attention be called to any leaks that may be known to exist. It states that while the contract called for measurement by the meters of the consumers of plaintiff, yet the discrepancy was so large as to call for careful investigation, and it was suggested that the treasurers of the two companies might take it up and bring about a satisfactory settlement; that if other matters were arranged it might be that the clause providing for measurement by consumers’ meters might be abrogated, and that the writer would recommend that it at least be waived until the cause of the March discrepancy be ascertained. On June 15, a proposition from the defendant Avas sent by Mr. Eaton, proposing a diAÚsion of the discrepancy in the account of gas furnished, the plaintiff paying for one half; all gas furnished thereafter to be paid for accordingly to the defendant’s meter reading; the meter to be replaced at Avonmor'e, provided the plaintiff would permit the defendant company to put the line in proper order and maintain same at their expense ; the plaintiff to pay for the daily minimum of gas when not actually taken in any month on the 18th of the next month, the over-payments to apply on future month when more than the daily average Avas taken.</p>

To this letter the Jackson Farm Company replied on June 29, stating that their proposition of June 15 must be accepted in its entirety or not at all. On August 27, 1895, the plaintiff made a demand on the defendant company for 1,000,000 feet of gas daily from September 1, then ensuing. On the 28th of the same month the defendant replied that the plaintiff company had forfeited all its rights under the contract of October 12,1894; and asking to be informed when and at what rate the gas would be paid for, how measured, and whether 1,000,000 feet would be their daily minimum.</p>

Presumably the findings were authorized by the evidence, and the presumption that they were is strengthened by the clear, concise and obviously impartial report in which they appear, and by the approval of the report by the court, after full argument upon and due consideration of the exceptions to it. A careful reading of the voluminous testimony in the case having satisfied us that the findings referred to were clearly warranted by it, an elaborate discussion of it is not called for. It is shown by many decisions of this court that the party complaining of the verdict of a jury or the findings of a master, auditor or referee, as unauthorized by the evidence, must specify the deficiencies in it and show that it is legally insufficient to sustain the verdict or findings of which complaint is made. In the case at bar a strenuous effort was made to convince us of error in the findings referred to, but it was unsuccessful because, as we have seen, they were sustained by the evidence.</p>

We do not assent to this view of the case. There is certainly no reasonable ground for denying that in view of the nature and subject-matter of the controversy a court of equity affords the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>most convenient remedy for a just disposition of the questions involved in it, while the remedy afforded by a court of law is obviously inconvenient, and the adequacy of it is at least doubtful.
