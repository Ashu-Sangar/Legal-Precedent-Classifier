Gallatin, appellant, No. 56 of January term, 1897, and involves substantially the same questions that have been considered and disposed of in an opinion just filed in that case, ante, p. 150. This case, as was that, is a “ case stated,” for the opinion of the court, in which all the facts necessarily appear of record. , The material questions in both cases being substantially the same, it is unnecessary to do more than refer to the opinion in the other case. For reasons there given, we think the learned court below erred in entering the judgment complained of; and both assignments of error should therefore be sustained.</p>
