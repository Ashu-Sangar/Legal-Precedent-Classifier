By an assignee’s sale the property became vested in Cbarles M. Shelley subject to the charge created by the will. After the deatli of Joseph Rebman, Susanna demanded payment of the legacy from Cbarles M. Shelley, and upon refusal brought suit against him and recovered a judgment. Under this judgment execution was issued and, at the sheriff’s sale, Susanna bought the property, and subsequently received a deed from the sheriff for it. On April 5, 1898, she executed an agreement in writing to sell a tract of said property to John S. Dierdorff; that in pursuance of said agreement she tendered ber deed for said tract to said Dierdorff, and demanded payment of tbe purchase money; that Dierdorff refused, and still refuses to accept said deed and pay said purchase money, or any part thereof, for the reason, as he avers, that she is not entitled to the payment of said legacy of $3,300 absolutely, but the same is payable at her death to the children of her brother, Samuel D. Feiser, under the provisions of the will of her father, and that she holds said real estate under the sheriff’s sale thereof to her, subject to tbe lien of said legacy, and that, therefore, she cannot convey said tract clear of all incumbrances.</p>

That judgment remains in full force and unreversed, and determines, as between parties to it, the ownership of the fund. However, it may not determine it as to the children of Samuel Reiser, deceased, who would have been entitled to it in remainder had Susanna Rebman died childless in the lifetime of her husband, and this is what still leaves the controversy open. She did not so die; she survived him, although childless it is true. The point aimed at by the condition in tbe will is perfectly apparent, namely, to prevent her husband from acquiring any interest in the fund, should Susanna Rebman die childless in the lifetime of her husband. In that event one half of tbe fund would have gone away from tbe blood of tbe testator, and it may be readily imagined that this may not have been desirable to tbe testator; hence tlie provision in bis will limiting the fund, which before be bad given her absolutely. It does not seem to me that this view of the question is open to successful denial, although a pointed and final adjudication of it, by the court of last resort, is desirable, in order to remove wbat is supposed to be a cloud on the title to the real estate bound by the charge in the testator’s will, and which is now offered and refused on this account.</p>
