But then came the Act of March 24, 1877, P.

The party excepting should at the same time request that the charge and answers to points be written out and filed by the stenographer.” Then further, in Connell v. O’Neil, supra: “In regard to the charge to the jury, including the answers to points presented by the parties, the several acts of assembly of February 24, 1806, April 15, 1856, and March 24, 1877, have provided an additional way of getting them upon the record, beside a bill of exceptions, to wit, a filing by the judge upon request of a party. . . . When the charge has been thus filed by the judge’s direction at the express request of a party made before verdict, and only when such direction affirmatively appears, the charge becomes part of the record and is assignable for error.” Then again, in Smith v. Times Publishing Co., <a href="/citations/?q=178%20Pa.%20497" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="178 Pa. 497">178 Pa. 497</a>, Justice Mitchell, in noting the persistent misunderstanding of what was decided in Janney v.

Null, <a href="/pa/154/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="154 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="842350" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0573-01">154 Pa. 573</a>, and Grugan v.

Howard as to the assignment of errors to a charge properly filed, but did not go beyond that and so far as Janney v. Howard appears to give countenance to anything further, it is now definitely overruled, and is not to be cited again as authority on that point.” Further, in Railroad Co. v. Hall, <a href="/citations/?q=61%20Pa.%20366" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="61 Pa. 366">61 Pa. 366</a>, Justice Williams speaking for this Court says : “The charge, which is the basis of the other assignments, is not properly on the record. No exception was taken to it, nor was the court asked to reduce it to writing and file it at the time of the trial. It was filed, as the presiding judge certifies, at the request of counsel of the defendants below, made more than <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>seven months after the verdict was rendered, and a month after judgment was entered thereon, and without any bill of exceptions being sealed thereto. As the charge has not been brought upon the record. ... it is not properly before us, and this would be a sufficient reason for disregarding the assignments of error and affirming the judgment.”</p>
    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[199,614,1161,1014]]]'>What is our settled construction of the statutes on this subject? 1. There must be an exception noted to the charge before verdict to enable a complaining party to successfully assign errors thereto afterwards. It is not necessary to specify the error at that time. But counsel must then indicate their dissent from the law as announced by the judge by having noted an exception to the charge. He then knows, if he ever knows, whether his contention is sustained or overruled. He is no longer bound to tender a bill of exceptions, specifying particularly the errors he complains of, and praying that bills be sealed. Of this, the legislation since 1856 has relieved him; but he has not been relieved either by statute or decision, if he has any objection to the law announced in his hearing by the court, of then making it known of record. It is asking but little of him that, if he then have any reason to dissent, he have his exception noted of record. 2. He must request, before verdict, that the charge be reduced to writing from the stenographer’s notes and filed of record, and that he does so request must appear of record. If the record does not so show, his appeal will be quashed on motion of the opposite counsel.</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[200,1637,1161,244]]]'>The record here shows no exception to the charge before verdict, and no request to the court before verdict to order it to be filed. Consequently, there is no charge lawfully of record for our consideration. Therefore it is directed that the appeal be quashed at costs of appellants.</p>
