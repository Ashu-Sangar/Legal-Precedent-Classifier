Stat. [ed. 1891] p. 443), makes a substantially similar provision in more condensed phraseology: “ That the individual liability of a ship owner shall be limited to the proportion of any or all debts and liabilities that his individual share of the vessel bears to the whole, and the aggregate liabilities of all the owners of a vessel on account of the same shall not exceed the value of said vessels and freight pending.” By the Act of June 19,1886, see. 4, 24 Stat. at Large, 79 (Supp. Rev.

It Avas further held in the former case that the limitation of liability Avas enacted by congress as part of the maritime law of the United States, and is coextensive in its operation with the whole territorial domain of that law.

That control is paramount, and when it has been exercised in a <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>particular way all state authority must conform to it. The second objection, that the limitation cannot be administered by a state court in a common-law action, must depend primarily on the language of the acts of congress and the nature of the right which they confer. If such right is contingent on something to be done by the vessel owner or others, then we must look into the pleadings or the evidence of the acts of the parties. But if, on the other hand, the right is absolute, then clearly it cannot be defeated by the plaintiff’s choice of the tribunal, and if the state court is unable through defect of its jurisdiction over parties or subject-matter, or through its methods of procedure, to protect the right, then the court must dismiss the case for want of appropriate powers to determine it in accordance with the paramount law on the subject.</p>
    <p id="b545-5" data-blocks='[["BL_545.4",545,[180,1049,1167,1217]]]'>This brings us to the consideration of the acts of congress. The limitation of liability under both the acts of 1851 and 1884 is general and absolute. By the former the liability “ shall in no case exceed,” and by the latter “shall be limited to,” the value of the individual owner’s interest in the vessel. The former provision is contained in section 3 of the act of 1851, and by section 4, it is provided that whenever the loss is by several owners of goods, etc., and the whole value of the vessel and freight is not sufficient, they shall receive compensation in proportion to their respective losses, and the owner of the vessel may take appropriate proceedings in any court for the purpose of apportioning the sum for which he is liable among the parties entitled thereto. It then continues, that it shall be sufficient compliance by the owner with the requirements of the act if he shall transfer his interest in the vessel and freight to a trustee for the parties entitled, to be appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction, and thereupon all claims and proceedings against the owner shall cease. There is nothing in this section which in any way changes the positive character of the limitation. The provisions are manifestly in furtherance, not in restriction, of the vessel owner’s right, and are directory only, in the sense that they point out a method by which his right may bo enforced, but are not exclusive of other methods which may be found effective for the same purpose.</p>

In the case of The Scot<a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>land, <a href="/us/105/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="105 U.S. 24" data-case-ids="3495472" data-case-paths="/us/105/0024-01">105 U. S. 24</a>, it was said by Bkadley, J.: “ The primary enactment in sec. 4288, Rev. Stat. is that the liability of the owner for any loss or damage shall in no case exceed the amount of value of his interest in the vessel and her freight then pending. Two modes for carrying out this law are then prescribed, one in sec. 4284 and the other in sec. 4285.” These sections are the revision and re-enactment of section 4 of the act of 1851 just discussed. The same opinion then proceeds to show that these modes are in aid and not in restriction of the owner’s right to limit his liability, and are not therefore exclusive, but the defense may be made in any form that the nature of the case and the procedure of the court will permit. And to the same effect are Providence and N. Y. S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., <a href="/us/109/0578-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="109 U.S. 578" data-case-ids="8182" data-case-paths="/us/109/0578-01">109 U. S. 578</a>, 594, and Craig v. Continental Ins.

Rep. 132</a>, where a petition by the vessel owner for establishment of limited liability and for prohibition of further proceedings by a plaintiff in a state court was dismissed by the district court of the United States on the ground that the defense could be adequately made in the state court. It is true that this conclusion has been dissented from in Quinlan v. Pew, <a href="/f/56/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="56 F. 111" data-case-ids="6715065" data-case-paths="/f/56/0111-01">56 Fed.
