The plaintiff owned in fee a tract of about six acres in Lower Merion township, Montgomery county. The land had a frontage of 300 feet on the Schuylkill river, and extended back 1,100 feet; through it flowed a stream known as Gully run, alleged by plaintiff to be pure spring water; on this land, at an expense of over #350,000, he had erected a large paper factory known as the Ashland Paper Mills, operated for the manufacturing of book paper. There were also erected on the land a mansion house with stables, tenement houses for workmen, pulp mills and all the accessories for a proper operation of the plant. There was also upon the land a reservoir for retaining pure water, of an area of about three acres, from which the water pipes leading to the factory were fed. Prior to the erection of the paper mill, the Reading Railroad had been located through the land, upon an elevated structure, having a right of way thirty feet wide. In addition to this appropriation, Rudolph, in May, 1868, conveyed to the same railroad company a strip of land 100 feet wide, containing about seven tenths of an acre, adjoining its right of way, for purposes of a coal siding and freight facilities for his mills. <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>The company, besides, stipulating that it would at its own proper cost construct sidings and coal bins; further, covenanted that it would in no way obstruct or interfere with the water course upon the property.</p>

This involved to some extent the reconstruction of the bank of the stream to make room for and sustain the railroad bed. The defendant then constructed and commenced operating its railroad. Plaintiff afterwards operated his paper mills, but eventually closed them, in which condition they have remained. Soon after an adverse decision in an equity suit, Rudolph v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/166/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="166 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="864183" data-case-paths="/pa/166/0430-01">166 Pa. 430</a>, on March 9, 1895, he commenced this statutory proceeding to have his damages assessed. One petition, that in No. 107, October term, 1890, averred that the railroad company had entered upon and taken about two hundred and twenty-three one thousandths acres of his land west of the Reading railroad, along Gully run, and then down said run and along the Schuylkill river to the Pencoyd Iron Works, that, further, the railroad company, for the purpose of constructing and operating its railroad, had removed the earth and created an artificial embankment for the location of its track, and thereby the stream washed into the earth and carried it into his reservoir or settling pool. And further, by the operation of the road, coal dust, cinders, soot and grease were constantly deposited in the pool, polluting the water and rendering it unfit for manufacturing purposes. Viewers were appointed on this petition who assessed plaintiff’s damages at $67,158. From this award plaintiff appealed. On the same day, plaintiff presented another petition averring that the railroad company had appropriated about one half acre of other land for the purpose of constructing its branch to said Pencoyd Iron Works ; and in the construction of its road, had removed two dwelling houses, filled up the cellars and located trestlework along the stream, thereby greatly depreciating the <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>market value of his property; that the water of said stream was polluted by washings of earth occasioned by rain storms; that he had sustained great damage, both direct and consequential; he therefore prayed a view to assess his damages. Viewers were appointed who assessed his damages on this petition at '$2,970.40. Plaintiff appealed from this award also. Both appeals, by agreement, were tried in the court below before one struck jury. In the first issue, a verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiff for $110,000; in the second, for $5,360. After full consideration by the court on motions for new trial, judgments for plaintiff were directed on both verdicts, and we have before us two appeals by defendant. A third appeal was tried before the same jury. It related exclusively to the mansion house property, and no question concerning it is involved in the two appeals before us. A new trial was granted, and it is still pending in the court below.</p>

The Reading Railroad appropriated a right of way through it, and long afterwards plaintiff conveyed to the same company a strip adjoining this right of way for railroad purposes. Did this make the one tract two ? The property was purchased by plaintiff for a distinct purpose, the manufacture of paper; the whole tract was as necessary to his purpose as any part of it; the stream and the land adjoining, while not intended to supply a water power, were intended to secure an uninterrupted and uninterfered with supply of water for manufacturing purposes in the mill. Without the supply of water furnished from the stream and reservoir on the land on the opposite side of the Reading Railroad, the paper mill could not be operated. The water and the land on which it was accumulated constituted an indispensable appurtenance of the mill, and made the whole one property; and the mere right of way and conveyance could not destroy their identity as one property. We think with the court beiow that the remarks of Justice Clakk, in Potts v. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/119/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="119 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="558092" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0278-01">119 Pa. 278</a>, are directly in point: “ In order that two properties having no physical connection may be regarded as one in the assessment of damages for right of way, they must be so inseparably connected in the use to which they are applied as that the injury and destruction of one must necessarily and permanently injure the other.” It is assumed in that case that there may be but one assessment of two properties wholly disconnected, if they are necessarily used as one. Here, the land was not disconnected, except that a common carrier, serving the manufactory, ran its cars over the surface, and even then, plaintiff had a right of way across the railroad. If the taking by defendant had been at one time, instead of at different dates in distinct parcels, one view could have embraced every item of plaintiff’s claim. The <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>court below, therefore, committed no error, in assuming in its instruction to the jury that the property injured by the taking was one property, and that injury to the water which supplied the mill on the part west of the Reading Railroad was a proper-subject for consideration in assessing consequential damages to the mill property east of the road. Defendant, further, asked the court to decide, as matter of law, that the appropriation of the land west of the road necessarily included the consequential injury to the mill which the water supplied, and that, whether evidence had been given in that particular or not in that proceeding, it could not be considered in estimating the damages to the mill. To understand this point the order in which the land was appropriated must be noticed. In February, the railroad company located its road across the stream at the head of the reservoir, intending to follow the bank on the north side. This route was subsequently abandoned, and another selected on the south bank of the stream; this taking included the stream and all the tract on the south bank; on this the road was constructed, and has since been operated. There were thus two takings; as the first taking was not followed by the operation of the road, and tbe second was, the consequential injuries to the mill were in fact sustained by the second "taking. The request for instruction was based wholly on a theory, and not on a fact. If the first location had been followed by the construction and operation of the road upon it, then the consequential injury would have arisen by that appropriation ; but having been abandoned, the evidence as to pollution of the water related mainly to the second location. As the injury might have been occasioned by the adoption of the first route, but was not, there is no reason why the claim should not be made for the act which really occasioned it. The court below most carefully instructed the jury on the facts proved, and there could not have been any duplication of damages, or any injustice to defendant, when the charge and answers to points are considered together. While the appropriation by the first taking was complete as soon as the railroad company filed its bond, yet the market value of the property is to be determined, not only by the taking, but also, from the construction and operation. And this was the measure of damages the jury was instructed to adopt.</p>

It must be kept in mind, in determining his remedy, that defendant appropriated for its roadbed and embankments a considerable part of the bed of the stream. We aré not called upon to consider what would have been his remedy, if any, for the pollution of the water alone, had defendant located its road on the land of another. It is undisputed that they took possession of part of the creek bed. Chancellor Kent, in Gardner v. Newburgh, 2 Johns, Chancery R., 162 says : “A right to a stream of water is as sacred as a right to the soil over which it flows. It is a part of the freehold, of which no man can be disseized, but by lawful judgment of his peers or by due process of law.” In a note to this case, 7th Am. Dec. 527, after citing cases following it, it is said : “ The right to the use of water is a right of property, depending on the ownership of the land over which the water flows.” Angelí on Water Courses, sec. 5, says: The right of private property in a water course is derived as a corporeal right or hereditament from, or is embraced by, the ownership of the soil over which it naturally passes.” All our cases, and they are many, distinctly hold this qualified right of property in the riparian owner. The decisions in our state are prac<a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>tically summarized in Pa. R. R. Co. v.

In substance, they hold that the riparian right is not an absolute ownership of the water of the stream. This is not pretended. The riparian owner could not sell the water to a nonriparian owner, nor could he possess himself of the whole of it; such is not his right; his right is qualified by the rights of the lower riparian owners. But this qualified right appertaining to his property along the stream adds to the value of the property. When plaintiff’s property was taken, defendant injured and, from the evidence, to some extent, destroyed it; it became useless to him; theretofore he had used the stream lawfully ; now, of that use, by defendant’s appropriation of his land and construction and operation of its road, he has been deprived.</p>

The taking' of the land, which formed part of the bed of the stream, and the construction of the road were lawful; the necessary implication from the appropriation and construction was the ordinary and lawful use of the road when constructed. An extraordinary use or an unlawful one was not within the contemplation of the remedial statute, nor of the parties, and, of course, for such damage in the future the plaintiff must seek his remedy under another form of action.</p>

It did not, as does the act of 1849, require them to take into consideration the disadvantages. This court, Stbong-, J., said: “ It would be a narrow construction, however, were we to hold that the legislature did not intend an assessment of all the damages which are the direct and immediate consequence of the construction of the road to the whole tract of land through which it may pass. It is upon the whole tract that the road is located, though only a part is actually occupied. The injury is therefore done to the tract as a whole, of whatever components that injury may consist.

As tlie damages here spoken of cannot liave reference to the land actually appropriated, since, as to it, its price is a Cull compensation, it follows that we must eons true tbe statutory direction to mean an estimation of tbe depreciation resulting to the remaining lands of the proprietor from the construction of the works.

The court below instructed the jury that the one who owned the injured property when the work was completed was alone entitled to recover. This was held to be error; that there could be no severance; the moment of appropriation with a view to construction, gave the right of action. In several cases, commencing with Railway Co. v. Swank, <a href="/pa/105/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="105 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="454270" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0555-01">105 Pa. 555</a>, we have held that a mere release by the owner of the light of way was a bar to a subsequent action for damages from the construction and lawful operation of the railroad.

But, instead of calling for over six acres, the quantity included in <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>the boundaries, the petition set forth that there were but five and one half acres. Tliere is no evidence that plaintiff claimed before the viewers a quantity more than he owned after the conveyance.</p>
    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[167,530,1162,133]]]'>The third assignment is without merit; the court gave to the evidence all the significance it was entitled to. The same may be said of the twelfth aud thirteenth.</p>
    <p id="b579-6" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[165,682,1164,237]]]'>As to the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth which complain of the verdict as excessive, the court below did not think so. As there was evidence which, if believed by the jury, warranted it, it is not of that excessive character which calls for review here.</p>
    <p id="b579-7" data-blocks='[["BL_579.6",579,[210,939,479,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
