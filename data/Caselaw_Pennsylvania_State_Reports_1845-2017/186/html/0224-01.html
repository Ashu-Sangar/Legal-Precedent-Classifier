Mr. Henderson, who has signed the release in question, as agent, .... took occasion to read over this clause to Mr. Windle: ‘ By the acceptance of this grant, the Crescent Pipe Line Company agrees . ... to pay for actual injuries done to lands, timber, crops, fences, buildings and improvements, whatsoever, occasioned by the construction of said line through and over said land.’ .... <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>After reading this clause he said to him : ‘Now this means all injuries ; none will be left out.’ He repeated that two or three times. And in explaining to the witness what the one hundred dollars was for he said: ‘ That is just to keep us from going to West Chester to fiie a bond.’ .... 1 want to show also that the witness did not understand the technical legal phrase, ‘ all actual injuries done to lands,’ .... but supposed, as he was led to suppose by these agents, and by Mr. Henderson in particular, that it meant all damages, and that none would be left out. ... I will also show by this witness that the one hundred dollars given him, apparently for the right of way, if this instrument is to be interpreted literally, is a grossly inadequate price for the easement or right of way across his place, if the depreciation to the land as to its market value is to be taken into consideration. I will also prove .... that a number of times .... between 1892 .... and 1895, different agents called on him and said to him that they would be back again and try to make a settlement; that they made no offer from the time of the laying of the pipe until the fall of 1895, and then he learned for the first time that they refused to pay him consequential damages.” (The above being the material quotations from the offer.)</p>

    <p id="b246-9" data-blocks='[["BL_246.12",246,[295,1725,1175,608]]]'>The plaintiff has clearly mistaken his remedy. In his statement he declared as the owner of a farm for a trespass by an entry “ without authority of law or of the plaintiff,” the digging Of a ditch,'and putting down of a pipe therein, the trampling of his grass, cutting of his trees, and damage by the leakage of oil from the pipe. His evidence in chief .was all upon the same lines. The defendant then put in evidence a release under seal, by which plaintiff authorized the entry and granted the defendant a right of way for its pipe, the defendant stipulating to pay for all actual injuries to lands, timber, crops, fences, buildings and improvements, and for all damages from bursting or leaking of the pipe, etc.</p>

This he would have been entitled to do if his testimony had reached the required standard. But it clearly did not. It was an offer to show that plaintiff supposed from the representations made to him that he would get the same damages as his neighbors, and that they would include “all damages,” although the words used in the writing were “to pay for all actual injuries.” Without going over the long offer in detail, it is sufficient to say that there was no allegation that anything had been left out of the paper by fraud, accident or mistake, or that there was any parol promise or agreement made at the time, without which it would not have been signed by plaintiff. Nor were there any damages averred in the statement that were not provided for in the release. The offer therefore fell short, and the judge was light in rejecting it. The plaintiff’s remedy appearing clearly to be on bis contract, the judge was also right in bolding that he could not recover in the present action. The extent of liis rights under the contract it would be premature to discuss.</p>
