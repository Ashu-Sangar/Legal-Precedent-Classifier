    <p class="summary" id="b162-10" data-blocks='[["BL_162.9",162,[257,1352,1182,1067]]]'>We are of opinion that the orphans’ court has exclusive jurisdiction of the matter alleged in the bill. The whole controversy arises over the interpretation of the will of Charles Tyson. The estate of the testator is before the orphans’ court, the surviving executor is endeavoring to administer it, and the construction of the will is specially entrusted to the orphans’ court. The rival claimants to the property in dispute are also in the orphans’ court. The court has control over the executors of Mary Tyson as well as over the surviving executor of Charles Tyson. Why seek the aid of another court when the parties and subject-matter are peculiarly within the control of the orphans’ court ? Whether these bonds, stocks and lands belong to the estate of Charles Tyson can be determined by the orphans’ court. The orphans’ court alone has the authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent’s property and order its distribution among those entitled to it: Phillips, Administrator, v. Railroad-Co., <a href="/pa/107/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="107 Pa. 465" data-case-ids="8858214" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0465-01">107 Pa. 465</a>. This property belongs to the husband’s estate or to the widow’s estate and both estates are in process of settlement in the orphans’ court and all matters arising in the distribution must come under the jurisdiction of the orphans’ court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.3",163,[193,316,1168,1776]]]'>
      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>It is contended that the equity court should intervene to restrain the executors of Mary Tyson from diverting the property to the irreparable loss of the estate of Charles Tyson. But we must not forget that the orphans’ court has power to prevent, by order in the nature of writs of injunction, acts contrary to law or equity, prejudicial to property over which it has jurisdiction: Appeal of Misldmins, <a href="/pa/114/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="114 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="550020" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0530-01">114 Pa. 530</a>. Again, “ The authority of the orphans’ court is plenary, embracing as it does all the powers of a court of chancery, .... and if need be, can enforce its mandates by proceedings for contempt: ” Lafferty v. Corcoran, <a href="/citations/?q=180%20Pa.%20314" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="180 Pa. 314">180 Pa. 314</a>. After a careful consideration of the prayer of the bill, we find that the sole question is one of settlement or administration in the orphans’ court. It is now the settled law, that the orphans’ court has exclusive jurisdiction over all things pertaining to the settlement and distribution of estates: Linsonbigler v. G-ourley, <a href="/pa/56/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="56 Pa. 166" data-case-ids="1009166" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0166-01">56 Pa. 166</a>. No matter of settlement or touching the administration of an estate can be drawn within the power of the common pleas: Campbell’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/80/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="80 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1042360" data-case-paths="/pa/80/0298-01">80 Pa. 298</a>. The orphans’ court, in a proceeding to distribute an estate among legatees, next of kin and heirs, has ample power to inquire into and determine all questions standing directly in the way of a distribution to these parties: Dundas’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%20480" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="73 Pa. 480">73 Pa. 480</a>. The executors of Mary Tyson are under the control of the orphans’ court. If they interfere prejudicially with the property belonging to the estate of Charles Tyson they may be restrained, and the court has power to enforce its mandates. There are no facts in dispute as the case now presents itself; the sole inquiry is, what estate did Mrs. Tyson take under her husband’s will ? When the orphans’ court is called upon to decide this 'inquiry, its final decree must end all controversy. If we send this case into the equity court, we do so for the sole purpose of having that court interpret the will of Charles Tyson. The orphans’ court alone must attend to this matter. Her grasp is already laid upon the will, and there is no authority that can wrest it from her hands.</p>
