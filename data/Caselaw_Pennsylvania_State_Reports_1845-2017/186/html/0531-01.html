The trustee was to collect the income and pay it over, less expenses, to the grantor during the latter’s lifetime, and after the death of the grantor the trustee was to convey the land to the grantor’s brothers and sisters. Power to convey was given to the trustee, but it was provided that the proceeds of sales should be invested and held for the purposes of the trust. The deed contained no power of revocation. The grantor had considerable property apart from that covered by the deed of trust. Nine years afterwards the grantor executed a will by which after directing payment of debts he devised and bequeathed all the rest and residue of his estate to a brother .and a sister, and by express words revoked all former wills theretofore by him made. The settlor lived eighteen years after the execution of the will, but during all this time the grantor and the trustee continued acting under the deed of trust, and treating it as in full force. After the settlor’s death the trustee filed his account. Held, that the will did not revoke the deed of trust; (2) that the deed of trust by its terms and purpose was not revocable by any subsequent will.</p>

All his other estate, which was considerable, was given in equal shares to all his children. The widow declined to take under the will, and after some litigation a family settlement was had by which the Ardmore land passed to John F. and Ultimus Adjutor, subject to a dower interest of one third to their mother for life. Afterwards, in 1866, John F. Anderson convejmd his interest in the Ardmore tract to his brother, Dr. Joseph W. Anderson.

The will was proved, and letters thereon issued after the death of testator. About a year afterwards, on petition of this plaintiff, Mrs. Wilson, a daughter of A. J. Anderson, one of the beneficiaries of the trust, averring the liability of Joseph W. to account as trustee up until the death of Ultimus Adjutor, a citation was issued to him to file his account; he answered, by admitting his accountability, but prayed for time, and after wards did file his account as trustee up until 1890. Not long-after, Mrs. Wilson filed this bill against Joseph W., the trustee, and Corona Anderson, averring the trust deed, the death of her father and John JF. Anderson, and praying for partition. The defendants filed answer, admitting the execution of the trust deed, but averring that it was made by Ultimus Adjutor at the suggestion of A. J. Anderson, who had neglected to advise him of the importance of inserting a power of revocation, and that the grantor never had surrendered possession or power over the property to the trustee, the latter being a mere agent for his brother; then averred the will revoked the deed, and that no estate passed to plaintiff by reason of the provisions of the latter, but that the entire interest in the land passed by the will to defendants. This constituted, in substance, the issue between the parties. After full hearing- and consideration of all the evidence, the court below concluded that the deed was made with a full knowledge of its effect, and was a conveyance in the nature of a spendthrift trust, irrevocable, and not a testamentary disposition of the settlor’s property; that by the will there was no intention to revoke the prior deed, even if the latter was testamentary.</p>

This estate did not depend on a contingency, something which might or might not happen; the commencement of the period of enjoyment was uncertain, only because, while the fact of his death was certain, the date of it was not. A present equitable title vested in the beneficiaries immediately, which in the future would merge with the legal title, which latter was to be conveyed to them on the grantor’s death. Every word in the deed is an apt one, as expressing a present intention to irrevocably convey a present estate to be enjoyed in the future. There is no ambulatory quality in a deed; the postponement of enjoyment does not make the instrument ambulatory, when such postponement is in express terms, and does not result from the nature of the instrument. A will is ambulatory, revocable, subject to change, <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>because it is a will, and takes effect only at death of testator; a deed takes effect when delivered to the grantee. And the estate granted vests at once in the beneficiaries in the absence of negative words, even if the period of enjoyment be postponed. In this case, the grantor could have reserved a power of revocation ; but he did not. Considering the absence of this power, in connection with the motive which prompted the execution of the deed and the language of it, we think the court was clearly right in its conclusion that the instrument was an irrevocable deed, and intended to be such by the grantor. The case relied on by the appellant as determining that this deed should be construed a will (Frederick’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/52/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="52 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1002226" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0338-01">52 Pa. 338</a>), does not by any means hold that a deed of trust reserving to the grantor the income of the trust estate for life, and postponing until his death the enjoyment by the beneficiaries of the principal, is necessarily testamentary without regard to the manifest intent of the grantor. The decision in that case proceeds wholly upon an ascertainment of the intention of the testator from the instrument itself. After a careful analysis of the expressed purpose, in view of the surroundings, and the fact that during his lifetime the grantor had by a second formal deed revoked the first, a subsequent testamentary disposition was sustained. The deed was not made to preserve the estate of the grantor from depletion by vicious habits ; from his express language, it was made for his own convenience merely. lie was old and feeble, and, in the preamble to the deed declares that it is made to exempt him from the vexation of management and sales of his property to pay debts ; therefore, he appoints three trustees, who are to make sales of his land, apply the money received to his debts, account to him annually, and any balance remaining in their hands is to be securely invested; the grantor to be maintained therefrom during his life, and any balance remaining at his death to be divided equally among his children. The deed was not intended by the grantor to be irrevocable; that there would be any estate for the children at the grantor’s death was altogether uncertain, for that depended on the value of the estate, amount of his debts, the expenses of administration and the cost of his support during the remainder of his life.</p>

He follows this with the remark that “ a disposition of property to take effect after the grantor’s death is testamentary, and therefore revocable; ” but this was unnecessary in the disposition of the case, for it was the very subject, that is, whether it was a testamentary disposition of the property, or an irrevocable trust deed, which he had declined to discuss or consider in the former part of his opinion. A careful reading of the opinion will show, that the judgment was based on the fact that the deed was made wholly for the convenience of the grantor, in that, it relieved him from the management of his estate. Besides, there was nothing in the deed itself, or in the circumstances attending its execution, manifesting an intention that it should be irrevocable. On its peculiar facts that case stands by itself; it is not authority, as argued by appellant, for the sweeping proposition that every voluntary trust conveyance of property which reserves to the grantor a life interest, with a direction to convey to others the principal of the estate at his death, is a testamentary instrument, and therefore revocable by a subsequent will.</p>

The general rule, commencing with Reese v. Ruth, 13 S. &amp; R. 435, and adhered to through all the subsequent cases of voluntary deeds of trust intended to be irrevocable by the grantor, is the one within which falls this case. In the case last cited the grantor, because of intemperate habits, conveyed all her property to trustees, reserving to herself such <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>comfortable support therefrom during life as the trustees should judge proper; to be transferred after her decease to such parties as she might by will appoint, and in defaul b of appointment to such persons as by law were entitled thereto. Alleging failure on part of trustees to support her, she sought to annul the deed; this Court held she could not avoid the deed unless fraudulently procured; nevertheless, holding that she could recover for her support. This was followed by Greenfield’s Estate, <a href="/pa/14/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="14 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="405959" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0489-01">14 Pa. 489</a>. There an absolute deed was accompanied by a declaration of trust on part of the grantees that they held the same to apply the income as directed by the grantor during her life, and at her death to apply proceeds of the trust property to payment of certain legacies and annuities. The trustees took charge of the estate under the trust and managed it from the date of the deed, December 15, 1884, until her death, on July 9, 1845. About two years before her death she executed a will making a different disposition of her property than provided in the trust, of which will she appointed an executor, who filed bill against the trustees to have the trust declared void, among other complaints, alleging the deed and declaration of trust constituted a testamentary disposition of her estate which was revoked by the subsequent formal will. The case was heard by Gibson, C. J., at nisi prius, who, as to this averment, speaks thus: “As to its being in fact a testamentary act, and therefore revocable, the argument is scarcely worth an answer. ’ Tis true, a deed containing a posthumous disposition has been proved as a will; but here the trust was not entirely posthumous, for the legal title was vested in the trustee in order to let them manage the property in her lifetime, and to pay as much of the produce as she might desire into her hands. There was nothing testamentary in that. But according to all the proofs, the very object of resorting to a trust deed was to make disposition unalterable. And if the owner of property cannot tie up his hands in regard to it, by such an instrument, he cannot do it at all.” On appeal to this Court, these remarks were approved, and it was said there was not “ the slightest pretence for saying that the settlement must be accepted as a testamentary disposition.” This case has been followed in a large number of cases since, down to Knowlson v. Fleming, <a href="/pa/165/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="165 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="862079" data-case-paths="/pa/165/0010-01">165 Pa. 10</a>. The general rule is that if the intention of the grantor at the time he delivered <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>the deed was to part with the legal title, the trust will be enforced in favor of the beneficiaries, even though their enjoyment of the estate is postponed until the death of their benefactor. Equity, because of exceptional facts in rare cases, has revoked the trust, or held it revocable by the grantor, because plainly a testamentary instrument; but, the general rule has remained without change.</p>
    <p id="b564-5" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[251,699,1177,1475]]]'>But not only is this instrument by its terms and purpose not revocable by a subsequent will, but it is manifest the grantor never intended to revoke it. After its execution in 1869, for a period of nine years, both grantor and trustee acted under it, assuming it was a deed; then, on February 7, 1877, the grantor made a will, in which he devises and bequeaths, after payment of debts and funeral expenses, all the rest and residue of his estate to these two defendants, and declares, “ I hereby revoke all other wills at any time by me heretofore made.” Plainly, by his conduct he had not considered the first instrument a will, but a deed; but he also indicates by the absence of any mention of it, an absence of intention to revoke it. But still further, he and his trustee, after this alleged revocation, go on for eighteen years, until the grantor’s death, acting under this revoked deed, and treating it as in full force ; even after his death, when cited, the trustee files his account as if the trust continued in existence up until the grantor’s death. An intention not to revoke could not have been manifested by more significant conduct. But as further indicating that the grantor intended the deed and will as distinct and separate instruments, operating on different property, the court, on ample evidence, has found as a fact, that the grantor was possessed of both real and personal estate not covered by the deed, to tbe value of between five and seven thousand dollars ; hence, in view of all the facts and the expressions of both instruments, is it not obvious, that he intended the will not to revoke the deed which had disposed of the particular land described in it, but to operate only on that property which was still in his power.</p>
