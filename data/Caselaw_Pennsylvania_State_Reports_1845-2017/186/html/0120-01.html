Said highway is a county road, not in any borough or city.

The owners of said Rawle farm made no objection to the construction of said railway, and have made no objection to its use and occupancy by defendants constructed as above stated; but none of the owners of said Rawle farm signed said permit or gave defendants any permission to build said railway or switch.

To reach the point where said right of way diverged from said Lake road it became necessary for defendants to further extend said railway in said highway, and for that purpose the road commissioners of said township on April 19,1890, adopted a resolution as follows (omitting certain provisions not important to this case) :</p>

Prior to July, 1893, the defendants had built and were operating five switches in the Lake road between the city limits and Trinity cemetery. These switches were constructed at different times, and were of greatly different distances apart, and mostly too short to properly accommodate the traffic on this line — and I find as a fact that they were not intended by defendants as the permanent switches for this line. In the early part of 1893 the defendants began to lengthen these switches and to reconstruct and equalize the same in the Lake road, when on July 3,1893, they were stopped by an injunction from this court, issued at the suit of the road commissioners of Mill Creek township, against the above defendants, in No. 3, September term, 1893, in equity. That case was so proceeded in that on August 2, 1897, this court made therein a final decree, as follows : “And now, August 2, 1897, this case having been heretofore fully heard and argued by counsel, and thereupon, <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>upon due consideration thereof, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the injunction heretofore granted be and is hereby-modified so as to permit the defendants to relocate their said five switches on their line on the Lake road between the western limits of the city of Erie and the westérn entrance to Trinity cemetery, so as to approximately equalize the distance between them, etc. But that the entire length of no one of said switches, including the leaders, that is the whole length from the points where the tracks diverge, shall exceed 360 feet, and that as soon as any one of said switches are relocated and constructed, the present switches as far as thus supplied shall be removed from the street by defendants. This order is not intended to interfere with the present length of the Sullivan switch unless the location of the same be changed, and it is further ordered that the defendants pay the costs of this suit, and as thus modified the injunction is made permanent.”</p>

The defendants paid no consideration for any right of way in the said Lake road, but relying upon their faith of their right to occupy said highway, they expended, between the spring of 1889 and July 3, 1893, very large sums of money, aggregating about $200,000, according to the evidence given on the trial of this case. They built the railway over three miles in length; they put up poles and feed wires; bought many extra cars and also extended their plant for generating motive power, etc. The right of the defendants in this highway arises from above quoted permit of abutting land owners, from the said resolutions of the,road commissioners of Mill Creek township and from the fact that they have constructed and havé operated the railway in said highway without objection and have made expenditures as above stated.</p>

Near the eastern boundary of the said Rawle farm there <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>is a public highway extending southwardly from the Lake road and known as “ Pittsburg avenue.” At about 3 o’clock in the afternoon of August 3, 1897, the defendants took a large force of men, also rails, ties, etc., to that part of the Lake road in front of the Rawle farm, and at once began the rapid construction of a switch or turn-out extending westwardly from at or near the west line of said Pittsburg avenue along, in the south half of said Lake road, in front of said Rawle farm, for a distance of three hundred and fifty-nine feet, and continued the work upon said switch until about 11 o’clock that night. The work of building said switch was begun without notice to or knowledge of above plaintiffs, and on learning thereof the said plaintiffs at once had the bill in this case prepared, and as soon as possible presented it to the judge of this court, who was on that day and evening some fourteen miles from the courthouse (a fact which we think this court should take notice of), and on same evening complainants having presented an injunction bond in the sum of $500, which was approved, a preliminary injunction was awarded and issued, commanding the defendants to desist from constructing, maintaining or operating the said proposed switch in front of the premises of complainants, which preliminary injunction was served upon the defendants by the sheriff on same evening, to wit: August 3, 1897, at 10:50 o’clock P. M., as defendants’ officers and employees were leaving the place where they had been at work. Before said injunction was served said switch had been so far constructed that defendants had run certain cars over it, but it was not then completed, and the feed wire, which forms a necessary part of the switch in its practical operation, was put up the next day, to wit: August 4, 1897, by one of defendants’ employees, who it is shown had then no knowledge of the injunction; and the evidence also shows that some trifling work was afterwards done on the switch by driving a few spikes and shoveling a little gravel. The switch is not now entirely completed so as to be entirely safe for use with heavily laden cars. The said new switch as constructed by defendants extends its entire length in front of said Rawle farm, the west end thereof being about in front of the dwelling house on said farm, and at a point where the tracks are laid in a diagonal direction it passes at grade over the farm crossing of said farm, and the frog' of said switch <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>is laid in said crossing. The said switch is a damage to the said farm, and if permitted to remain there will constitute a permanent annoyance and inconvenience to the owners and occupants thereof, and by reason of the facts as above stated the owners of said farm sustain thereby a special injury, not common to the general public; and the location of said switch as above stated will cause a greater damage to the said farm than is or was caused by the old switch known as the “ Tracy switch.”</p>

And the defendants have also pursuant to said decree relocated and permanently constructed a switch known as the Hermann switch, the center of which is 2,214 feet west of the center of the said new “ Tracy switch.” [According to said decree the defendants are entitled to relocate and permanently construct the “ Tracy switch ” so as to approximately equalize the distance between the said “ Ball switch ” and the said “ Hermann switch,” and the said new “ Tracy switch,” as located and constructed by the defendants, does not so equalize the distance between the said “ Ball ” and “Herman switches,” and is not in conformity with said decree; but on the contrary the said new “ Tracy switch,” is 824 feet nearer to the said “ Hermann switch ” than to the “Ball switch,” according to the measurements submitted by defendants and agreed by both parties to be correct. To equalize the said distance the said new “Tracy switch” should be constructed about 412 feet east of its present location.] [1] If so constructed it would be entirely east of the said Pittsburg avenue, and would not pass over any farm crossing, and would not be in front of or interfere with any dwelling house or other building. It is necessary, to properly accommodate defendants’ business, to have a switch near the Pittsburg avenue, but it is <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>not necessary for the accommodation of said business to have a switch at the point where the defendants have built the new Tracy switch in front of said Rawle farm, but on the contrary it will better accommodate defendants’ business to have said switch built east of said Pittsburg avenue, and said new Tracy switch in the place where constructed by defendants, does unnecessary damage to private property. The said street railway in the Lake road is largely a summer line; and from May until October the traffic over this line is very large. On days when there are picnics or other attractions at the “ Plead,” the said travel over this line is especially heavy, and makes it necessary, to run cars over this line late in the night; for which reason it is especially desirable to have the switches as far as practicable from private residences, as it is a matter of common knowledge that the noise and jar of electric cars passing in and out of switches, the ringing of bells, the stopping and starting of cars, and the conversation between passengers on standing or passing cars, are all matters of annoyance to people living nearby, especially in the night-time. The traffic on this line is increasing from year to year and is much larger now than when the railway was first constructed.</p>
