A fair verdict, the deliberate opinion of the jurors upon the evidence, could scarcely in this manner be obtained. Some of the jurors would mark a larger sum than their candid judgment would sanction, in order to make up the expected deficiency of others, and so the honest jurors would be deceived, and a dishonest verdict obtained : Haight v.

Failis, 1 Cowen, 238. The case of Cowperthwaite v. Jones, 2 Dali. 55, does not affirm the naked proposition that a verdict reached by the device complained of is legal. There was no evidence of previous agreement to resort to and abide by the contingent result as a verdict, nor did it appear as in this case that this method was abused by designing jurors fixing an extravagantly high, and ridiculously low sum. The case of Coyle v. Gorman, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20326" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Phila. 326">1 Phila. 326</a>, is likewise barren of the facts existing in this case, and is not at all in point.

    <p id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.7",132,[253,717,1172,854]]]'>Leaving out of consideration the question whether the deposition of the constable can be regarded as a part of the record and therefore within our cognizance, we see no sufficient reason for interfering with the discretion of the court below in refusing to grant a new trial. ■ There is certainly no abuse of discretion in the case. The verdict was moderate in amount, and cannot for a moment be regarded as shocking to the sense of justice. It does not necessarily follow that where a jury reaches its verdict by adopting the average amount which is revealed by taking the amount fixed by each juror and dividing the aggregate sum by twelve, it is for that reason entirely invalid, and must be set aside. Unless the result is manifestly wrong and unjust the court is not bound to interfere: Cowperthwaite v. Jones, 2 Dali. 55. Although the jury remained together twenty minutes after the verdict was agreed upon, it doe's not appear that any juror dissented or expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict as rendered.</p>
