      <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>The Centre Hall Water Company was duly chartered by act of assembly passed March 17, 1858, in which were incorporated the provisions of the act of assembly passed March 11, 1857. The company was duly organized, and erected a plant in the fall of 1858, by laying wooden pipes, and was to some extent a temporary construction, but served the purpose of furnishing a supT ply of water to all who became patrons thereof, in the town of Centre Hall and vicinity, for a period of about seventeen years. The company then replaced the wooden pipe with iron pipe, the main pipe leading from the reservoir for some distance being a six inch pipe, and then it is reduced to a four inch main before it enters the limits of the town; through part of the town it is a four inch pipe, and a portion of it is two and one half inches; the branch mains are one and one half inch pipe. But for aught that appeared, the plant has not failed to furnish an ample supply of water to the extent it is used. There is no provision made for purposes of use in case of fire, there being no fire plugs. At one time the company had placed some fire plugs on the system of pipes, but they were all removed before the town was incorporated a borough. The town of Centre Hall was incorporated a borough September 18, 1885, under the provisions of the general borough law of April 3, 1851. The bill does not aver, nor does the testimony show, that the complainant had laid any pipes or extended its plant since the town was incorporated a borough; or that the borough has ever taken any action of any kind as to the use of the streets by the water company, or entered into any contract of any kind with it, relative to a supply of water for public purposes, such as fire, etc.; but so far as the facts are shown by the bill, and the evidence adduced on part of complainant to continue the injunction, the waterworks or plant is the same as when the borough was chartered in 1885.</p>

The evidence as to the election was so meager, and the averments in the bill are so indefinite and general, that we are unable to determine its legality or validity at this time. The council of the borough passed an ordinance <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>August 14, 1897, providing for the erection of waterworks to supply the borough with water and advertising for bids, and subsequently entered into contracts with It. D. Wood &amp; Co., September 10,1897, for the furnishing of supplies and material necessary for the new waterworks, and with H. P. Malone for laying pipes, etc., and constructing the works, exclusive of reservoirs. These two contracts provide for an expenditure of the sum of $6,211.22, being $1,211.22 in excess of the indebtedness authorized bj7 the vote of the people on that question, at the election held April 6,1897. The contractors have partially executed their contracts by delivering considerable of the pipes and material; but little work has been done by 11. P. Malone toward laying the pipes. The testimony shows that he just started to dig the trenches when the preliminary injunction was issued.</p>

The erection of the new works will-no doubt impair the value of the plant of the complainant. The chief contention of the complainant is that by virtue of its charter, and the erection and construction of its works, having furnished a supply of water to the inhabitants of the town of Centre Hall and vicinity, prior to the incorporation of the town as a borough and since, it has the exclusive right and authority to furnish a supply of water for said borough, and the borough has no right to erect waterworks that would compete with the works of the complainant, and thus impair their value. Is this so ? The act of 1857, under which the plaintiff was chartered, does not confer upon or grant to the plaintiff the exclusive right, privilege or authority to furnish a supply of water to the town of Centre Hall and vicinity. The grant authorizes the construction of waterworks and the entering upon streets, alleys, etc., for the purpose thereof, and sections 9 and 10 of the act provide, that they shall do as little damage to the streets as possible, and be “ subject to such regulations as the councils of said borough, town, city or district may adopt in regard to grades, or for the protection and convenience of public travel over the same.” Did the acceptance of the pro<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>visions of the constitution and the act of April 29, 1874, and its supplements and amendments, confer or grant the exclusive right ? It is true that by the acceptance thereof the company became subject thereto, and also acquired the benefits thereof ; but as the Act of June 2, 1887, P. L. 310, amending the act of April 29,1874, has been held to repeal clause 3, section 34 of the act of April 29, 1874 (see Luzerne Water Co. v. Toby . Creek Water Co., <a href="/pa/148/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="148 Pa. 568" data-case-ids="981878" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0568-01">148 Pa. 568</a>), we fail to see how the acceptance of thé provisions of the act of 1874, by the complainant, September 2, 1897, conferred upon it a grant of the exclusive right or privilege to supply water to the borough of Centre Hall.</p>

The bill does not aver that the citizens of the town of Centre Hall prior to its incorporation entered into any contractual relation with ■the Centre Hall Water Company relative to the erection of its plant, nor has anything been done by the borough in relation thereto since its incorporation. The bill does not aver that the complainant has extended its pipes since the formation of the borough in 1885; nor does the testimony offered at the hearing show that the company has done anything in relation to its plant with the consent of the borough, other than supply its patrons with water as it had been doing prior to the incorporation of the borough. Nor so far as the bill and evidence shows has the borough taken any action in relation to the complainant’s furnishing water to the inhabitants of the town. Then can it be said, because the complainant has been furnishing water to the inhabitants of the town of Centre Hall, who saw proper to patronize the company, and was so doing when the borough was incorporated, that therefore they have the exclusive right to furnish the borough with a water supply, and without more, the borough has exercised its authority under its charter to furnish a water supply, and is therefore prohibited from erecting works that may impair the value of the plaintiff’s property and'franchises ? We are not prepared to so hold. To do so, we can readily see how a municipality would be at the mercy of a water company. Where a water company has been very .extravagant in the cost of constructing its plant, or where its <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>system might be very deficient in many particulars for public uses, such as proper fire protection, and the stock of the company largely owned by one or two individuals, and the income absorbed in liberal salaries, so that no dividends be declared, then to say the borough should be compelled to purchase such a plant at the cost of construction, with interest thereon, would in our opinion work a great injustice, especially where the borough had not exercised its rights to procure a water supply by or through such company. The size of the main pipe laid by plaintiff, as shown by the evidence, and one and one half inch pipe on the branches from the main, would seem to afford in our judgment a very limited fire protection. The complainant relies upon the recent decisions in the cases of White v. Mead-ville, <a href="/pa/177/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="177 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="883741" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0643-01">177 Pa. 643</a>, Metzger v. The Borough of Beaver Falls, <a href="/pa/178/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="178 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="885518" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0001-01">178 Pa. 1</a>, and Wilson v.

Upon a careful examination of said cases, we find the decisions were based upon the fact that the said municipal corporations had exercised their respective charter rights to furnish a water supply through the agency of the several water companies. They had been parties to the procuring of the establishment of the said water companies, and by their action encouraged the organization of the companies, and on the strength of which the companies spent large sums of money in constructing their plants, laying their pipes, etc. And the municipal corporations having thus exercised their authority once under their charters to furnish a supply of water, could not exercise it again in a different manner to the hurt or injury of the companies they were parties to. But this case raises, as above stated, a very different question, and would require us to take a step farther in advance of the principles decided in the above cases than we feel the law warrants. In relation to the legality of the election held to increase the indebtedness of the borough as before stated, the allegations in the bill are very indefinite, and the evidence taken in relation thereto is insufficient to enable us to determine that it was illegal, even if we could do so in this bill. But upon the argument, that question was not seriously pressed. The chief point urged was the exclusive right of the plaintiff to furnish a water supply for the borough of Centre Hall, and that the borough had no right to furnish a supply by the erection of new works; but if it desires to furnish a supply, and <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>control the water supply, it should purchase the property of the complainant in the method provided for in the charter of the company. Having determined that question adverse to the plaintiff, we do not think the injunction should be continued.</p>

We find nothing in the case that brings it within the controlling principles of White v. Meadville, <a href="/pa/177/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="177 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="883741" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0643-01">177 Pa. 643</a>, Metzger v. Beaver Falls, <a href="/pa/178/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="178 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="885518" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0001-01">178 Pa. 1</a>, or Wilson v. Rochester, <a href="/pa/180/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="180 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="888393" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0509-01">180 Pa. 509</a>, on which plaintiff relies. In each of those cases the respective municipalities had exercised their charter right to furnish a supply of water through the agency of the several water companies with which they respectively had entered into contractual relations for that purpose. No such relation ever existed between the parties to this <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>contention, and hence defendant is not affected by the consequences that might have resulted therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[287,414,1179,247]]]'>The questions involved have been so fully and carefully considered and satisfactorily disposed of by the learned judge who presided at the hearing that further discussion is unnecessary. On his opinion the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant’s costs.</p>
