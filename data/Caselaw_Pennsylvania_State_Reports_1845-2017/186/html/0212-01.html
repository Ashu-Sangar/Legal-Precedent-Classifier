It was incorporated for the purpose of constructing a railroad from Olean, in the state of New York (or the state line near Olean), by way of Bradford, to Warren, in the state of Pennsylvania. The gauge of their road was to be three feet. It was soon afterwards constructed and operated as a narrow gauge railroad. Sometime prior to 1882, the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg Railroad was incorporated by the state of Pennsylvania. This road was soon after constructed and operated from Rochester, in the state of New York, by wa}' of Bradford, in the state of Pennsylvania, to some point or points south or southwest of Bradford, in Pennsylvania. By various transfers and charters not necessary to detail in this case, the road became the Buffalo, Rochester &amp; Pittsburg Railroad, and is operated under that name, and as such is made <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>defendant in this case. It appears from the evidence that it was deemed necessary by the directors of the Rochester &amp; Pitts-burg Company that it should cross the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren Railroad at a point near -the city of Bradford, the present point of controversy. Legal proceedings were instituted, and on June 17, A. D. 1882, a contract or agreement was entered into between the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren Railroad Company, of the one part, and the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg Railroad Company, of the other part, upon the subject of this crossing (see contract given in evidence in this case), and by this contract the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg were permitted to cross the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren Railroad at a point within eight hundred feet easterly from the station of the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren Railroad at Bradford. This contract contained other matters not essential to the matter in controversy in this case. This crossing was constructed and operated up to the present hour.</p>

The various proceedings, although not given in evidence consecutively, seemed on the trial to be in accordance with the powers of railroad corporations, as given by our many statutes upon the subject, and it seems still further unnecessary as the averments of the same, as contained in the eighth paragraph of the plaintiff’s bill, are not denied in the answer clearly and distinctly.</p>

This corporation, however, yielded certain rights and privileges to the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg corporation by the contract of June 17,1882, but this right or privilege, broadly stated, was merely to cross their track, under certain restrictions contained in the contract. All other rights, powers and privileges given them by the various statutes of the commonwealth remained unaffected by the con- <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>' tract, and all the rights, powers and privileges granted by the commonwealth charter to the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren Railroad were vested in the Western New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railroad, and when the Western New York &amp; Pennsylvania sought to widen the gauge at the point in controversy it had the full -right to do so that would have been in the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren had no merger ever taken place. It appears then, that on May 6, A. D. 1897, when the plaintiff sought to widen its gauge at the point in controversy, it had the full right to do so given by our statutes, except as affected by the contract of June 17, 1882, and the corporation defendant had such powers as are given by our statutes, limited and affected by the same contract with the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg, having succeeded to its rights.</p>

It is now sought to make the gauge four feet, eight and one half inches. The Act of April 11, 1858, <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>P. L. 8G6, enacts as follows: “Tliat any railroad heretofore chartered is hereby authorized to construct or change their gauge, or gauges, of road to such a width as the directors o£ such railroad company may deem expedient, and all laws inconsistent with this provision be and they are hereby repealed.” This act is followed by the Act of March 17, 1869, P. L. 12, which provides as follows: “ That it shall and may be lawful for any railroad, canal and slack-water navigation company, now or hereafter incorporated by or under any law of this commonwealth, to straighten, widen, deepen, enlarge and otherwise improve the whole or portions of their lines of railroads . . . . whenever, in the opinion of the board of directors of any such company, the same may be necessary for the better securing the safety of persons and property and increasing the facilities and capacity for the transportation of traffic thereon.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.5",235,[184,1332,1170,505]]]'>The second question seems to us equally clear and free from doubt. The Act of May 16, 1861, P. L. 702, provides: “ That it shall be lawful for any railroad company chartered by this commonwealth to merge its corporate rights, powers and privileges into any other railroad company so chartered, connecting therewith, so that by virtue of this act, such companies may be consolidated, and so that all the property, rights, franchises and privileges then by law vested in such company so merged may be transferred to and vested into the company unto which such merger may be made.”</p>

I cannot find room for doubt that the Western New York &amp; Pennsylvania Railway have precisely the same rights and legal powers in this controversy as the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren would have had if no merger had taken place. This brings us to the question whether the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren lost its rights to widen its gauge <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>by reason of the contract of June 17, 1882. After a careful consideration of this agreement I find nothing therein contained which can be construed, either by a reference to its language or any legitimate inference from its purpose and scope that should be given any effect beyond the one so plainly expressed by its language, to wit: The right to the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg to cross the track then operated and owned by the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren at a designated point, and under certain limitations and conditions. The directors of the Rochester &amp; Pitts-burg knew, as they were bound to know, that the directors of the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren had the right at any time to widen the gauge, either of the whole or any portion of this road. Surely, if they intended to require the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren to barter away that important right (important to them and the general public) they would have expressed it in unmistakable language.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b236-4" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[293,1125,1170,403]]]'>If the Rochester &amp; Pittsburg had been in possession of the disputed point, operating a railroad thereon, and the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren, with a subsequent charter, had approached it, asking to cross it with a three feet track, the case would have presented another and perhaps more difficult question. It woul d then have presented the question argued by the able counsel for the defendant, and to which the authorities therein cited are to some extent applicable.</p>

It was signed by the other party, passed to the custody of the proper officers of the Olean, Bradford &amp; Warren, and by them is presented on the trial. The contract was signed by one party, the party receiving the principal benefit under it, and delivered to the other party. Both parties acted under it, and it has gone fully into effect, the defendant getting and exercising the right granted to it, and holding the right up to the present hour. It hardly seems necessary to cite authorities to show that this contract is binding upon both parties, at this late date.</p>

      <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>An ingenious argument is presented to us to demonstrate that since the passage of the act of 1875, regulating the amount of stock to be subscribed and paid in, as a condition precedent to obtaining a charter for a narrow gauge road, requiring a less amount than is required for a standard gauge; a narrow gauge cannot therefore be widened, for the reason that it might result in the existence of standard gauges with the limited amount of stock required for a narrow gauge. This state of things might, of course, occur, but how can the public be injured thereby; the cost of widening would have to be borne by the stockholders of the widened road, and as the statute limits the number of bonds to be issued by a railroad corporation, the amount of stock actually paid in would be unaffected; nobody could be affected by the transaction but the corporation itself.</p>
