The executors under a power in the will sold and conveyed the land of the testator subject to the payment of interest on the daughter’s share during her life, and the payment of the principal of such sum to the persons entitled to it after her death. The deed was executed in May, 1856, but not acknowledged until November of the same year. On the day of the acknowledgment the grantee conveyed the real estate to the wife of one of the executors who was a son of the testator and the devisee of a third of the estate. No mention was made in this deed of the charge in favor of the daughter. On the same day the other son, who was also an executor and a devisee of another one third of testator’s estate, quitclaimed his interest to the wife of the first executor, who, to secure payment therefor, executed, with her husband, a mortgage dated as of the date of the deed in which the charge was created in favor of the daughter, but acknowledged on the day in November when the other papers were executed and acknowledged. The value of the property at the time these papers were executed was sufficient to cover both the charge and mortgage. Forty years afterwards when the land was sold it did not bring sufficient to pay both the charge and the mortgage. <em>Held, </em>that, in the distribution, the charge on the land was entitled to priority over the mortgage.</p>

The charge in the deed repres’ented one third of this balance, and was intended to protect Jane Donagan’s interest in it, together with the interests of the persons entitled to receive it at her death. It was a valid charge and adequate for the accomplishment of the purpose for which it was inserted. That it was not included or referred to in the deed from Selfridge to Christiana Donagan, or in any other conveyance of the real estate subject to it is an unimportant circumstance. The Selfridge deed, having been duly recorded, was notice to subsequent purchasers of the existence and nature of the charge. The title to the real estate which Selfridge acquired by his deed from the executors was subject to this charge, and it was not within his power to divest or impair it by his deed to Christiana Donagan, or by a conveyance to any other person. Christiana Donagan, by his deed to her, acquired the title he received by his deed from the executors and she could not by sale or mortgage. extinguish or qualify the charge to which it was subject. The validity of the charge was not questioned by Christiana Donagan 91' her mortgagee, and neither of them claimed at any time that the mortgage preceded it or was on a parity with it. The claim of precedence now made by the executrix of the assignee of the mortgage has nothing whatever to rest upon, nor is there any substantial ground on which to base the claim that the mortgage is on a parity with it. There is nothing in the deed to Selfridge or in the mortgage to Mary Donagan which supports or gives color to either of these claims, and the fact that the deed was recorded more than five years before the mortgage was is a circumstance which may reasonably be regarded as inconsistent with them. The claim of the appellant that, if the mortgage is not on a parity with the charge, it must be assumed that the executors were remiss in the performance of a duty they owed to the mortgagee, is untenable. They were trustees of the fund charged upon the real estate in and by their deed to Selfridge, and it was their duty to preserve it for the benefit of their sister and the persons entitled to it at her decease. There was uncertainty respecting the duration of the trust and the final disposition of the fund. In view of tins uncertainty and of the fact that the sums secured on the real estate by the deed and the mortgage, represented but two thirds of the |8,000 which the claimants under the will estimated as <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>the net value of their interests in it, there is no reasonable ground for accusing the executors of negligence or dishonesty in the transaction by which priority ivas given to their sister’s claim, and to the interest of others in it, in the event of her remaining in the monastery during her life. Besides, one of the executors was the husband of the mortgagee, and the other was the husband of the purchaser from Selfridge of the real estate bound by the mortgage. There is no reason to doubt that all the parties in interest intended, by the charge in the deed, to give priority to the trust fund, and by the mortgage, to adequately protect the sum it was given to secure. Certainly the mortgage afforded such protection if the value of the real estate covered by it was not grossly overestimated by the parties. It is not shown by evidence or claimed by any person that it was so estimated, and a sheriff’s sale of it in August, 1894, cannot be justly considered as furnishing a fair measure of its value. It was sold to the executrix of Hannah Lentz, who is the claimant of the fund in court, for less than half the valuation of it in 1856. There is nothing aside from this circumstance to indicate that it is worth less now than it was appraised at, then. If it be assumed that there has been a depreciation of twenty per cent in the value of it since 1856, although there is no visible warrant for such an assumption, it was still sufficient to satisfy all the incumbrances upon it at the time of the sheriff’s sale. These matters are referred to, not as affecting the appellant’s legal right, but as tending to show that the assignee of the mortgage has sustained no loss by reason of the priority conceded to the charge in the deed.</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[212,1761,1167,287]]]'>As the fund in court, after deducting therefrom the prothonotary’s costs and the referee’s fee, is not sufficient to pay the sum secured by the charge in the deed, neither the appellant nor the terre-tenant is entitled to any part of the same. This is the conclusion reached by the learned referee and in which we concur.</p>
