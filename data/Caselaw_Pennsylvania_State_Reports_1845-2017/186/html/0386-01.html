The profits were to be divided between the parties. No time was set for the termination of the contract. Defendant testified that subsequently lie stated to plaintiff that he would not continue the agreement unless he was allowed twenty-five per cent for shop expenses. Defendant’s testimony on this point was supported by that of another witness, and it appeared also that he could not continue to manufacture the article profitably unless some allowance was made to him for shop expenses, and that without such allowance, plaintiff’s profits would have been unreasonably large. Plaintiff denied by his own testimony that any such statement had been made by defendant, but he admitted that for two years he had settled on the basis contended for by defendant. He was contradicted by a number of witnesses upon material matters. The master found in favor of the plaintiff. The court below overruled the master’s finding of fact. <em>Held, </em>that the decree of the court should be sustained.</p>

In doing ■this they found it necessary to use a patent fertilizing attachment, the patent for which was owned by the Spangler Manufacturing Company; and the right to use this device was obtained, upon an agreement for the payment of a royalty, for the use of the said patent. About a year was consumed in this work of getting up a drill. The defendant expended the sum of about $2,000 in this and the plaintiff contributed his services. A patent was not obtained, more probably for the reason that the drill built, approved and adopted was not a patentable drill; and the parties entered upon the manufacture and sale of drills. The plaintiff had charge of the books pertaining to the drill business during the continuance of the business except the book containing chaz-ges for drills sold which charges wei-e kept in the books of the defendant in his general manufacturing business. These books were, during all the time of the continuance of the business between plaintiff and defendant, opezi to the.inspection and examination of the plaintiff.</p>

At the end of the second year a settleznent was made of the business, izx which the plaintiff fell izz debt to the defendazzt izi the sum of $50.00, for which sum the defendaxxt gave the plaixztiff credit on the books. The business of 1881 and 1882 was neither extensive zzor profitable. As to the cireuxnstazzees and teznas of said settlemexit the evidence is conflicting, as well as the terms upon which the business was cozztizzued to the fall of 1886. The defezxdant cozztends that said settlement was made upon the basis of adding to the naked cost of the drills manufactured, said cost beizzg the actual cost of tbe material used and the cost of labor in their manufacture, twenty-five per cent for shop expenses, enumex-ated by hizzz, azzd that at the time of said settleznezzt he inforzzied the plaixxtiff that urxless this added shbp expenses of twenty-five per cezzt of the zzaked cost of the drills was conceded by the plaintiff, the manufacture of thé drills could zzot cozztinue and that the plaintiff agreed, expressing the wish that the cost zzziglzt be reduced to $50.00 per drill, <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>not counting tlie Spangler royalty, or costs of selling. Tlie plaintiff admitted in liis testimony tliat lie settled for the first two years on tlie basis contended for by the defendant, under protest, but denied that at said settlement he was informed by the defendant that tlie business could not continue without the addition of the twenty-five per cent shop expenses, to the naked cost of the drills ; and that lie agreed to the same. He admitted that he told defendant “ he thought the drill could be built for fifty dollars, including Spangler’s royalty. He said he would build them at that if he could.” Upon this question as to how the shop cost of tlie drills should be estimated, fixed or determined, and what that cost actually was, under the agreement of the parties, the decision of this case largely depends. A great mass of testimony was heard by the learned master, the taking of which testimony was had, from time to time, between December 19,1887, and December 31,1894. After argument, the master gave notice to the counsel of his intention to file his report, when exceptions were filed. In this report lie finds the total amount received by defendant for drills in the years 1883, 1884, 1885 and 1886 was $126,040.42 and after allowing a credit for cost of drills (as found by him) and payment on account, lie finds a balance due the plaintiff including interest, of $16,201.07. Exceptions were filed by the defendant and an amended report was made and filed reducing the interest $5,065.33, leaving a balance due plaintiff of $11,135.74. This amended report was filed; the plaintiff excepted to this reduction in the interest.</p>

Jones, the plaintiff, alone, while A. B. Farquhar and F. James Evans unequivocally contradicted him. Besides the circumstances bear out the testimony on the part of defendant, viz: the settlement in 1883, for the preceding years, on the basis claimed by defendant for ascertaining cost of manufacture of drills, by adding twentj^-five per cent for shop expenses; the selling of a drill to Hoff at $55.00 by the parties; Mr. Jones saying that <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>was about cost; the continuance by the defendant of the business with the plaintiff when it is manifest, from the facts proved, that it required $50.00 to $55.00 for the materials, work and shop expenses, such as wear and tear of machinery, coal, oil, waste, superintendence, foremen and draymen, etc., to manufacture a drill for the <em>market; </em>all show the probability of the defendant’s demand, and refusal to continue the manufacture of the drills unless his basis of estimating the cost of manufacture was accepted.</p>

Jones’s admissions that he told Mr. Farquhar at the time of the 1883 settlement, that he “ thought the drill could be built for $50.00, including Spangler’s royalty ” corroborates the testimony on the part of the defendant. It is not probable nor credible that the defendant, in view of the settlement of 1883, at $55.00 per drill, with a full knowledge of the naked cost, or cost of labor and material, and the certainty that shop expenses had to be added and were as much expenses of manufacture of the drill as the materials for the labor on the same, and that all amounted to about $55.00, including the royalty, would continue in the business of making the drills at naked cost, plus the $2.50 or about that, royalty. In addition to the weight of the testimony of the witnesses testifying on this branch of the case, the facts and circumstances proved in the case, the partial admission of the defendant as to the cost of the drill, above referred to, and the continuance by the defendant in the drill business, all tend to prove that the plaintiff was informed by defendant of the demand of twenty-five per cent for shop expenses, as an item of expense in the manufacture of the drill, and the agreement thereto, by the plaintiff. What was the defendant to gain by the further continued manufacture of these drills at naked cost, — the cost of work and materials. There was not any patent on the drill, and the defendant, could therefore, have continued the manufacture of the drills on his own account. The cost of manufacture was first to be deducted, also the expenses of sale and then a division of the profits. What was the defendant getting for his relinquishing shop expenses ? That shop expenses were part of the cost of manufacture is conceded bjr the plaintiff. How were the shop expenses to be ascertained and fixed except by a percentage, shown in the manufacture ?

Where is there any evidence that these and other items of shop expenses, which Mr. Jones says he may have omitted, were included in the amounts set down in the “ naked cost ” column of estimate marked 3; and who testifies or where is there any proof that the said estimate is not just <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>what it shows' on its face, viz: that column one is the “ drill or shop cost” and column two the “naked cost?” We have not found any such proof in the great mass of testimony which cumbers the case. The error in this finding is so manifest that we are at loss to see how the learned master could have fallen into it. So in relation to his finding that the “naked cost” column, only, of estimate three, was accepted by the plaintiff, and that the other column, marked drill cost, was not accepted by him. The plaintiff himself does not even so testify. Pie says he accepted defendant’s estimate. What estimate ? Why, clearly the whole of estimate three, including the column showing the “drill cost.” That is the only part of the estimate showing shop expenses.</p>

Maigne convincingly shows that the “naked costs” column of estimate “ 3,” shows the cost only of labor and material. This testimony is full and clear as to items and particulars, and is overwhelming. It establishes the cost of labor and material as contained in the second column of the estimate. The learned master’s refusal to consider this testimony, and his finding in the face of it, that in this “naked cost” column was included all cost of manufacture “except the cost of the plant and interest on the investment ” is to us inexplicable. The “ drill costs ” in the first column of the estimate “ 3 ” is less than $50.00, including Spangler’s royalty, for which the plaintiff testified that he told defendant at the settlement in 1883 he thought the drill ought to be built.

Waltman fixes the number of drills carried over each year, at from thirty-five to fifty, and a large amount of drill materials. This is not contradicted. The master should have found the number of drills carried over each year, <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>at, at least the smaller number testified to, and allowed the defendant credit for the same in the account stated. The plaintiff admitted that this is a part of the cost of the manufacturing of the drills, and the defendant is clearly entitled to a credit of $5.00, the smallest sum mentioned in the evidence, for the drills carried over, estimated at thirty-five each year, the smaller number mentioned by the witness.</p>

The plaintiff’s income was, per year on that basis, $5,205.60, without the investment of a single dollar as capital by himself, or furnishing any patent, in connection with the drill. His drill points were not used to any appreciable extent, having been found too expensive. His only contribution to the business was his personal services. The largeness of the profits as found by the learned master is itself enough to show the fallacy of his conclusions. Had such profits been realized defendant’s extensive shops would have been devoted, entirely, to the drill business, and instead of retaining the services of the plaintiff, without any necessity, the defendant would doubtless have dissolved his connection with the plaintiff and assumed the entire business. This was in his power, there being no time limited for the continuance of the alleged partnership. The testimony as to the receipt of average profits of five per cent by the defendant in his other business of a similar character, renders it certain that thirty-three per cent could not have been realized in this drill business.</p>

The principle that “in the settlement of partnership accounts the allowance or refusal of interest depends upon the circumstances of each particular case; any unyielding rule would work injustice in some case,” is however clearly recognized and enunciated in these cases, as well as in the late case of Magilton v.

It was an association for the single purpose of manufacturing and selling grain drills, a joint undertaking, the defendant to furnish the capital and manufacture the drills, the plaintiff to be in immediate charge of the drill business and assist in the sale of the drills and keep certain of the books required to be kept. They were to share equally the net profits, and no losses are shown by the proof. There was no partnership name. The drill circulars were issued in the name of A. B. Farquhar, and the testimonials therein, addressed to him. The notes were made payable to A. B. Farquhar and bore interest. The business was of such a character and in such condition, that at the time of the bringing of this suit, the <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>defendant could have promptly accounted to the plaintiff. This the defendant did not do, nor did he account, at any time, during the pendency of the suit. The notes he held, bore interest, and it did not matter whether they had all been collected at the time he was required to account or not. He could have said so much of the assets, in his hands, consisted of promissory notes bearing interest, and tendered the plaintiff one half of said notes, as part of his share of the profits. For the reason that he did not account when required to do so; that he drew interest on the notes until paid, and had the use, in his business, of the balance remaining in his hands — making interest on said balance— he must be required to pay interest to the plaintiff for the amount found to be due the plaintiff. If even the parties were partners, which is most questionable, the case comes within the rulings of the exceptional cases, when interest may be allowed. Here there were no intricate matters to settle, no debts to be paid, no accounts to close, or losses to adjust, by the defendant, before the profits could be ascertained. The reasons for nonliability for interest entirely fail. The partnership (if any) had ended, and the account could readily have been stated, and the rights of the parties ascertained; as in Magilton v. Stevenson, cited supra, where interest was allowed. “If a defendant offers to pay as much as in justice he ought, and the plaintiff refuses to receive it, and brings an action, it would be wrong that the defendant should pay full interest after being driven to the expense of defending himself against an unjust suit. But in the present case the fairlt does not seem to be altogether on either side. The plaintiff insisted on too much, and the defendant offered too little. There was necessity, therefore, for a suit. That being the case, and there being no reason to suppose that the defendant has not made use of the money, we think he should be chargeable with interest: ” Delaware Insurance Company v. Delaunie, <a href="/binn/3/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Binn. 295" data-case-ids="1791129" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0295-01">3 Binn. 295</a>.
