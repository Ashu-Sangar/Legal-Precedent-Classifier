Bucher, 182 Pa. 604.

Before Brubaker, J.\nThe facts are substantially the same as those which appeared in the previous report of the case in 182 Pa. 604.\nThe court charged in part as follows :\n[This presumption is prima facie evidence of payment; it is a strong presumption. The lapse of time can be explained bjr the plaintiff by sufficient evidence on his part to rebut the presumption. The presumption may be rebutted by showing direct payments, or by admissions, or statements or declarations by the defendant inconsistent with the presumption of payment. As I have said, the proof that must be furnished by the plaintiff must be satisfactory and convincing proof to you that the mortgage was not paid before he will be able to recover in this case.] [10]\n[Now, gentlemen, that is the main testimony that I have submitted to you to ascertain the fact whether this mortgage has been paid or not paid. First, I say to you, the law presumes it is paid, and the plaintiff is bound to furnish you convincing proof, satisfying proof, to rebut this presumption before he can recover a verdict.] [11]\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.\nErrors assigned among others were (10, 11) above instructions, quoting them.\nWm. D. Weaver and Benj. E. Davis, for appellant.\nA. J.
