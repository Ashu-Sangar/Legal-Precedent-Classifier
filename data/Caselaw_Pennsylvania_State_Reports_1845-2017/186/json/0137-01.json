In such a case the orphans\u2019 court has exclusive jurisdiction, not only to distribute the property, but also to restrain by injunction any action by either of the litigants, which would cause irreparable damage to the other.\nArgued Feb. 2, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 411, Jan T., 1897, by plaintiff, from decree of C.

The will of Charles Tyson with its codicils reads as follows:\n\u201c Be it remembered that I Charles Tyson of Limerick Township, Montgomery County and State of Pennsylvania, being of sound disposing mind, memory and understanding, knowing the uncertainty of this Life and to the end that T may be the better prepared to Leave this World, do theirfore make, publish and declare this to be my Last will and testament in manner and form as follows to-wit:\n\u201c First I order and direct that all my just debts of whatsoever nature and my funeral expenses be fully paid and satisfied as soon as conveniently can be after my decease and after payment of my just debts and expenses as aforesaid I order and direct as follows :\n\u201c In case I should depart this Life before my wife Mary I give and bequeath unto her the whole of my estate Real and Personal and to have the same and use it at pleasure for her sole use as fully largely and amply to all intents and purposes as I myself could or might have done in my Lifetime with full power at any time to sell or dispose of any part or the whole of the same and also power and authority to collect all outstanding monies of whatsoever nature or kind and to be exclusively for her use and disposal and also for the selling of any personal property or transfering of any stock of whatsoever nature or kind, and to do all and whatsoever may be necessary to be done in the selling and transfering of any stock or personal property and to vest full title thereof in the purchaser or purchasers.\n\u201c If my wife Mary should think at any time that it would be to her advantage to sell any part or the whole of my Real estate during her nateural Lifetime, she can do so, either at public or private sale and make and execute good and lawful deed or deeds ol conveyance to the purchaser or purchasers thereof, to be as valued good and as effectual in Law as if I had made and executed the same in my Lifetime and to vest full title in the purchaser or purchasers thereof and my wife Mary shall have the proceeds of such sale at her own disposuel.\n\u201c Their shall be no desposal made of my estate or any part thereof by my executors hereinafter named during the Lifetime of my wife Mary.

Hunsicker, deceased, share or bequest named in my will during her natural lifetime and pay her annually the interest thereof, and at the time of her decease the said share and any interest due thereon shall be paid and revert back to said Susanna\u2019s brothers and sisters or their legal representatives as in will directed, but not go and descend to said Susanna\u2019s heirs.\n\u201c In witness whereof I, Charles Tyson, testator, have hereunto set my hand and seal to this codicil as and for part of my last will and testament the twelfth day of November, A. D., one thousand eight hundred and seventy-seven (1877.)\n\u201cTHIRD CODICIL.\n\u201c I, Charles Tyson, testator, within named, do make and publish the following codicil to be added to and be part of my last will and testament as follows, to wit: Whereas in my last will and testament bearing date November the sixteenth, A. D., 1872, I had made and appointed my brother-in-law, Henry II. Kitten house, and my brother, Jacob Tyson, executors of my estate. And whereas said Henry K. Rittenhouse is now deceased, I do, therefore appoint and depute in his stead my brother-in-law, Abraham Hunsicker, Jr., together with said Jacob Tyson to be the executors of this, my last will and testament, with full power and authority to execute the same according to the tenure thereof.\n\u201c In witness whereof, I, Charles Tyson, the testator, hereunto set my hand and seal to this codicil as and for part of my last will and testament the fourth day of November, A. D., 1879.\u201d\n2. In 1886 the executors of Charles Tyson assigned, transferred and set over unto Mary Tyson all the personal estate of the testator, consisting of five Perkiomen Railroad bonds, thirty-four shares of Spring City Bank stock, farming implements and cash, aggregating in all as appraised $5,982.11. At the same time the widow gave a receipt to the executors setting forth that she was to have, to hold and enjoy the property, according to the terms and provisions of the will.\n3. In 1887 the widow sold one of the tracts of real estate to Harrison Bean and received as a consideration $1,015.\n4. In March, 1897, she sold the remaining real estate to her \u25a0brother James Rittenhouse, receiving as a consideration $2,500 cash, and mortgages on the premises sold, aggregating $11,500. In April, 1897, the properties were reconveyed by the brother to the widow, Mary Tyson. The consideration named was the same as that stated in the deeds to the brother. The mortgages remain unsatisfied of record.\n5. At the time of Mary Tyson\u2019s death the railroad bonds and shares of bank stock still stood in her name.\n6. The defendants demur to this bill and assign as causes for \u25a0 their demurrer, that the plaintiff has no interest in the matters alleged, that the defendants are not in any way liable to the plaintiff, that the equity court has no jurisdiction of the bill.\nLEGAL CONCLUSION.\nWe are of opinion that the orphans\u2019 court has exclusive jurisdiction of the matter alleged in the bill. The whole controversy arises over the interpretation of the will of Charles Tyson. The estate of the testator is before the orphans\u2019 court, the surviving executor is endeavoring to administer it, and the construction of the will is specially entrusted to the orphans\u2019 court. The rival claimants to the property in dispute are also in the orphans\u2019 court. The court has control over the executors of Mary Tyson as well as over the surviving executor of Charles Tyson. Why seek the aid of another court when the parties and subject-matter are peculiarly within the control of the orphans\u2019 court ? Whether these bonds, stocks and lands belong to the estate of Charles Tyson can be determined by the orphans\u2019 court. The orphans\u2019 court alone has the authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent\u2019s property and order its distribution among those entitled to it: Phillips, Administrator, v. Railroad-Co., 107 Pa. 465. This property belongs to the husband\u2019s estate or to the widow\u2019s estate and both estates are in process of settlement in the orphans\u2019 court and all matters arising in the distribution must come under the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court.\nIt is contended that the equity court should intervene to restrain the executors of Mary Tyson from diverting the property to the irreparable loss of the estate of Charles Tyson. But we must not forget that the orphans\u2019 court has power to prevent, by order in the nature of writs of injunction, acts contrary to law or equity, prejudicial to property over which it has jurisdiction: Appeal of Misldmins, 114 Pa. 530. Again, \u201c The authority of the orphans\u2019 court is plenary, embracing as it does all the powers of a court of chancery, .... and if need be, can enforce its mandates by proceedings for contempt: \u201d Lafferty v. Corcoran, 180 Pa. 314. After a careful consideration of the prayer of the bill, we find that the sole question is one of settlement or administration in the orphans\u2019 court. It is now the settled law, that the orphans\u2019 court has exclusive jurisdiction over all things pertaining to the settlement and distribution of estates: Linsonbigler v. G-ourley, 56 Pa. 166. No matter of settlement or touching the administration of an estate can be drawn within the power of the common pleas: Campbell\u2019s Appeal, 80 Pa. 298. The orphans\u2019 court, in a proceeding to distribute an estate among legatees, next of kin and heirs, has ample power to inquire into and determine all questions standing directly in the way of a distribution to these parties: Dundas\u2019s Estate, 73 Pa. 480. The executors of Mary Tyson are under the control of the orphans\u2019 court. If they interfere prejudicially with the property belonging to the estate of Charles Tyson they may be restrained, and the court has power to enforce its mandates. There are no facts in dispute as the case now presents itself; the sole inquiry is, what estate did Mrs. Tyson take under her husband\u2019s will ? When the orphans\u2019 court is called upon to decide this 'inquiry, its final decree must end all controversy. If we send this case into the equity court, we do so for the sole purpose of having that court interpret the will of Charles Tyson. The orphans\u2019 court alone must attend to this matter. Her grasp is already laid upon the will, and there is no authority that can wrest it from her hands.\nAnd now, November 1, 1897, the demurrer to jurisdiction is sustained and the bill is dismissed at the cost of the plaintiff.\nError assigned was in sustaining the demurrer.\nN. II. Lamiere, with him Wm. F. Lannehower, for appellant.\n\u2022 \u2014 The orphans\u2019 court has not such equity jurisdiction as to meet the requirements of this bill: Willard\u2019s App., 65 Pa. 267; Ake\u2019s App., 74 Pa. 119.\nThere is no attempt made in this proceeding to settle and distribute either estate. The object for which the remedy is sought is to recover the fraudulently converted property.\nEquity will follow a fund through any number of transmutations, and preserve it for the owner so long as it can be identified ; no matter in whose name the legal title stands: Farmers & Mechanics\u2019 Nat. Bank v. King, 57 Pa. 202; Thompson\u2019s App., 22 Pa. 16; Delbert\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 473; Abbott v. Reeves, 49 Pa. 494; Campbell\u2019s App., 80 Pa. 298; Marschall\u2019s Est., 6 Dist. Rep. 386; Trust Co. v. Gazzam, 161 Pa. 536; Beale v. Kline, 183 Pa. 149.\nQuestions of disputed title are not cognizable in the orphans\u2019 court: Curran\u2019s Est., 28 W. N. C. 96; Willard\u2019s App., 65 Pa. 265; Odd Fellows S. Bank\u2019s App., 123 Pa. 356; Fox\u2019s App., 11 W. N. C. 236.\nThe cases cited in the lower court\u2019s opinion concern distribution principally, and in none of them was there any dispute over the property to be distributed, as belonging to the estate whose distribution was involved.\nMontgomery Evans, with him Louis M. Ohilds, for appellees.\n\u2014The orphans\u2019 court has exclusive jurisdiction: Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784; Weimer v. Karch, 153 Pa. 385; Hammett\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 392; Phillips v. R.
