Cross, and my son, Walter L. Cross, and the survivors of them and their heirs in fee, but should they both die without lawful issue, then the same shall go to my sons, Jesse and Wilbur, and their heirs.\u201d Walter L. Cross died unmarried and without issue prior to testatrix, but Marietta R. Cross survived the testatrix and the life tenant and aliened the property. In an action by Jesse and Wilbur against the grantee of Marietta R. Cross, brought after the death of Marietta, the court held that Marietta had received an estate-tail which became a fee simple estate under the Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, and directed a verdict for defendant. Held, no error.\nArgued Oct. 1, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 159, Oct. T., 1917, by plaintiffs, from judgment of C. P. Greene Co., Dec. T., 1915, No. 83, on verdict for defendant, in case of Jesse R. Cross and Wilbur F. Cross v. A. J. Dye.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Stewart, Frazer and Waleino, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nEjectment for lands in Greene County. Before Ray, P.

Cross and my son Walter L. Cross and the survivor of them and their heirs in fee, but should they both die without lawful issue then the same shall go to my sons, Jesse and Wilbur and their heirs.\n\u201cIt is my will that if my daughter, Marietta R. Cross should marry that the estate I have above devised to her in the said house and lot shall be subject to her separate use and control and shall not become liable in any manner for the debts of her husband, being unwilling that my bounty to her shall be dissipated or aliened by strangers or other debtors than her own.\u201d\nWalter L. Cross died November 4, 1893, unmarried and without issue. The decedent died November 28, 1894. Marietta R. Cross survived her brother, Walter L. Cross, and her father, A. G.
