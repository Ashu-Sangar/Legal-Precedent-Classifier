By codicil testatrix revoked the bequest to one of the three persons named. E'eld, such revocation did not affect the gift in remainder to the children of such legatee, but created an intestacy as. to the income which such legatee would have received for life had the bequest not been revoked.\nSubmitted May 15, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 230, Jan. T., 1916, by Mary J. MacTague and Ella B. McManemy, from decree of O. C. Philadelphia Co., April T., 1915, No. 167,' dismissing exceptions to adjudication of trustees\u2019 account in Estate of Margaret A. May, Deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Stewart, Moschzisker and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nThe facts appear from the following from the opinion of Lamorelle, J.:\nThe testatrix bequeathed her residuary personal estate in trust to pay the net income to three persons named, share and share alike, for the term of their respective lives, and upon the death of any of them she directed that the principal represented by the share of income which any person so dying had been receiving should be paid to her child or children, with remainder over in default. By her codicil the testatrix revoked the bequest mentioned in her will to Mary E. Molliken, one of the three, and in all other respects confirmed her will.. It is now argued, that as this codicil revoked Mrs. Mulliken\u2019s right to participate in the entire income of the whole estate the other two cestui que trust life tenants should receive the entire income, share and share alike. The obvious meaning of the testatrix was to give to each of the three beneficiaries one-third of the income of the estate. That is clear from her language, \u201csha,re and share alike during the term of their respective lives,\u201d The gift to three persons by name \u201cshare and share alike\u201d and the limitation of the gift to their \u201crespective lives\u201d indicate clearly a, severance. of their beneficial interests, and the gift in remainder to their children can only mean a gift of one-third of the principal. The codicil revoked the life estate given to Mrs. Mulliken as to one-third, but did not affect the gift in remainder to her children.\nThe court in banc dismissed the .exceptions to the. adjudication. Exceptants appealed.\n\u2022 Error assigned was in dismissing the exceptions to the adjudication.\nA. Howard Ritter and William W. Porter submitted paper book for appellants.\nNo paper book was submitted for appellee.\nJune 30, 1917:"
