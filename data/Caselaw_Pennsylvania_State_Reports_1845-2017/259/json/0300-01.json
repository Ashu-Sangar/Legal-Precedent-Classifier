    "head_matter": "Van v. Richmond et al., Appellants.\nMaster and servant \u2014 Bricklayer\u2014Fall of brick arch on workman \u2014Assumption of risk \u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Conflicting evidence \u2014 Preponderance of evidence with defendant \u2014 Case for jury.\n1. The credibility of oral testimony is for the jury.\n2. Where the testimony offered by the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case by showing the existence of facts from which an inference of negligence arises, the case is necessarily for the jury, notwithstanding that the great preponderance of the testimony is with the defendant. An inference of negligence having once arisen remains until overcome by countervailing proof, and whether it is so overcome is a question.for the jury.\n3. In an action against building contractors to recover for injuries sustained by the falling of a brick arch on a workman, where it appeared that during the construction of the building plaintiff was assigned by the defendants to build such arch on a supporting wooden form erected by defendants\u2019 carpenters, that after the completion of the arch it fell on the plaintiff causing the injuries complained of, and the evidence was conflicting as to how the fall of the arch was occasioned, plaintiff\u2019s version being that the form had been removed at the direction of. defendants\u2019 foreman, that plaintiff had complained to him of its removal but that the foreman had assured him that it was safe, that relying upon the foreman\u2019s forty years\u2019 experience plaintiff continued at his work and three quarters of an hour later the arch fell, while defendants\u2019 version was that the form had not been removed but that the arch fell by reason of plaintiff\u2019s placing his body or leg over it, causing it to buckle, and that plaintiff had admitted thereafter that the occurrence was his own fault, the court did not err in refusing to charge that as a matter of law plaintiff had assumed the risk.\n4. In such ease the court did not err in refusing to charge that the duty rested on the plaintiff to establish by the weight of evidence that there was no act or omission on his part, as an experienced bricklayer, amounting to want of ordinary care, which concurred with the alleged negligence of the defendants in causing the injury. \u201d\nArgued Oct. 18, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 79, Oct. T., 1917, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1916, No. 1848, upon verdict for plaintiff in case of J. Wesley Van v. Andrew Richmond and John L. Richmond, Copartners, trading and doing business as A. Richmond & Son, with notice to W. J. Morrison, Administrators of Andrew Richmond, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries.\nThe facts appear from the following opinion by Brown, J., sur defendants\u2019 motions for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto:\nPlaintiff, a. bricklayer employed by defendants in building a residence, brought this action to recover damages for personal injuries received on the 7th of August, 1915 \u2014 injuries to his arm, back, head and sight and hearing, causing pain and suffering and loss of earnings and impaired power to work and to earn.\nPlaintiff\u2019s story, as told by himself and witnesses, was: that on August 6, 1915, carpenters \u2014 at direction of defendants\u2019 foreman \u2014 having put in place a supporting-wooden form, he built thereon a brick arch, using mortar furnished by defendants. The brick arch was completed that day \u2014 leaving for the next day the laying of brick on the sides next the arch. When plaintiff came to work on the morning- of the 7th, discovering the supporting wooden form had been taken out, at the direction of defendants\u2019 foreman, he complained to the foreman about the question of safety; and the foreman told him it was safe \u2014 to go ahead with the work; and resting- upon the superior knowledge of the foreman of forty years\u2019 experience he went on Avith the brick work \u2014 at the sides next the arch; and three-quarters of an hour later the arch buckled and fell, striking and carrying him, and the platform on which he was, down some nine or ten feet.\nTouching this question of safety \u2014 at the time plaintiff went to work the morning of June 7th \u2014 we quote a portion of his testimony:\nQ. \u2014 Before you went to work did you say anything to Mr. Briggs (foreman) about the safety of this thing?\nA. \u2014 I did.\nQ. \u2014 What did you say to him?\nA. \u2014 I told him it was not safe, and he promised to get a prop and put it up there to save it from falling.\nQ. \u2014 Save what from falling?\nA. \u2014 The arch from buckling. It didn\u2019t look safe to me, and I mentioned it to him.\nQ. \u2014 Did he think it was safe?\nA. \u2014 Yes, sir; he told me it was safe and I relied on his word for it to be safe.\nQ. \u2014 Then did he tell you to go to Avork?\nA. \u2014 Yes, sir.\nQ. \u2014 Instructed you to go to work did he?\nA. \u2014 Yes, sir.\nQ. \u2014 And told you it Avas safe?\nA. \u2014 Yes, sir.\nQ. \u2014 Was there anything about it that looked as though the thing would fall immediately?\nA. \u2014 Well, it didn\u2019t look just right.\nQ. \u2014 It wasn\u2019t cracked, was it?\nA. \u2014 No, sir.\nQ. \u2014 And didn\u2019t look as though it Avas going to fall that instant?\nA. \u2014 No, sir.\nQ. \u2014 Looked as though it might hold itself for awhile?\nA. \u2014 Yes, sir.\nQ. \u2014 How long did it hold itself?\nA. \u2014 About three-quarters of an hour.\nQ. \u2014 After you started to work?\nA: \u2014 Yes, sir.\nQ. \u2014 What caused that thing to break?\nA. \u2014 It buckled.\nIt will be observed by this testimony that plaintiff\u2014 awaiting fulfillment of the foreman\u2019s promise to put up props, to support the arch \u2014 was not working under nor in front of the arch, but at the side, laying and building up the brick work; and therefore not exposing himself under nor in front of the arch.\nDefendant\u2019s story, as told by their witnesses, was: that the supporting wooden arch had not been taken out by the carpenters, nor directed to be taken out, as alleged by plaintiff; that plaintiff was not working on brick construction at the sides of the arch \u2014 at the time of the accident, but just preceding the accident, had placed his body or leg over the arch, causing it instantly to buckle and fall.\nPlaintiff denied placing his body or leg over the arch.\nSome of the defendant\u2019s witnesses testified to plaintiff\u2019s admission, on several occasions, that the injury was all his own fault, and nobody to blame but himself. Plaintiff alleged the admissions were due to fear that he might not be employed or able to get work.\nThe credibility of the testimony \u2014 all oral \u2014 was for the jury: Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 251 Pa. 489; Anderson v. Railways Co., 251 Pa. 517. Credibility is the touchstone of testimony in the measure of its weight. As said by Mr. Justice Pell, in Rauch v. Smedley, 208 Pa. 175, 176, and by Mr. Justice Stewart in Simons v. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co., 254 Pa. 507-509:\n\u201cWhere the testimony offered by the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case by showing the existence of facts from which an inference of negligence arises, the case is necessarily for the jury, notwithstanding that the great preponderance of the testimony is with the defendant. An inference of negligence having once arisen remains until overcome by countervailing proof, and whether it is so overcome is a question for the jury.\u201d\nThe charge presented to the jury: The issues of fact to be passed on by it; the method of weighing and measuring testimony \u2014 lay and expert; the duty of determining the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s injuries \u2014 nervous and physical; and the measure of damages. And its attention was drawn to the duty resting upon an employer to furnish his employee with a reasonably safe place to work and proper tools and appliances; and upon an employee not to be careless of himself in the line of his work. Its attention was also drawn to the question of plaintiff\u2019s equal or unequal knowledge of the danger \u2014 and whether he acted and had the right to act upon the superior knowledge of the foreman of - forty years\u2019 experience: Molesky v. South Fork Coal Mining Co., 247 Pa. 434.\nThe reasons assigned by defendants for a new trial are:\n1. The verdict in said case is contrary to the evidence.\n2. The verdict in said case is contrary to the weight of the evidence.\n3. The verdict in said case is contrary to law.\n4. The court erred in refusing defendants\u2019 second, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth points submitted.\nDefendants\u2019 second, sixth, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth points \u2014 with the answers of the court thereto \u2014 are as follows:\n\u201cSecond: If the jury believe that plaintiff was directed by defendants\u2019 foreman to continue his work at the arch after the form was removed before sufficient support had been placed under the arch, and plaintiff continued his work as a brick mason, notwithstanding, he assumed the risk involved and therefore cannot recover.\nBy the Court: As a whole, this point is refused because it involves an issue of fact to be passed on by the jury \u2014 an issue of fact covered by the general charge.\nSixth: Plaintiff must establish by the weight of evidence that there was no act or omission on his part as an experienced bricklayer, amounting to a want of ordinary care, which in concurrence or cooperation with the alleged negligence of defendants was the proximate cause or occasion of the injury.\nBy the Court: This point is refused, becatise the burden of establishing plaintiff\u2019s acts of omission \u2014 want of care \u2014 is on the defendant.\nTwelfth: If the jury believe that plaintiff just before the accident could have proceeded with his work of laying up brick in against the wall without first building the \u2022temporary or foot staging, the breaking of which by the fall of brick from the arch caused him to fall, he was guilty of contributory negligence and cannot recover.\nBy the Court: Refused.\nThirteenth: It appearing by a preponderance of testimony that plaintiff admitted on numerous occasions afterwards that the accident was caused by his own carelessness, as testified to by Addison Brieges or Briggs, John Cornyn, Sr., John Cornyn, Jr.-, Solomon Wensel and John L. Richmond, the jury should be instructed to find for the defendants.\nBy the Court: Refused.\n\u2022 Fourteenth: It appearing from uncontradicted evidence that plaintiff could have proceeded to point up the courses of the pier by standing upon a ladder, placed upon the outside of the pier, his failure to do so constitutes contributory negligence and is a bar to his recovery.\nBy the Court: Refused.\nFifteenth: That under all the evidence in the case the court should direct that the jury render its verdict in favor of the defendants.\nBy the Court: Refused.\nWe cannot say that the verdict is contrary to the evidence, the weight of the evidence, and the law.\nIn the light of (a) the disputed issues of fact and (b) the law \u2014 as outlined in the charge \u2014 we think no substantial error was committed by the court in its answers to defendants\u2019 points.\nClose as the case was upon its conflicting testimony it raised issues of fact upon which the jury alone had power to pass and decide.\nBelieving that a fair trial was had the motions for judgment non obstante-veredicto and for a new trial are refused.\nJ. Boyd Duff, of J. Boyd Duff & Son, with him Packer tG Sherrard, for appellants.\nStephen Stone, of Stone & Stone, with him J. Thomas Hoff mam, for appellee.\nJanuary 7, 1918:"
