The husband of a testatrix elected to take against his wife’s will and in the written election recited that the estate in question consisted of personal property, and particularly declared his desire to have $5,000 allotted to him therefrom as allowed by the Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 87. It appeared that the entire property for distribution consisted of cash or its equivalent. The auditing judge awarded decedent’s husband the requested allowance, in addition to one-half of the remaining portion of her estate. Exceptions were filed to the $5,000 award because there was no appraisement as provided by the Act of 1909. <em>Held, </em>the exceptions were properly dismissed.</p>

Hollinger, by a duly signed, acknowledged and recorded document, which was filed with the clerk of the court below and served upon the personal repre: sentative of his deceased wife, elected to take against the latter’s will. In this written election, Mr.. Hollinger recited that the estate in question consisted of personal property, and particularly declared his desire to have $5,000 allotted to him therefrom, as allowed by the Act of April 1,1909, P. L. 87. When the estate came before the Orphans’ Court for adjudication, the auditing judge took cognizance of this election and awarded decedent’s husband the requested allowance, in addition to one-half of the remaining portion of her estate. Exceptions were filed to the $5,000 award, “because there was no appraisement......, as provided by the Act of......1909 ......and its <em>supplement”; </em>and, upon their dismissal, this appeal was entered.</p>

L. 612). The Act of July 21, 1913, P. L. 875, supplementing the Act of 1909, provides that “the appraisement and setting apart shall be made by the appraisers appointed to appraise the other personal estate of decedent,” and that, should any one of such appraisers be unable to act, the Orphans’ Court may appoint another in his place and stead.</p>

Under the facts at bar, however, where the entire property for distribution consists of cash or its equivalent (Finney’s App., supra), no error was committed in dispensing with the formality of an appraisement.</p>
