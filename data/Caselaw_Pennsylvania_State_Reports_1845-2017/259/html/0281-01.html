    <p class="syllabus" id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[158,958,1148,1008]]]'>A bill in equity brought by certain creditors of a corporation sought to impose liability on a decedent’s estate on the ground that the decedent’s acquisition of the assets of the corporation was a breach of the relationship of trust and confidence in which he stood to complainants, and fraudulent. It appears that deceased had been president of the corporation and owner of all its stock. The corporation was placed in the hands of a receiver and thereafter the creditors perfected a plan, in which complainants joined, under which the receiver was discharged and the creditors controlled the company, naming six of its nine directors, and managed its affairs by an executive committee composed of three of the six directors they had appointed. The company was unable to meet its obligations and its securities were sold at public auction, and were purchased by deceased as the highest bidder. The court found on amply sufficient evidence that after the creditors assumed control deceased took no part in the affairs of the company and had no control over them, and that deceased did not procure the sale to be made and possessed no means to prevent its taking place. <em>Held, </em>(1) the mere fact that deceased was the sole stockholder did not render the transaction a fraud, (2) no relationship of trust and confidence existed between deceased and complainants at the time of the sale, and (3) the bill was properly dismissed.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b318-7" data-blocks='[["BL_318.12",318,[228,1807,1158,369]]]'>First. In the year 1907, George Westinghouse was the owner of a large number of shares of stock in the Westinghouse Airbrake Company, Westinghouse Switch &amp; Signal Company, Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company, Westinghouse Machine Company, and other subsidiary companies, he being the president and ■director of most of these companies.</p>

This company was incorporated by special act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, approved May 29, 1871, by the name of the Southwest Pennsylvania Improvement Company. It was given extensive powers by its charter and its capital stock had at this time been increased to three million dollars, one million of which was preferred stock and the balánce common stock, all of which was fully paid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[123,882,1147,262]]]'>Third. The Security Investment Company did not engage in any business, except the holding of securities of the various Westinghouse enterprises above mentioned, and in the year 1907 and for a long time before was solvent, having a considerable surplus.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[123,1155,1148,535]]]'>Fourth. In October, 1907, there occurred a severe financial panic by which the market price of various securities of' the Westinghouse companies was • greatly reduced, and the stocks of these companies owned by the Security Investment Company, and pledged by it in various banks, were likely to be sacrificed. On the 23d of October receivers were appointed for the Security Investment Company, as well as for others of the Westinghouse companies above mentioned, by the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b319-5" data-blocks='[["BL_319.6",319,[120,1702,1150,587]]]'>Fifth. In February, 1908, the receiver, being the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company of Pittsburgh, advised all the creditors of the Security Investment Company that after consultation with the principal creditors they had nominated a Creditors’ Committee consisting of officers of the various banks in Pittsburgh and in other cities where Westinghouse securities were held by banks and others. The purpose of this committee was to have the creditors join together in protecting the assets of the Security Investment Company and to aid the receivers in .the management of its affairs.</p>

It was deemed necessary for the rehabilitation of the Westinghouse ‘Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company that new capital should be brought into it by issuing additional shares of its capital stock at par, which were to be taken by the owners of stock in proportion to their shares. In order that the Security Investment Company might do its part in this raising of additional capital for the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company, a plan and agreement for the extension of its debt and the protection- of its interest in the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company was prepared by the Creditors’ Committee, a copy of it being printed as Exhibit A of the bill.,</p>

The plan also provided as to the notes already held by the creditors of the company that new notes should be given by the Security Investment Company in exchange for the notes already held by the creditors, payable in three years after May 1, 1908, in, the case of creditors who had collateral aggregating or exceeding the face’ amount of the notes, and in the case of other creditors, whether secured in part or unsecured, notes maturing in five years from May 1, 1908, were to be given.</p>

This plan, dated March 6, 1908, but not actually executed until December, 1908, was submitted by the creditors’ committee to all creditors of the Security' Investment Company, with the recommendation that it be signed, and it was signed by almost all the creditors, and among others by the plaintiffs.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.7",321,[131,1632,1148,486]]]'>Twelfth. After this plan of extension had been put in operation, the Security Investment Company entered upon no neAV business but its sole business consisted in attempting to liquidate its indebtedness by sale of securities and to procuring reductions from its creditors. In the meantime, before the maturity of the notes which ran for five years, Mr. Westinghouse purchased a large number of claims of creditors, for most of which he paid less than face value and for some very much less.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b321-7" data-blocks='[["BL_321.8",321,[132,2126,1148,267]],["BL_322.1",322,[255,310,1152,1239]]]'>Thirteenth. At the 1st of May, 1913, when all the notes were due and the company had failed, owing to the continued depression in the value of the securities, to raise sufficient money to pay the debts, although a large num - her of the shares pledged had been sold and a large num<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>ber of notes secured by them had been paid, and all of the new notes which all fell due on that day were still outstanding, the Fidelity Title-&amp; Trust Company, Trustee, which held these notes and securities, took up the matter of selling out the securities. It appears to have been agreed by the parties concerned that it was not wise to attempt to sell these securities at that time on account of the state of the market. At this time there were in various Pittsburgh banks notes of Mr. Westinghouse to the amount of $666,000, which he had given for the purpose of supplying the deficit left by the failure of all the creditors to pay 25 <em>% </em>of new money into the affair for the purpose of rehabilitating the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company, and there were other notes belonging to other persons outstanding, so that the whole amount of money which was necessary to pay the secured notes, with interest and expenses, was $1,614,700. Mr. Westinghouse, in the summer of 1913, made efforts to provide for the money necessary to bid this amount when the stock should be sold and among others he attempted to procure the same from plaintiffs. He afterwards obtained the money by an arrangement with the Westinghouse Airbrake Company.</p>

When they were sold Mr. Westinghouse bid for them $1,614,700, and they were sold to him at that price. He paid for them by having the notes surrendered to the trustee and cancelled and issued his own notes to the holders of the securities so cancelled for one-half thereof, pledging Westinghouse Electric stock purchased by him at the sale, and paying the other half in cash.</p>

After the change in the directorate of the Security Investment Company provided for by the plan of extension the affairs of the company were managed by an executive committee appointed by the board, composed of three of the directors who were designated by the Creditors’ Committee; and Mr. Westinghouse as president and director took no active part in the affairs of the company and had no control of them. The sale made in October, 1913, was not procured by Mr. Westinghouse to be made, nor did he have any control or other means by which it could have been prevented.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[505,1464,423,27]]]'>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.7",323,[142,1564,1149,596]]]'>First. The plaintiffs contend, first, that under the facts of this case the Security Investment Company in incurring the debt to the plaintiff was in equity the agent of George Westinghouse, and that its debt ivas his; and secondly, that under the facts of the case, when George Westinghouse purchased, at the sale made by the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company, on October 7, 1913, he took the shares purchased by Mm subject to a trust for the general creditors of the Security Investment Company, as to any excess of value or proceeds over the amount paid by him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b323-7" data-blocks='[["BL_323.8",323,[143,2171,1146,211]],["BL_324.1",324,[244,306,1149,1022]]]'>Second. As to the first contention of the plaintiffs, that Mr. Westinghouse is liable for the debts of the Security Investment Company because it was his agent, we are unable to see anything in the facts of the case which <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>would indicate any such agency, unless it is contended that the fact that Mr. Westinghouse owned all the stock of that company made it his agent. We do not conceive that this is really the plaintiffs’ contention, but rather that the claim is that as Mr. Westinghouse owned all the stock of the Security Investment Company all its debts were his personal debts as being contracted by him although under another name. In other words, that the Security Investment Company was a mere alias for George Westinghouse. That courts will in proper cases look behind the act of incorporation and deal with the real owners to discover and control fraud there is no doubt, but the mere fact that one person is the sole stockholder in a corporation does not make him the same person with the corporation: Monongahela Bridge Company v. Pittsburgh &amp; Birmingham Traction Company, 196 Pa..25. We are therefore of opinion that Mr. Westinghouse is not liable for the note of the plaintiff upon this theory.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b324-4" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[245,1338,1145,317]]]'>Third. Even if he were, so liable, the plaintiff could not recover in this proceeding but must proceed by an action at law or, as Mr. Westinghouse is dead, against his estate in the Orphans’ Court. No ground of equitable relief is presented by such a case, and the want of equity jurisdiction has been pleaded.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[245,1667,1146,693]],["BL_325.1",325,[162,323,1150,921]]]'>Fourth. The other, and as we apprehend the main ground upon which plaintiff prays for relief in this case, is the contention that under the circumstances Mr. Westinghouse was incapable of buying the shares from the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company, Trustee, except as a trustee for the creditors of the Security Investment Company, because he was president of the company and a director of it, and the owner of its stock. It does not appear that, so far as the ownership of the stock is concerned, there is any difference in the relation to the company or its creditors, between the stockholder who owns part of the stock and one who owns all of it. Unless there is actual fraud in the case he is to be treated in <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>each case as.a mere stockholder. As a stockholder he may, of course, deal at arm’s length with the company. As president and director of the company his relation is different, and if it appeared that acting in either capacity he had control of the sale it might be that he could not purchase for himself. In this case, however, it appears that the majority of the directors were named by the Creditors’ Committee, and all of the executive committee were named by them, and that Mr. Westinghouse had no real control of the company and no means of controlling the sale, and further, that he had no funds nor were any funds available for the payment of the debt on which the sale was made. We are therefore of opinion that the purchase by Mr. Westinghouse of the shares in question, under the circumstances in this case, was not a purchase in trust for the Security Investment Company or its creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AcP" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[162,1256,1146,98]]]'>The bill must, therefore, be dismissed, with costs to be paid by the plaintiffs.</p>
