Testatrix left no children and all the legacies provided for in her will save one had lapsed by reason of the deaths of the respective legatees prior to that of testatrix. The husband of testatrix elected to take against her will. He was awarded the $5,000 exemption allowed by the act of assembly. The balance for distribution, consisting of personalty, was awarded one-half to appellant and the remainder after deducting the one unlapsed legacy to decedent’s next of kin according to the intestate law. The husband filed exceptions contending that he was entitled to the entire personal estate represented by the lapsed legacies. The auditing judge dismissed the exceptions. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

    <p id="b112-7" data-blocks='[["BL_112.9",112,[254,759,1142,208]]]'>This is an appeal by Martin B. Hollinger from a decree of the Orphans’ Court of Lancaster County directing distribution of the estate of his late wife, Susan L. Hollinger, deceased.</p>
    <p id="b112-8" data-blocks='[["BL_112.10",112,[251,977,1147,810]]]'>When the account of the administrator, c. t. a, was called for audit, it appeared that Mrs. Hollinger left no children and that all the legacies provided for in her will, save one of $1,000, in favor of John Brubaker, had lapsed, by reason of the deaths of the respective legatees previous to that of the testatrix. Mr. Hollinger claimed $5,000, under the Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 87, which was allowed him by the court below. The net balance for distribution, consisting entirely of personalty, was awarded, one-half to appellant, and the remainder, after deducting the $1,000 legacy, to decedent’s next of kin according to the intestate law. Appellant complains of this latter award, contending that he is entitled to the entire personal estate represented by the lapsed legacies, less certain deductions for debts and expenses.</p>

Hollinger made her will, and, with the exception of John Brubaker, lived longer than the legatees named in it, who were not in a class protected against the lapsing of legacies; therefore, the testatrix died intestate as to nearly all of her estate. As the whole of it is personalty and there was no issue, all of it [would have] descended to' her husband, Martin B. Hollinger, save [that portion of the estaté represented <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>by the amount of] the bequest to John Brubaker, had he [the husband] done nothing......; but he chose to elect to take against her will and thereby reduced his interest to the same as. would have been hers had she survived him and elected to take against his will; and no less was awarded him by the decree to which he has taken exception. In the light of Lee’s App., <a href="/pa/124/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="563091" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0074-01">124 Pa. 74</a>, it would be a work of supererogation to offer anything in support of the legality of the award; therefore, the exceptions in behalf of Martin B.
