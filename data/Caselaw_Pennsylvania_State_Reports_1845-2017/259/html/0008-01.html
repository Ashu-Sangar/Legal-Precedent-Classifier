The subject-matter is the amount of royalty bearing coal mined from several veins underlying a tract of seventy odd acres of land in what is now Old Forge Township, this county, of which Drake, the lessor, was owner in fee. In 1863 and 1865, respectively, he made two indentures under seal, commonly called “Coal Leases.” The one granted to R. D. Lacoe and J. B. Shiffer— both now dead — their heirs, assigns, etc., all the coal in the tract, excepting the upper or Marcv vein; the other granted to the Massachusetts Coal Company, its successors and assigns, all the coal so excepted. The first was for a term of ten years and such further time as lessees should continue to pay the royalty, subject to forfeiture, for default of payment for the period of six months. A yearly minimum of $500 was to be paid in half yearly installments on the 1st of April and October, collectible <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>at lessor’s option by distraint. In consideration thereof lessees were to have the right to mine and carry away 5,000 tons of coal yearly at ten cents a ton “miners’ weight to be the standard.” The same price was to be paid for all coal mined in excess of the minimum which was to be paid whether mined or not, subject, in case of deficit in mining or payment in any one year, to have credit for any excess thereof in any preceding year, with the privilege of making up in any subsequent year such deficit of coal as may have been paid for though not mined in any preceding year. The lease conferred the usual mining rights for purpose of shafts and other structures, with the use of so much surface as might be deemed necessary or expedient, inter alia, for roads and wasting grounds. There was a covenant for workmanlike mining and that “sufficient pillars of coal shall be left to support the roof over the gangways and the usual protection of the mines generally.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b47-3" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[156,1316,1148,1087]],["BL_48.1",48,[264,330,1148,640]]]'>3. While the second lease passed all the coal in the Marcy, the obligation to mine was limited to the “merchantable coal,” the exhaustion of which was the only thing to define the term. There was no minimum but the royalty was ten cents a ton “miners’ weight on all the merchantable coal mined from said vein,” etc., payable semiannually. Lessee was to* have the right of way over or under the demised premises after the expiration of the term for the conveyance of coal taken from the corresponding vein on an adjoining tract. It was further stipulated that the lease was “subject to the provision of” the Lacoe and Shiffer lease “so far as relates to its continuance, the payment of taxes and the inspection of books as well as the conduct of mining operations in a workmanlike manner.” In addition to the royalty, it called for the annual delivery to Drake or his successors of “fifty tons of lump or prepared coal” so Jong as lessee’s rights in the premises should continue to be exercised. The lease changed hands and eventually became vested in Lacoe and Shiffer, who thus acquired the.leasehold in <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>both parcels of coal. They died, seized of that estate in both, and it is now in their personal representatives. Bnt during all the time for which accounting is asked, the mining has been done by Jermyn &amp; Company under their sublease of April 1,1887, copy of which is set forth as Exhibit One in their separate answer. The fact is noted that parties to this instrument defined as “merchantable coal” everything above the size known as pea, but stipulated for a given royalty on all sizes including pea as well as still smaller sizes. The books and accounts of production in evidence are those of Jermyn &amp; Company. ,</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-4" data-blocks='[["BL_48.4",48,[260,982,1151,972]]]'>4. The lessor died in 1873 and was succeeded in title by his four sons. One of these was George K., original plaintiff here. Another was Lyman K., who sold and transferred his share to Mr. Lacoe, one of the lessees. In that state of the title the parties in interest, by Avriting 18th February, 1880, modified the provisions of the leases so as to subject the tract, both surface and subsurface, to certain uses for the benefit of mining operations on an adjoining tract so long as might be needed, regardless of the expiration of the terms of the leaseholds unless ended by forfeiture. The only other modification had to do with furnishing the fifty tons of coal. This was changed by apportioning the amount equally between the parties entitled, specifying the place Avhere delivery was to be made on demand, and providing that the right to demand it should be exercised each year. For the contents of these several writings reference is made to copies exhibited in the bill as A, B and C, respectively.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-5" data-blocks='[["BL_48.5",48,[260,1962,1146,429]],["BL_49.1",49,[151,330,1147,373]]]'>5. Up to that time no mining of consequence had been done under the earlier lease, though the minimum royalty had been regularly paid. Later there was an unsuccessful attempt by lessees to apply these payments on account of the mining which had been done in the Marcy vein under the second lease. This brought on a bill for accounting in 1888. The operations for which accounting is now demanded go back to 1891 in the Marcy, and <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>
      <em>to 1899 </em>in the lower veins governed by the earlier lease. Back of 1891 there had been no mining except in the Marcy and it is drawn in question only incidentally in connection with defendant’s claim that the royalty unit is res adjudicata by force and effect of the decree of October 2, 1893, in the former suit. See Drake v. Lacoe et al., <a href="/pa/157/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="157 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="846603" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0017-01">157 Pa. 17</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b49-3" data-blocks='[["BL_49.4",49,[152,713,1149,1300]]]'>6. The meaning of the “miners’ weight” as used in the lease of 1863 is the key to the question in dispute. If, as contended by defendants, it is the equivalent of a ton of “prepared sizes” of coal ready for shipment to market, then admittedly there was nothing to account for on that score when suit was brought, as payment had been either made or tendered in full of all that defendants were bound to pay by the terms of the contract. Indeed, in that case they have overpaid. The term “prepared sizes” or “prepared coal” includes nothing below chestnut; so it is not disputed that if the language of this lease was effective to limit the royalty to prepared sizes of coal, the pea, buckwheat and other so-called steam sizes, would go free. On the other hand it is equally undisputed that in case of the Marcy the lessees paid on all sizes without question until a comparatively recent date. They now deny liability for anything below chestnut plus an allowance for loss in tonnage of prepared sizes due to breaking the coal down in order to supply the market demand of later years for chestnut and smaller sizes. To cover their estimate of the value of plaintiff’s equity arising in that way they now include in their tender the royalty on 52 21/100 per cent, of the pea which goes to market, and claim entire exemption only for sizes below that.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b49-4" data-blocks='[["BL_49.5",49,[154,2024,1148,373]],["BL_50.1",50,[271,320,1149,961]]]'>7. This view seems to have originated since 1900, or soon after active operations began under the 1863 lease. It is candidly admitted by Mr. Berry to have been due to the outcome of the “Warrior Run Case,” i. e. Wright v. Coal Co., <a href="/pa/182/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="182 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="893362" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0514-01">182 Pa. 514</a>, which was decided in 1897. It could hardly have been entertained before 1900, as a payment relied upon to settle a large part of the claim for mining <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>in the Marcy was made October 25th, that year. This is evidenced by a voucher made out by defendants covering in detail the total yield from 1891 to April, 1897, when the operation in this vein was discontinued in the belief that it was exhausted. Thus they paid on the marketable product at that time. While the same is true of the earlier payment to satisfy the decree in Drake v. Lacoe et al,, supra, covering the antecedent mining in that vein, it is also true that it included nothing below chestnut as that was the smallest size going to market during the period involved in that accounting, which was from 1871 to 1876. Hence, there was no specific occasion to claim immunity as regards smaller marketable sizes in that instance. But not so in respect to the payment of 1900 for the operations between 1891 and 1897,, as at that time it is not disputed that both pea and buckwheat were marketed, and that both were voluntarily accounted- for in that settlement.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.4",50,[268,1302,1146,687]]]'>8. The voucher of 1900 appears by copy as defendant’s Exhibit A in the separate answer on part of lessees, and also as their Exhibit No. 1 in the proofs, to which reference is made for its contents. The fact is here noted that plaintiffs seek to avoid its prima facie effect on the allegation that it was executed and delivered by their testator on the faith of an oral understanding that it didn’t mean what it says, but only a payment on account which could be accepted without prejudice. It is also noted that the parties have at.all times treated the half yearly payments under the lease for this vein as falling due the first of April and October as in case of the earlier lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[267,2011,1144,369]],["BL_51.1",51,[158,308,1147,264]]]'>9. Later, more coal being found in the Marcy, mining was resumed there in 1910 in connection with that being carried on in the lower veins! Before the end of March, 1914, the new operation was complete and the vein finally abandoned. No separate account of the shipments from this source was kept during that period and the marketable tonnage can only be .calculated from the <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>quantity which came to the breaker in the mine cars, as to which a record was kept of the total number. But this involves some dispute as to the average weight of the car content. Plaintiffs say it was 7,099, and defendants 5,732 pounds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-3" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[159,581,1151,1454]]]'>10. By mutual consent of the parties Mr. George E. Stevenson, a competent engineer, was designated by the court to make an independent test of the weights. Upon what is believed to have been a fair and adequate test he makes the average 6,641 pounds per car. That is somewhere near midway between the opposing figures of the parties and is the figure adopted in view of the conclusion founded upon the testimony of Mr. Corcoran, general manager of the Jermyn &amp; Company operation since its inception, that the weights have at all times been substantially uniform. The number of cars from this vein during the years in question was 33,270, making a gross tonnage of 99,229.08 going into the breaker. There is no reason to believe there was any falling off in percentage of yield as compared with that of .1896-7, the last year for which a separate account had been kept, when it was 71 9/10 (71 9/10%); and that is adopted as the percentage applicable to the years 1909 to 1914. This would make a marketable tonnage of 70,719.75 tons for that period; and the fact is accordingly so found. If the royalty is payable on that basis it would amount to $7,-091.98, of which plaintiffs’ share would be $1,773. The yearly production appears by computation shown in blueprint hereto attached and marked B, to which reference is made for the half yearly amounts with interest thereon to October 1, 1915, of $423.30, a total of $2,-196.30.</p>

This calculation takes into account neither the fuel coal used by the operator, nor plaintiffs’ claim for pillar coal based on the contention that under the terms of the contract in the light of an alleged usage of the industry at an early day, the lessor was entitled to have approximately one-third of the coal left in place as pil<a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>lars for support of the surface; and, none being so left, to that extent the mining was wrongful. Hence, the claim that pro tanto defendants should account for the value of the coal in place. While the quantity from that source may be susceptible of calculation from certain data in evidence, for reasons hereinafter stated it has not been calculated.</p>

The minimum was accepted regularly until March 31, 1905, inclusive. From that time ever since it has been refused because of the dispute culminating in the present suit. No report of the tonnage was made until 1911, apparently because it was then for the first time formally demanded. The omission to report on the one side, and to make demand on the other, had been due to the fact that the minimum for years gone by had amounted to' enough to cover the mining for some years after actual operations began. On defendant’s theory the advance minimum became exhausted on March 31, 1913. There having been no tonnage to account for before 1900 as in case of the Marcy, there has been no period of the mining under this lease when the parties settled with each other on the basis of the marketable tonnage. But in addition to the minimum falling due since April 1, 1905, defendants have tendered a further sum to cover plaintiffs’ share of the excess payable on their present theory of liability for prepared sizes and a percentage of the pea.</p>

According to the usage prevailing in this region in 1863 the term “miners’ Aveight” meant the gross ton plus 10%, or 2,161 pounds in the mine car. It was afterwards increased so that while it varied somewhat as between different sections of this valley, at Old Forge and vicinity since the early ’70s it has been 3,021 pounds. In either case it was the weight of mine-run material that the miner must produce in order to get paid for mining a ton of coal, the excess being a more or less arbitrary al<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>lowance against him for refuse and waste in the mine car content.</p>

Plaintiffs demand an accounting at ten cents a ton of 2,464 pounds in the mine car before the coal went into the breaker. This quantity can now be determined only by the same method of calculation mentioned in case of the Marcy. (See 9th conclusion above.) The number of cars appears by the operator’s books. At the same average weight the total to October 1, 1915, would be 549,047 mine tons if the ton be taken at 2,464 pounds. At 3,024 pounds for that factor it would be 447,385 tons.</p>

Associated with the question of pillar coal, mentioned in the eleventh Conclusion, is that of damages for surface subsidence occasioned by mining out the pillars. None were left in either the Marcy or the Clark vein next below, in both of which the mining has been completed. Defendants intend to mine the lower veins to the same extent, but no further injury is apprehended from that source. That there has been some disturbance of the surface is not denied, and lessees admit their liability on that score as well as the jurisdiction of equity to take account of the damages in this proceeding. The dispute is as to the nature and extent of the injury and its amount in dollars and cents, as to which the difference is marked. Title to something like forty-five acres of surface remains in lessors’ estate. It is believed, and accordingly found, that the subsidence is now complete and that it affects not to exceed three acres of which the value before the injury was not more than $900; and that the depreciation by reason of the injury does not exceed $500. The legal injury was complete upwards of three years ago.</p>

Lacoe and Shiffer, <a href="/pa/157/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="157 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="846603" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0017-01">157 Pa. 17</a>. That decree liad to do with the Marcy vein only. The parties were held to their own practical interpretation of the lease, and the plaintiffs to the consequences of estoppel. The result was that lessees were required to pay as they had accounted, viz: for the tonnage which went to market. That was consistent not only with the mutual conduct of the parties in their respective treatment of the accounts rendered during the progress of that period of mining, but also with the terms of the contract itself which differ from those in the 1863 lease in that they impose the obligation to pay upon “all the merchantable coal mined from said vein.” The mere fact that at the period then in question nothing below the prepared sizes had been marketable, cannot be regarded as limiting the obligation in every <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>event; and heretofore it was not so regarded by lessees. In 1876 the mining had been interrupted. It was resumed in 1891 and the second period ran from that date to 1897. In the meantime two things had happened: (1), Drake v. Lacoe had been decided; and (2), a market demand for small sizes had arisen — an event of which lessees were getting the benefit: See lease and accounts of Jermyn &amp; Company. While lessees did not settle for the royalties accruing during this period until 1900, they had regularly accounted, as they eventually paid, for everything that went to market. The voucher for that settlement doesn’t show the proportions of each size, but the fact is freely admitted that it included the small sizes. Evidently the delay in payment was due to a dispute between the parties, but it involved no question by lessees that they were liable to that extent, as that was the royalty basis for which they were then contending. Thus both parties are now trying though on wholly different grounds to break the force and the implied effect of that settlement. It conformed to the method of accounting that had been approved in the earlier case because it was held to be too late for plaintiffs to then call it in question. That reasoning must be deemed to apply with at least equal force at this late day; and to both parties alike. Plaintiffs’ attempt to avoid the terms of their testator’s receipt by parol cannot be seriously entertained. There is no- pretense of fraud or deceit as to its contents. On the contrary, the very nature of the parol evidence necessarily assumes that he executed the writing with full knowledge not only of its contents, but of its prima facie legal effect. In his lifetime he never repudiated it, and he survived many years. In the face of positive contradiction on the other side it cannot now be cancelled for the benefit of his successors on the allegation that it was signed with the understanding that its effect should be something other than what he knew it purported to be. Needless to say, if that can <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>be done, it becomes an idle formality to pnt any human transaction in writing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[249,425,1150,855]]]'>The reciprocal rights and liabilities under the 1863 lease are unaffected by any course of mutual dealing giving rise to a question of practical construction by the parties. So far as drawn in controversy in the former proceeding it was there ruled adversely to lessees that this contract had not become merged with the later one then in suit; and the present case involves no such claim. One is at a loss, therefore, to see upon what theory it is now contended that lessees have accounted according to the royalty basis defined in that case: See their separate answer, par. 4 and 5. In my judgment their theory derives no support from Coal Co. v. C. &amp; I. Co., <a href="/pa/225/0211-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="225 Pa. 211" data-case-ids="965292" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0211-01">225 Pa. 211</a>, and kindred cases founded on a stipulation for royalty on definite sizes. • In such instances the parties necessarily have in contemplation the marketable yield as the royalty basis.</p>

But the parties to the contract saw fit to adopt a standard and to define it as the ton for which the miner should be paid. That is the undisputed significance of the term “miners’ weight,” and the weight is taken in the mine car before the contents go into the breaker. They must be presumed to have used the term deliberately and in that sense. It was manifestly inapt if what they had in mind was the yield either of “prepared sizes” or of “merchantable” coal of any size whatever.' So, too, if they had intended to commit themselves unalterably to 2,464 pounds, then constituting the miners’ ton, it would have been quite as easy, and much less awkward, to say so in so many words or figures. They were at pains to use a trade term which could rationally serve but one purpose, <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>namely, to make the royalty payable on the same tonnage for which the miners were being paid during the period of production. As between that and a fixed and invariable weight, it must be presumed they exercised their choice deliberately and for reasons satisfactory to themselves. But this view, say the counsel for plaintiffs, puts the contract of the parties to the hazard of alteration at the hands of strangers, viz: the operator and the miner. The obvious answer is, that the hazard, if any, looks both ways; each party incurred the like risk; instead of an increase, the vicissitudes of the business might have led to a decrease in the weight of the unit; and it was for the parties to say whether they chose to take that speculative chance.</p>

Neither is the question affected by the restriction on methods of operation, inter alia, “that sufficient pillars of coal shall be left to support the roof over the gangways and the usual protection of the mines generally.” This must be deemed a provision, not for the benefit of the surface, but for the preservation of the colliery with a view to winning the maximum quantity of coal, as in the analogous case of Miles v.

The prayers are also for a decree declaring the leases forfeited for conditions broken, for an injunction if they should not be declared forfeited, and for the ascertainment of damages alleged to have been sustained by reason of the caving in and falling of the surface of the demised lands, caused by the mining and removal by the defendants of the pillars of coal under the surface. The material facts, all of which were properly found by the learned chancellor below, appear in its opinion, made part of the reporter’s notes. From the decree which followed them and the legal conclusions based upon them both sides have appealed.</p>

For all coal mined in excess of five thousand tons a year the lessees were to pay ten cents per ton. The chief contention between the parties to this proceeding is as to the meaning or effect to <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>be given to the words in the lease “miners’ weight to be the standard” of each ton of coal mined.</p>

Lacoe et al., <a href="/pa/157/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="157 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="846603" data-case-paths="/pa/157/0017-01">157 Pa. 17</a>, we construed the words “miners’ weight,” used in the lease of November 28, 1863, to mean “such quantity of coal, slate and dirt, as was agreed upon between the operators and the miners to be sufficient to make a ton of prepared coal.” In 1863 a “miners’ weight” ton in the anthracite region, in which the Drake property is located, was a gross ton plus ten per cent., or 2,464 pounds, in the mine car. It was afterwards ■ increased, and while it has varied somewhat in different sections of the valley in which the leased premises are located, it has been 3,024 pounds in their vicinity since about the year 1870; but, however it may have so varied, “miners’ weight” ton has always been the weight of mine-run material which the miner must produce in-order to be paid for mining a ton of coal, the excess being a more or less arbitrary allowance against him for refuse and waste in the mine car content. During the period for Avhich an accounting is asked a “miners’ Aveight” ton has been 3,024 pounds, and upon that basis the defendants are directed by. the court below to account under the-first lease. The main complaint of the plaintiffs is that the accounting ought to be made on the basis of 2,464 pounds — a “miners’ weight” ton at the time of the execution of the lease of 1863. If the intention of the parties to that lease Avas that the then “miners’ weight” ton should be the unvarying standard during the whole term of the lease upon Avhich the royalties were to be paid, they readily could, and most naturally would, have fixed it in figures at 2,464 pounds, for they are presumed to have knOAvn that a “miners’ Aveight” ton —the amount of mine-run material which a miner must produce in order to be paid for mining a ton of coal— would vary from time to time with changes in the quality of the material obtained from the mine. “Miners’ weight,” as we define it in Drake et al. v. Lacoe et al., is not a fixed, unvarying quantity of mine-run material, <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>but is such quantity of the same as operators and miners may from time to time agree as being necessary or sufficient to produce a ton of prepared coal. This varying standard was manifestly adopted by the lessor and lessees when they used the well-known trade term “miners’ weight” — the ton weight of material required to be mined as equivalent to a ton of prepared coal— and the learned court below properly held that the accounting must be on the basis of a “miners’ weight” ton as fixed and agreed upon by the operators and miners during the accounting period.</p>
