Bigler, Mr. Miller, Mrs. Miller, Hamlet and Walton — all five of whom swore the man was Anthony, and Mary Gamble, who swears it was not. Testimony was offered to throw discredit on the identification of Hamlet and Walton, as you will remember, and of Bigler by showixxg that he said the man went out the other door, and that he did not know the man. But as we remember, no such contradictions were shown as to Miller and his wife, whose story is corroborated in many respects, other than the identification, and the statement of the colored woman, by witnesses on both sides. Were they correct or were they mistaken?</p>
