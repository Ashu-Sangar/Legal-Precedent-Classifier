The difficulty with this contention is that the contract alleged to be breached is not simply between the present plaintiff and defendant, but it is a written agreement, or gas lease, executed by plaintiff and five other persons, as lessors, and defendant, as lessee; if, therefore, plaintiff’s alleged tortious act, in diverting the gas thus sold to defendant, is to be treated merely as a failure to deliver in accordance with the contract, then all six lessors are jointly liable for this breach of their covenant, and defendant cannot of his own volition single out any one of them as the object of a suit based upon such default, which is the effect of the set-off averred in the affidavits of defense.</p>

As said by our present Chief Justice in Pittsley v. King, <a href="/pa/206/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="206 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="931767" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0193-01">supra</a> (p. 196), “It is a general presumption of law, Avhen two or more persons undertake an obligation, that they undertake jointly, and words of severance are necessary to overcome this primary presumption.” In the present instance, no such words appear; hence we say that the plaintiff and his fellow lessors are all jointly liable for a failure to deliver the oil sold to defendant, and the latter cannot maintain a suit against plaintiff alone for such a breach of contract. At common law, there are three distinct forms of obligations ex contractu, i. e., (1) joint, (2) several,'and (3) joint and several. In an action on the first, it was necessary to sue all the obligors together, or the.' survivors of them; <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>on the second, the obligors had to be sued separately; but, on the third, the plaintiff could elect either to sue separately or jointly: 9 Cyc. 651 et seq.; 30 Cyc. 121. Except where changed by statute, these principles are still applicable: 9 Cyc. 654, and n. 35. Since the defendant cannot maintain a suit against the present plaintiff alone, for the breach of contract which it contends it has a right to take advantage of in this action, it follows that the defendant is not in a position to use this alleged breach in defense, as a set-off; for the rule requiring mutuality of debts, where set-off is pleaded, forbids the setting off of a joint debt against a separate one: 34 Cyc. 712, 727, 730. “Mutuality of debts is the essential circumstance in set-off”: Cramond et al., Exrs., v.

Super. 282" data-case-ids="837306" data-case-paths="/pa-super/18/0282-01">18 Pa. Superior Ct. 282</a>) have no application here, since they rest upon the theory that defendants have the right to agree among themselves as to the adjustment of the proceeds of the set-off, and hence no harm is done to any one. This rule also permits one of two joint obligees, with the consent of the other, to use the obligation as an equitable defense in an action by the obligor against one of them alone (Smith &amp; Co. v. Myler &amp; Aber, <a href="/pa/22/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="22 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="413694" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0036-01">22 Pa. 36</a>; Cochran v.

The affidavits in question not having been made by an officer of the defendant corporation, the court rightly viewed them as insufficient for want of essential averments. As President Judge Sloan says, “The affidavits are made by one A. J. Hamilton, chief accountant of the corporation, but it is not stated that he is an officer of the corporation, nor why the same was not made by an officer of the corporation, and it is not averred that he has personal knowledge of the facts..... .In the supplemental affidavit he states that he has a knowledge of the facts, and that he. is duly authorized by the corporation to make and file this supplemental affidavit; but there is nothing in the supplemental affidavit of defense that in any way relates to the original affidavit which would cure the defects in it [the original] ; and, as it [the supplemental] neither states nor alleges why it is not made by an officer of the corporation, it is open to the same objection.” In addition, it may be said that, although the affiant avers that he “believes and expects to be able to prove” the facts therein stated, in neither affidavit does he claim personal knowledge, or that he makes the averments thereof after, investigation or upon Information imparted to him by one possessing personal knowledge. In short, he neither <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>claims to be an officer who would naturally possess a knowledge of tbe facts averred in tbe affidavits, nor does be attempt to state tbe sources of his information or even formally to allege that be makes tbe averments contained therein upon “information and belief”; moreover, be fails to aver bow be is “duly” authorized. Hence, tbe affidavits are insufficient to prevent judgment.</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[275,739,1151,915]]]'>True, tbe Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, provides that affidavits of defense “shall be sworn to by tbe defendant or some person having knowledge of tbe facts”; but this provision in no way changes tbe requirements laid down in our prior cases for such affidavits when made by agents of corporations who are not regular officers acting within tbe scope of their authority.
