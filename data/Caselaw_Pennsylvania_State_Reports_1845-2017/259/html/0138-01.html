In other words, it does not provide for seizing property presumed to be without an owner, but rather for the taking into possession by the sovereign Commonwealth, for the protection of both State and owner, of a certain class of property which is subject to escheat. The act requires that, in all cases where, for a period of thirty years, any person has failed to exercise rights of ownership over a savings fund deposit, the amount thereof shall be handed to the State treasurer, whose receipt it declares a sufficient protection to the prior custodian. The rights of the owner are amply protected by giving him a cause of action against the Commonwealth, with full provision for legal proceedings and final process, under which either he or his legal representatives may recover the amount of the deposit upon proof of identity. This is neither depriving the depositor of his property nor taking it for public use within the meaning of either the federal or state constitutions.</p>

True, the act says that the deposit shall be paid “to the State treasurer for the use of the State,” but it also specially provides that, when claimed by the depositor or his legal representatives, the amount proved shall be paid over to the party entitled thereto “out of any unappropriated moneys in the hands of the State treasurer, or if there be no such moneys unappropriated, then out of the first moneys that shall be received by him”; which, in effect, is a dedication, so far as may be necessary, of all unappropriated moneys in the State treasury to the purpose of satisfying duly proved claims under this act. Since the State, with its power of taxation, is always solvent, it would be impossible to give better security.</p>

When, as here, such property is taken in charge by the State, and the owner or his legal representatives are given an unlimited right to ’reclaim, with a pledge of all unappropriated moneys in the public treasury, so far as may be necessary, to repay the amount thereof when duly proved, this is simply an exercise of authority over property actually within the jurisdiction of the State, and liable to escheat, for the due protection of all parties in interest, including the owner; and is in no sense a taking or seizing for public use within the <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>meaning of the constitutional provisions relied upon in this case.</p>

Conceding, for the sake of argument, defendant-has a right to raise this constitutional point, yet, in so contending, it speaks only on behalf of the depositors whose money is being transferred to the State treasury, since the bank itself received due and formal notice of the present proceedings. When the case is viewed from the standpoint of these depositors,' then the rule applies that “a court Avill never heed objections to the constitutionality of an act of assembly unless the complainants are affected by the particular feature alleged to be in conflict with the Constitution”; furthermore, it is ahvays essential for a complainant to show that he occupies such a position: Mesta Machine Co. v.

On the pleadings at bar, there being no averment to the contrary in the affidavits of defense, we must assume all the deposits in controversy to have been made subsequent to 1872; and, hence, that the respective depositors acted with full knowledge of the provisions of the statutes passed in that year. This being so, since the proceedings on the part of the State to obtain possession of these deposits were not instituted for the purpose of declaring an escheat or of passing the property in question over to another, in short, Avere not in antagonism to the owners, but for their benefit, there. exists, no absolute necessity for any form of notice to <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>such owners, as the latter are presumed to know that, after expiration of the thirty-year period, the Commonwealth, at any time, may take-over the custody of their deposits in the manner provided by the act dealing with the subject in hand.</p>

Finally, the fact that, under the Act of, 1872, supra, a depositor may not claim interest from the State, does not present a subject which calls for consideration at this time; “this is a matter with which......[the defendant] ......is not concerned, and can arise only between the State and the claimant when he asserts [his] ......right [of]......property”: Provident Savings Institution’s Case, <a href="/us/221/0660-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="221 U.S. 660" data-case-ids="3658260" data-case-paths="/us/221/0660-01">221 U.

Bell v. Powell, <a href="/pa/249/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="249 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1013649" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0144-01">249 Pa. 144</a>, 156, and there said, it “simply means that the public funds are not to be expended in any way except as directed by the law-making power.” It was not the intention thereby to prevent the legislature from providing a special fund to be paid out in a designated manner, or to prevent the law-making power from pledging unappropriated funds for the return of moneys taken into the custody of the State under an act such as the one at bar, and concerning which money the State asserts no right or title paramount to that of the original owner. As to the Act of May 11, <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>1909, P.

It reads as follows: “Where any depositor with any savings fund, savings institution or savings bank whatsoever......shall omit to make any demand,” etc. True, later on, this section contains the provision that, after thirty years, no suit may be instituted or maintained “for the amount of such deposit, against such «corporation”; but it is argued by plaintiff that the word “corporation” is here used in “a generic sense......to cover unincorporated as Avell as incorporated” savings institutions. It is not necessary to decide this point, however, for we are convinced the court below expressed a proper vícav of the matter in the following excerpt from its opinion: “We do not look upon this provision of the statute [Act of 1872, supra] as a statute of limitations strictly so called, such as was intended to be avoided by Section 21 of Article III of the <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>Constitution, but rather as an-enactment for the protection of the savings banks against liability after it has paid over the deposit to the State treasurer. The statute takes away the remedy of the depositor against the bank, and substitutes for it the remedy against the State treasurer and the Commonwealth which has received the deposit. But, be that as it may, the other provision in the statute amply protects the savings bank. In the second section, it is provided that the State treasurer’s receipt shall be a full and sufficient discharge of the savings bank from any further liability to the depositor. Both provisions......were intended to protect the savings bank; so even if the first......be avoided......it still has full protection in the effect which the statute directs shall be given to the receipt of the State treasurer.” In other words, even if it be conceded that, after the lapse of thirty, years, the depositor or his legal representatives might still have a right to sue the bank, yet, since the State has full jurisdiction to take over the custody of apparently abandoned property, the receipt of its treasurer, when produced, by the defendant bank, would be a sufficient answer to such an action; hence, the bank cannot be in any wise prejudiced by the alleged unconstitutionality of the limitation. Then again, it is to be noticed that, even after thirty years, the Act of 1872, supra, does not deprive a depositor of either his remedy or right of action, but simply transfers the liability to him from the original depositary to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</p>
