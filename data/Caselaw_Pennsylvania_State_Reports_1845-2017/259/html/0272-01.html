There was evidence that defendant saw deceased shortly before the latter started toward his home, to reach which he would pass under the bridge, and there was further evidence that defendant was seen going toward the bridge shortly before the shooting. On the morning after the shooting a revolver containing three 38-calibre cartridges and two empty shells was found near the railroad tracks sixty rods from the bridge, and on the following day an empty cartridge case was found in the defendant’s room with name and number corresponding to that on the cartridges found in the revolver. There was evidence that ill-feeling existed between defendant and deceased prior to the shooting. Held, there was sufficient eyidence that the murder was committed <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>by lying in wait, and a verdict of guilty of murder of tbe first degree will be sustained.</p>

Dur: ing this examination the district attorney stated that “We believe now if this man [the defendant], would am swer- the questions truthfully, we could show that that was' the motive for this homicide.” This was an iim <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>proper remark, but, as there was no objection or exception taken thereto, it cannot be made the basis of an assignment of error: Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[222,697,1154,1065]]]'>The sixth and seventh assignments of error are based upon certain statements in the charge of the court, wherein reference is made to the contention and theory of the Commonwealth. But that was not error, as such contention and theory found some support in the evidence. The fact that -the defendant saw the deceased shortly before the latter started down Wayne street in the direction of his home, to reach which he would pass the subway, and where according to his declarations the defendant stepped from behind the abutment and shot him, tends to support the contention that the murder was perpetrated by lying in wait. And the evidence that defendant was seen shortly before the homicide near the. west end of the foot bridge at Salem street, above Wayne street, and said he was going home,- which would take him over that bridge, tends to support the theory that he crossed the river there, and, in connection with the evidence that he was at the subway, tends to support the theory that he came there by walking down the railroad track.</p>

To go and commit the crime and return in the manner .the Commonwealth contends he- did would take under' ordinary circumstances about fifteen minutes, as he would travel some four-fifths of a mile. However,- the witnesses to the, alibi were busy waiting upon customers <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>in the store and had no way of fixing the length of time the defendant was absent therefrom, except as an estimate from recollection. And estimates made by some of those witnesses while testifying indicate that what to them seemed four or five minutes was in reality from twelve to twenty minutes. On the question of alibi the court charged, inter alia: “If you find from the weight of the testimony, from the preponderance of the evidence, that he was not at the scene of the crime at the time of the hilling, you must find a verdict of not guilty.” This was a correct statement of the law: Rudy v. The Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/128/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="128 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="567100" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0500-01">128 Pa. 500</a>; Commonwealth v. Andrews, <a href="/citations/?q=231%20Pa.%20597" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="231 Pa. 597">231 Pa. 597</a>. The court further said in substance that if the defendant was gone from the store long enough to perpetrate the crime and return, referring to such time as fifteen to twenty minutes, then they might find him guilty. This was a proper explanation and called the attention of the jury to the true test of the alibi.</p>

And two days after the crime was committed an empty cartridge box was found in the defendant’s room in his boarding house, with name and number corresponding to that on the cartridge found in the revolver. The court in commenting upon this circumstance said that “The Commonwealth has shown that this cartridge box was found in the room of the defendant.” Several witnesses had so testified; but it is urged for defendant that the use of the word “shown” treated the fact as established, while the credibility of the testimony was for the jury. We see no merit in such contention. A proper definition of “shown” as used in the charge would be “pointed out or made known by evidence,” and that accords with the dictionaries. The court did not say it had been conclusively shown, and the jury knew that <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>sucli fact rested upon oral testimony, and were instructed that, “The facts are to be found from the testimony as you recollect it.” ' The court inadvertently stated that the doctor had testified to' certain declarations as made by Morobito shortly after the shooting, when substantially such testimony had been given by other witnesses, but not by the doctor. The court’s attention was not called to this mistake at the time and, therefore, it constitutes no ground for reversing the judgment: Commonwealth v. Razmus, <a href="/pa/210/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="210 Pa. 609" data-case-ids="937864" data-case-paths="/pa/210/0609-01">210 Pa. 609</a>; Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b316-4" data-blocks='[["BL_316.4",316,[255,931,1147,1466]]]'>•The so-called after-discovered evidence, as exhibited in the depositions, was largely cumulative, and with due diligence might have been discovered before the trial. There was no abuse of discretion in refusing to grant a new trial on that ground. Such refusal was so clearly a matter within the discretion of the court below that its action in this respect will not be reviewed in the absence of clear error: Knickerbocker Ice Co. v. Pa. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/253/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="253 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="1024003" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0054-01">253 Pa. 54</a>, 66. And see Commonwealth v. Garrito, <a href="/pa/222/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="222 Pa. 304" data-case-ids="959456" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0304-01">222 Pa. 304</a>. That the trial judge in passing upon the motion for a new trial considered the affidavit of a witness in explanation of his deposition affords no ground for reversing the judgment. The case depended to a considerable extent upon dying declarations, the weight of which was for the jury. “All the authorities agree that after the declarations have been admitted as dying-declarations their weight and credibility are purely for the determination of the jury”: 1 Ruling Case Law, page 547.. Where such declarations are contradictory tO' each other, it is the duty of the jury to weigh them and to determine which if either is to be believed: Wharton’s Criminal Evidence (10th Ed.), page 585. The question of guilt or innocence was for the jury to decide, subject to the approval of the trial judge.' If guilty the case' presents all the elements of -first degree murder. Having considered and passed upon the alleged errors, our duty is performed.</p>
