Plaintiff acknowledged receipt pf the $1,000, noting that it was to be appropriated to the principal; but objected to a like application of the $4,000. The jury found specially that the $4,000 payment had been properly applied by plaintiff to interest, but that the $1,000 had been correctly applied on the principal, and rendered a general verdict on that basis upon which judgment was entered. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

Appellant contends that a debtor has no legal right to direct a payment made by him to be credited on principal, when the interest then due exceeds the amount of the payment; hence that, under such circumstances, the creditor may retain the sum paid and appropriate it to interest, notwithstanding a different application may have been directed by the former and at the time expressly or impliedly agreed to by the latter.</p>

Moreover, in the first of these cases, where one suit was brought on several notes, upon all of which interest had accrued, it was held that undirected payments, made by the debtor to the creditor, must be applied, not in liquidation of the accrued interest upon all the notes, but, “first to the interest accrued on the note first falling due, and the balance of such payment to the principal of said note, and so on, in the order in which the notes were payable”; which ruling certainly does not help the present appellant. In the next case the court states, “Where there is interest due, a debtor cannot, without the consent of the creditor, impute to the reduction of the principal any payment he may make”; the plain implication being that, where the creditor assents, the rule is otherwise.</p>

Va. 549</a>, 559, 560. Where the parties, or either of them, have rightfully applied a payment, it is final, and the law will not interfere therewith: Mercer v. Tift, <a href="/ga/79/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="79 Ga. 174" data-case-ids="63870" data-case-paths="/ga/79/0174-01">79 Ga. 174</a>; Pond &amp; Hasey Co. v.

Ordinarily, interest is considered as incidental to or forming an integral part of the principal debt upon which it accrues, and not as a separate demand (22 Cyc. 1570, 1571; Osterling v. Allegheny Trust Co., decided at this term); but, when a payment is made on account of the debt, there is nothing to prevent the parties from mutually treating interest as a demand separate and apart from the principal, so as to appropriate the payment to the latter rather than the former, if they see fit. When this course is pursued, the rules laid down in the authorities dealing with the application of payments as between separate debts, have relevancy; hence their notation here. While it may be that none of the cases cited actually governs this one, and that, perhaps, some of the broad principles to which we call attention may have no direct bearing on the exact point now before us, nevertheless they all shed more or less light upon our present inquiry.</p>

From an examination of the cases already mentioned it appears that, while a debtor, after making payments, may not demand their application to principal as against interest, yet he may so stipulate in making a payment, and, if it is accepted without immediate pro<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>test, such acceptance will be tantamount to an agreement to apply the money as directed, the creditor being bound accordingly. The principle that, after an appropriation has been made by the debtor and expressly or impliedly assented to by the creditor, the law will not interfere on behalf of the latter, upon equitable or other grounds, has been frequently announced (Stewart v. Keith, <a href="/pa/12/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="12 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="963761" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0238-01">12 Pa. 238</a>; Martin v. Draher, <a href="/watts/5/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="5 Watts 544" data-case-ids="1844012" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0544-01">5 Watts 544</a>; Pearl v. Clarke, <a href="/pa/2/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="2 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="951416" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0350-01">2 Pa. 350</a>); for such circumstances constitute a contractual situation, and courts will not set aside agreements unless they are without consideration, illegal, against public policy, made Avithout contractual capacity, or induced by fraud, accident or mistake of fact. The present case does not fall under any of these classifications, and the alleged inequity of- holding this creditor to the application which, when the payment in question was made, he at least impliedly agreed to, is not so strong as to move a chancellor to avoid the resulting contract and release plaintiff from its effect; and the learned court below did not err when it so ruled.</p>

When defendant paid plaintiff the latter sum, he explicitly directed in writing that it should be applied on principal, and, in the same letter, he expressed the wish that the sum of $4,000, previously paid, should be likeAvise applied. Plaintiff acknowledged receipt of the $1,000, noting that it was to be appropriated to principal, and, in his letter so doing, he discussed defendant’s suggestion for a like application of the $4,000, saying in that connection, “What I can’t see at the present time, without giving it much consideration, is how you can apply a payment on principal, as long as the interest is running against the debt; interest should be paid before the principal.” The verdict of the jury, which is in the nature of special findings, correctly determined that the $4,000 fund had been properly applied to interest, but <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>that, under the circumstances, the $1,000 (being the payment now in controversy) must be applied on principal. They also found that the original contract between the parties required defendant to pay plaintiff interest at the rate of five per cent. These findings are justified by the evidence at bar and they breach no established rules of law; thereunder, since the original contract expressly required the payment of interest, no issue arises on the question discussed in some of the cases, upon the general subject now before us, concerning the right, in the absence of such an agreement, subsequently to recover accrued interest on a principal sum which had previously been paid off (see 22 Cyc. 1572-4; 15 R. C. L. 11, 14, 15); and, again, since the evidence shows, and the jury in effect found, a contract on the part of plaintiff to appropriate the $1,000 to principal, the abstract question of the right of a creditor, when partial payment is made on a debt, coupled with a request or direction to apply the amount to principal rather than accrued interest, at once to refuse so to do, is not before us for determination. On the facts here disclosed, what we do determine is that, at the time of the payment in question the defendant having explicitly directed its application to principal, and the plaintiff having accepted the money without, declining to abide by this direction, the jury were justified in finding it had been complied with and that the appropriation thus made created a contractual relation or situation which subsequently could not be changed by one of the parties without the consent of the other; hence, as expressed in the verdict, the $1,000 must be applied on principal.</p>
