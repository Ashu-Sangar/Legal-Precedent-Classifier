      <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>This is admittedly a close case. Counsel for the plaintiff in his brief speaks of it as a border line case, but after mature deliberation we have come to the conclusion that it was a case for the jury and not the court to decide. The verdict of the jury establishes the following facts, which are supported by sufficient evidence: The accident occurred in the Pennsylvania Railroad yards at Youngwood, in Westmoreland County, in what was known as the loaded classification yard. In that yard there were at least nineteen tracks leading off from what is known as the ladder track. The plaintiff had worked in that yard and the other yards adjoining for fifteen years, with the exception of two years about eight or ten years before the accident when he was working on the road. He was thoroughly familiar with all the yards and with all the tracks and had worked over all the tracks handling all kinds of cars.'</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b573-3" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[161,1275,1147,641]]]'>On the morning of the accident No. 11 track was full of loaded coal cars for more than two hundred feet at least, down from the ladder track. The conductor of the shifting crew ordered them to take a certain empty car off track No. 10 and place it on track No. 19, and in order to get that car they had to hitch on and pull these eight or ten cars off No. 10 track, go up the ladder track and then back down on track No. 19 where they left this one car. They then pulled back up on to the ladder track and backed down to No. 10 track and down No. 10 track for the purpose of coupling up with the remaining cars standing on that track.</p>

He was occupying that position so as to be able to see that the car properly coupled when backed against the end of the train of cars standing on that track. The car, on the side of which he was riding, was empty. He was standing with his foot or feet on the stirrup or lower step <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>of the ladder and his left arm thrown over the top of the ear. There was a flange on the top of the bed of the car, which extended out to about even with the edge of the posts which supported the side of the car bed. It was usual and customary for brakemen riding the cars in on these tracks to ride on the ladder on the side of the car just as the plaintiff was doing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b574-4" data-blocks='[["BL_574.4",574,[243,724,1150,1186]]]'>There were some eight or nine cars being shifted back on to No. 10 track, the same cars that had been taken off No. 10 in order to get the one car that was to be placed on No. 19 track. As the end of the car on which the plaintiff was standing reached a point about two hundred feet from the ladder track down on No. 10 track the plaintiff was caught between the side of the car on which he was riding and the side of a loaded car on track No. 11 and was squeezed and rolled round once between the cars and then fell to the ground between the tracks; by reason of which the plaintiff was very seriously, and, it was claimed, permanently injured. The plaintiff claimed to recover from the company on the ground that there was not sufficient clearance between tracks Nos. 10 and 11 to afford the plaintiff a reasonably safe place in which to work, and the plaintiff’s right of recovery was resisted on two grounds especially, first, that he had been guilty of contributory negligence, and, second, that he was thoroughly familiar with the location of the tracks, had worked in the yard for almost fifteen years, and over these tracks Nos. 10 and 11 for at least ten years, and that he must be held to have assumed the risk.</p>

The engineer called by the defendant testified that at a point three hundred feet from the ladder track the distance between track No. 10 and track No. 11 was 6 feet 7 inches, and that two hundred feet from the ladder track the distance between the two tracks was 6 feet 9 inches. The standard gauge between tracks is 7 feet to 7 feet 5 inches. Louis Johnson, a witness called by the plaintiff, testified that he had been track foreman for the defendant company at the Youngwood yards and that he had helped to lay the tracks in this yard. He said they had aimed in laying the tracks to work to a gauge of 7 feet between the tracks, but that part of the ground over which they laid the tracks was a swamp, which they had to fill in, and that in laying tracks 9,10 and 11 they did not maintain the gauge of 7 feet, but that they were laid with a narrower space than 7 feet between them.</p>

Mr. Tarbell, a mechanical engineer for that road called by the plaintiff, testified that that was one of the widest of cars and that its width over all was 10 feet 1% inches; that on the top of the bed of the car there were flare boards which extended up and out even with the outside edge of the posts and that the posts at the side of the car were about 6 inches thick. The standard width of a track between the rails is 4 feet 8% inches, and the average width of the ball of a rail, or that part on which the wheels run, is 2% inches. There was a very slight bend in the tracks at or near where the accident occurred, but there was no evidence to show what effect that would have upon the space between the cars on No. 10 and No. 11 tracks. The plaintiff testified that he had walked through between the cars on tracks Nos. 10 and 11 hundreds of times and that in riding a car in on track No. 10, as he was doing on the morning of the accident, he usually had a space of about eight<a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>een inches between his car and the car or cars on track No. 11. He testified further that just before he was caught between the cars on the morning of the accident, the car on which he was riding made a lurch and sagged over towards the cars on track No. 11, and that it was because of this that he Avas caught between the cars; that he did not know that he would have been caught had the car not made that lurch. He testified further that he did not know what caused the car to make the lurch, and there was no evidence to sIioav that either the car on Avhich he was riding or track No. 10 was not in good condition. The plaintiff claimed that he was riding the car in in the usual and ordinary Avay; that he had never heard of any brakeman being injured by being caught between cars at that point, and that he did not know that the place Avas dangerous.</p>

But in view of all the circumstances, considering that the plaintiff had worked over those tracks and between the cars for years, that no accident had ever happened, that men in the employ of the company, who' were his superiors and who had worked in the yard for years, differed in their opinions as to whether it was a safe place to work or not, and in view of the further fact that there is no evidence to show that the plaintiff actually knew that the clearance between tracks Nos. 10 and 11 wras less than the standard clearance between tracks in those yards, we think the question of the plaintiff’s assumption of risk was a question of fact for the jury and could not be ruled as a question of law by the court.</p>

The clear, impartial and entirely adequate charge omitted nothing which was necessary to enable the jury to intelligently consider the testimony and determine the facts of the case. The learned trial judge subsequently reviewed the facts and law in an exhaustive opinion overruling the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto for defendant and amply vindicating the judgment which he directed to be entered on the verdict.</p>

This is so clearly correct that a discussion of the question is not required. The serious question, and the one to which the appellant has devoted its extended argument, is that the plaintiff fully appreciated the danger and must be conclusively presumed to have assumed the risk of the service he was performing at the time he was injured. The plaintiff was a brakeman employed by the defendant company in its loaded classification yard at Youngwood, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. He had worked in that and the defendant’s adjacent yard about thirteen years, was familiar with the yards and the numerous tracks and had handled all kinds of cars on them. On the morning of the accident, the conductor of the shifting crew ordered them to' shift one of eight or ten cars on track No. 10 to another track, and, in order to do this, they had to pull all the cars off the track, place the one car on the other track, and then replace the remaining seven or nine cars on track No. 10. While backing these cars on track No. 10, the plaintiff was standing in his proper place on the ladder on the side of the car next to track No-. 11, the ladder being close to' the front end of the car on which he was riding. He was standing with his feet on the ladder and his left arm thrown over the top of'.the car. While in this position, he was caught between the side of the car on which he was riding, and the side of a loaded car on track No. 11 and seriously <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>injured. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant was negligent in not leaving sufficient clearance between tracks Nos. 10 and 11 to afford a safe place in which to work. Negligence and assumption of risk by plaintiff were the grounds of defense.</p>

The reasons for submitting to the jury the question of assumption of risk are so clearly stated in the opinion of the learned trial judge that we deem it unnecessary to refer to and discuss the testimony bearing-on the question, as the learned trial judge does so at length in his opinion, and shows conclusively that the evidence would not support a directed verdict for the defendant on that issue. The facts, as stated by the court, will be found in the opinion of the court below. As a result of his reexamination of the case on the motion for judgment, the learned court concludes as follows: “In view of all the circumstances, considering that the plaintiff had worked over those tracks and between the cars for years, that no accident had ever happened, that men in the employ of the company, Avho Avere his superiors and who had worked in the yard for years, differed in their opinions as to whether it was a safe place to work or not, and in vieAV of the further fact that there is no evidence to show that the plaintiff actually knew that the clearance betAveen tracks Nos. 10 and 11 was less than the standard clearance between tracks in those yards, Ave think the question of the plaintiff’s assumption of risk was a question of fact for the jury and could not be ruled as a question of law by the court......The injury to the plaintiff by reason of his riding on the side of the car and being caught between that car and a car on track No. 11 by reason of the width of the car upon which he was riding and the lurching of the car at the time of the accident, and the further fact that the distance between the two tracks was less than the standard g-uage, was not such an injury as was reasonably inci<a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>dent to the plaintiff’s employment, and hence it could not be said that the plaintiff had assumed the risk of that injury, unless it was first shown that he knew that those tracks were less than the standard distance apart, and that he knew and fully appreciated the danger to Avhich he was exposed in riding in on the side of the car at the time the accident occurred......It follows, therefore, that the motion for judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto must be overruled.”</p>
