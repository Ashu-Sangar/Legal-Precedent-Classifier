The width of this space was not given, but it was well known to the jury. Fifth avenue runs by the court house where the trial was being held and is the most prominent street in this city. The overhang of a street car occupied a portion, and two ordinary steps would carry a man over the entire space. The only wit<a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>nesses who located the automobile with reference to the side of the street car were Miss Meyers and Mr. Kent, who both said that it ran on the street car track.
