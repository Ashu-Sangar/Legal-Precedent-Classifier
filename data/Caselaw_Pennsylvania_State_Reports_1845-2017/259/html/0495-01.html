Bollo, deceased, who died intestate in 1905 leaving a husband, Charles A. Bollo, and no children besides the petitioner; that Charles A. Bollo died May 20,1916; that Ella K. Bollo at the time of her death was in possession as owner of and had title in fee to said lot of ground; that petitioner and Ella K. Bollo had been in possession of said land since 1878 and petitioner has the legal title by operation of the law of descents and adoption, and has had the right of possession since the death of Charles A.

Rollo ever had any possession save that had by her husband; denies that petitioner ever was in possession of any part of the premises except a part devised to her by Charles A.

During the lifetime of Charles A. Rollo, he had control of the property and collected the rents, though he did not live on the land. The petitioner with her husband lived in one apartment of a three-apartment house on the land during the lifetime of Charles A. Rollo- and has continued to live there since his death. Neither of the respondents live or have lived on the land. The petitioner testified that on June 28, 1916, shortly after Rollo’s death, she notified the tenants in the other houses to pay rent to her. Since Mr. Rollo’s death, the other tenants of the apartment house have paid rent to the petitioner, but, notwithstanding the notices given by her, the tenants on the other part of the land have paid rent to Mrs. Rollo, the widow, and one of the respondents. When this proceeding was instituted, about six' weeks after Mr. Rollo’s death, there had been no change in the tenants and no effort by any one to oust any of them. It appears that the water for all the houses on the tract was procured from wells thereon, and that, since Mr. <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>Hollo’s death, the petitioner has paid rent for water for the apartment house which is supplied from tanks on other property, although the wells are on the lot in question.</p>

The residuary estate is devised to the widow, Margaret Bollo, with a devise over in case of her death before that of the testator. The lot was not divided during the lifetime of Mr. Bollo.</p>

The court was of opinion that the petitioner did not have “such possession......as the statute contemplates,” and discharged the rule for the issue. With this conclusion Ave do not agree. We have stated substantially the pleadings and the contention of the parties. The learned court was in error, we think, in admitting in evidence the will of Charles A. Bollo. As has been pointed out, the single issue for determination in the proceeding was the possession and not the title or <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>ownership of the land in controversy. Whether Mrs. Bell, the petitioner, or Mr. Rollo and since his death his devisee, Mrs. Rollo, has the title to the premises is entirely outside the issue, and evidence to establish the title of either of the parties was immaterial, and, when offered, should not have been admitted. It is true, both the petition and answer claim title, in the respective parties, which is required by the statute, but proof of title in either is not required nor permissible in determining the issue in this proceeding. So far, therefore, as the learned court admitted such proof by either party, it was error, and the proof cannot be considered in determining the petitioner’s right to the issue.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[233,1039,1155,1350]],["BL_539.1",539,[155,330,1150,1237]]]'>The petitioner averred that she was in possession and owner in fee of the entire lot of ground, and set forth how she acquired title. The answer averred that Charles A. Rollo owned in fee and had possession of the whole lot at the time of his death, that he devised the lot to his widow, except the part occupied by the three-apartment house “of which said part, the said Mazie E. Bell has had sole and exclusive possession since the death of said Charles A. Rollo.” It is therefore admitted by the appellees that appellant has had actual possession of a part of the lot in question since May 20,1916, when Charles A. Rollo died. The petition avers, what is not and could not well be denied in the answer, that, as the act provides, the appellant has claimed to have not only the possession but the title to the whole lot. It is wholly immaterial whether she claimed title or right of possession as the adopted daughter of Ella K. Rollo who had the legal title when she died intestate, or from any other source. The jurisdictional fact required to be averred is that petitioner is “claiming to hold or own possession of the same by any right or title whatsoever,” which is disputed. The validity of the title is not involved in the issue. What, therefore, is the effect of the admission in the appellees’ answer that the legal title to the entire lot was in Ella K. Rollo when she died in 1906 and that appellant <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>is and has been since Charles A. Rollo’s death in actual possession of a part of the lot to which she claims title and right of possession to the whole premises? The evidence shows that no division of the lot was made in the lifetime of Mr. Rollo1. It was held and used by him as one property, and continues to be such unless it was divided by Mr. Rollo’s will, upon which the appellees rely to make the division. But obviously this cannot be the effect of the will if Rollo was simply tenant by the curtesy, as his title died with him, and he could not devise the premises or any part of them. Whether he had the equitable title to the premises, as contended by the appellees, and, therefore, could devise the lot involves the question of title, which, as already shown, cannot be inquired into or determined in this proceeding. The position of the parties, so far as affects the right of the appellant to the issue, is precisely the same as if Rollo had devised the whole instead of only a part of the lot to his widow, and appellant is, and was prior to Rollo’s death, as now conceded, in actual possession of a part and claiming the whole property. In other words, Rollo’s will cannot affect the right to the issue in either instance and must be eliminated from the case.</p>

The statute does not prescribe the kind or character of possession that petitioner must have to confer jurisdiction on.the court to award an issue, but provides simply that he must be in possession of the premises, with disputed claim of title. It is contended, however, that Mrs. Rollo is in possession of the part of the lot claimed by her, and that since her husband’s death the tenants under Rollo attorned to her and have since accounted to.her for the rents. It is admitted that she does <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>not reside on-the premises in dispute. The conduct of the tenants cannot avail Mrs. Rollo or the other respondents. The only possession they can have is such as would follow and be incident to the ownership of the land in dispute acquired by Rollo’s will, but, as observed above, the title to the premises cannot be inquired into in this proceeding for any purpose, and the will was not admissible to show title in Mrs. Rollo for any purpose germane to the issue before the court. The court was apparently of this opinion, but admitted the will because the petitioner had. offered “some evidence of her title or the basis of it.” The petitioner may show how she claims title or the right of possession, but, as indicated above, evidence on her part to establish her title was not admissible for that purpose, and, if offered, should have been excluded. That it was erroneously admitted was no justification for permitting the respondents to show their title.</p>
