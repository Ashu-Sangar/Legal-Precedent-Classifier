In the trial of an indictment for murder it appeared that the defendant and two confederates, all armed with revolvers and with their faces partly concealed with handkerchiefs, went to a shanty where deceased was visiting. The defendant entered, placed his revolver against deceased’s head and shot and killed him instantly. Defendant and his confederates compelled the other occupants of the shanty to hold up their hands and took from the only one possessing any money all that he had, Defendant was positively <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>identified by one of tlie occupants of tlie shanty by his size, unusually light hair, and by the features of the upper part of his face which was exposed, .and was identified by another by his voice, although less positively. There was evidence that at about one o’clock on the day of the shooting defendant and his two confederates were together at a camp in the vicinity and were overheard talking about the money at the shanty and planning to get it, that later in tlie afternoon they were again overheard talking on the same subject, and that they left the camp together half an hour before the commission of the crime. Shortly after the shooting defendant appeared in the neighborhood acting in a nervous, excited and hurried manner and stated to two acquaintances, “we had some shooting up there and the neighbors are telephoning the police.” There was evidence that three or four days before the murder deceased had said in the defendant’s presence that defendant had taken money from him and had attempted to commit an unnatural offense upon him. Defendant fled and was apprehended seven months later in another state where he was working under an assumed name. Held, a verdict of guilty of murder of the first degree was justified by the evidence.</p>

The shanty had two rooms, a front room, in which was Shade’s bed, and a kitchen. On January 31, 1916, he had quit work for a day or two and was indulging, as he occasionally did, in the excessive use of liquor, having at the shanty at that time a small keg of beer and a bottle of whiskey, which he shared with some of his friends who called during the day. On that evening, at abont fifteen minutes after six o’clock, while he and John Rowles, the deceased, were in the front room, and two other friends named Patrick Kelley and Michael Brawlev were in the kitchen, three men armed with revolvers and their faces partly concealed by handkerchiefs entered the shanty, two in the <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>kitchen and the third in the front room. The latter at once grabbed Bowles’ face and turned it aside with his left hand and with his right hand placed the revolver against Bowles’ head and fired, killing him instantly. The assailant then covered Shade with his revolver, and with repeated threats of instant death demanded his money and compelled him to search therefor in different parts of the room, including the bed, but found none. At the same time Kelley and Brawley were held up by the two robbers in the kitchen and forced to stand facing the wall with their hands above their heads while they were searched.</p>

He came to Clearfield about December 27,1915, and until the fifteenth of January, 1916, Avas employed there as dish washer in a hotel. When he ceased that work he had a few dollars and remained around Clear-field until the evening of the homicide, sleeping with other tramps at a brick kiln. During this time he did some begging and lived as such men usually do, spending considerable time at a place called “the camp” on the bank of the river, where tramps built a fire and did cooking. John Bowles, the deceased, was a resident of Clearfield and worked nights at one of the brick plants. He was subject to fits, not strong in any respect, and had at one time been an inmate of the county home. He had no regular boarding place for some days prior to his death and seems to have associated more or less with tramps. He met the defendant about two weeks prior •to his death and a friendship sprang up between them; <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>they were often seen together and he introduced the defendant as his brother; they tried to rent a shack for their joint use and were together several times at Shade’s shanty, including the morning of the day of the homicide; at which time Bowles gave Kelley two ten dollar bills and a five dollar bill belonging to Shade, and which Kelley then put in the watch pocket of his pants.</p>

Allen and Wilson were arrested the same night at DuBois on an outgoing freight train, and this defendant, who left Clearfield that evening, was apprehended about seven months later at Cleveland, Ohio, where he wras working under an assumed name. Meantime Allen and Wilson, for their complicity in the crime, had been tried and convicted of murder in the second degree. At the trial of this defendant a large amount of testimony was submitted tending to show, inter alia, that a few days prior to the robbery he saw Shade have about eighty dollars at the shanty; that at about one o’clock on the day of the crime the three defendants were at the camp where they ate dinner, also drank intoxicating liquor and were overheard talking about the money at the shanty and planning to go and take it; that later in the afternoon they returned to camp and continued the talk upon the same subject and left there together about one-half hour before the crime was committed.</p>

Then lie and the two others thus addressed caught a freight train and left Clearfield. All the defendants denied their guilt and submitted evidence tending to discredit and explain that of the Commonwealth. The evidence for the defense tended to show that this defendant returned that night and got some underwear at the brick kiln, then caught another train out before daylight and went into an adjoining county where he worked a week in an ice plant and served ten days in jail for trespassing on the railroad, and in each.instance there gave his true name. Each of his confederates had a revolver when arrested; and money corresponding to that taken from Kelley was found on the car floor where one of them sat Avhen being brought back that night from DuBois. At Clearfield this defendant was sometimes referred to as “The Big Swede,” although not of that nationality. Shade, who knew him well and had a good chance to see him that night, as the room was lighted up and the handkerchief covered only the loiver part of his face, testified positively that he Avas the man who shot <em>Rowles; </em>and Kelley, who based his conclusion on the assailant’s voice, was of the same opinion, though not so positive.</p>

The statement made by the witness, Shade, just as the robbers departed was properly admitted as part of the res gestee. The fact that the deceased had accused defendant of criminal offenses was admissible on the question of motive, as it tended to show ill feeling between them. A man would naturally hate one who had accused him of attempting to commit an infamous crime. This evidence merely went to the extent of showing that the deceased had made such an accusation against defendant and for that purpose it was competent. See Commonwealth v.

As Howies was not resisting the robbers, his murder was such as might suggest some other motive, hence it was proper for the Commonwealth to prove any facts naturally tending to show the defendant’s prior hostility to the deceased.
