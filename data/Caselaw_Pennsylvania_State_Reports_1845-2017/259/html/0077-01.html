Mylin, Esq., of Pequea Township, trustee of the estate herein given to my grandson, Francis Marion Mylin. And finally I nominate and appoint my said nephew, Samuel M.

It was held that the devisee, by the operation of the rule in Shelley’s Case and the Act of April 27, 1855, P. L. 368, took an estate in fee. To the same effect is the decision in Arnold v.

The only duty imposed upon the trustee was- that of keeping the buildings upon the land insured and in good order. But no funds were provided for insurance or repairs. The grandson was entitled to the possession, control and beneficial enjoyment of the property for the term of his life, without interference by the trustee. It does not appear from the case stated that there are any buildings upon the land in question, but if there are they can be kept insured and repaired by the cestui que trust as readily as by the trustee.
