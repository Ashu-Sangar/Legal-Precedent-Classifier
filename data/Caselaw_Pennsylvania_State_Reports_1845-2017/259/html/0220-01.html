Thereafter he purchased with his ward’s funds three coupon bonds, containing a provision that title should pass by delivery unless registered on the books of the company, but that after registration no transfer except on the books of the company should be valid unless the last registration shall have been made to bearer. The bonds were duly registered in the name of <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>the ward, and such registration was evidenced by endorsement on the back of each bond.</p>

Platkaway, nor was any inquiry made of Myers as to how he came in possession of the bonds or by what authority he was pledging them as collateral security for his own indebtedness.

This $3,000 added to the $8,900 loan made $11,900. The said H.' E.
