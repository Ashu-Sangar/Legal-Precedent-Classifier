The contract to Avhich they are noAV objecting Avas not before the court in the previous litigation, except incidentally. The actual controversy was as to the constitutionality of the Act of 1909, without regard to anything that had been done thereunder; hence, there was no decision upon the contract at all. Nothing could have been decided except a constitutional question. The Act of 1917 does no more than any other curative act; it effectively authorizes [.within the restrictions of the statute] what had previously been defectively authorized, and there is no attempt to decide any judicial question.....The act...... is undoubtedly curative legislation; but the legislature is not prohibited from passing such acts, if the power to enact the [substance of the prior] defective legislation existed.

This position is faulty for two reasons. In the first place, while the result of our former adjudication was to render ineffectual the tunnel contract here involved, yet that matter was not then in litigation and we passed no direct judgment thereon. Next, the Act of 1917, supra, does not attempt or even pretend to validate the contracts therein referred to, in the sense of making them effective, or establishing them as subsisting binding obligations, according tO' their tenor, nor does the act undertake to declare the proceedings underlying such contracts legal, after we had ruled otherwise. On the contrary, the legislation in question is based upon a recognition of the non-enforcibility of these contracts, and they are treated therein as mere moral obligations..' The whole statute is drawn upon the theory that the relief thereby afforded is made necessary by the illegality of the before-mentioned prior legislation and <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>all proceedings thereunder. True, at one point, it does state that the contracts are made “valid and binding,’’but this language is immediately qualified by the remedial or curative part of the statute, which provides that recovery thereunder can be had only for work done before the unconstitutionality of the former legislation, upon which these contracts rest, was established, and that (as quoted hereinbefore) “nothing in this act shall be so construed as to make valid any......contract except to the extent that work was actually done and performed prior to the date on which said [legislation] was declared unconstitutional.” In other words, the essence of the law under attack is simply a legislative recognition that, when in any instance public work of the character described in the statute shall have been done under a contract having the color of validity, by reason of its authorization by act of assembly, and such act shall subsequently be declared unconstitutional, these circumstances shall give rise to a moral obligation, by virtue of which the statute requires the county which ordered the work in question to fulfil its promise of payment to the extent of any actual performance of the contract, up to the time that operations thereunder were brought to a stop by the adjudication of the invalidity of the prior authoritative legislation. Briefly stated, the Act of 1917, supra, merely turns into enforceable demands what the legislature in its wisdom saw fit to consider moral obligations. This course has been countenanced repeatedly as curative legislation; and, in the present instance, it is far from declaring the class of contracts referred to in the act before us to be valid, subsisting, legal obligations, to be enforced according to their tenor, which, of course, the legislature could not do without effectually remedying the faulty foundation upon which they rest,</p>

There, as noted in the opinion of this court, certain public improvements Avere made under legislation which was subsequently declared unconstitutional; “this left the city without power to collect ......the cost of the......improvements completed and in course of construction,” and the statute attacked was passed to remedy this difficulty. The opinion in that case then states: “It was urged that this [curative] act does not apply, because the improvements in question were made under void acts of assembly, and without any authority whatever.

The defendant was assessed, under the curative act, for part of the cost of an improvement which had been authorized and completed under the void act. He resisted payment on the ground that the curative act was unconstitutional. We held that, the original authorization and proceedings for the collection of the assessment being abortive, since the legislature had power to authorize the work and assessment, the curative act was valid and recovery could be had thereunder.
