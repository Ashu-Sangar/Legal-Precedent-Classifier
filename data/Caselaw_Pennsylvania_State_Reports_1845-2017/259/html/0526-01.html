A bond in the sum of five hundred ($500) dollars, at the same time, Avas filed by the appellants, conditioned that they pay all or any costs which may be occasioned by reason of such appeal and Avhich may be decreed by the Orphans’ Court to be paid. At the time of filing this appeal and bond, a motion was filed to strike off the appeal from the probate because it did not appear, from the appeal filed, the nature and character of appellants interest in the estate. We might say in passing — for it is not clear to us that this motion Avas disposed of— that the appeal shows they Avere nephews of the decedent and, of course, would be entitled to inherit as collateral heirs, if the decedent died intestate, he being without issue and his wife dead.</p>

Ruff, Ida M. Ruff and others; yet this testimony fails to show — we believe not a single witness testified — that the decedent was of weak mind and without testamentary capacity, or that undue influence was exercised over him by the proponents. The only question to which it is necessary for us to direct our attention is, whether or not the fifth paragraph in this will was inserted by the scrivener after the decedent signed it. The whole contest narrows itself down to the determination of this question. To this, and this question alone, was testimony offered by the contestants of the will. It is now for us to say, from this testimony, whether that testimony is of sufficient weight and directness as would justify us in sending an issue to the Common Pleas Court for trial by jury.</p>

Ruff, the scrivener of the will, says that he wrote the entire will, with the exceptions of the signature of the testator and the witnesses to the will, just as it appears to-day, before David McWilliams or the subscribing witnesses signed it; that the fifth paragraph was in the will before it was executed by the decedent and witnessed by the Rogers boys; that he used a fountain pen in writing it; that it was written with one kind of ink; and that the testator and the subscribing witnesses used the same pen and the same ink in executing and witnessing it. This testimony of Mr. Ruff was elicited by the appellants as if under cross-examination. One of the subscribing witnesses, on cross-examination, said that this paper was signed and executed by David McWilliams and witnessed by himself and brother with the same pen, and that he saw no other pen that day. Outside of the experts, the contestants have produced no witnesses to prove the contrary of what was testified to by Mr. Ruff and the subscribing witnesses, There is not a <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>witness produced by tbe contestants who says that this fifth paragraph was not in the will at the time David McWilliams signed it. There is not a witness produced by the contestants who says that this fifth paragraph was inserted by Harry E. Ruff after or immediately before Barbai’y McWilliams’ death, without the knowledge or consent of David McWilliams, or out of his presence; and there is not a witness who says that this fifth paragraph was written with a different pen and with a different ink from that used in writing the balance of the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[160,940,1151,1017]]]'>The fact that David McWilliams signed the paper, which is not denied by the contestants, is evidence that he knew the contents of this paper at the time of signing and that the fifth paragraph was there at that time. Of course, this is presumptive evidence but still it must be overcome. Then, again, the fact that these contestants, in their petition for a citation on the framing of an issue, averred undue influence on the part of Harry E. Ruff and Ida M. Ruff in procuring the execution of this fifth paragraph, is an admission that it was in the will at the time it was executed by David McWilliams. We have, in addition to all of this, the testimony of Harry E. Ruff that the fifth paragraph was written in the will before it was signed by the testator, together with his testimony and that of Daniel Rogers as to the whereabouts of the will and the envelope in which it was kept. All point conclusively that this fifth paragraph was never written in this will at the time or in the manner the contestants now contend.</p>

Mc-Ivlveen and Geoi'ge W. Wood whose testimony, when boiled- down, amount to-, this: that there was a different pen and a different ink used in writing the fifth paragraph of this will. They do- not pretend to say it was written at a different time from the writing and execution of the balance of tbe will, or that it was not written <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>in the presence of the testator and at his direction. The inference avc are expected to. draAv from their testimony that it Avas Avritten Avith a different pen and ink is that this'fifth paragraph Avas placed in the will after its execution. This Ave cannot do and avc refuse to alloAV a jury to predicate a guess on that testimony alone. It is true, the scrivener said that he used but one pen and one ink in Avriting the entire Avill Avhich is in conflict Avith this expert testimony, but if different pens and ink had been used, Ave are unable to see hoAv it Avould have hurt his case to have so testified. An examination of the will, especially the signatures of the testator and that of the witnesses, show as marked a difference as to the color of the ink as there exists betAveen the fifth paragraph and the balance of the body of the Avill. And so an examination and comparison of the part complained of and other parts of the Avill do not convince us that it Avould be safe to draw the conclusion desired by the contestants. This is our opinion of the evidence.</p>

Ruff after its execution by the testator. Our notion of the krw is that expert testimony, such as Avas offered in this case, cannot be received as independent testimony to establish the facts or conclusions sought by the contestants to be established or drawn. Such testimony can only be received as corroborating other direct or positive evidence as to some fact in issue.</p>
