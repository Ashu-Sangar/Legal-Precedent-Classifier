An order of sale was granted on the 16th of February, 1917. The real estate described in the order was sold to J. C. Barron, husband of the administratrix for $8,000. Mr. Green for himself and as attorney for the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company, filed exceptions to the sale, and also presented the petition for specific performance of contract. There were gross irregularities in the conduct of the sale, and if a proper party in interest had filed exceptions they would doubtless have been sustained, but as we have concluded that neither Mr. Green nor the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company has any interest in the estate, we need give the exceptions no further consideration.</p>

They have all filed answers practically admitting the facts as set forth in the petition, but denying the petitioners’ right to specific performance, alleging specifically the resolution of the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company fixing the maturity of the mortgage as in 1914, <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>and averring laches on the part of the petitioner; and also denying authority on part of Mr. Green as a representative of the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company to institute and conduct the litigation. The widow, Susannah C. Kutz, filed an answer of similar import, but also in a manner denying her signature to the articles of agreement. This denial in her answer is in the following form: “......I think it is his genuine signature, but there appears upon said agreements with the name of Cyrenius W. Kutz, the name of Susannah C. Kutz. I was the wife of Cyrenius W. Kutz at the date said agreements purport to have been signed by him. My name does not appear on said agreements. The name of the widow of Cyrenius W. Kutz is Susan C. Kutz, and I, the widow of said decedent, have at no time written my name Susannah C. Kutz, and I have no recollection of signing-said agreements and I do not recognize the signature purporting to have been signed by Susannah C. Kutz as having been written by me, though there is some resemblance in those signatures with my own genuine signature.” The name of Daniel H. Schweyer appears on the agreements as an attesting witness to the signature of Mrs. Kutz; and depositions have been taken to prove the death of Daniel H. Schweyer, and that the signature on the agreement is the genuine signature of Mr. Schweyer; and the agreements in that form, with the name of Mrs. Kutz appearing thereon after the name of C. W. Kutz, were handed to Mr. Green by Mr. Kutz. Mr. Kutz was a very reputable citizen, and therefore for the purposes of this case, we find as a fact that the signature on the agreements is the genuine signature of Mrs. Kutz.</p>

For this indebtedness Mr. Kutz executed a mortgage on his real estate including that in controversy here, to his son-in-law, J. C. Barron for himself and as trustee for <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>the other creditors. The assets of the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company were all expended in prospecting on lands of Mr. Kutz and others, spoken of as the pool, for the purposes of ascertaining the extent and quality of the coal and minerals thereon. The certificates of stock of the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company for Mr. Kutz, as referred to in the optional agreements, were, never tendered to Mr. Kutz, in fact were never executed by the corporation. No- formal action has been taken by the corporation authorizing Mr. Green to prosecute these proceedings. In fact a number of the stockholders were called as witnesses and by their testimony indicated their hostility to this proceeding. There is no prospect for an immediate sale of the coal by the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company were it to become the owner of the premises. Under these circumstances we are decidedly of the opinion that the relief sought for should not be granted. Were the parties reversed and the estate of Mr. Kutz seeking to enforce the contract there would be little prospect of success.</p>

The agreement itself is silent as to the time of the delivery of deed and security by mortgage, therefore the law would fix a reasonable time, in the absence of any proof; but the parties themselves seem to have considered that three years was a reasonable time ;. in fact, the agreement provides that the mortgage is to be made payable in three years from its date, and it is fair to presume that the parties contemplated an early issuing of the stock and exchange of papers. The charter was promptly obtained; then the action of the corporation fixing the first of July, 1914, as the time for the limitation of the mortgages, is in harmony with what appears to have been the understanding at the time the papers <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>were executed. Within that time no demand was made of Mr. Kutz, and when a demand was made upon him a year later he promptly took advantage of the resolution passed by the stockholders of the petitioning corporation. From the light that we have now, were we to grant a decree of specific performance, it would simply mean that a deed should be executed to the Laurel Hill Valley Coal &amp; Coke Company and a mortgage given by that company for the bulk of the purchase-money with no immediate prospect of a sale of the land in view, and with a strong probability that resort would have to be had to legal proceedings to enforce the payment of the mortgage, and probably result in a sheriff’s sale of the property, thus entailing great expense, long delay and unnecessary trouble.</p>
