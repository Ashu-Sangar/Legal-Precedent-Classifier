Certain of the residuary legatees filed exceptions asking that the executor be surcharged for failure to convert assets and securities belonging to the estates of the two sisters who first died and to account for the same, that he be surcharged for failure to include certain notes belonging to the said estates, and that the executor’s commissions be disallowed. The Orphans’ Court refused to surcharge the executor and allowed the commissions. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

At the decease of the last survivor of the three of us, we dispose of all our property, real, personal or mixed which shall then remain as follows: We direct our executor hereinafter named, as soon as he deems it advisable so to do, to sell all our personal estate at public sale, and our real estate, except as hereinafter provided, at either public or private sale, as he may deem best, and to distribute the proceeds thereof as follows”:</p>

Upon the death of each of these sisters their will was admitted to probate and letters testamentary issued to D. M. Hertzog, the appellee, as executor. This appeal is from the refusal of the court below to surcharge him and to the allowance of commissions.</p>

The estates of Mary and Sarah, who died first, are not involved in the settlement of Elizabeth’s estate, it not appearing that anything to which she was entitled out of,-the estate of her two sisters had been withheld from her by the appellee. The will clearly contemplated the settlement of but one estate, and the appellee has in-<a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>eluded in the settlement of that estate — Elizabeth’s, who was the “last suryivor” — all that she had acquired from any source. In the settlement of her estate has he done anything, or omitted to do anything, he ought to have done, which makes him liable to surcharge or calls for a forfeit of his commissions?</p>
    <p id="b86-5" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[260,644,1153,1565]]]'>After a review of all the evidence in the case we concur in the conclusion of the learned court below, that the appellee, as executor, exercised common skill, common prudence and common caution in the settlement of Elizabeth’s estate, and approve the following from the opinion dismissing the exceptions to his account: “At the audit twelve witnesses, nine of whom were leading members of the bar, testified that Mr. Thompson’s reputation financially as a safe person and one in whom trust and confidence could be reposed up until the time of his failure was very good; that he was trusted generally by the people; that his financial standing was not. questioned until about the time of his failure. And that the executor’s reputation as a good, safe business man was very good, and that his standing as a member of this bar was very good. The testimony further shows that no suits were entered against Mr. Thompson before December, 1914, and that the executor handled the estate’s claims in the same manner and with the same skill and judgment that he handled other claims placed in his hands for collection and pursued the same general course that all the other members of this bar pursued. We think the course pursued by the executor would have been approved by the testatrix had she been living: McNair’s App., <a href="/rawle/4/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 148" data-case-ids="1823558" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0148-01">4 Rawle 148</a>.” To the foregoing it may be properly added that from the records of this court it is manifest that any effort on the part of the appellee to recover from J. V. Thompson would have been unavailing.</p>
