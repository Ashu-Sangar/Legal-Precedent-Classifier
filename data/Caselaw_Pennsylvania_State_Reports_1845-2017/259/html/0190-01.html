At the time of the making of the will there was in Allegheny County an unincorporated body known as the Children’s Aid Society of Allegheny County. In May, 1913, the majority of the members of such society voted to incorporate the society, and in June, 1913, such society was incorporated by the Common Pleas Court. Thereafter certain persons who had been members of the unincorporated body, not approving of the incorporation, formed an organization known as the Children’s Aid Society of Western Pennsylvania, Allegheny County Auxiliary. Each of such organizations claimed the legacy. <em>Held, </em>the court properly awarded the legacy to the incorporated body.</p>

Accordingly a meeting of the society was called for May 17, 1913, to consider the matter of securing a charter. While not positively testified that all the members had notice of the meeting, it is a clear inference from the established facts that a notice was sent to each member. Out of a board membership of twenty-five, thirteen attended the meeting in person and three sent proxies. The action taken, as appears by the minutes was as follows: “The president announced that the legislature had appropriated $20,000 to the Allegheny County Society, and that to receive the money it Avould be necessary for us to have our OAvn charter. After a very careful and conscientious consideration of the matter, and comments from the members present, it was moved by Mrs. Hickman, seconded by Mrs. Rankin, that we apply for a charter. All voted for it but Mrs. Wallace and Mrs. Anderson. They did not vote. Motion Avas declared carried.” in pursuance of this action, an application for a charter, executed on its behalf by six members of the society, Avas made to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, and in June, 1913, the Children’s Aid Society of Allegheny County was incorporated by said court. OAving to the vetoing of the bill by the Governor on July 26, 1913, there was delay in organizing under the charter, which did not take place until in 1914, when the existing officers, who had previously been elected, became, by virtue of their offices and in <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>consequence of their designation as such in the charter, officers of the incorporated society. Or, in other words, without change of object or purpose, custody or books, or apparent objection or friction, the unincorporated society merged into, and continued its business and objects as the incorporated society, without any noticeable change, save that it did not thereafter maintain any connection with the Society of Western Pennsylvania, and it has ever since, in full activity, continued its work.</p>

The court has further expressed its views upon this matter in what is said upon the fifth exception. This unincorporated organization is maintained, and engages in the work for which it was formed.</p>

So far as the court is informed the organization of the ladies interested was without articles of association or fundamental rules specifically defining the rights of the members or the powers of the association, and was, therefore, very loose in character. Such being the case, it would seem to- be a necessity that the control of its affairs, and the determination of that form of organization which at any time would best tend to the furthering of its great and beneficent purpose should be peculiarly within the control of the majority of the members thus ..associated together. Of course, no one could be forced into corporate membership. Nevertheless, the opinion is entertained that, under the circumstances in this case, it was within the province and power of the majority of the associates, in furtherance of the general purpose and design of the organization, to incorporate as they did, especially as the transfer or-transaction was no more than a change from an unincorporated situation to a corporate situation, and all of the activities were continued by that majority and have ever since been main<a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>tained by the society. Under such circumstances, the very few who remained silent ought not to have it in their power to block or prevent that which the majority deem for the best interest of the society, and to best tend to promote and carry out its original and unchanged purposes, nor be permitted to prevail in their claim of being at the present time the original society.</p>

It is quite uncontroverted that a. majority of the original society, during the lifetime of Mrs. Neel, did incorporate, taking with them to the corporation the name, identity, actual working organization, minute book, and the like, of the society, without legal question of the right so to do by any silent member, and, without cessation, continued, and has ever since continued, actively and efficiently to carry out the original objects and purposes of the society. Thereafter the donor was under no obligation to investigate whether as between themselves the incorporated society should administer her bounty, or whether the non joining members should do so. Sufficient for her purpose that there was and continued to be a Children’s Aid Society of Allegheny County, in uninterrupted existence, identically the same in every respect except for a merger into a corporate organization from an unincorporated one. So long as she lived neither claimant had a vested interest in the bequest, nor, so far as they are concerned, was there any occasion, at the time the charter was obtained, for determining as between them, in her behalf, which was the continuing society. The court should not be required to determine that controversy now, nor should the estate be vexed with it.</p>

Could a residuary legatee contend with success that it had lapsed because the corporation was nonexistent when the will was made, although in full being at and after the death of the testatrix? She had a beneficent purpose in view, not the mere enrichment of a society, and, if, when she died, there existed the “Children’s Aid Society of Allegheny County,” corresponding in location and almost identically in name with the legatee named in her will, and fully qualified and in readiness to carry out her purpose, Avould right and justice permit her intention to be thwarted? It is manifest she had no intention whatever to have her benefaction expended all over the western part of the State.
