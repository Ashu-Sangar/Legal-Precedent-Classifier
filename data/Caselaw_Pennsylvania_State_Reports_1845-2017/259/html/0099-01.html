The bill prayed, (1) That defendant be ordered to remove the dam and certain obstructions connected therewith, “or such, parts thereof as shall allow the water of said river to flow and run in its usual and natural course......as it did before the erection, maintenance and operation of said dam, structures and works of the defendant”; (2) That defendant be restrained from increasing the height of its dam; (3). “That defendant be enjoined from maintaining and operating its said dam and works or other obstructions in said river.......in such manner as shall <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>cause the water thereof to back and overflow the property of the plaintiff”; (4) “That defendant be perpetually enjoined from placing and maintaining any dam, structure or works......as shall increase the depth of the water......thrown or flowing upon plaintiff’s said property”; (5-7) That defendant be enjoined from flooding certain roads, tow-paths, banks, etc., claimed to be the property of plaintiff; (8) That an account be taken of the damages suffered by plaintiff, and defendant be “decreed to pay the same”; (9-11) “Discovery, general relief,” etc.</p>

On the day the bill was filed, plaintiff petitioned for an order allowing service on defendant outside the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas of York Coxxnty; whereupon the court below decreed “that service of the bill be made upon......the defendant in the manner directed by the Act of April 6, 1859.” The sheriff returned that he had made such service on the president and secretary of the corporation at its office in New York City. On September 13, 1916, the sheriff of York County deputized the like officer of Lancaster County to make service in the latter’s jurisdiction ; and, on September 16, 1916, the last mentioned sheriff made return that he had served the bill, etc., on “the agent of defendant and the person for the time being in charge of its office” in Lancaster County. September 28, 1916, counsel for defendant entered an appearance de bene esse, for the purpose of attacking these two returns. The court below dismissed a motion to set aside the service, stating, inter alia, “the plaintiff’s bill contains the only facts upon which the court can yet rely; and an inspection thereof clearly reveals a sufficient subject-matter within the jurisdiction of this court to warrant the court in authorizing process of service on the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Act of April 6, 1859, P.

The court below set aside service upon the defendant Dwight, had under the Act of 1859, supra, and on appeal we affirmed, saying: “It has not been the policy of our jurisprudence to bring nonresidents within the jurisdiction of our courts unless in very special cases.......The Act of 1859 ought, therefore, to receive a construction in harmony with this policy. There exists no good reason why courts of equity should be invested with a more enlarged jurisdiction against nonresidents than courts of law. On the contrary......the inclination should be in a different direction.......Had the bill in this case been confined to the prayer for relief as to the ninety-eight shares of the capital stock of the Williamsport and Canada Lumber Company, standing upon their books in the name of the defendant Walton Dwight, there would be plausible ground upon which to sustain the service of the process upon him.......We are of opinion that the bill must be confined, at least so far as the interest of the foreign de<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>fendant is involved, to a prayer for a decree affecting onty the property in question.
