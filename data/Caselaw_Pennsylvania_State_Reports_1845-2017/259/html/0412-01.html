They are not presented, it being stated that they had been adjusted by various credits; they were explained at the audit, but still seem to be in the possession of the claimant.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[244,649,1159,1738]],["BL_451.1",451,[148,321,1145,98]]]'>Evidently, the gold mining venture was not a success, and in the fall of 1903 a- reorganization was effected including the three parties named and other stockholder’s who got stock of the new company to the amount represented by their original investments. This reorganization involved the payment of the debts by the stockholders who continued. Thompson paid the shares of Moore and Montgomery, and in the fall of 1903 it was agreed between them that Moore and Montgomery each owed Thompson $5,896.00 for their shares of the debts that he had paid for them. Montgomery seemed to have been the secretary or party who kept record of the calculations in arriving at the foregoing amounts and to have thereafter continued in that capacity, but no written evidences are found among his papers. Moore recognized, and still recognizes, his individual debt in the foregoing amount, to Thompson, and has been reducing it. What the amount may be that he still owes, is not before, this court, nor is it material. He says that his understanding is that Montgomery, continued to recognize the debt; that he and Thompson had other transactions which were adjusted in his, Moore’s, office, and that various checks and receipts passed between them; he says that shortly before Montgomery died he stated that he would like to sell some real estate and settle with Thompson; but he is not able to state, nor does it appear in evidence, that the settlement he contemplated was on the other transactions between them or on the three thousand dollar note, which he then still clearly owed to Thompson, or to the adjustment of the other note in the same amount that the parties had carried between themselves in the Oakland Savings &amp; Trust Company, or <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>whether the settlement included, and was intended to be, a recognition of the open, general claim of $5,896.00.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[147,430,1149,701]]]'>It appears that in October, 1915, Montgomery, the decedent, gave Thompson a check for two thousand dollars ; neither the check nor the stub showed for what it was given; Thompson has given credit for one-half of this payment on account of said note, crediting the balance on his general claim of $5,896.00; there is no evidence that he told Montgomery how he would apply this credit or that Montgomery gave the check or any part thereof in recognition of the other debt, or knew that it was so applied; so far as the evidence indicates it was the self-serving voluntary application by the creditor of this check upon what he held to be two obligations to be due to him from Thompson.</p>

There is no evidence of any. agreement between the administrator or Thompson as to what indebtedness was to be credited with this amount.</p>

The large claim in question depends wfiolly upon the alleged adjustment between the parties fixing a debt in 1904, and Mr. Moore’s testimony is that these parties met continuously, discussed their mining transactions and other transactions, adjusted differences between themselves, and while he says Montgomery paid interest on this claim, it appears, if it was paid, that Thompson allows no credit therefor, and thus repudiates the payment of interest thereon,</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b452-4" data-blocks='[["BL_452.3",452,[251,310,1150,1871]]]'>
      <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>The defense to the claim is, first, lack of sufficient evidence to establish it clearly, and, second, the bar of the statute, even if it did exist in 1904. As indicated before, the evidence is sufficient to establish the fact of a recognized indebtedness by Montgomery to Thompson in January, 1904, or the latter part of December, 1903, of $5,896.00. From that time on, there is no clear proof of the recognition of this particular claim by Montgomery, of his promise to pay it, or any interest paid thereon, or any credits allowed for a period far exceeding the statutory limitation of six years, other than the voluntary credit made by Thompson in 1915, and this without any evidence of notice to, or agreement by, Montgomery that it should be applied as a credit on the original debt and involving an acknowledgment of the debt. There is no evidence of a direct, clear and unequivocal promise, express or implied, from Montgomery to Thompson, or to Thompson’s duly accredited agent, of his liability for or indebtedness to, Thompson, coupled with a promise to pay made at any time. The fact that Moore recognized his original indebtedness to Thompson and acknowledges he still owes Thompson on account thereof, and that he believes that Montgomery is indebted to Thompson on a like claim, is not sufficient to bring this testimony within the strict standard of testimony which must be clearly established to avoid the bar of the statute. In view of the fact that Moore testifies that these men had many other dealings, some of which have been brought into this case, and others of an outside character, involving monetary transactions between them, the evidence is of a very doubtful character upon which to find as a fact that these transactions were in connection with, an acknowledgment of, and promise to pay, this distinct old debt dating from 1904.</p>

Here, as there, Thompson had abundant opportunity to enforce his demand against Montgomery, who evidently had become a man of means, with whom he was in constant communication and had many business transactions, and from whom he took an acknowledgment in writing of a debt in every other case. It was easy, prudent and vitally essential that the claimant in this case should have better evidences of the alleged indebtedness which he should have acquired with diligence while the alleged debtor was living, and not wait until his lips are sealed in death.</p>
