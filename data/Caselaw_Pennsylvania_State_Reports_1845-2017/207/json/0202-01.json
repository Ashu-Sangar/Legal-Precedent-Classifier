This they entirely failed to do. As said by the learned judge below, the only item disputed was the final shipment, and on that the defendants might have been entitled to go to a jury, but as the preceding items, practically admitted, were sufficient to authorize judgment for the full amount of the bond, this last item became immaterial.\nJudgment affirmed.",
