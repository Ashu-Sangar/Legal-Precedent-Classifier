T., 1903, by William Kraus, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co. Sept. T., 1902, No. 4, dismissing petition for partition.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Dean, Fell, Brown, Mestrezat and Potter, JJ.,\nAffirmed.\nPetition for partition of real estate.\nOver, J., filed the following opinion :\nThis is a petition filed by the children of Elizabeth Kraus, a deceased daughter of George Vilsack, deceased, praying for a partition of the real estate devised by him as follows :\n\u201c I give and bequeath to my beloved wife, Katherine, all my real and personal estate during her natural life, and at her death, I give the proceeds or interest thereon to my sons, George and Siebol, and my daughters, Elizabeth and Catherine, during their natural lives, share and share alike, and after the death of either of the above named sons or daughters I give and bequeath to their child or children (should they leave any children at their death) the share held by my sons and daughters at the time of his or her death, but should neither of my sons or daughters leave no heirs, then their share is to be divided between all of my grandchildren share and share alike.\u201d\nThe widow died October 21, 1886, and. Elizabeth Kraus, testator\u2019s daughter, October 20, 1897. All of the other sons and daughters of the testator are still living. The question raised by the petition and answer is whether the children of testator take an estate in fee. After the death of his wife he gave his estate to his sons and daughters during their natural lives, and after their death to their children, should they leave any. Had he stopped here, there could be no question that the word \u201c children \u201d was used in its ordinary sense as a word of purchas\u00e9, and that his sons and daughters only took a life estate ; but if any of them left no children, there would be intestacy as to this share. This, however, does not seem to have been his intention, as he next provided that if any of his sons or daughters left no heirs, their share was to be divided share and share alike between all of his grandchildren. If the word \u201c heirs \u201d here means children alone, and a son or daughter died, leaving no children, but grandchildren, such grandchildren, being the great-grandchildren of the testator, would be disinherited, as grandchildren do not take under a devise to children: Gable\u2019s App., 40 Pa. 231. In doubtful cases such a construction should be adopted as would distribute the estate as nearly as possible according to the intestate laws, the word \u201c heirs \u201d we think therefore should not be construed as synonymous with \u201c children.\u201d That it was not used in its general sense is evident from the fact that the limitation over is to testator\u2019s grandchildren, who would be the collateral heirs of a deceased grandchild not leaving lineal heirs. It seems then that the testator intended here to limit the estate given to his children to their lineal heirs, or issue, which shows also his intention to use the word \u201c children \u201d in its comprehensive and extended sense, meaning issue or heirs of the body. If this construction be correct the gift then is to his children for life with remainder to the heirs of their bodies or their issue, which vested in the children a fee tail, enlarged by the act of assembly into a fee simple. Another reason- for so construing this will, is, if the limitation is to grandchildren as such, and none of his sons or daughters left children there would be intestacy, which is to be avoided if possible. This construction is supported by the following eases: Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, where the words \u201c child or children \u201d were held to be used in the sense of issue of heirs of the body; Brinton v. Martin, 197 Pa. 615; Potts v. Kline, 174 Pa. 513; Yarnall\u2019s App., .70 Pa. 335; Sheeley v. Niedhammer, 182 Pa. 163.\nAlthough the gift to the testator\u2019s sons and daughters is the proceeds or interest of his estate, yet as his intention seems to have been to give the proceeds or interest to them forever, it is equivalent to a devise of the fee: Haldeman v. Haldeman, supra; Saxton v. Mitchell, 78 Pa. 479.\nAs the testator\u2019s sons and daughters took the fee under his will and have made an amicable partition of the land devised to them, this petition must be dismissed.\nError assigned was the decree dismissing the petition.\nO. W. Reamer. with him D. M. Miller, for appellant.\nThe authorities are uniform that \u201c children \u201d is as certainly a word of purchase as \u201c heirs \u201d or \u201c heirs of the body \u201d or \u201c issue \u201d are words of limitation: Guthrie\u2019s App., 37 Pa. 9; Oyster v. Oyster, 100 Pa. 538; Wall v. Maguire, 24 Pa. 248; Curtis v. Longstreth, 44 Pa. 297 ; Sheets\u2019s Estate, 52 Pa. 257 ; Mannerback\u2019s Estate, 133 Pa. 342.\nJ. It. Ritchey,with him D. S. McCann, for appellee.\nThe word \u201c children \u201d has been in repeated cases held a word of limitation\u2014equivalent to \u201c heirs\u2022 Haldeman v. Halderman, 40 Pa. 29 ; Saxton v. Mitchell, 78 Pa. 479 ; 3 Jarman on Wills, page 34; Hance v. West, 32 N. J. L. 233 ; Criswell\u2019s App., 41 Pa. 288; Pifer v. Locke, 205 Pa. 616 ; Simpson v. Reed, 205 Pa. 53; Brinton v.
