The whole of the fund was subscribed for, but about a quarter of it was never paid. After the subscriptions had been made and turned over to the trustees, the trustees established the permanent location of the college in the borough. The land was conveyed to the trustees. About thirty years afterwards the trustees voted to remove the college to another <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>town.

At the date of the passage of the act of incorporation, it was known as Thiel Hall, and was temporarily located at Phillipsburg, Beaver county, Pennsylvania.

As a means of inducing the said trustees to permanently locate the college in Greenville, the citizens proposed to contribute five acres of land and $20,000 toward furnishing a site and erecting buildings for the permanent use of said college. The citizens finally succeeded in securing the land and subscriptions, and by an agreement made between a committee representing the citizens and a committee appointed by and representing the trustees, the land and subscriptions were turned over by the <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>citizens’ committee and accepted by the trustees’ committee. At the time the subscriptions were turned over to the trustees’ committee, it was believed by both committees that the subscriptions to the said fund were solvent and the amount subscribed by each subscriber collectible. Many of the subscriptions were made and subsequently paid by the subscribers to a committee representing the trustees on the express representations made by the committee appointed by the trustees to negotiate with the citizens, that the intention of the trustee was to permanently locate the college in Greenville, if the citizens donated the land and subscribed the 120,000.</p>

In said report the resolution aforesaid, adopted by the board of trustees, February 19, 1872, was incorporated. The synod received the said report and referred the same to a special committee, which committee reported the action of the trustees as embraced in the resolution of February 19, 1872, and recommended that the said action be approved by the said synod.
