It was made to her doubtless because she occupied this relation to the estate, and the words administratrix, etc., at least suggest that she does not hold in her own right. Certainly that would be the suggestion to the owners here. Besides, the <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>question here is of notice by a writ; and a writ against an administratrix, even when the question of charging real estate is concerned, is very different from a writ against one personally. The usefulness of this very just and useful registry act would be destroyed if in its application a rule were adopted which left the effect of a sale uncertain. It is to the interest of the city as well as the property owner that there should be no doubt as to the effect of the sale. It calls for at least as much certainty as the matter of the lien of a judgment. It would be difficult to lay down a rule that would even approach certainty, if we draw the line outside of the present variation. There may be, of course, variations so trivial that they will mislead no one, and hence will not affect the title of the purchaser. But the present is not of that class. It is certainly not unreasonable to expect the city to follow her own records with care and accuracy.</p>

In the case of a sale of Pitts-burg property for taxes, every careful bidder would undoubtedly compare the name given in the sci. fa. with that upon the registry, and it is pretty certain that a variation such as the present one would drive off all but speculative bidders.</p>
