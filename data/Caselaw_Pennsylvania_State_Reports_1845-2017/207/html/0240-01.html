We do not propose to review them nor even to cite them, but will simply suggest a few principles which we think are in accord with all of these cases, and which fully warrant the interpretation which we put upon the contract, with respect to who is the responsible party of the second part.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[302,725,1183,770]]]'>Justice Swayne says, in Whitney v. Wyman, 101 D. S. 892, that there is a broad distinction in this case between instruments under seal and those not under seal. That in the former case the contract must be in the name of the principal and must purport to be his deed and not the deed of the agent covenanting for him; while in the latter case it is always one of intent, and the court being untrammeled by other considerations' is bound to give it effect. This probably means that when the instrument is sealed the intent as to whose contract it is, is shown by the seal affixed, and thus is explained the great significance given to the seal in some of the old cases. This, however, does not affect the present case, as the instrument is not under seal,—at all events it does not affect our conclusion, as there is nowhere a suggestion that there ever was any intention of attaching to it the seal of the corporation.</p>

Geary certainly intended himself to pay the seventy-five per <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>cent monthly on the estimates. The affidavit of defense says that the company was incorporated before the bridge was completed, but it does not say that it was incorporated before October 1, 1901, when, by the contract, it was to be completed. It is just as clear that there is no provision for a substitution of responsibility.</p>
