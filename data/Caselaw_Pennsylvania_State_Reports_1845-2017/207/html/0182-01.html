Ellen Chadwick went into possession of the lot.and paid on the article the sum of $65.00. Early in 1894, the improvement company, with consent of Ellen Chadwick, forfeited the agreement and substituted therein John Thomas Chadwick, the defendant. The latter paid his mother the $65.00, which she had paid on account of the purchase money, and paid the balance of the purchase money in full to the improvement company, in January, 1896. A deed to Thomas Chadwick was made bearing date July 11, 1894, and the same was duly recorded July 27, 1894. A judgment was recovered against Ellen Chadwick on June 3, 1896, and her interest in this lot was sold by the sheriff November 13, 1897, to Mary E. Kuder, the plaintiff, and this action was brought to recover possession.</p>

On the authority of Casey v. Penna.

Such a reservation has a double advantage. It gives the court <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>a better chance to examine the questions of law than is afforded in the hurry of a trial, and it will operate to save retrials, if not to discourage appeals. In this form, it is often equivalent to a request for binding instruction, but has the advantage that even where error exists, a right judgment can be entered without a new trial.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[280,651,1178,870]]]'>The good faith of the transaction is not questioned. It was averred in plaintiff’s abstract that “ the said Ellen Chadwick and the defendant either fraudulently or by accident and mistake caused and procured the Kensington Improvement Company to convey said legal title to said defendant.” At the trial, the averment of fraud was eliminated and there was no attempt to show fraud on part of Ellen Chadwick and the defendant. The equity of the case is with the defendant. He paid in good faith a full consideration for the lot and for the improvements. It also appeared that he paid off a mortgage, which had been mistakenly entered on another lot owned by Ellen Chadwick, and for which there was, perhaps, no legal liability on defendant’s part to pay. The plaintiff, who was the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, had record notice that the legal title was in Thomas Chadwick, as the deed to the latter had been recorded long before the sheriff’s sale. Thomas Chadwick was also in possession of the property at that time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.6",214,[278,1529,1178,872]],["BL_215.1",215,[151,346,1185,1795]]]'>Now, with notice to the purchaser, with a strong equity in defendant and with the bona ñdes of the transfer to Thomas Chadwick not disputed, upon what ground rests the plaintiff’s right to recover ? The position is taken that the Kensington Improvement Company had no right to declare a forfeiture of the contract, even with the consent of Ellen Chadwick, the vendee; that her equitable estate still remained and was seized and sold by the sheriff. Many cases were cited on both sides on the subject of forfeiture. To attempt to review these would serve no good purpose. It is plain, however, from an examination of the cases that, as a general rule, courts both of law and equity lean against a forfeiture. Nor will a forfeiture be permitted where it works an injustice. But notwithstanding these general rules, there are many instances of forfeited contracts, where it appears that it was contemplated by the stipulation of the parties. The article of agreement contained a clause authorizing the improvement company to declare the <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>same forfeited in default of payments. Tlie improvement company did undertake to forfeit. Notice was given to the vendee, who appeared and consented to a rescission of the contract. She received back the portion of the consideration money she had paid, and the purchaser of the legal title received a deed and paid the purchase money in full. Here was a forfeiture in fact by agreement of all the parties in interest. The old agreement was rescinded; the vendee under it received back the money she had paid and a new contract was entered into with Thomas Chadwick. Whether under the terms of the original contract, the courts would have decreed a forfeiture against the protest of Ellen Chadwick, it is not important to determine. It seems plain, under the authorities, that a creditor of Ellen Chadwick would not be in a position to interfere with the arrangement made, unless it could be shown that such arrangement was fraudulent and made for the purpose of defeating the creditor. The plaintiff became a judgment creditor of Ellen Chadwick June 3, 1896, but this was nearly two years after the deed to defendant had been recorded. As a purchaser at sheriff’s sale, the plaintiff had record notice that the legal title was in the defendant and she was put on inquiry by the fact that the defendant was also in possession of the property. We think the parties to the original agreement had a right to terminate it. The purpose, as is conceded, was not fraudulent and no creditor therefore has a right to complain. The only standing the plaintiff can have is as a purchaser at the sheriff’s sale. But defendant at "that time was in possession of the property and his deed therefore was on record, and plaintiff therefore had notice of the actual condition of affairs. To permit plaintiff now to recover would work great injustice to defendant, who acted in good faith and who did all that the law required him to do. As we understand it, there is no rule of law which requires us to take such view, and for the foregoing reason judgment on the question reserved is entered in favor of defendant.</p>
