Bartholic. That after the death of testator, Jonathan W. Bartholic took possession of lots Nos. 9 and 10, and subsequently conveyed the same in fee simple to plaintiff’s predecessors in title ; that the same, by subsequent transfers, became vested in the plaintiff, John Dougherty, who, by articles of agreement, agreed to sell and convey the same to the defendant, John G. Wellinger, for the price or sum of $1,600; that a deed was tendered by plaintiff to the defendant for the property, which defendant refused to accept, alleging as a reason for his refusal that the devise by Joshua T. Bartholic to Jonathan W. Bartholic was for life only, and that plaintiff was unable to convey a fee simple title to the defendant. It was further agreed that if the court should be of opinion that the devise by the will of Joshua T. Bartholic of lots Nos. 9 and 10 to his son, Jonathan W. Bartholic, was a devise in fee simple, judgment was to be entered in favor of plaintiff and against the defendant for the sum of $1,600 and costs ; if of the opinion that Jonathan W. Bartholic took but a life estate in the property, then judgment to be entered for the defendant with costs. It seems clear to us that Jonathan W. Bartholic acquired a fee simple title to the property, and that it- was the intention of the testator that he should take such title. As we understand the facts set forth' in the case stated, the clause above quoted, which occurs only in the original will of November 21, <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>1889, applies solely to real estate devised in that will and does not apply to the devises made in the subsequent codicils. In no other part of the will, nor in any of the codicils are similar words to be found, nor any words indicating an intention upon the part of the testator that the condition imposed by that clause quoted should apply to devises made in the codicils. On the contrary a careful reading of the codicils indicates an intention upon the part of the testator to devise the real estate not included in the original will, and especially that divided into lots, free from the effect of the condition in the original will above quoted. Being of the opinion that Jonathan W. Bartholic took a fee simple estate in lots 9 and 10 under the codicil of April 27, 1888, it is ordered that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $1,600 with costs of suit.</p>
