Such combination is a despotic and tyrannical violation of the indefeasible right of labor to acquire property which courts are bound to restrain. It is utterly subversive of the letter and spirit of the declarations of rights.

The portions of this instrument which have special bearing upon the case at bar are set out in the following extracts: The preamble recites that “ the ownership and management of all industry is being placed on an organized basis, to the end that competition shall be replaced by unity of action,” and declares, among other things, that “it behooves us as intelligent men to more thoroughly organize the ‘ workman ’ who makes the profits of all industry possible. Each union in a city should be allied with the other in the Central Council and following this to its logical end, each central council of every city should be allied with the other in such a manner as would grant to each city or locality the right of local autonomy with the allied support of the entire world.” “We earnestly invite all organizations of workmen engaged in the building trades to join us in our efforts to build a permanent edifice until there shall be no man working in the building trades that does not own allegiance to the council of the allied building trades of Philadelphia and vicinity.” By article VII of the constitution the president is required, with the consent of the council, to appoint certain standing committees, among them an “organization committee of ten members.” Article VIII prescribes the duties of committees, and section 3 is as follows: “ The organization committee shall endeavor to organize any building trade that is not organized; they shall endeavor to get all building trades unions not affiliated with this council to affiliate with same,” etc. Article XVI on “ Trade Rules ” contains the following sections: “ Section 1. It shall be the special duty of this council to use the united strength of all trades represented herein to induce all non-union men to conform to and obey the laws of the organization to which they should properly belong.” “ Section 3. Any organization that is not represented in this council shall not be protected on any building or job until affiliated with this body except by unanimous consent of the council.” Article IX establishes “ an executive board, composed of the properly elected business agents of the various organizations affiliated with this council.” By section 5 of the same article, “the executive board shall be empowered to act on all occasions on behalf of the council and to deal with all emergencies that may arise in the interim between meetings.” Article XIII, sec<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>tion 2, provides: “ When any trouble occurs on any building or job affecting any organization represented in this council, it shall be the duty of the business agent of said organization to immediately endeavor to settle same with the contractor or owner in accordance with the trade rules and to the satisfaction of the organization involved. Failing in this the business agent shall have power to call said strike. If the aforesaid strike is liable to become general, he shall then lay the matter before the executive board at its next meeting and be governed by their action or decision, which shall be equally binding on all organizations in this council engaged on the job or building.” Section 2 of article XI, as amended, provides: “ The funds for the maintenance and expenses of this council shall be raised from the revenue obtained by issuing quarterly working cards at ten cents per card.”</p>

In the early part of the month of April, 1901, a large building, known as the “ Mariner and Merchant Building,” was in course of erection at the southwest corner of Third and Chestnut streets in the city of Philadelphia. The firm of W. A. &amp; A. E. Wells had the general contract for the erection of the building; Hoban &amp; Doyle, master plumbers and gasfitters, were subcontractors for the plumbing and gasfitting. The plaintiffs were employed by Hoban &amp; Doyle as journeymen and were at that time actually at work upon the plumbing and gasfitting at the building. Their work was entirely satisfactory to their employers and also to the general contractors. None of the defendants were employed about the building.</p>

The plaintiffs, who were the only plumbers at that time working at the building, were also without the quarterly card. At a meeting of the executive board of the Allied Trades, the date of which does not appear in evidence, a strike was ordered of the workmen engaged at the building in affiliation with the association, the reason assigned for which was the employment there of the nonunion electricians, painters, steamfitters, helpers, and the plumbers, the present plaintiffs; that is, of mechanics who did not carry the Allied Trades’ working cards. The strike, according to the testimony, went into effect about two weeks prior to April 23, 1901, “on a Friday,” and two thirds of the mechanics employed about the building ceased working there upon and after that day. The defendants, -prior to this strike, had tried to induce plaintiffs to join with them, and plaintiffs had refused.</p>

From the facts found by the court below it appears that plaintiffs are journeymen plumbers, residents of Philadelphia, and members of an incorporated society chartered by act of assembly under the name of “ The Plumbers’ League of the City of Philadelphia.” The defendants are members of an unincorporated association known as “ The Council of Allied Building Trades of Philadelphia and Vicinity.” Tins association is composed of delegates from different, separate and subordinate building trade unions in the city. Its theory of organization is, that there should be an affiliation of all trades unions throughout the city and the world, to the end that “ competition shall be replaced by unity of action,” and that workmen who make the profits of all industry possible should, as intelligent men, move and organize. The scope of their organization is indicated by this invitation: “We earnestly invite all organizations of workmen engaged in the building trades to join us in our perma<a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>nent efforts to build a permanent edifice until there shall be no man in working trades that does not own allegiance to the Council of the Allied Building Trades of the City of Philadelphia.” The Plumbers’ League of Philadelphia, to which plaintiffs belonged, did not accept this invitation; it never became a member of the Allied Building Trades Council.</p>

A. &amp; E. A. Wells; under them as subcontractors for the plumbing and gas fitting were Hoban &amp; Doyle; the latter were the employers of plaintiffs who were journeymen plumbers ; no one of defendants Avas employed on or about the building. At the same time there were a number of other workmen employed on the building engaged in other trades, such as steam fitters, painters, etc., who Avere nonunion men. While the work was thus progressing the Council of the Allied Building Trades ordered a strike of all workmen engaged at the building who were affiliated with the council. The reason given for ordering the strike was, that workmen were employed on the building Avho were nonunion men, and plumbers belonging to a society not affiliated with the Council of Allied Trades'. Previous to the strike, defendants had tried to induce plaintiffs to join them, but plaintiffs had refused. Under the strike order two thirds of the men then employed on the building quit work. While the strike was on, defendants called upon the manager for the general contractors and told him, that if plaintiffs were removed the strike Avould be called off; the result was a writing, whereby it was agreed, that if plumbers of the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers and all other Avorkmen on the building had in their possession the working cards of their respective unions for the current quarter, no other strike would be declared until the completion of the building. This was signed by the general contractors and the representatives of the Allied Building Trades. The members of the United Association of Plumbers, authorized'to work, were members of an association affiliated with the Council of the Allied Building Trades. The contractors carried out their agreement and discharged $ie plaintiffs from work on that building; then the strike was declared off. <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>Other workmen on the building, although nonunion men, were not discharged and continued work. About this time, representatives of the Plumbers’ League, to which plaintiffs belonged, had an interview with Mitchell, one of the defendants, and secretary of the Council of the Allied Trades, and Mitchell informed them that the Allied Trades intended to pursue the same course in future, and to drive every plumber in Philadelphia into the United Association of Journeymen Plumbers, one of the Allied Trades. By this conduct of defendants, plaintiffs have been unable to secure any steady employment at their trade, and will have to enter one of defendants’ unions or leave the city.</p>
    <p id="b119-4" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[163,981,1181,873]]]'>The court below was of opinion, that in so far as defendants, in furtherance of the purposes of the Council of the Allied Building Trades, undertook, by intimidation of plaintiffs and their employers to coerce the plaintiffs into joining their organization or any particular organization, and by such* action caused the workmen to suffer damage, such action was unlawful and ought to be restrained by equity. This conclusion is correct. This is not an indictment for a statutory offense nor for a common-law conspiracy, which last the legislature by acts of 1872, 1876 and 1891 has practically abolished ; it is a suit in equity to restrain an unlawful act. It is argued by appellees’ counsel, that an act may be clearly unlawful although not the subject of criminal prosecution; that an agreement by a number of persons that they will by threats of a strike deprive a mechanic of the right to work for others merely because he does not choose to join a particular union, is a conspiracy to commit an unlawful act, which conspiracy may be restrained.</p>

But it is manifest, from the findings of fact and the testimony, that defendants went far beyond this. The contractors undertook the erection of a large and expensive building; they employed a large number of men skilled in all branches of the building trades, a majority of whom were members of defendants’ <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>union. No notice was given by the organization to the contractors that their members would not be permitted to work on the same building with members of plaintiffs’ union or with nonunion men; after the building had progressed until it had reached what may be called its critical stage, a strike was ordered of all the workmen affiliated with defendants’ union and two thirds of all at work quit. After the strike, negotiations for calling it off were opened between the manager for the contractors and defendants, and the result was the agreement with their union heretofore noticed; then followed the discharge of plaintiffs from work on that building and then an interview between the president of plaintiffs’ union and the secretary of defendants’; the latter told the president that the Allied Trades intended to pursue the same course as at the Mariner and Merchant Building on every building in the city, for the purpose of driving every plumber into a union affiliated with the Allied Trades. This evidence would have established a criminal conspiracy at common law; concede, that it would not, under our present legislation, now establish it, nevertheless it is still an unlawful act. There was no complaint as to wages by any of the workmen on the building when the strike was declared; all wanted to work and their employers wanted them to work. But these defendants who did not work on the building had a grievance; plaintiffs refused to and would not join defendants’ union; they must be driven to joining it by threats of loss of work, and their employers must be compelled to aid defendants by threats of loss of money on their contract.</p>
    <p id="b120-5" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[272,1793,1178,398]]]'>This is so plain that it is waste of time to more than state the facts to convince that the conduct of defendants was calculated to intimidate both employees and employers, and consequently was unlawful. The frightened employers, to avoid further loss yielded; the plaintiffs did not yield, and to prevent further intimidation of those who would otherwise employ them, they seek by this suit to restrain defendants from future acts of intimidation.</p>

Where-ever a court of common pleas can be reached by the citizen, these great and essential principles of free government must be recognized and vindicated by that court, and the indefeasible right of liberty and the right to acquire property must be protected under the common-law judicial power of the court. Nor does it need statutory authority to frame its decrees or statutory process to enforce them against the violators of constitutional rights.</p>

This right of acquiring property is an inherent indefeasible right of the workman <em>; </em>to exercise it he must have the unrestricted privilege of working for such employer as he chooses at such wages as he chooses to accept. This is one of the rights guaranteed him by our “ Declaration of Rights; ” it is a right of which the legislature cannot deprive him, one which the law of no trades union can take from him, and one which it is the bounden duty of the courts to protect. The one most concerned in jealously maintaining this freedom is the workman himself.</p>

It* is unlawful to deprive a mechanic or workmen of work by forc.eA threats or intimidation of any kind; a combination of two or <em>j </em>more to do the same thing by the same means is a conspiracy. Jf That by the legislation referred to such conspiracy is no longer y criminal, does not render it lawful. At common law the courts t' held that such combination was so prejudicial to the public in<a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>terests and so opposed to public policy as rendered it punishable criminally; but the legislature, which generally determines-what is and what is not public policy, has declared, that it is no longer a crime or misdemeanor But this is as far as it has gone, it is as far as it could go without abolishing the Declaration of Rights; to do that the whole people of the commonwealth must be directly consulted and they must give assent. For while the plain implication from the declaration is that the power to limit this indefeasible right rests solely with the people, yet when they adopted the constitution of 1874, with an extreme of caution they expressly said, “ Everything in this article is excepted out of the general powers of governmént and shall forever remain inviolate.” That is, shall forever remain with the people; they will not trust their own legislature with power to minimize or fritter it away, much less a trades union. If the legislature to-day abolished indictment for wilful and malicious trespass, or abolished the writ of estrepement, to-morrow courts of equity would still be bound under the Declaration of Rights to protect the citizen in the peaceable possession and enjoyment of his land, even if to do so they were compelled to imprison the lawless trespasser who refused to obey their writs. So the*1 same courts are still bound to protect the humblest mechanic or laborer in his right to acquire property. <em>0</em>

Such combination is a despotic and tyrannical violation of the indefeasible right of labor to acquire property which courts are bound to restrain. It is utterly subversive of the letter and spirit of the Declaration of Rights. If such combination be in accord with the law of the trades union, then that law and the organic law of the people of a free commonwealth cannot stand together; one or the other must go down.</p>

It is not important that apt language precisely expressing the threat should have been used; the meaning of their declarations and acts was well understood by all parties. The men lost their work; the em- , ployers after á damaging stoppage were permitted to proceed because they yielded to the threat, that is, they were intimidated because they feared further loss. How absurd it is to call this peaceable persuasion, and how absurd to argue that if the law attempts to prevent it the right of the workmen to organize for their common benefit is frustrated. And then, what about the right of the Plumbers’ League to organize for the common benefit of its members of whom the plaintiffs are a part ? The declared purpose of the Allied Trades is by these ”j acts to absorb this union and thereby destroy it. Under no J possible view of the conduct of defendants was it lawful.

It is true they committed no acts of personal violence or physical injury to property, although they threatened to do something which might reasonably be expected *to lead to such results. In their threat however, there was « plainly that which was coercive in its effort upon the will. It is not necessary that the liberty of the body should be restrained.
