Whether there is a merger or not is a question of intention. Tlius where one of two co-owners of real estate pays off a joint mortgage given by himself and the other owner, and takes an assignment of the mortgage to himself, and subsequently conveys his interest subject to the mortgage, it will be presumed that it was the intention of such person to preserve the lien of the mortgage, and not merge it with the fee.</p>

On December 18, 1872, Simpson paid the mortgage of himself and Pentecost to Shepherd and took an assignment thereof from the mortgagee. Pentecost and Simpson each conveyed his undivided half in the said premises and finally on January 20,1874, the entire title became vested in William Burns, who on June 28, 1875, conveyed the undivided one half interest to Samuel Reynolds, the father of the present plaintiffs. All these conveyances were made subject to the mortgage of Pentecost and Simpson to Shepherd.</p>

      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>The first question that presents itself for our consideration is: Was there a merger of the mortgage with the fee on the payment by Simpson to Shepherd of the amount of the mortgage, and the taking of the assignment of the same by him ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[309,567,1179,1082]]]'>Usually the merger of a lien with the fee is a matter of intention, and if it be to the interest of the person holding the fee to preserve the lien of the incumbrance in order to protect any interests which he may have, the law will not require that the lien of the incumbrance be merged in the fee. In a stated case like this, of course, it was not possible that the parties should agree in so many words as to what the intention of Simpson was, and unless his intention in the matter is a conclusion of law, the coqrt cannot find what his intention was, from the facts agreed upon.. But we are inclined to think that his intentions do necessarily follow from his acts. In Moore v. Harrisburg Bank, <a href="/watts/8/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts 188" data-case-ids="1848388" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0188-01">8 Watts, 188</a>, in a case very similar to this the court has said : <em>“A </em>mortgage does not necessarily merge or become extinct by being united in the same person with the fee, but on the contrary, when it is the intention of the parties that it should not merge but continue to subsist for the protection of the owner of the fee from subsequent incumbrances, he may keep it on foot, sue out the scire facias upon it in the name of the mortgagee against the mortgagor with notice to himself, obtain a judgment and sell the estate mortgaged.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[308,1656,1179,707]]]'>It was just as much to the interest of Simpson to keep this mortgage alive in order that he might have security for the payment of the one half of the mortgage by Pentecost as it was in the case cited in order to protect the holder of the fee from a junior incumbrance. All his acts, in taking the assignment, in conveying his interests subject to the mortgage, indicate that it was his intention to preserve the lien of the mortgage and not to merge it with the fee. Simpson paid and took the assignment of this mortgage in 1872, sold his interest in 1874, and at that time sold it subject to the lien of this mortgage. Burn, in selling to Reynolds, sold subject to the lien of this mortgage. It was clearly the intention of all the parties connected with the transaction that the lien of that mortgage should remain.</p>

A satisfaction is prima facie evidence of payment, but is not conclusive. It may be shown upon the trial of a case that the satisfaction was made by mistake, or through misrepresentation or fraud, and the mortgagee or assignee satisfying a mortgage under such circumstances would not be bound by the satisfaction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[121,679,1183,1640]]]'>The plaintiffs in this case were served as terre-tenants on the issuing of the scire facias on the said mortgage. They could then have defended, alleging the payment of the mortgage, if it had been paid, and if they could substantiate that fact, could have prevented judgment being taken, but they did not defend. They permitted judgment to go by default. The property was sold on that judgment and is now in the hands of innocent purchasers, and that judgment should be conclusive against these plaintiffs on the question of the payment of that mortgage. The purchasers from Simpson had a right to assume that the terre-tenants knew that satisfaction was entered by mistake, and that they could not successfully defend against the scire facias. We have a right to assume that if they had any claim that the mortgage had been paid, they would have made that claim in answer to the scire facias. The judgment on the scire facias was conclusive on the question of the payment of the mortgage against all persons served either as defendants or terre-tenants. In Irwin v. Nixon, <a href="/pa/11/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="404646" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0419-01">11 Pa. 419</a>, the court went much further than it is necessary to go in this case in order to sustain the conclusiveness of the judgment of the scire facias on the mortgage. In that case, in 1808, a judgment was obtained against William Nixon, and in 1809 an execution was issued and returned “ Money made,” and paid to the plaintiff. In 1814 Nixon died. In 1815 the plaintiff in the judgment entered satisfaction on the appearance docket. In 1827 an attorney issued a scire facias to revive the. original judgment against the administrators of Nixon, and an attorney assuming to appear for the administrator appeared and confessed judgment, execution was issued, levy made upon the land, and the same was sold to Samuel Kingston, the attorney for plaintiff, who sold to the defendant.</p>

But the Supreme Court sustained the judgment on the scire facias as <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>conclusive of the nonpayment of the original judgment. In that case the return of the sheriff was conclusive of payment, while in this the receipt on the margin of the record is only prima facie. If that judgment was conclusive against the heirs of the defendant, much more would this one be.</p>

In that case Boyer became.the owner of the fee on which his judgment was a lien.
