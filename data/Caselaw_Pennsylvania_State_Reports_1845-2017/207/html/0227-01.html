Other persons were also admitted as partners who had not been members of the partnership with any of the retiring partners. Some of the retiring partners had been compelled to pay judgments recovered against the partnership on claims incurred while they had been partners. The bank was finally dissolved and creditors all paid, leaving a balance for distribution. <em>Held, </em>that former partners who had paid claims were not entitled to have such claims paid out of the assets for distribution.</p>

This claim consists of two classes, (1) A number of former partners of the bank were compelled, by judgments recovered against them, or upon claims upon which no defense could be made, to pay claims against the bank for deposits, while they had been partners or for deposits made by customers who had no notice that these partners had sold their interest in the bank, aggregating $4,281.90; (2) the second class is a claim paid by these same former partners to the city of Pitts-burg. The city had brought suit at No. 711, March term, 1878, for a balance of deposit, $41,530.16, with interest, against the entire membership of the bank, including those who had from time to time sold their interest therein. The members filed defenses and the case was referred to B. B. Carnahan as referee under the act of May 14, 1874. Before any action was taken before the referee those same former partners paid to the city the sum of $17,092.63 in settlement of the claim.</p>
