    <p id="b250-6" data-blocks='[["BL_250.8",250,[299,667,1178,508]]]'>The will of testator placed the bequest to his daughter in trust- for her, the trust to end in the event of the husband’s death before hers ; that event did not occur, but the marriage relation was dissolved by a decree in divorce. Evidently, the sole purpose of the trust was to protect her estate from the husband Jacob E. Blackmore; the law has severed the matrimonial bond as effectually as death could have done; therefore, the sole purpose of the trust being atan end, the daughter is entitled to the estate. So the court below on the authority of Koenig’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/57/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="57 Pa. 352" data-case-ids="1010446" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0352-01">57 Pa. 352</a>, rightly decided.</p>
