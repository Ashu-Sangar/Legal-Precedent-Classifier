The common source of title is admitted to be Jane B. Finlay. The plaintiff claims under the will of said Jane B.

Linton and Adolphus Frederick Linton taken on a rule to take testimony, to show that the deeds of May 22,1874, and November 9, 1874, had never been delivered. This so-called evidence was mere rambling statements of the plaintiff and her husband, reciting declarations made by John B. Finlay, the father of the plaintiff, not in the presence of the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b220-8" data-blocks='[["BL_220.8",220,[282,1381,1181,302]]]'>When we consider that this is an attempt by the plaintiff through her trustee to invalidate and overthrow her own deeds, twenty-eight years after they had been made, and twelve years after the title had passed into the hands of a bona fide purchaser for value, we cannot help but express our surprise that the plaintiff could hope to recover upon such flimsy evidence.</p>

Before he can be deprived of his property the facts which avoid his title must be proved by the grantor by the most unexceptionable testimony. If there is at the time of the executing the deeds, no delivery or intention to deliver, these are facts that should be explicitly proved by the grantor:” Blight v.
