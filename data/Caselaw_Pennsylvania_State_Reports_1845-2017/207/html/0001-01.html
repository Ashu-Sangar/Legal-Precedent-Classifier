It may be argued that this was not an advancement, because advancements are confined to estates of intestates as said in the case of Newell’s Will, 1 Browne, 811, cited in 1 Rhone’s O. C. 66, note 5; and because of the general rule that if the parent take a note or bond for the repayment of the money, with or without in<a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>terest, it is presumed to be a debt and not an advancement; Higb’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/21/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="411523" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0283-01">21 Pa. 283</a> ; Roland v.

But where the note or bond taken by its terms makes the money given an advancement, if not in express words yet in effect, all presumptions are overruled. And this is what we regard Alexander’s note as clearly showing. Suppose the testatrix had charged upon a family book the $2,100 to Alexander instead of taking the note she did, there could be no question as to its nature. Or suppose she had taken a writing from Alexander expressly setting out that he had received from his mother $2,100 “ as an advancement ” on account of his share in the estate, could there be any question about it ? Certainly not. The note taken by her is only so in form. It could not have been collected of Alexander except in the way expressly provided and if his share in his mother’s estate amounted to nothing he, or his estate, could not be called upon to pay.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[296,1211,1183,925]]]'>But it is further contended that granting it to be an advancement the decedent, having made a will after the death of her son Alexander in which she bequeathes the one eighth of her residuary estate to the children of Alexander, they cannot be charged with the same. This argument concedes that if the testatrix had died intestate Alexander’s heirs would take their share diminished by the sum advanced to their father. It is important to remember the declared principle of equality which runs through the whole will. In the sixth item she saj's: “ I am desirous that all my children shall share equally in the distribution of whatever property I have been or hereafter may be possessed, such of them as are deceased being represented by the children they have left to survive them.” She might have said in express words that the share of Alexander’s children was to be diminished by the principal of the note she held against him but taking the whole will with its expressed idea of equality, and particularly the language above quoted, we think the intention is sufficiently expressed.</p>

But it is almost equally clear that when she made her will subsequently, the testatrix had changed her intention in regard to this money. Her son Alexander, the maker of the note, had died, and in her will she made express provision for his children. Moreover she had considered the subject of advancements, and gave explicit directions concerning what should be so treated and the amounts, and these directions included by name the children of Alexander. Thus after reciting that she was possessed of real estate in Bedford, Fulton and Philadelphia counties, and had conveyed portions of it to various of her children, she directed “ that the Bedford county lands so divided among them shall be treated as advancements to my said sons William, George, Plarry and tci the children of my son Alexander (now deceased) each, of one thousand dollars in the final settlement of my estate as hereafter provided,” and “ that the Fulton county lands so divided among them shall be treated in the final settlement of my estate as hereinafter provided, as advancements to my surviving children, and to the children of my deceased children respectively, Alexander and Elizabeth, at the rate of five dollars per acre.” In the subsequent part of the same item' she devised the Fulton county lands to her three surviving sons, subject as aforesaid, and the real estate in Philadelphia to her executors in trust to sell, etc., and “ subject to the advancements to my children in land as heretofore mentioned and at the same price designated by me, either already taken or to be taken after my decease, I direct my executors to divide the said net purchase moneys of the said Philadelphia county properties, the accrued rents and income therefrom, and all other the rest and residue of my estate which may be in their possession, into eight equal parts, and to pay over and deliver one of said equal eighth parts to each of my children,” naming the six survivors, one other eighth in trust for a granddaughter and the remaining eighth in trust for the children of Alexander.</p>

In the face .of the express consideration and settlement of the subject by the testatrix herself, we are not at liberty to add anything to it.
