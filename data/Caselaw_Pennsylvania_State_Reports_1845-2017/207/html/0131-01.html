    <p id="b166-7" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[312,1094,1176,395]]]'>The power of the courts of Pennsylvania to open judgments upon equitable grounds has been recognized since Kalbach v. Fisher, <a href="/rawle/1/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="1 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1819319" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0323-01">1 Rawle, 323</a>, where it was said: “ The power of the court of common pleas in relation to open judgments is most ample and policy requires that it should be liberally used, otherwise great and manifest injustice would be the consequence, from the great variety of shapes which fraud may assume in the complicated transactions of men.”</p>
    <p id="b166-8" data-blocks='[["BL_166.8",166,[313,1506,1175,305]]]'>It was said by our Brother Mitchell in Fisher v. Hestonville, etc., Pass. Railway Company, <a href="/pa/185/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="185 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="897974" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0602-01">185 Pa. 602</a>: “ There can be no question that the rule that fraud vitiates everything into which it enters applies to verdicts and judgments and the equitable powers of the courts on that subject may be administered summarily upon rule.”</p>
    <p id="b166-9" data-blocks='[["BL_166.9",166,[313,1816,1174,358]]]'>We can see no reason for holding that the judgment in this case should be exempt from the control of the court, through the exercise of its chancery powers. The law gives to the report of the auditors when filed in the court of common pleas the effect of a judgment of that court. If it is to have that force and effect, it should certainly in the interest of justice be subject to the same equitable control.</p>

But we are not concerned as to that. In the exercise of its equitable powers, the court will reach far, to <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>prevent the triumph of fraud. As was said by this court in Cochran v. Eldridge, <a href="/pa/49/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="49 Pa. 365" data-case-ids="998546" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0365-01">49 Pa. 365</a> (370), “ when it is alleged on adequate proofs that a judgment in whole or in part has been obtained by a suppression of truth which it was the duty of the party to disclose or by the suggestion of a falsehood or by any of the infinite and therefore undefinable means by which fraud may be practiced, no court will allow itself, its records, and the process of law to be used as instruments of fraud.”</p>
    <p id="b167-5" data-blocks='[["BL_167.5",167,[162,774,1180,295]]]'>It is here definitely charged that the report of the auditors was based upon the fraudulent misrepresentations made by the county treasurer. The general principle that the report of the auditors is final unless an appeal is taken in time, should not be allowed to prevent inquiry into a result attained by fraud.</p>
    <p id="b167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[162,1087,1184,1133]]]'>We are of opinion that under the allegations of the petition in this case, the court below has full power to deal with the question upon its merits, and to grant equitable relief by opening the judgment and allowing an appeal from the report of the auditors to be filed nunc pro tunc; and if upon full investigation it should appear that the report of the auditors had been procured by fraud, it would become the duty of the court to interfere by allowing the appeal asked for. The question, however, being of grave import, ought not to have been summarily disposed of on the petition and demurrer. The demurrer should have been overruled with leave to the county treasurer and his sureties to answer; and on answer, or in default thereof, the court should have informed itself by depositions as to the real facts in connection with appellants’ allegations of fraud, and, if then satisfied that relief ought to be granted, the judgment should be opened and the appeal allowed. The error into which the learned judge fell was in holding that he had no power to allow an appeal after the expiration of the statutory period. He not only possesses that power but should exercise it in a proper case, and the only question before him after full investigation here will be whether such a case has been presented.</p>
