The same rule applies when, by permission of the landlord, even without formal renewal or extension of the lease, the tenant continues to remain on the premises for a definite or indefinite term.

The tenancy expired on April 1, 1902. During the term defendants had erected in the premises a stationary gas engine and two dynamos with the necessary belting and shafting. Defendant was notified to quit on December 28,1901. The fixtures were removed on April 14, 1902. The defendant claimed that a Mr. Black, the agent of the landlord, had given it permission to remain upon the premises until it could get possession of a building which it expected to occupy. On this subject William E. Frick, on behalf of the complainant, testified as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b628-8" data-blocks='[["BL_628.15",628,[302,2043,1182,357]]]'>Then Mr. Black came to see me a few days after that and said he wanted to see us about leasing the property again.

The defendants, however, claim that there was an extension of this lease in an agreement made by Mr. Black, the agent for the landlord, with one of the officers of this defendant company.

    <p id="b630-6" data-blocks='[["BL_630.10",630,[257,678,1194,459]]]'>The articles removed from the demised premises by the appellant were trade fixtures. The well settled rule, that the ten-, ant must remove them during the term, and that the right to do so ceases with its expiration, was correctly stated by the learned trial judge in his instructions to the jury. The lease to the appellant expired April 1, 1902, and the proper notice to quit had been served by the landlord. The fixtures were not removed until about the middle of April, and, if there were nothing more in the ease, the plaintiff ought to recover.</p>

If, during the term, no intention can be imputed to the tenant to make a gift to his landlord of fixtures, which he has attached to the land for the use of his business, and he has a light to remove them during the tenancy, the same rule ought to, and does, apply when, by permission of the landlord, even without a formal renewal or extension of the lease, he continues to remain on the premises for a definite or indefinite term.

The tenant may have been mistaken as to its right to remain; but, if it was misled <a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>into doing so by the conduct or language of the agent of the appellee, the latter cannot now ask that the fixtures be forfeited to him. This is what the jury should have been told, and it is not to be doubted that they were misled when instructed that the holding over, which would justify the removal of the fixtures/ must have been in pursuance of an agreement of fixed and definite terms, “binding upon both of the parties, and settled.” A portion of the charge excepted to is, that there “ must have been a definite and determinate agreement settled between them.” In this there was error, and, that the case may be submitted under proper instructions, the judgment is reversed with a venire de novo.</p>
