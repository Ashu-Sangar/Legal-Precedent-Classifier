Upon the other hand it was contended on behalf of the appellee, that this legacy was absolute, and was not subject to the payment of the indebtedness of Frederick H. DeHaven to his father. The conclusion reached by the auditor was, that the testator made no new will, as to the rights of Frederick Albert DeHaven, but that he was, by the second codicil to the will, merely substituted as a legatee, in the place of his father, Frederick H. DeHaven, and as such must take the legacy subject to all the terms and conditions of the bequests as originally made to his father.</p>

DeHaven would have been subject to the payment of any debts which he owed the testator at the time of his death. Admittedly, these debts exceeded the amount of the legacy in question. We are clear that the will shows the intention of the testator to treat his children with equality. The codicil must undoubtedly be read as if written into the original instrument, and if this be done, it would subject the gift to the grandson to the same conditions as are imposed upon all other gifts under the same will. We can discover no indication that the testator intended to make an absolute gift to his grandson, or to free the bequest to him from the requirements imposed upon all others. The second codicil merely substitutes the name of the grandson as devisee and legatee in place of the son.' The amount and nature of the bequests to the grandson can be ascertained only by reference to the original will. Whatever was given, devised and bequeathed in the original will to the son, Frederick H. DeHaven, was, by the second codicil, given to the grandson, Frederick Albert DeHaven. By its plain wording, he takes no more and no less than his father would have taken had the terms of the will remained intact. He takes precisely the share that his father would be entitled to if the son had not been substituted as a legatee in his stead; and what that is, is to be ascertained in the <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>mode pointed out by the will, for no change whatever in that respect is made by the language of the codicil.</p>
