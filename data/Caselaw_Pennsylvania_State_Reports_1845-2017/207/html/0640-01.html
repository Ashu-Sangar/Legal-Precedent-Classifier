The testimony shows that the trust deed was executed by Mr. and Mrs. Fry after she had read the same—executed in good faith for the clear and unmistakable trust purposes therein expressed. There was not a shadow of evidence that fraud or coercion induced its execution. Nor is there any evidence that from the execution and delivery of the trust deed in June, 1897, to the' date of the revocation instrument of March 2,1903, Mr. and Mrs. Fry, or either of them, ever questioned the meaning, force and active power of the trust.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b672-4" data-blocks='[["BL_672.5",672,[652,844,439,27]]]'>CONCLUSIONS OP LAW.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b672-5" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[286,905,1182,352]]]'>That the trust deed was deliberately executed by Mr. and Mrs. Fry, with ample time to consider the purposes in contemplation, and delivered by them to the trust company without solicitation upon its part, cannot for a moment be doubted. A solemn instrument thus created is not lightly to be set aside, but only on strong and convincing reasons—reasons that in this case are wholly absent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b672-6" data-blocks='[["BL_672.7",672,[283,1266,1186,718]]]'>The deed creates an active and a separate use trust. That it is an active trust is toó clear to require the citation of authorities. That it is a separate use trust is ruled by Twining’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="97 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="444812" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0036-01">97 Pa. 36</a>. In the language of the opinion in that case, “ To grant the prayer of the plaintiff would, necessarily, be upon a principle that the whole fund could be disposed of by agreement of the parties. That principle would enable the. husband to influence the wife to destroy the trust created for her use. There is no difference in legal effect between this trust and one created by will or deed of a parent for use of a married daughter. If the beneficiary of the trust can defeat it by agreement while the reasons for its creation exist, it is worthless. The validity of trusts like this is too well settled to be overthrown, save by legislative power.” .</p>
