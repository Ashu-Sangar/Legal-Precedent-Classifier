Elizabeth Kraus, testator’s daughter, October 20, 1897. All of the other sons and daughters of the testator are still living. The question raised by the petition and answer is whether the children of testator take an estate in fee. After the death of his wife he gave his estate to his sons and daughters during their natural lives, and after their death to their children, should they leave any. Had he stopped here, there could be no question that the word “ children ” was used in its ordinary sense as a word of purchasé, and that his sons and daughters only took a life estate ; but if any of them left no children, there would be intestacy as to this share. This, however, does not seem to have been his intention, as he next provided that if any of his sons or daughters left no heirs, their share was to be divided share and share alike between all of his grandchildren. If the word “ heirs ” <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>here means children alone, and a son or daughter died, leaving no children, but grandchildren, such grandchildren, being the great-grandchildren of the testator, would be disinherited, as grandchildren do not take under a devise to children: Gable’s App., <a href="/pa/40/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="40 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="478677" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0231-01">40 Pa. 231</a>. In doubtful cases such a construction should be adopted as would distribute the estate as nearly as possible according to the intestate laws, the word “ heirs ” we think therefore should not be construed as synonymous with “ children.” That it was not used in its general sense is evident from the fact that the limitation over is to testator’s grandchildren, who would be the collateral heirs of a deceased grandchild not leaving lineal heirs. It seems then that the testator intended here to limit the estate given to his children to their lineal heirs, or issue, which shows also his intention to use the word “ children ” in its comprehensive and extended sense, meaning issue or heirs of the body. If this construction be correct the gift then is to his children for life with remainder to the heirs of their bodies or their issue, which vested in the children a fee tail, enlarged by the act of assembly into a fee simple. Another reason- for so construing this will, is, if the limitation is to grandchildren as such, and none of his sons or daughters left children there would be intestacy, which is to be avoided if possible. This construction is supported by the following eases: Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/40/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="40 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="478140" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0029-01">40 Pa. 29</a>, where the words “ child or children ” were held to be used in the sense of issue of heirs of the body; Brinton v.
