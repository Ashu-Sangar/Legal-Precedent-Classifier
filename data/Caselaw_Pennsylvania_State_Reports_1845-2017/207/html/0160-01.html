    <p class="summary" id="b190-9" data-blocks='[["BL_190.16",190,[288,1503,1178,303]]]'>1. The Pittsburg and State Line Railroad Company was incorporated October 23, 1885, in conformity with the provisions of the Act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 62, known as the general railroad act, and by it and the supplement thereto of June 4, 1883, P. L. 67, was authorized to increase its capital stock to an amount not exceeding $150,000 per mile. ■</p>

L. 49, and also by authority of laws of the state of New York, into and with a line of railroad built under the provisions of the laws of the state of New York and connecting with it at a point on the line dividing the two states, under the name of the defendant company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b190-11" data-blocks='[["BL_190.18",190,[288,2176,1178,199]]]'>3.

L. 189, was $13,000,000.</p>

L. 73, and its supplement of June 15, 1897, P. L. 155, amending the 44th section of said act, which require a bonus from “ every company incorporated by or under the provisions of this act, or accepting the same,” so impose it upon the defendant company.</p>

The commonwealth settled an account against the defendant August 21, 1902, $1,000,000 increase of capital equal to $3,333.34 “ as per act of May 1, 1868, and supplements thereto,” which should probably read as per act of May 3, 1899, particularly as the former act excepts railroads from its operation and as we are not otherwise advised. The defendant took an appeal from this settlement and the specifications of objection raise the question of liability.</p>
