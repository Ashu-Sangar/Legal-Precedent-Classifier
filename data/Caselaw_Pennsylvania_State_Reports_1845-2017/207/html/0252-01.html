One of the prospective buyers (Kaufmann Brothers) protesting against this method, requested that it be offered as a whole. This being refused, the sale proceeded and the property was sold in lots or departments to William Campbell and others for $19,145. Kaufmann Brothers still demanding the right to bid upon the property as a whole, and being refused immediately offered $25,000 for the same. And thereupon certain creditors notified the receiver that an application would be made to court to set aside the sale and order a resale. This application was made, and after a hearing thereon and the filing of a bond by Kaufmann Brothers to bid $25,000 the sale was set aside and a resale ordered, at which Kaufmann Brothers as the highest bidders purchased the property for $25,000 and paid said sum to the receiver.</p>

And with bidders prepared to bid, some for lots, others for the whole of the property, the rights of bidders, of creditors, and the best interests of the trusts required that the sale be tested as advertised. It was- tested one way (by lots) but not the other (as a whole). Until tested both ways, it could not appear whether “ the best interests of the trust ” would result by one method or the other. Kaufmann Brothers, who by the terms of sale were present to bid for the property as a whole, were not permitted to do so ; and the result was that instead of realizing $25,000 for the property, it was sold in parcels for $19,145—a loss of $5,855.</p>
