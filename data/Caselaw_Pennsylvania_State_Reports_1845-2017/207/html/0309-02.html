On September 15, 1902, William F. Fennell and Harry A. Fennell, sons of the decedent, applied for the vacation of these partition proceedings, upon the ground that the petitioner had no interest in the property, having released her rights in the same by her deed dated December 31,1900. A rule havingbeen granted, the case was set down for hearing, and testimony taken in open court. At this hearing two deeds or releases were offered in evidence each dated December 31,1900, and forming a part of the same transaction; one from David Fennell, in which he releases the separate real estate of his wife, Annie Fennell, from “ all right, claim and interest whatsoever,” and one from Annie Fennell, in which she makes a corresponding release as to the real estate of her husband. The testimony shows that the parties lived together as husband and wife, until the date of the death of the testator.</p>

    <p id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.11",341,[159,1086,1184,612]]]'>By an agreement in writing, under seal, duly acknowledged, a married woman relinquished her right of dower and all other right, claim, and interest whatsoever in the estate of her husband, and agreed that at his death his estate should vest in his heirs or in such persons as by will he should appoint, in like manner as if they had never been married. At the same time her husband executed an agreement relinquishing all interest in her estate. These agreements were alike and conferred equal rights. Their purpose as stated in the preambles was to give to each the free and absolute control and disposal of his or her separate property. The consideration in each was one dollar and the like covenant of the other party.</p>

She was her husband’s second wife, married late in life, and not the mother of his children, who were of full age at the time of her marriage. Each party had a separate estate, and hers was a third lai’ger than his. The agreement was not only fair and conscionable but decidedly to her advantage. After the death of her husband, she attempted to repudiate the agreement into which she had entered, on the ground that it was not legally binding and she instituted proceedings in partition to have her dower interest ascertained and set apart.

That a separation is provided for in an agreement between husband and wife goes to the consideration only and does not effect her power to contract.</p>
