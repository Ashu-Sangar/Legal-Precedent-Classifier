Subsequently the defendants, or some of them, made information before a justice of the peace, charging plaintiff with arson. Upon this information which was made June 1,1894, plaintiff was arrested, and a true bill was found against him. He was regularly tried and acquitted on August 29, 1894. The present action was begun May 31, 1900. The court relying on the authority of Reed v.

It was excluded by the court for the reason that, under the plea of the statute of limitations, the plaintiff could not recover, even if it was admitted. It was not to show that he had been arrested on a warrant which charged no crime, or that his arrest and imprisonment had been procured by the defendants against all forms of law.

Wilt, 4 S. &amp; R. 19, itis-said: “ Where the act is an immediate wrong against all form of law, trespass vi et armis, is the proper action ; but where the process is legal, but it is used in an oppressive manner, trespass on the case. In the one case, it is the immediate act that gives the party his action for the injury, without relation to the motive; in the other the motive of the act.” Following this, the rule is clearly laid down by Rogers, J., in Farmers’ Bank v. <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>McKinney, <a href="/watts/7/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="7 Watts 214" data-case-ids="1846864" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0214-01">7 Watts, 214</a>: “ The true criterion between trespass and case is, whether the injury is immediate or consequential. For injuries arising from regular process of a court of competent jurisdiction, case is the proper form of action; and trespass does not lie as for a malicious arrest or for a malicious prosecution : Bell v. Broadhurst, 3 Term Rep. 185; Johnstone v. Sutton, 1 Term Rep. 535; 11 East, 297; 1 Camp. 295 ; 2 Chitty’s Rep. 204. But when the process is irregular, and by this is meant a void process, trepass is the proper form; as when a justice of the peace maliciously and irregularly grants a warrant against a person for felony without an information on oath, the remedy is in trespass, and case does not lie: Morgan v. Hughes, 2 Term Rep. 228. The general distinction is thus stated. When the immediate act of imprisonment proceeds from the defendant, the action must be trespass, and trespass only; but where the act of imprisonment by one person is in consequence of information from another, then an action on the casé is the proper remedy, because the injury is sustained in consequence of the wrongful act of that other.” Among the later cases holding that case is the proper form of action for a malicious prosecution, carried on under the forms of law, are Stewart v. Thompson, <a href="/pa/51/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="51 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="999845" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0158-01">51 Pa. 158</a>, and Kennedy v. Barnett, supra.

The evidence showed the plaintiff had been arrested by a constable under legal process issued upon a complaint regularly and formally made before a magistrate having jurisdiction of the subject-matter. A nonsuit was entered because the action was in trespass and not in case, and, in refusing to take it off, the trial judge said: “ It has been held by all the text writers, and by numerous decisions, that for the malicious abuse of legal process, case and not trespass is the proper legal remedy. The rule is thus stated by Waterman, sec. 307 and note, ‘ If one knowing that he has no cause of action or complaint, cause another to be arrested, the latter may maintain an action upon the case, although the whole proceedings a.re perfectly regular and legal in point of form; but he could not in such a case maintain trespass.’ ” What was thus said we approved in affirming the judgment.</p>

The words of the act are, that actions upon the case, other than for slander, shall be commenced “ six years next after the cause of such actions or suit, and not after.” The Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 236, has no application to a suit for malicious prosecution. It is clearly intended to apply only to cases of injuries to the person, which may or may not result in death. Its words are: “ Every suit hereafter brought to recover damages for injury wrongfully done to the person, in case where the injury does not result in death, must be brought within two years from the time when the injury was done and not afterwards <em>; </em>in cases where the injury does result in death the limitation of action shall remain as now established by law.”</p>
