The plaintiffs were to facilitate a decree of sale, and the defendants were to pay the purchase money. The defendants were to form a new corporation which was to take title, and the bonds and stock of the new company were to be divided among the parties. No binding agreement was ever made with the trust company either before or after it became the owner of the road. After the trust company had purchased the road one of the plaintiffs informed a director of the trust company of a trick proposed by one of the defendants to cheapen the road in the estimation of the trust company so that it could be bought at a lower price. <em>The </em>director of the trust company thereupon refused to have any further dealings with plaintiffs and defendants as to the sale of the road to them. <em>Held, </em>that a nonsuit was properly entered.</p>

This paper was exhibited by Hopkins to the defendants in this case, and was the assurance upon which the parties executed the contract in suit. It was in brief,- that the trust company, if it purchased' the road, would within sixty days either convey the road, or transfer its bid, or the bid of such persons as may bid in the property, to a purchaser or such person or corporation as may be designated by him for the sum of $125,000.

Johnston, so as to delay him and disgust him with the property and induce 1dm to sell it at a lower price, and about the same time W. D. Johnston wrote to the manager making the same suggestion.</p>

Johnston that he would not have any further dealings with him or the other defendant, and assigned as a reason the letter to the manager of the road which Hopkins had sent him or caused to be sent him after March 1,1901. On April 12,1901, Walter S. Johnston assigned his bid to another person, and, as we recall the evidence, at a better price than $125,000.</p>

They did nothing but watch the movements of the defendants. The arrangement with Walter S. Johnston, as evidenced by the preliminary paper, was that he would sell the road to these parties within sixty days after March 1. Before the expiration of that time he refused to have any dealings with the plaintiffs and sold the road to another. To provide against such an event the provision was inserted in the contract that the failure of the trust company to convey the road ended all liability of the parties. The defendants had sixty days to perform, and we cannot hold them liable because they failed to perform before the full expiration of that period, especially when Walter S. Johnston put it out of his power to make a conveyance or to assign his bid to them or the proposed corporation.</p>

The defendant, Watkins, had nothing to do with the suggestion of Johnston about the scheme to disgust the trust company with the road.

The pro<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>posed trick is open to criticism, but it was in no way Mr. Hopkins’s duty to disclose it to Walter S. Johnston, especially after the time had gone by when it was proposed to put it into effect. If the purchase fell through on this account, it was through Mr. Hopkins’s own act. It may be that it was from a sense of duty that he communicated the facts to Mr. Johnston, but if the result was disastrous to his project he can blame only himself.</p>
