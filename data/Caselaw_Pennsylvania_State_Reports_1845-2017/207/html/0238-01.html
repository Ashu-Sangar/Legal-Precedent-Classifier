    <p class="summary" id="b269-4" data-blocks='[["BL_269.7",269,[125,762,1188,823]]]'>At the trial it appeared that the note in suit was made by the Burrell Water Company to the order of the defendants payable on demand. The defendants indorsed the notes as follows: “ For value received we hereby guarantee the prompt payment of the within note.” These words were followed by the signatures of defendants. The note was in the form of an ordinary collateral note, and gave the holder on default the right to sell the collateral at public or private sale without demand, advertisement or notice. Deposited with the note were eleven bonds of the Burrell Water Company of the par value of $1,000 each. George F. Wright, cashier of the plaintiff, testified that after default he had sold the bonds deposited as collateral to the Mellon National Bank for fifty cents on the dollar. This sale was made without notice to the defendants. Mr. Wright testified that the sale was made in good faith, and that-he secured the highest price possible for the bonds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.8",269,[173,1595,604,43]]]'>Plaintiff presented these points :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.9",269,[123,1646,1183,357]]]'>1. That the defendants, having guaranteed the prompt payment of the note of the Burrell Water Company, in evidence in this case, became absolutely liable as sureties for the payment thereof, and it is immaterial whether the note could have been collected from the Burrell Water Company, or whether the water company was solvent or insolvent when the note became due. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. [19]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-7" data-blocks='[["BL_269.10",269,[122,2009,1182,409]],["BL_270.1",270,[308,348,1176,306]]]'>2. That the plaintiff bank cannot be held liable for more than, it received from a sale of the bonds, unless it appear that the bank sold the bonds fraudulently or in bad faith, or that there was such recklessness in the mode or the time of selling, that an intent to injure the defendants might be inferred therefrom, and that there is no evidence in this case which would warrant the jury in finding that there was any fraud, bad faith or recklessness on the part of the bank as would render it liable for <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>more than it received for the bonds pledged to secure the payment of the note. <em>Answer: </em>Affirmed. By this is meant that there is no evidence submitted by the defendants that would justify the jury in finding that there was bad faith, or a failure on the part of the plaintiff to get what they could out of the bonds that were pledged as collateral.
