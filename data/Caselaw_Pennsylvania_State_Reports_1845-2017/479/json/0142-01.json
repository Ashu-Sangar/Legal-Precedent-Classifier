        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant, Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission), appeals from a decision of the Commonwealth Court holding (1) the Commission has no power to award victims of unlawful discrimination damages for \u201cembarrassment, humiliation and emotional upset,\u201d and (2) the Commission may not order a respondent to maintain records which designate the race of apartment applicants or the race of the apartment\u2019s former occupant because such a requirement violates \u00a7 5(h)(6) of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(h)(6) (Supp.1977-78). Span v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 15 Pa.Cmwlth. 334, 325 A.2d 678 (1974).\nThis Court has recently held that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission has no authority to award damages for injuries such as mental anguish and humiliation which allegedly result from unlawful discrimination. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Zamantakis, 478 Pa. 454, 387 A.2d 70 (1978); Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Straw, 478 Pa. 463, 387 A.2d 75 (1978). Accordingly, we affirm that part of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order denying the Commission the authority to award damages for embarrassment, humiliation, and emotional upset.\nWe do not agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order that the Commission may not, as a remedial measure, order a respondent to maintain records of the racial identification of applicants for an apartment or the former occupants of a vacated apartment unit. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s order in the present case was entered before this Court\u2019s decision in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Chester Housing Authority, 458 Pa. 67, 327 A.2d 335 (1974), in which we upheld a nearly identical order requiring reports containing information of racial composition. The Commission, statutorily empowered to \u201ctake such affirmative action ... as, in the judgment of the Commission, will effectuate the purposes of [the Human Relations Act],\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 959 (Supp.1977-78), could have concluded that such a reporting requirement was necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Human Relations Act.\nWe therefore reverse that portion of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision invalidating the Commission\u2019s order which requires respondent\u2019s records to indicate the racial composition of applicants for apartments and the former occupants of apartments. We affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order denying the Commission the authority to award the compensatory damages sought in this case.\nIt is so ordered.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which NIX, J., joined.",

However, for the reasons fully set forth in my dissenting opinion in Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission v. Straw, 478 Pa. 463, 387 A.2d 75 (1978) (Manderino, J., dissenting), I dissent from the Court\u2019s holding that the Human Relations Commission has no statutory authority to award compensatory damages to persons genuinely injured by unlawful discrimination.",

St. Joe Minerals Corp., 476 Pa. 302, 382 A.2d 731 (1978) (Roberts, J., joined by Nix, J., dissenting), I dissent from that portion of today\u2019s opinion holding that the PHRC is without statutory authority to award compensatory damages to victims of discrimination. Accordingly, I would reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the PHRC.\nBecause, however, the majority affirms the order of the Commonwealth Court modifying the award of damages, the Court should remand the proceedings to the PHRC to allow it to enter an appropriate remedial order in light of today\u2019s decision.\nNIX, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
