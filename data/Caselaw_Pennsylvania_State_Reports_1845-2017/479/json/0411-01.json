        "text": "POMEROY, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe application for reargument filed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in this case seeks basically a ruling from this Court at this time that the Court\u2019s decision, which removed the constitutional bar to suits against the Commonwealth, be made effective and applicable (as to all cases other than the instant case and those other cases decided the same day) only to cases wherein the cause of action accrued on and after a future date to be fixed by this Court. Because the application presents an important question meriting the consideration of the Court, I feel warranted in taking the unusual step of expressing my disagreement with the denial of the application through this dissenting opinion.\nThe Court\u2019s decision in Mayle, et al. overruled scores of past decisions on which reliance had been placed. The Commonwealth, in its petition now before us, represents that the impact of the Court\u2019s decision on the Commonwealth will be severe and that the orderly administration of government demands that a \u201creasonable but finite\u201d time should be provided for the other branches of state government to \u201ccomprehensively address the complex problems of suits against the state.\u201d\nThere is general recognition of the propriety, in jurisprudential and constitutional terms, of the prospective application of a decision by a court which overrules an established precedent upon which there has been justifiable reliance. See Great Northern Railway Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., 287 U.S. 358, 53 S.Ct. 145, 77 L.Ed. 360 (1932). Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965). Annotation, \u201cRetroactive or Merely Prospective Operation of New Rule Adopted by Court in Overruling Precedent \u2014 Federal Cases,\u201d 14 L.Ed.2d 993,1001-02. Specifically, there is ample precedent and authority for delaying the effective date of decisions in cases where sovereign immunity has been abolished. In a number of our sister states their highest courts have made some provision to postpone the effective date of their decisions in which this change in the legal status of the state has been made.\nIt seems to me that the Court should be willing to consider, in light of briefs and argument addressing that question only, whether and to what extent the \u201cbreak with [this state\u2019s] decisional past,\u201d Laughner v. Allegheny County, 436 Pa. 572, 585 n.10, 261 A.2d 607, 613 n.10 (1970) (POMEROY, J., dissenting), which the holding in the present case brings about, warrants a delay in its effective date. See Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 263, 309-11, 282 A.2d 206, 229-30 (1971). If no postponement or delay is then granted, that determination will at least have been a reasoned one made in light of all factors the parties can bring to bear on the subject. I would grant reargument for that limited purpose.\n. Poklemba v. Shamokin State General Hospital, 479 Pa. 414, 388 A.2d 722 (Opinion filed July 14, 1978); Porr v.
