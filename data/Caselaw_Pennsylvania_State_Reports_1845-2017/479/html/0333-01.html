The alleged father, Bobby Nave, also the victim in this case, had told appellant he was a widower living with his sister. Appellant discovered, however, that he was married and living with his wife.</p>

Since she did not have a car, she went to Frank’s Cafe in York, Pennsylvania to find a ride to Nave’s house in New Freedom, Pennsylvania. While in the tavern, appellant drank four double shots of ginger brandy and two beers. She then was offered a ride to Lamotie’s Cafe, which was next door to Nave’s house. There she drank another beer and then bought a six pack of beer to take to the Nave’s residence.</p>

Appellant finally asked to be driven home. The trio left for appellant’s home, stopping for a six pack of beer along the way. After arriving at appellant’s house, the three went inside and continued their drinking.</p>

The victim’s wife went upstairs to use the bathroom and upon returning downstairs saw her husband lying on a bed, writhing in pain. Mrs. Nave asked her husband what happened, and the victim <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>replied, “She [appellant] shot me.” Mr. Nave died shortly thereafter.
