    <p id="b300-11" data-blocks='[["BL_300.12",300,[250,1761,1158,578]]]'>In 1970, Inez Banes, trustee under the will of her deceased husband, J. Walter Banes, sold a piece of real estate, which was part of the property of the trust, to the Shell Oil Company. The sale was challenged by a remainder beneficiary of the trust who filed a petition to set aside the conveyance. Shell Oil Company filed an answer to the petition denying that there was any basis to set aside the conveyance.. Shell’s answer also contained new matter in which Shell requested, in the alternative, that the court consider its claim for damages which Shell alleged it would suffer if the conveyance were set aside.</p>

      <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>The trial court denied the petition to set aside the conveyance and approved the trustee’s sale of the property. The trial court therefore did not consider Shell’s claim for damages.</p>
    <p id="b301-5" data-blocks='[["BL_301.5",301,[212,523,1148,309]]]'>On appeal, this Court held that the trial court erred in failing to set aside the conveyance <em>(Banes I). </em>In that decision, this Court did not have before it any decree of the trial court concerning Shell’s claim for damages because that claim had not been addressed by the trial court since it had approved the sale. This Court’s mandate in <em>Banes I </em>was:</p>
    <blockquote id="AX" data-blocks='[["BL_301.6",301,[255,843,1106,151]]]'>“Decree of the Orphans’ Court approving the March, 1970, conveyance, is reversed and the record remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b301-6" data-blocks='[["BL_301.7",301,[213,1010,1150,671]]]'>After a remand “for proceedings consistent with [this] opinion” several meetings, attended by the attorneys for all the parties involved in this litigation, were held at the request of the trial court. Lengthy discussions took place concerning a settlement. When settlement was not reached, the trial court requested the appellee to file a petition requesting reconveyance of the property. Such a petition was filed on April 23, 1974. On the next day, April 24, the trial court ordered a reconveyance of the property. No hearing was held on this petition and no further proceedings were scheduled concerning the pending alternate claim of Shell for damages requested in new matter in Shell’s original answer filed in this case.</p>
    <p id="b301-7" data-blocks='[["BL_301.8",301,[215,1707,1149,465]]]'>From the trial court’s decree ordering a reconveyance of the property, Shell Oil Company appealed to this Court. In that appeal, Shell contended that the trial court erred in failing to consider whether Shell was entitled to damages. This Court affirmed the decree of the trial court ordering the reconveyance of the property. In doing so, we did not consider Shell’s claim for damages because Shell “did not file exceptions or seek other relief from the decree” in the trial court. <em>Banes II, </em><a href="/pa/461/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="461 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="483784" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0203-01">461 Pa. at 205</a>, <a href="/pa/461/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="461 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="483784" data-case-paths="/pa/461/0203-01">336 A.2d at 248</a>.</p>

In the alternative Shell asked the trial court to consider exceptions to that decree. Shell asked the trial court to treat a letter which Shell had sent to the trial court about six weeks after the April 24 decree as the equivalent of formal exceptions, or to permit a period of time for Shell to file formal exceptions. Following argument, Shell’s petition was dismissed by the trial court. It is from that order that Shell now appeals.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.5",302,[250,850,1161,892]]]'>In this appeal Shell contends that the trial court erred in dismissing its petition. I do not agree so far as the trial court’s refusal to vacate its decree of April 24, 1974, is concerned because that decree carried out the mandate of this Court in <em>Banes I </em>and was affirmed by us in <em>Banes II. </em>In addition to requesting the vacating of that decree, however, Shell attempted to file exceptions to that decree. Since that decree was affirmed in <em>Banes II, </em>it could not be disturbed. To that extent I agree with the trial Court. On the other hand, it is clear that when this Court remanded this matter to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this Court’s opinion in <em>Banes I, </em>Shell’s claim for damages, which had not been disposed of in the trial court and which was not before us in <em>Banes I, </em>was still pending. In <em>Banes II </em>we refused to consider the matter because Shell did not file exceptions or seek other relief in the trial court before appealing to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b302-6" data-blocks='[["BL_302.6",302,[249,1761,1156,202]]]'>After our decision in <em>Banes II </em>Shell did seek relief in the trial court and requested consideration of its outstanding claim for damages contained in its original pleading. In my view, Shell was entitled to its day in court on its claim.</p>

In raising the issue under the caption of exceptions, Shell incorrectly labeled the relief which it sought. Shell, however, should not be deprived of its day in court because it raised a proper issue under the wrong label. Since this Court mandated reconveyance and subsequently affirmed the decree ordering <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>reconveyance, that decree cannot be disturbed. It does not follow, however, that Shell is not entitled to have considered its alternate claim which has never been considered.</p>
