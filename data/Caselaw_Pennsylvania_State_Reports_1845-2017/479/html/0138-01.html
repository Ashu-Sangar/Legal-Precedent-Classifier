      <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>On September 9, 1975, appellees, the proposed adopting parents, filed a petition for involuntary termination of parental rights against the natural parents of Baby Boy P. Appellees sought the termination of the natural parents’ rights so that they could adopt the minor child. Following a hearing, the court entered an order terminating the parental rights of both natural parents. Appellant filed exceptions which were denied, and this appeal followed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[270,743,1158,524]]]'>The facts are as follows. In 1973, appellant, a thirty-one year old legal secretary, became pregnant. In an attempt to terminate the pregnancy, she sought an abortion. An abortion was attempted, but was unsuccessful. Appellant informed her physician that she did not want to keep the baby. Appellant and her physician reached an agreement where upon birth of the child, she would turn over the baby to the doctor for placement and eventual adoption. At sometime during her pregnancy, appellant quit her job and went on public assistance.</p>
    <p id="b170-5" data-blocks='[["BL_170.6",170,[271,1287,1156,148]]]'>On March 1, 1974, appellant gave birth to Baby Boy P. She left the hospital the next day and gave the baby to her doctor, who placed the infant with appellees.</p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[271,1454,1157,308]]]'>During the ensuing year, appellant visited her doctor at least twice, but never mentioned the child or inquired as to his whereabouts. In February of 1975, appellant was contacted by appellees’ attorney about signing a consent form for the child’s adoption. While appellant expressed concern for the child’s welfare, she never asked to see the child.</p>
    <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.8",170,[270,1784,1158,203]]]'>In June, 1975, appellant requested $3,000 from appellees in return for her consent to the adoption. Appellees refused the request. In July, 1975, appellant wrote a letter to her doctor, asking the whereabouts of the child.</p>

Appellant did nothing to regain custody until December 2, 1975 (twenty-one months after the child’s birth), when, <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>through her attorney, she requested another continuance until January 28, 1976.</p>

Parental duty is best understood in relation to the needs of a child. A child needs love, protection, guidance, and support. These needs, physical and emotional, cannot be met by a merely passive interest in the development of the child. Thus, this Court has held that the parental obligation is a positive duty which requires affirmative performance. . . . This affirmative duty encompasses more than a financial obligation; it requires continuing interest in the child and a genuine effort to maintain communication and association with the child. Because a child needs more than a benefactor, parental duty requires that a <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>parent ‘exert himself to take and maintain a place of importance in the child’s life.’ ” (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>
