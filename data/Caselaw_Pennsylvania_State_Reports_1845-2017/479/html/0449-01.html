SEIU’s petition asserted that appellee Washington County, through its commissioners, was the public employer of these employees. Over objection of appellants, Washington County Judges, who contended that they were the employer of certain of the employees in the bargaining unit set forth in SEIU’s petition for representation, the Board conducted a representation election. The employees chose SEIU as their exclusive representative for purposes of bargaining and the Board certified SEIU accordingly. Appellants filed a petition for review in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County and, upon the petition of appellants, this Court assumed plenary jurisdiction and transferred the matter to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
