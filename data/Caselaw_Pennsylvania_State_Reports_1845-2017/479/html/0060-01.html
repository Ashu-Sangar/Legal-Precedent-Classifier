Such an issue, however, was not raised in written post-trial motions and accordingly has been waived. <em>Commonwealth v. Blair, </em><a href="/pa/460/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="460 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="482932" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0031-01">460 Pa. 31</a>, <a href="/pa/460/0031-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="460 Pa. 31" data-case-ids="482932" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0031-01">331 A.2d 213</a> (1975). Second, it is alleged that appellant was denied his constitutional right to effective representation by counsel when his trial lawyer failed to obtain an investigative report pertaining to a prosecution witness, one Anthony Brothers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant has failed, however, to establish either that the report does in fact exist or, if it does, that it contains any information which would have been pertinent to the cross-examination of Brothers. Absent this information there is nothing to show ineffectiveness of counsel. On this record the appellant is entitled to no relief.</p>
