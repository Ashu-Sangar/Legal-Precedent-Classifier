He was convicted after a nonjury trial, and post-verdict motions challenging the sufficiency of the evidence were denied.

The record, so viewed, establishes that in October, 1972, two agents of the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Drug Control, were conducting undercover narcotics operations in Public Square in Wilkes-Barre. Dressed casually in the manner of other young people in the area, the agents habitually loitered in the square, mingling with others who gathered there, and occasionally approached someone for drugs.</p>

Appellant answered that he did not. A few minutes later a third party, George Shiner, approached appellant and his friend, and appellant then called the agent over and introduced him to Shiner, indicating that Shiner had some marijuana. The entire group drove in the agents’ car to Shiner’s residence, where they were joined by yet another person, John Dustin, who brought with him a supply of marijuana. Dustin passed marijuana to Shiner, who passed it to the agent; tlie agent passed $200 through Shiner to Dustin. Appellant" was present throughout the transaction, but handled neither marijuana nor money, nor did he enter any of the negotiations or conversation related to the sale. The agents’ testimony establishes no participation other than the original introduction of the agent to Shiner.</p>

There is no evidence that he met Shiner by design or plan, or that Shiner was any more than a passing acquaintance.

Appellant herein was not charged with aiding and abetting the buying of marijuana but, in the prosecution’s own words, as an accessory to the sale. The Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Moses, </em><a href="/f2d/220/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="220 F.2d 166" data-case-ids="515829" data-case-paths="/f2d/220/0166-01">220 F.2d 166</a> (3d Cir. 1955) reached the same result on facts almost identical to these. Appellant therein was related to the sale of narcotics only through application of Section 2 of Title 18, United States Code, which provides that one who “aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures” the commission of an offense is a principal. At the buyers’ request she had introduced the buyers to the seller and vouched for them. In reversing her conviction, the Court held, as we do here, that “one who has acted without interest in the selling cannot be convicted as a seller even though his conduct may in fact have facilitated [the] illegal sale.” <em><a href="/f2d/220/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="220 F.2d 166" data-case-ids="515829" data-case-paths="/f2d/220/0166-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f2d/220/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="220 F.2d 166" data-case-ids="515829" data-case-paths="/f2d/220/0166-01">at 169</a>.</p>
