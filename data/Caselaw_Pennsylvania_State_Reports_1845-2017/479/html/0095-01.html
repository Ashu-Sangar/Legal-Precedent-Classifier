Before the 1967 marriage, decedent wrote on his 1965 will “not of any value” and “do not use this will.” On September 10, 1967, decedent executed a new will. The new will, as the first, directed that the property in Philadelphia be given to the “nephews and nieces” of his first wife but also provided for his second wife and her daughter. On July 14, 1969, decedent executed a holographic codicil to the 1967 will, leaving one-half of his “entire estate” to Josephine, and the “interest of the fruits of [$]20,000” for so long as Josephine remains unmarried. Thus, by the terms of the 1967 will and its 1969 codicil, appellants are denied the share of the residuary estate they would have received under the 1965 will.</p>
