Testator directed that the residuary estate bear the burden of “all” taxes “imposed upon” “any property or interest in property which may be included as part of [his] estate” for purposes of taxation, which included the property Mildred’s appointment transferred. See supra note 4. Any doubt that “any property” included property transferred through Mildred’s exercise is resolved when it is considered that testator authorized his executors to pay the taxes “at such time and in such manner as [they] in their sole discretion shall determine.” Thus, testator contemplated that certain transfer taxes would be payable both at and after death. Under applicable inheritance tax laws, these transfer taxes included those on property transferred through powers of appointment.

First, testator directed that “no part [of the tax payments] shall be collected from or pro-rated among any persons receiving or in possession of, or receiving the benefit of the property or interest in property taxed.” Further, with unmistakeable clarity, testator stated his “particular intention that the bequest to [his] wife under Article Fifth hereof [(bequeathing Mildred personal property)] and the bequest and devise for the benefit of [Mildred] under Article Thirteenth hereof [(creating the marital trust and power of appointment)] shall be free of all such taxes.” Testator’s wish that “any persons receiving the benefit of property” subject to tax should not bear the tax burden surely encompassed Mildred’s appointees, for they gained through the appointment. Also, knowing Mildred would benefit from not only her lifetime interest in the trust but also the general power of appointment, testator used the terms “for the benefit of my wife,” language unambiguously broad enough to relieve the entire transfer to Mildred of the burden of inheritance tax.</p>

The Act empowers the Commonwealth to collect tax at a rate of two per cent on bequests to, or for the benefit of, certain of decedents’ relatives, often referred to as “lineal heirs,” and a tax of fifteen per cent on bequests to persons outside this class, commonly known as “collateral heirs.” The Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, §§ 101 et seq., 72 P.S. §§ 2485-101 et seq.

Relying upon Section 741 of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, 72 P.S. § 2485-741, which provides that fiduciaries are primarily responsible for payment of transfer taxes on property of which they are in charge, appellants argue that Mellon Bank, in its Petition For Distribution, lacked standing to raise the issue of who should pay additional inheritance tax. Appellants contend that, under <em>Kleinhans Estate, </em><a href="/pa/454/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="454 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="579857" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0539-01">454 Pa. 539</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=312%20A.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="312 A.2d 366">312 A.2d 366</a> (1973), the Commonwealth is entitled to collect inheritance tax from the assets of the marital trust and therefore Mellon Bank’s sole responsibility in this matter is to pay the tax. According to appellants, only-after Mellon Bank fulfills its duty to pay inheritance tax may it seek reimbursement from those it believes are obligated to pay.</p>
      <p id="b604-6" data-blocks='[["BL_604.7",604,[285,1150,1127,935]]]'>In <em>Kleinhans, </em>the testator established two residuary trusts funded equally, one for the benefit of his wife for life, principal to pass as his wife in her will appointed, the other for the benefit of his sister for life, remainder to the testator’s grandsons. The testator’s sister predeceased testator and thus the executors distributed outright the principal of the second trust to the testator’s grandsons. The testator’s wife appointed the principal of the trust in favor of heirs collateral to testator. Accordingly, the Commonwealth sought inheritance tax, at a rate of fifteen per cent, on the property transferred through the wife’s appointment. Over the argument of the wife’s estate that the testator’s will directed all taxes to be paid from his residuary estate and thus testator’s grandsons, residuary beneficiáries, should share the burden of taxation, and the contention that Section 718(c) of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, 72 P.S. § 2485-718(c), limited the Commonwealth’s right to collect the full inheritance tax from a single trust, this Court concluded that the trustee of the residuary trust was obliged to pay the full sum of inheritance tax from the marital trust. We stated: “If [the wife’s estate’s] interpretation of section 718(c) were to prevail, the Commonwealth would have to collect the other half of the tax from the remainder beneficiaries of [the second trust], who received their legacy prior to the termination of the widow’s life tenancy. We conclude that Section 718(c) does not justify such an unsound result.” <a href="/pa/454/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="454 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="579857" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0539-01">454 Pa. at 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=312%20A.2d%20366" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="312 A.2d 366">312 A.2d at 369</a>.</p>

No' dispute exists here concerning the Commonwealth’s right to collect all the additional inheritance tax owed. Rather, Mellon Bank requested the orphans’ court to direct a proper distribution. This distribution could be made only if Mellon Bank knew whether, and to what extent, Mildred’s estate bore responsibility for taxes owed because of Mildred’s appointment. Rather than distribute the assets of her estate and then attempt, in <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>subsequent proceedings, to recover a share from beneficiaries under her will, Mellon Bank first sought to dispose of the important question of tax burden. The orphans’ court has authority to resolve this question before distribution. 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 762 (1975) (authorizing orphans’ courts to decide or dispose of “any question relating to the administration or distribution of an estate or trust and exercise any of its powers in respect thereof upon the filing of an account or in any other appropriate proceeding”). If we were to hold Mellon Bank acted improperly, we would discourage the prompt and orderly administration of estates, leaving all parties uncertain of their rights and obligations concerning transfer taxes.</p>

Section 103 of the Act, 72 P.S. § 2485-103, fixes January 1, 1962, as the effective date of the Act, repealing or displacing existing law only insofar as it would have applied to cases where decedents died on or after that date.
