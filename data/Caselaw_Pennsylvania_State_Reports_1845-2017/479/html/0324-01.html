Gladieux and the Union were parties to a collective bargaining agreement which expired at midnight on April 30, 1974. Prior to April 30th, the Union and Gladieux held numerous bargaining sessions but were unable to agree on a new contract. Just before the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement, the Union offered to continue to work under the terms of the expiring agreement on the condition that any new agreement be made retroactive to May 1, 1974. Gladieux declined this offer and informed the Union that it was willing to continue to provide work under the same terms and conditions of the then current agreement, but would not agree to retroactivity. The Board also found that during the negotiations Gladieux informed the Union that if there was no contract by April 30, 1974, there would be no work.</p>

At a meeting later that evening, the members of the Union rejected this offer. At the same meeting, the members voted to continue to work, and on the night of April 30, 1974, the employees reported for work and worked their usual shift. Thereafter, between May 1st and May 8, 1974, Gladieux eliminated certain employee benefits, <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>reduced employees’ hourly wages, and eliminated two working shifts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Finally, on May 9, 1974, Gladieux informed its employees that due to the airlines’ failure to place service orders, Gladieux was closing its facilities and suspending its employees.

Thus, in instances where a work stoppage resulted from a cause other than a labor dispute, section 402(d) is inapplicable and does not provide a basis for denying unemployment benefits.

Although the labor situation was unsettled, the employment relationship had continued for a number of days and did not cease until there was a lack of work.</p>

Nearly two decades ago, this Court in dictum suggested that the terms “stoppage of work” in section 402(d)(1), 43 P.S. § 802(b)(1) (Supp. 1977-78), referred only to a cessation of work by employees. <em>Pramco, Inc. v. Unemployment Comp. Bd. of Rev., </em><a href="/pa/396/0560-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="396 Pa. 560" data-case-ids="1284897" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0560-01">396 Pa. 560</a>, 564, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.2d%20875" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="154 A.2d 875">154 A.2d 875</a>, 876 (1959). This dictum may be misleading in applying section 402(d) because subsequent cases made it clear that section 402(d) may apply regardless of the form of the work stoppage, i. e., regardless of whether it was the employees who actually ceased working or the employer who stopped operations. <em>Compare Hershey Estates v.

Indeed, the majority concedes that the nexus between these two facts is “relatively easily identifiable.” Opinion, <em>ante </em>at 330. As I see it, the inability to maintain the status quo was in turn the result of the employees’ refusal to continue to work for a time under the terms and conditions of the then existent contract. See <em>Vrotney Unemployment Compensation Case, </em><a href="/pa/400/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="400 Pa. 440" data-case-ids="1292500" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0440-01">400 Pa. 440</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.2d%2091" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="163 A.2d 91">163 A.2d 91</a> (1960). While the actions which the employer unilaterally took subsequent to April 30 are regrettable and not to be condoned, they do not change the fact that the airlines ceased conducting business with Gladieux as the result of the labor dispute which existed on April 30. To ignore the fact that the work stoppage here involved was a direct result of the dispute is to ignore the clearly expressed legislative desire to deny unemployment benefits to persons who precipitate their own unemployment.</p>
