In <em>EUenbogen, </em>we decide only that Allegheny County commissioners are the managerial representative in representation proceedings and collective bargaining under Act 195 involving court personnel. We do not decide that court personnel are not employed by judges for purposes other than bargaining and representation proceedings; indeed, we uphold the constitutionality of Act 195 in <em>EUenbogen </em>principally because judges retain the right to hire, discharge, and supervise court personnel.</p>

For example, appellants argue that Section 805 of Act 195, 43 P.S. § 1101.805, deeming decisions of arbitrators requiring legislative enactment as advisory, demonstrates a legislative awareness that arbitrators have no legislative authority. From this awareness, and because judges alone can hire, discharge, and supervise employees of the judicial system, see Act of June 29, 1976, P.L. 460, § 1, amending The County Code, Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, § 1620, 16 P.S. § 1620 (1956 and Supp.1977), appellants contend that if the Legislature meant Act 195 to cover the judiciary it would have provided a similar proviso governing decisions of arbitrators requiring judicial action.</p>
      <p id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[219,1979,1118,384]]]'>Act 195 expressly refers to “courts of this Commonwealth.” §§ 604(3) and 805, 43 P.S. §§ 1101.604(3) and 1101.805. Section 604(3) provides that the Board, in determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit, shall not permit “employes directly involved with and necessary to the functioning of the courts of this Commonwealth” to be included in a bargaining unit of other public employes. Section 805 provides for binding arbitration upon impasse in collective bargaining in cases involving the same class of employes. Appellants read these sections to cover only those employes charged “with the physical security of courts,” including sheriffs deputies.</p>

The Court Administrator further argues that implementation of numerous bargaining agreements throughout the Commonwealth pursuant to Act 195 will thwart this Court’s effort to unify the judicial system of Pennsylvania. We do not agree. For all the reasons stated in text, Act 195 does not impose any threat to the unification of the judicial function because collective bargaining involving court personnel does not alter judges’ authority to administer justice.
