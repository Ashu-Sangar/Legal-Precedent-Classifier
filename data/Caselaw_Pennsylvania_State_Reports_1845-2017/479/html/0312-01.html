Appellants argue that testator revealed his intent to discriminate against “strangers to the blood” by discriminating among his own children. It is true that one of testator’s children was to receive his share outright while the others were to receive their shares in varying degrees in trust, but this scheme is irrelevant to whether testator intended to exclude grandchildren adopted after his death. Similarly, appellants contend that it is significant that testator made no gifts of principal to “strangers to the blood” except to a charitable institution. This fact does not speak to the question whether testator sought to exclude adopted grandchildren. When testator was willing to bestow his bounty upon an institution, it seems at least as likely that he would desire to pass his estate to his children’s children, whether natural-born or adopted.</p>

Appellants emphasize that at the time of execution of the will, testator had six living children, all natural-born and all married, and eight grandchildren, all natural-born, and that two of testator’s children were childless, including Ralph, whose wife was then 61 years old and therefore not likely to bear children. From these circumstances, appellants conclude that testator must have considered the possibility that some of his children would not bear children, and that his failure expressly to provide for adopted children reveals his intention to exclude them. Properly viewed, these circumstances do not disclose testator’s intent. It is equally plausible that, because none <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>of testator’s children had adopted children, testator gave no thought to the possibility of adopted children or that, because testator knew that two of his children were childless, he directed his attention to the matter and deliberately used language broad enough to include grandchildren adopted after execution of the will.

Appellants argue that this canon of construction cannot apply to testator’s will because it was executed in 1923 while the wills in <em>Sykes </em>and <em>Tafel </em>were executed in 1935 after passage of the Adoption Act of 1925, Act of April 4, 1925, P.L. 127, § 4, 1 P.S. § 4 (1963), which provided that an “adopted child shall have all the rights of a child and heir of such adopting parent or parents.”</p>

An individual is in privity with a party where his relationship to the property in question is “mutual or successive.” <em>Central Pennsylvania Lumber Company v.

Three members of the six-judge panel expressly rejected the plurality’s position, see <em>Estate of Tower, </em>supra (Nix, J., concurring, Roberts, J., joined by Manderino, J., dissenting), and one concurred in the result.</p>
