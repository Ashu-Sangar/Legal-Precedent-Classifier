On August 31, 1959, Brewer, who was represented by court-appointed counsel, entered a plea of not guilty and trial by jury began on that date. On the third day of trial, after the Commonwealth had presented the testimony of eleven witnesses, Brewer entered a plea of guilty to the charge of murder generally. The guilty plea was accepted on the same day and the jury was discharged. On the following day the. court conducted a hearing to determine the degree <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>of guilt. During this hearing, the Commonwealth introduced a pretrial statement by Brewer and the defense introduced testimony of four witnesses in mitigation of Brewer’s conduct. The court found Brewer guilty of murder of the first degree and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. Brewer was not advised of his right to appeal and no appeal was taken.</p>

(1965) 1580, § 1 et <em>seq., </em>19 P.S. § 1180-1 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1977-78) setting forth six reasons in support of his claim for relief, including the obstruction of his right to appeal. By order of the PCHA court dated November 2, 1970, Brewer was granted the right to appeal from his plea of guilty and the judgment of sentence <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>The PCHA court did not address Brewer’s remaining complaints.</p>

A series of reasons were asserted in support of the motion.

Following a counseled hearing on that petition the PCHA court concluded it had inadvertently overlooked Brewer’s motion of November 6, 1970, to withdraw the guilty plea, so it then proceeded to consider and dispose of that motion. Permission to withdraw the guilty plea was denied. At the same time, the court considered the petitions seeking post conviction relief and entered an order denying such relief. This appeal challenges the orders of September 15, 1976, denying the motion to withdraw the guilty plea and denying the request for post conviction relief.</p>

The record is likewise unclear as to whether or not Mrs. Brewer’s recorded statement to the police (aside from the references thereto in the district attorney’s cross-examination) was made part of the record. For the purposes of this appeal, we will assume an affirmative answer to each question. But the record is crystal clear that the trial court considered the statement of Mrs. Brewer to the police as substantive evidence against her husband.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This was error. In view of Mrs. Brewer’s failure at the time she testified in court to acknowledge she made the answers credited to her in the pretrial police statement, the statement could be used merely to impeach her trial testimony and not as substantive evidence of guilt against Brewer.
