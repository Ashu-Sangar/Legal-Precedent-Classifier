He has appealed directly to this Court from the judgment of sentence for murder; appeals from the other convictions were certified to us by the Superior Court for consolidation with this appeal.</p>

We have examined the record and find these issues to be without merit. He also challenges admission of his statements by contending that they were tainted by pre-warning interrogation and resulted from an uninformed waiver of his constitutional rights. These issues have been waived for failure to comply with Rule 1123(a) and <em>Commonwealth v.
