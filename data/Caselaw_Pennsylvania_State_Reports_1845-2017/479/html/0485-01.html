This testimony was further placed in focus by the prompt curative instructions given by the court. Under these circumstances, we agree that the evidence was admissible and could have properly been introduced during trial.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[265,902,1157,557]]]'>Furthermore, we are satisfied that the fact the Commonwealth did agree to exclude this evidence does not change the result. There is no indication on this record that the failure to delete the word blood was in any way caused by deliberate action on the part of the Commonwealth. To the contrary, it appears that it was as a result of the inadvertence of the court, prosecution and defense counsel. Given such a situation we find no justification for suggesting that the Commonwealth must suffer the sole brunt of the error. Also, appellant was not in any way prejudiced by this testimony.</p>

That appeal was docketed at No. 76 May Term, 1977. A motion to quash has been filed by the Commonwealth alleging that the issues raised therein are the same as those raised in this direct appeal. Appellant accepts this allegation and we therefore grant the motion to quash that appeal.</p>

Appellant also complains that the trial court improperly allowed this exhibit to go out with the jury during their deliberations. Since we find this evidence to be competent, relevant and non-inflammatory, we conclude that this complaint is also without merit.</p>
