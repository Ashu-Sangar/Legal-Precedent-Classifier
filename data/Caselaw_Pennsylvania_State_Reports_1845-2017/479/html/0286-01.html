As noted by one of the appellants here, the logic behind the “unusual strain doctrine” was founded on the fact that the claimant was required to show a causal connection between the heart attack and the rigors of employment. Where an individual suffered from a pre-existing heart condition, it was thought that the progression of the disease itself could trigger the heart attack at any time. Consequently, the requirement that unusual strain or exertion be shown was cast upon the claimant in an effort to assure proof that the heart attack resulted from employment activities and not simply from the natural progression of the disease. <em>See, Crispin v.

Although this testimony was rebutted in both cases by the employers’ medical witnesses, the conflicts were resolved by the referees in favor of the claimants.
