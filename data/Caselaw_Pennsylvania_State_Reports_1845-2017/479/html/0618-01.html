The accident severed appellant’s spinal cord at chest level, rendering him a complete paraplegic with total loss of <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>sensation in the lower body and total loss of use of all body functions below the chest level.

    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[258,490,1158,401]]]'>On May 24, 1972, appellant and J. &amp; L. entered into an open compensation agreement under which appellant has been paid $94.00 per week for total disability as authorized by § 306(a) of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 511. On July 2, 1973, appellant filed a petition to modify the compensation agreement to an award of compensation for the specific loss of use of both legs, under § 306(c), 77 P.S. § 513(25).</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.6",650,[257,910,1159,662]]]'>After hearing testimony from medical experts at a modification hearing ordered by the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board, the referee found as a fact that appellant had lost the use of both legs and awarded him the statutory compensation of $94.00 a week, for a total of 870 weeks — 410 weeks for each leg plus a 50 week healing period — retroactive to the date of the accident, with full credit to J. &amp; L. for all payments made under the compensation agreement. On appeal, the Board, in a written opinion, concluded that appellant’s injuries “have resolved to a specific loss of use of both legs” and affirmed the referee’s order. J. &amp; L. then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, and a three judge panel of that court reversed the order of the Board.</p>

This appeal, therefore, deals only with questions of law regarding how the relevant provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act are to be applied to the undisputed facts. The issues now before us are (1) whether a claimant who is factually eligible for compensation either on the basis of total disability or specific losses may elect compensation under the provision more beneficial to him; and (2) whether the Board may modify an agreement for total disability compensation to grant specific loss benefits solely on the basis of claimant’s election.</p>

Absent an improvement in appellant’s condition terminating his total disability, these payments are available for his lifetime under § 306(a) as amended in 1972.</p>
    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.5",651,[170,947,1150,419]]]'>Appellant wishes, however, to modify the agreement in order to obtain his benefits pursuant to § 306(c), 77 P.S. § 513(25), which is intended specifically to compensate a claimant for the <em>loss of use </em>of designated bodily members rather than for general loss of earning power. Under this section appellant’s weekly benefit would remain the same, but compensation would terminate at the end of 870 weeks rather than at appellant’s death or the end of his disability.</p>
    <p id="b651-5" data-blocks='[["BL_651.6",651,[171,1383,1151,309]]]'>In the usual case total disability payment would be the most beneficial to a claimant, since its payment is not limited to a term of weeks as is specific loss payment.

    <p id="b651-6" data-blocks='[["BL_651.7",651,[173,1710,1152,631]],["BL_652.1",652,[239,299,1157,245]]]'>Appellant’s primary concern is to maximize his monthly income. Appellant receives a permanent incapacity pension of $197.00 per month under the Basic Steel Agreement to which, as a union member, he is a party. The agreement provides that when the employee reaches age 65, any amount received pursuant to Workmen’s Compensation law must be deducted from that pension amount. Those fixed statutory payments for loss of bodily members; however, are specifically excepted. Thus, if appellant — now aged 65 — receives his compensation as total disability under § 306(a), his pension of $197.00 per month will be entirely eliminated by the set-off of $94.00 per week received as <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>Workmen’s Compensation. Under an award for specific loss pursuant to section 306(c), however, the pension will not be affected. Therefore, modification of the original agreement will in effect provide appellant with $197.00 per month more than he can now receive.</p>
    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[237,572,1158,570]]]'>In addition, appellant is looking to the effects of a modification on his survivors. Under a 1972 amendment to § 306(g) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 541, upon the death of the injured employee specific loss benefits awarded under § 306(c) continue to be payable to designated dependents for the full statutory term of the award, whether or not the death is caused by the compensable injury. Benefits paid pursuant to § 306(a) for total disability, however, cease at the claimant’s death unless the death was caused by the injury and occurred within 300 weeks after the accident — a reference point now passed in appellant’s case.</p>
    <p id="b652-5" data-blocks='[["BL_652.6",652,[236,1161,1156,148]]]'>For those specific reasons, it is to this appellant’s over all financial advantage to receive compensation only for the loss of two legs rather than for total disability.</p>
    <p id="b652-6" data-blocks='[["BL_652.7",652,[232,1326,1160,776]]]'>It is this unusual position which caused appellant to seek modification of the original agreement. Since total disability compensation has heretofore been considered a greater benefit than specific loss compensation, modification requests have usually arisen in either of two situations: when a claimant has alleged that his loss of use of a bodily member has developed into a total disability, entitling him to increased compensation; or when an employer has alleged that a claimant’s condition has improved to the extent that his total disability benefits may be reduced or terminated. Such cases, based as they were upon some change in the claimant’s condition, logically required that the change be proved in order to justify a modification, and it is upon this line of cases that the Commonwealth Court relied in the instant case.</p>

The cases relied on by the Commonwealth Court apply when the modification is to be based on a change of physical condition — i. e., when an altered factual situation requires the adjustment — but not when the modification is based upon a matter of statutory interpretation.</p>

As a matter of law, however, it is argued that § 306(d), 77 P.S. § 513(d), restricts one who is totally disabled to compensation under § 306(a), the provision for total disability benefits. We believe that this argument is based upon an erroneous interpretation of Section 306(d). This section provides that:</p>

In the event the employe suffers two or more permanent injuries of the above enumerated classes compensable under clause (c) of this section, he shall be compensated for the largest single healing period rather than the aggregate of the healing periods.”</blockquote>

The Commonwealth Court apparently agreed with this interpretation, for in requiring that some change of condition be shown it held <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>that appellant must establish something <em>less than </em>total disability to recover for specific loss.</p>

Moreover, also a part of this set of provisions entitled “Schedules of Compensation” is § 306(e), which provides that no compensation shall be allowed for the first seven days after disability begins; and immediately preceding § 306(d), in the last paragraph of § 306(c), the legislature defined other time periods for which benefits may be received. Placed as it is with other subsections enacted to designate when compensation is payable, subsection (d) must be read to serve the same purpose. It does not require that the factual status of total disability cease before specific loss benefits are available. In plain English, it requires that payment for specific losses not begin until the payment for temporary total disability has ended. Nothing therein can be construed to say that a claimant cannot voluntarily cut short a period of total disability payment so as to initiate a period for specific loss payments. The provision merely prohibits simultaneous payments and reduction of the number of weeks for specific loss payment.</p>

      <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>By ignoring the word “temporary” in subsection (d), appellees changed the character of this provision. When that qualifying word is included it becomes obvious that the legislature contemplated a situation in which severe but curable injuries might render a claimant <em>temporarily </em>totally disabled for a period of time after the accident. The word “temporary” assumes a natural termination of the total disability status by the eventual healing of the injuries other than the specific loss injuries, and the provision is intended only to establish the payment procedures when that healing occurs and total disability ceases, leaving claimant still factually qualified for benefits for permanent specific loss. All that must cease, under this language, is the compensation period for temporary total disability. Inherent in this provision is the assumption that no election of benefits will be necessary, because the total disability is <em>temporary </em>only, and will eventually terminate. This is not applicable to our appellant, whose total disability status is not expected to improve. No natural termination is inherent in a permanent disability, hence specific loss benefits cannot be presumed to follow in due course those for the temporary total disability. When factually the two types of benefits cannot both be available, as contemplated in circumstances to which § 306(d) is relevant, an election between the two should be permitted.</p>

Viking Theatre Corp., </em><a href="/pa/400/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="400 Pa. 27" data-case-ids="1292502" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0027-01">400 Pa. 27</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20610" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="161 A.2d 610">161 A.2d 610</a> (1960); <em>International Milling Co. v.

Both parties to this action were mistaken as to the proper application of the relevant statutory provisions when this agreement was made. In light of the liberal intent of this Act, an agreement which severely affects a claimant financially by eliminating almost $200 a month from his income is indeed materially incorrect when a substantially similar compensation under another Section for which he qualifies could preserve for him that additional income. In modifying the agreement, the referee gave appellant the election which is available to him under the statute. Certainly no injustice was done to J. &amp; L. The order was made retroactive to the initial compensation determination, and all sums already paid by appellee were ordered deducted from the modified award. In fact, the amount of weekly compensation actually remained the same. Thus, to date, J. &amp; L. stands in precisely the same position as if the order for specific loss benefits had been the order originally entered.</p>
    <p id="b658-4" data-blocks='[["BL_658.5",658,[228,1558,1158,665]]]'>The award of compensation for a 50 week healing period is likewise proper. Although Section 306(d) eliminates compensation for a healing period when temporary total disability payments have preceded the specific loss benefits, no such payments can be considered to have been made herein, since the modification order is retroactive. By making the order retroactive, the Board started the running of the statutory period of compensation for loss of two legs — 820 days — on the first day appellant received compensation, and no compensation other than for specific loss has thus been received. The provisions of § 306(c) authorizing payment for a 50 week healing period for the loss of both legs are therefore applicable.</p>
