We find neither persuasive. First, he notes that the comments to the Model Penal Code analogue to section 3921 state that “ ‘exercise’ of unauthorized<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> control is the requirement in the typical embezzlement situation where the actor already has lawful control” of property. Model Penal Code, Tent. Draft No. 2, § 206.1, comment 3. He concludes that we should require some evidence showing the accused misappropriated the automobile before the accused may be convicted under section 3921. However, the comment also states that the description “Taking or Exercise of Unlawful Control . replaces . . . ‘caption’ and ‘asportation’ as well as a great variety of current legislative terms such as steal, take, remove, carry away, <em>receive, secrete, conceal, </em>withhold, retain, fail or refuse to pay, appropriate, convert, embezzle, misapply, <em>sell, convey, transfer, dispose, pledge, use.” <a href="/citations/?q=99%20S.E.%20248" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="99 S.E. 248">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the drafters of the Model Penal Code intended that the Code’s analogue to section 3921 prohibit at least such acts of unlawful control over property <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>as receipt, use and sale, as well as its original misappropriation.

See 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a) (“Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions”). To the contrary, our construction of section 3921 accords independent scope to section 3925. Section 3903(a) imposes an enhanced penalty for conviction of theft by receiving stolen property (section 3925) in certain cases where the receiver is in the business of buying or selling stolen property.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
