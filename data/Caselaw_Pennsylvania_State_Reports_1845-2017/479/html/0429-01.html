When the point is reached where the state pays more than fifty percent of court expenses, the county may no longer be the public employer of court employees as defined in this opinion by the Court. At that time, the proper bargaining agent may well be the State Court Administrator, regardless of any legislation to the contrary since if the interest of the counties significantly diminishes, new constitutional issues, not now before us, may affect the authority of county commissioners to act as bargaining representatives for the courts. A statewide bargaining representative may be a desirable goal necessary to implement the mandate of Article 5, Section 1, of the Pennsylvania Constitution for a unified state judicial system.</p>
