Fields had been shot six times and died soon after the police <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>removed him to the hospital. In November, 1973, appellant was arrested and preliminarily arraigned on unrelated charges. Immediately following that preliminary arraignment, Starks was further detained by police for questioning concerning the shooting of Fields. Appellant quickly admitted shooting the decedent in a dispute over a drug deal. He was then charged with the murder of Fields and ultimately tried for that crime. The Commonwealth’s principal proof was the confession. Taking the stand in his own defense, Starks maintained that he did not shoot Fields. He contended that the statement was untrue and had been involuntarily given following repeated threats and beatings by the police.</p>

In response to that charge, the assistant district attorney in his closing address to the jury stated: “. . . think the worst about Detective Morris and think the worst about Detective Richardson, but for Christ’s sake, you cannot believe they were born yesterday.” Again, he adjured, “If you believe that Detective Richardson and Detective Morris engaged in beating this defendant and beat him into signing a paper that they prepared, that were not the words of this defendant, I want you to understand, I mean, I want you to send him home . . . God help us if the police are going to do what the defendant says. If that is what you believe, ladies and gentlemen, not only let the defendant go, but I would be concerned about staying around myself.” We believe that such expressions by the prosecutor indirectly conveyed his personal belief concerning critical issues at trial in violation of our established standards.

Stark’s confession, if believed, was sufficient evidence upon which to base a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

The statement allegedly volunteered by the defendant to the police and introduced at trial did indicate that a drug-related deal supplied the motive for the murder. To this extent the use of drugs as a factor in the crime was properly before the jury. Compare <em>Commonwealth v. Collins, </em><a href="/pa/462/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="462 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="485222" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0495-01">462 Pa. 495</a>, <a href="/pa/462/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="462 Pa. 495" data-case-ids="485222" data-case-paths="/pa/462/0495-01">341 A.2d 492</a> (1975).</p>

The assistant district attorney stated to the trial court that he would comment in his own argument with respect to any objections he had to the defense closing. We believe the more proper response would be to request the trial court to caution the defense attorney during the defense closing or to seek curative instructions immediately thereafter or in the court’s charge. In addition, under appropriate circumstances, defense counsel’s conduct may be the subject of contempt of court or disciplinary proceedings.</p>

We commend the trial court’s efforts to cure the prejudicial impact of the prosecutor’s summation by way of curative instructions. Such instructions are normally sufficient to remove the taint of improper argument and we encourage their use. In view of the nature and extent of improper summation in the case at bar, however, we cannot conclude that the instructions were adequate to assure appellant the fair and objective determination of his guilt or innocence to which he was constitutionally entitled.</p>
