The record reflects the court considered the scope of its sequestration order as limited to witnesses testifying during the case-in-chief, because the court inquired of the Commonwealth at the time of objection whether the testimony would only be in rebuttal and received an affirmative response.

No explanation is given us to why this procedure was employed.</p>
    <p id="b647-9" data-blocks='[["BL_647.11",647,[193,1861,1148,363]]]'>What is apparent, however, is that counsel might have reasonably believed that his Rule 1100 motion could be made after voir dire because the voir dire was not conducted by the trial judge. I would therefore order that the case be set for reargument to consider the issue of whether, under the facts of this case, trial had actually commenced for Rule 1100 purposes.</p>
