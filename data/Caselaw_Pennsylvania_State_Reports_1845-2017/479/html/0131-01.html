Moreover, there was testimony which indicated that shortly before July 6, 1975, Harris had made inquiry as to the location of the victim’s residence and that he and Everson were acquaintances. These facts are particularly significant in view of Mrs. Everson’s testimony that her husband, after responding to a <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>knock at the door, admitted the caller whom he apparently knew. It is therefore obvious that aside from direct identification testimony there was circumstantial evidence sufficient in law to permit a jury to find appellant the perpetrator of this crime. <em>Commonwealth v.

We have previously considered and accepted the admissibility of the out-of-court photographic identification.

The victim admitted the person and thereafter Mrs. Everson heard a sound which she compared to the explosion of a “firecracker”.

Another officer present seized the gun after being told by the owner of the apartment that appellant “threw it up there.” At the suppression hearing the officers testified for the Commonwealth that the gun was in plain view on the shelf.
