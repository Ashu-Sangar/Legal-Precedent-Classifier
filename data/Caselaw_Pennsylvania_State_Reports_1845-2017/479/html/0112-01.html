These three contentions bear directly on the issue of petitioner’s liability as a co-conspirator. Since this issue was fully considered by this Court in petitioner’s direct appeal, <em>Commonwealth v. McNeal, </em><a href="/pa/456/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="456 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="584417" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0394-01">456 Pa. 394</a>, 396-97, <a href="/citations/?q=319%20A.2d%20669" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="319 A.2d 669">319 A.2d 669</a>, 671-72 (1974), it is finally litigated and not open to collateral attack. 19 P.S. §§ 1180-3(d), 1180-4(a)(3) (Supp. 1977-78).</p>
    <p id="b144-5" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[275,947,1156,615]]]'>Petitioner also contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for (1) failing to submit adequate points for charge on the defense of withdrawal from conspiracy and failing to object specifically to the trial court’s instruction thereto and to pursue the issue post-trial; (2) failing to object to the remainder of the trial court’s instruction on conspiracy; (3) failing to assert a defense theory of voluntary manslaughter and failing to request an instruction on voluntary manslaughter; (4) failing to object to several comments made by the prosecutor during his opening and closing remarks. We have considered the above contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>
