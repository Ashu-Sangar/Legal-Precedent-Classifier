Also present at the time of this event was Brothers’ mother and Kent, the murder victim.

One of the special circumstances which operates as an exception to the general rule is the case where the proffered testimony tends to establish the defendant’s motive for the crime or crimes charged in the indictment on trial. <em>Commonwealth v.

Placed in this frame of reference, we cannot say the trial court was in error when it concluded the evidence of these prior acts gave sufficient ground to believe that Kent’s killing grew out of or was in some way caused by the prior incident. We conclude, therefore, that since this issue was not of arguable merit, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to raise it in post-verdict motions. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v.

The manner in which this situation arose at trial is as follows. Over defense counsel’s objection, the trial court initially (and correctly, as we have seen) decided that Brothers’ testimony discussed above was admissible. At the conclusion of Brothers’ direct examination, but before cross-examination, defense counsel moved to strike Brothers’ testimony; the prosecutor stated that, although he still maintained Brothers’ testimony was admissible, he would not oppose the motion to strike for tactical reasons. The trial court then (incorrectly) granted trial counsel’s motion to strike and gave a strong cautionary instruction to the jury to ignore completely Brothers’ testimony. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that</p>

    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.6",100,[259,874,1158,1114]]]'> In the context of the instant case, since Martin succeeded in having damaging, albeit admissible, testimony stricken, and the jury instructed to disregard it, we do not see how he has been prejudiced. Evidence which is not objectionable is clearly not a ground for declaring a mistrial. See e. g., <em>Fleischman v. Reading, </em><a href="/pa/388/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="388 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="1272562" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0183-01">388 Pa. 183</a>, 188-93, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20429" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="130 A.2d 429">130 A.2d 429</a>, 432-34 (1957). While it is true that trial counsel did not have an opportunity to cross-examine Brothers, this was because his motion to strike Brothers’ testimony was made and granted by the trial court immediately after the conclusion of Brothers’ direct examination. We are unable to say that the timing of trial counsel’s motion to strike was not a tactical decision. Furthermore, the trial court after striking the testimony gave a strong cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard it entirely. In view of the fact that such testimony was admissible, Martin received more than that to which he was entitled. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial, <em>Commonwealth v.

First, whether or not a witness is qualified as an “expert” is within the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be overturned unless clear abuse occurs. <em>Commonwealth v.

The firearms expert here was an experienced person and could be expected to have first-hand knowledge concerning the consequences to a bullet from hitting another object, whether this object be a bone inside a body or some other solid object. Thus, we see no abuse in admitting such testimony. Its credibility was, of course, for the jury. Moreover, since it was clear from other testimony that a bullet passed through Kent’s neck, spine and jaw and was extracted from his body, the actual cause of the distortion did not make any significant difference in resolving the ultimate questions in this case. Since this issue is not of arguable merit, this precludes a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to pursue it post-trial.</p>

It also bore the same license number as the arresting officer testified was that of the getaway car. Since a proper foundation for the admission of this evidence was provided, it was properly allowed.

    <p id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.8",103,[190,1127,1152,471]]]'>I dissent. The majority concludes that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue, in post-verdict motions, the issue of whether the trial court erred in allowing a prosecution witness to testify that appellant and three other persons entered his home and robbed him of $15.00. Although the majority correctly states the general law as to the admissibility of evidence of prior criminal conduct (at pp. 68), it fails to correctly apply that law to the case here. The majority says, (at p. 69):</p>
    <blockquote id="b103-7" data-blocks='[["BL_103.9",103,[235,1612,1107,413]]]'>“In the instant case, the Commonwealth maintains that evidence of Martin and three other persons taking money from Brothers; of Martin holding a shotgun on and striking Brothers with it; and, of Kent stopping the ensuing struggle between Martin and Brothers by hitting Martin with a chair is admissible to show motive, intent, and ill-will on the part of Martin, who was charged with killing Kent a mere thirteen days after this incident.”</blockquote>
    <p id="AC6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.10",103,[193,2044,1148,310]],["BL_104.1",104,[275,324,1154,394]]]'>Clearly, we are dealing in this case with the introduction of three separate and distinct facts. Only one of these facts has any relevance to the question of appellant’s motive, intent, or ill-will as directed toward the decedent, Kent. That fact is in the witness’ testimony that Kent stopped a struggle between appellant and Brothers by striking appel<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>lant with a chair. That fact was, of course, admissible. The facts indicating that the struggle between appellant and Brothers was precipitated by appellant’s commission of the crime of armed robbery were not relevant to any motive, intent, or ill-will appellant may later have formed with regard to Kent. The evidence of the commission of this crime was highly prejudicial, however, and should not have been admitted.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[274,745,1156,658]]]'>Appellant’s counsel could have prevented the prejudice caused by the witness’ statement of these irrelevant facts by seeking, prior to the witness’ testimony, an offer of proof, and then requesting the court to instruct the prosecuting attorney that the witness was not to testify as to the irrelevant prior criminal activity, but was to confine his remarks to the statement that a struggle took place which was terminated by the decedent’s act of striking appellant with a chain. The prosecution would thus have been able to present its evidence relative to appellant’s motive, intent, and ill-will toward decedent, and appellant would not have been prejudiced by the introduction of the irrelevant evidence indicating his participation in prior criminal activity.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.6",104,[273,1421,1155,249]]]'>For these reasons, I conclude that the issue was of arguable merit, and should have been raised in post-verdict motions. Failure to raise it denied appellant the effective assistance of counsel, and the case should be remanded for the filing of proper post-verdict motions raising this issue.</p>
