On June 19, 1974, a jury found appellant guilty on both counts of robbery. The court denied post-verdict motions and sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment of not less than eight months nor more than three years.

During the Commonwealth’s case-in-chief, the victim of the two robberies described the clothing worn by the robber, including a blue and white striped shirt with flowers on it, blue jeans and a rusty colored corduroy coat. During cross-examination of the witness, appellant introduced into evidence a copy of the police report made shortly after the two robberies, which contained a description of certain articles of the suspect’s clothing as reported by witnesses. Appellant took the stand and denied his involvement. Subsequently, the Commonwealth sought to recall appellant for additional cross-examination to ascertain whether, in December, 1973, he owned certain items of clothing matching the witnesses’ description. Appellant objected on the ground that these questions would violate the order suppressing clothing. Following discussion out of the hearing of the jury, the court determined the Commonwealth could question appellant as to his ownership of the clothing, limiting the questions to, the descriptions contained in the police reports completed prior to the illegal search.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

There was ample evidence that the description of the clothing worn by the perpetrator of the robberies had been ascertained from independent sources prior to the illegal search. Further, two witnesses had testified as to the articles of clothing worn by the robber. Thus, the “fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine” is inapplicable. That doctrine “excludes evidence obtained from or as a consequence of lawless official acts, not evidence obtained from an ‘independent source.’ ” <em>Costello v.

Appellant concludes the Commonwealth attempted to use and benefit by the prior illegality. While it may be true that without the illegal search the prosecutor might not have known in advance the answers to his questions, nevertheless there is no “real and direct causal relation” between the illegality and the challenged questioning so as to render the questions impermissible.

In rebuttal, the prosecution called Officer McNyck who testified concerning a conversation he had with appellant at the local Democratic Club after appellant had been charged with the four robberies and was out on bail. McNyck stated appellant had told him he had been with Betty Mattie “on the dates that the armed robberies had taken place.” The reference complained of came during cross-examination of the officer by defense counsel:</p>

The suppression court .gave no reason for summarily denying the supplemental motion, but the opinion of the trial court denying post-verdict motions states that the suppression court’s denial was based “on the ground that Rule 323 requires that all applications to suppress be filed at the same time.” The trial court refused to reconsider this ruling and, over appellant’s objection, permitted the in-court identification.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.7",220,[279,1408,1158,837]]]'>Nothing in Pa.R.Crim.P. 323 or any other of our rules of criminal procedure supports the court’s action. The only time limitation in Rule 323 is in subsection (b) which requires that an application to suppress must be filed not later than ten days before trial. Appellant sought to file the second or supplemental motion to suppress identification testimony on March 4, 1974, before the hearing on the motion to suppress clothing. Appellant’s trial was scheduled for May, 1974, but did not commence until June 18, 1974. Clearly, appellant’s request to supplement his motion to suppress clothing before hearing on that motion was well within the time requirement of Rule 323(b). Subsection (b) cannot, therefore, support the court’s denial of appellant’s timely request to supplement his motion to suppress or to file an additional motion to suppress prior to hearing on the original motion.</p>

The Commonwealth maintains that this rule applies regardless of whether a hearing has yet been held on the original motion or an adjudication rendered. In support of its position, the Commonwealth refers to the Comment to Rule 323 which reads, in part: “The rule is designed to provide one single procedure for the suppression of evidence alleged to have been <em>obtained </em>in violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights.”</p>

Appellant’s motion to suppress clothing and his timely supplemental or second motion to suppress identification testimony constitute a timely and proper “application to suppress.” Nothing in the Comment supports a contrary conclusion. Rule 323 was revised to replace a number of different rules with one inclusive pretrial suppression rule.

Appellant sought to supplement his original motion to suppress evidence with a motion to suppress other evidence before the hearing on the original motion and more than three months before commencement of trial. The record shows no reason to believe there would have been any unjustifiable delay or inconvenience in allowing a hearing on the additional motion, which on its face presents a claim of arguable merit. If the Commonwealth felt it had insufficient notice to meet appellant’s additional claim, it was within the court’s discretion to grant a postponement of the hearing, set another date for taking of additional evidence, or grant such other relief as was necessary in the interests of justice. In these circumstances, we hold the suppression court erred in refusing to hear appellant’s motion, as part of his application for relief.</p>
