Sawdy would normally be classified as her lineal descendant under the common usage of this term. However, the Commonwealth contends that the term “lineal descendant” has an artificial meaning since it is specifically defined in the “Inheritance Tax Act,” Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, Art.

It determines who qualifies as a lineal descendant and therefore receives the benefit of the six percent tax rate. As such, it is a provision imposing a tax and therefore must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1928(b)(5) (Supp.1977-78). A taxing statute must not only be strictly construed, but all reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Estate of Rose, </em><a href="/pa/465/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="465 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1712680" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0053-01">465 Pa. 53</a>, <a href="/pa/465/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="465 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1712680" data-case-paths="/pa/465/0053-01">348 A.2d 113</a> (1975).

      <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>In examining the definition of lineal descendants, we cannot forget that the terms do not exist in a vacuum. That is to say, while “lineal descendants” includes “children and their descendants,” this does not mean that one qualifies as a lineal descendant because he or she is the child of <em>anyone; </em>rather, one qualifies as a lineal descendant because he or she is the child or descendant of a <em>specific </em>person. This specific person then becomes the point of reference for the definition. The testatrix, paternal grandmother, is the point of reference when we read the definition of “lineal descendants” for this case. Therefore, the definition with the point of reference added for clarity would read:</p>

    <p id="b455-8" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[204,1238,1148,310]]]'>As a descendant of the son of testatrix, James D.

Here the grandson would qualify for the six percent tax rate on an inheritance received from his natural paternal line and might later benefit from the lower rate on an inheritance from his adoptive paternal line. While this is true, we do not deem it to be significant. The purpose of the Inheritance Tax Act indicates the legislature wished to tax close relatives at this lower rate. There is no indication that one is restricted to one paternal and one maternal line through which one may inherit and still receive the six percent tax rate. Indeed, a daughter-in-law or a son-in-law may inherit from four lines — natural mother, natural father, mother-in-law, and father-in-law — and be taxed at six per<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>cent in each case. Moreover, under the Inheritance Tax Act, if James D. Sawdy had <em>not </em>been adopted by his natural mother’s spouse but merely remained this spouse’s stepchild, he clearly would qualify for the six percent rate for inheritances from both paternal lines. 72 P.S. § 2485-102(3) (Supp.1977-78). We think it illogical to penalize James D. Sawdy simply because his second father chose to adopt him.</p>
