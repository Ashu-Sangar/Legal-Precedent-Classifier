The above convictions resulted from the October 29, 1969, robbery of a Philadelphia National Bank office in Northeast Philadelphia and the shooting death of bank guard George Bordner during the burglary and robbery. Post-verdict motions were denied on July 31, 1975. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of the first degree conviction and concurrent ten-to-twenty year sentences on each of the robbery and burglary convictions.

As appellant proceeded toward the office area, the decedent, George Bordner, rose from his chair. Upon seeing the bank guard, appellant fired three shots.

In this case the trial court incorrectly charged the jury that the appellant had the burden of proving his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. The majority concludes this was harmless error because appellant was not entitled to an insanity charge. I disagree. Once the insanity of a defendant is put in issue from whatever source, a <em>proper </em>insanity charge should be given.
