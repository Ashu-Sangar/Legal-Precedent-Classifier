A number of these aggravating circumstances, obviously, aren’t present here. Two of them are, that this specific killing occurred while in the perpetration of a felony, and undoubtedly the Commonwealth argue that that’s the case in this situation. Another is that the victim was a witness to a felony, and that he was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony. The Commonwealth may argue that, I don’t know. There may be some other issues, but I suspect those will be the ones they will be pressing. If they are successful in having the Jury find that those are present, and no mitigating circumstances present, then the death sentence will follow. So you may want to give some thought to the mitigating circumstances and the one which might apply would be the ‘age, lack of maturity, or youth of the actor at the time of the killing.’ You may want to consider advancing that as a mitigating circumstance. If the Jury finds there is a mitigating circumstance, that’s the end of it, then it’s life and the death penalty is out of the case.</blockquote>

One of the reasons for taking the recess is not only for lunch, but to give you some time to reconsider the subject. We will reconvene, and the same will start promptly. The Commonwealth will put their evidence on, if they have any; and you can present your’s [sic], if you have any.

I, Section 9 of the 1968 Constitution of Pennsylvania provides in relevant part, “In all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel . ..” The prior Constitution of December 16, 1873, as amended, November 7, 1961, contained an identical provision and by way of dicta in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Simon v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/405/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="405 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1303616" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0562-01">405 Pa. 562</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%2094" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="176 A.2d 94">176 A.2d 94</a> (1961), this Court said the right to counsel under the Pennsylvania Constitution is mandatory in capital cases and “whether the defendant desires or does not desire to be represented by counsel, an attorney must be provided in murder cases.” <a href="/pa/405/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="405 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1303616" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0562-01">405 Pa. at 564</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.2d%2094" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="176 A.2d 94">176 A.2d at 95</a>. This patently conflicts with the ruling in <em>Faretta. </em>If a criminal defendant in a state trial has the right under the Federal Constitution to waive the assistance of counsel, this right may not be curtailed by the provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Additionally, cf. Pa.R.Crim.P. 316(c). Cf. also <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Robinson v.

However, the decision to proceed without counsel must be made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. These adjectives do not merely comprise a neat cliche; instead, they establish the criteria which must be met before we can find a valid waiver.</p>
    <p id="b314-8" data-blocks='[["BL_314.9",314,[250,856,1157,762]]]'>In this case, Davis clearly believed that he had a good defense based upon the fact that he was arrested under the wrong name. In a conference in the court’s chambers, he stated, “Well, I’ve been arrested and I haven’t yet been charged, because my name is not Benjamin Davis, and I have my military discharge that will state that my name is Franklin Davis and my social security is not [ XXX-XX-XXXX ], it’s [ XXX-XX-XXXX ].” Davis later introduced his military discharge papers and only made a short summation to the jury. Since Davis was permitted to defend himself with the mistaken notion that he did not have a good defense, there was no intelligent waiver. If Davis had chosen counsel and counsel had pursued this defense, such counsel would have been ineffective. To permit Davis to unwittingly so defend himself and label it a “waiver” is unconscionable.</p>
