Sometime after the conveyance, construction was started on the site with Dick Corporation (Dick) as general contractor. In 1973, a suit in equity was filed by appellants naming Allegheny County as a defendant. Appellants alleged that because of the construction, their property, which was adjacent to the conveyed property, was being damaged by a continuing trespass in the form of water drainage.</p>

After discontinuing their suit against the County, appellants filed a similar suit naming CCAC as defendant. CCAC then joined Dick as an additional defendant. Dick in its answer stated that it was acting pursuant to plans and directions of CCAC and the State Public School Building Authority (the authority).</p>
