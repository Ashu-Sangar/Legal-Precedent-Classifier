Post-verdict motions were filed on October 8, 1975. On January 19, 1976 the post-verdict motions were withdrawn at the request of appellant and sentence was imposed. Appellant received a sentence of seven to fifteen years for the murder and a consecutive five-year sentence bf probation for the possession crime. This direct appeal, involving only the murder conviction, followed.</p>

It is true that at one point in appellant’s brief, while stating that no grounds for appeal exist (because of the withdrawal of the post-trial motions), counsel does state that he <em>might </em>argue that the appellant did not intelligently withdraw his motions. Counsel’s basis for such a claim would not be' the invalidity of the colloquy supporting the withdrawal, but rather a theory that appellant lacked the capacity to withdraw his motions because he was a “schizophrenic reaction-latent type.” There is, however, no support in the record for such an argument. Moreover, counsel concedes that appellant was “aware of what he was doing and that withdrawing the motion for a new trial was what he desired.” Appellant’s Brief at p. 8. Accordingly, I see no ground upon which to conclude that the issue addressed by the majority — the sufficiency of the waiver colloquy — was at any time placed before this Court.</p>
