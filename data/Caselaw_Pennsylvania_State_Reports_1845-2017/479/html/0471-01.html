Duffield be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two (2) years, with the right to apply for reinstatement within the last three months of the said two (2) years suspension period. While this recommendation was pending before this Court and prior to any action of this Court upon the said recommendation, Mr. Duffield, on October 7, 1975, filed an affidavit of disbarment upon consent in accordance with the then Su<a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>preme Court Rule 17-15 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> (now designated as Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement 215). As a result, on October 29, 1975, respondent was disbarred on consent in accordance with the provisions of that rule.</p>

Respondent petitioned this Court on January 3, 1977, to suspend Rule 218(b) in this matter, alleging that he had been led to believe that he would be permitted to file for reinstatement after the expiration of the two (2) year suspension period. This Court, after being satisfied that respondent’s contention was supported by the record, <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>granted the request that Rule 218(b) be suspended on January 14, 1977 and permitted respondent to file a petition for reinstatement after April 20, 1977.</p>

The two matters were consolidated by the Board for hearing and we now have before us the Report and Recommendations of the Board recommending reinstatement and the dismissal of the Petition for Discipline. After consideration of the entire record we are’ satisfied that the Board’s recommendations should be accepted and pursuant thereto we issue the following:</p>
