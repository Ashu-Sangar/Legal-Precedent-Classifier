Appellant was originally charged with murder and aggravated robbery in 1973 for the beating death of one Arthur Bock. He was tried and convicted by a jury of murder in the second-degree. Following denial of post-verdict motions, appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of ten to twenty years. Appellant’s trial counsel then took an appeal to us. On direct appeal, we affirmed the judgment of sentence. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the instant case, as in <em>Hubbard, </em>defense counsel’s omitted objection to the prosecutor’s comment was arguably important and had a reasonable chance of succeeding. Unlike <em>Hubbard, </em>however, the instant appeal is from a Post-Conviction Act hearing at which appellant’s trial counsel was asked to give his reasons for that omission. Appellant’s trial counsel explained at the PCHA hearing that such remarks were a favorite tactic of young assistant district attorneys, but that it did not strike him as a particularly effective appeal to the jury in the circumstances of this case. We cannot conclude from this explanation that trial <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>counsel acted in appellant’s best interests when he sat by idly during the prosecution’s summation to the jury.

Defendant’s trial lawyer, Joseph N. Bongiovanni, III, Esq., testified at the post-conviction hearing as to his extensive experience in the trial of criminal cases and stated that he refrained from objection because he did not believe that the prosecutor’s remarks in the circumstances of this case could have a prejudicial effect on the jury; he viewed them as but “a pseudo-dramatic flourish.” Given the absence at the time of trial of a pronouncement by this Court that statements of the sort quoted above from the Commonwealth’s closing are so flagrant that they must be deemed prejudicial, I cannot conclude, as the majority does, that defense counsel’s judgment at the time of trial is <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>to be discarded.
