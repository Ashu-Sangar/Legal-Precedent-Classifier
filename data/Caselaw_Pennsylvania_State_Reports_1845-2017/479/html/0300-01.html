Applegate executed a will on November 25, 1970, devising the residue of his estate to McDowell National Bank as trustee to divide certain properties “into two equal parts and [to] hold one part in trust for the use and benefit of my daughter, Donna Jean White, and her children and [to] hold the other part in trust for the use and benefit of the children of my son, William K. Applegate.” The will further provided that the trust established for the children of William K. Applegate “shall continue until the youngest child of the said William K. Applegate shall have attained the age of twenty-five years at which time the said trust shall terminate and the corpus thereof together with any accumulated income therefrom shall be divided equally among so many children as there are for whom the trust was established.” A corresponding clause directed that the trust established for Donna Jean White and her children “shall continue until the death of my daughter, Donna Jean White, and so long thereafter as is necessary for her youngest child to attain the age of twenty-five years at which time the said trust shall terminate and the corpus thereof together with any accumulated income therefrom shall be divided equally among so many as there are for whom the trust was established.” Thus, the instrument provided that the trustee distribute income from the corpus to Donna Jean White and the children of both Donna Jean White and William K. Applegate and divide the corpus of each trust among the grandchildren of testator when the youngest reached the age of twenty-five.</p>

On October 18, 1973, Jennifer Lee Applegate was born out of wedlock to William K. Applegate and Barbara Ann Mason. On February 4, 1974, William K.

On February 25, 1976, the trustee petitioned the orphans’ court division of the court of common pleas for a declaratory judgment to determine whether Jennifer Lee Applegate and Vivian Rose Applegate were members of the class of “children” entitled to benefits under testator’s will. The orphans’ court concluded that the class of beneficiaries closed upon the death of testator and therefore included only the four children born to William K. Applegate by his first wife because Jennifer Lee Applegate and Vivian Rose Applegate became children of William K. Applegate after testator’s death. We believe the orphans’ court erred and therefore vacate its decree and remand for further proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

As the class increased until the time of distribution of the corpus, the share of income each class member received decreased accordingly.
