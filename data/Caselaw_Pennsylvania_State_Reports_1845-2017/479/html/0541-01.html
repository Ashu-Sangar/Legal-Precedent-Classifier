The trial court struck the verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Appellant filed post-verdict motions but, before argument, the court permitted trial counsel to withdraw. New counsel filed additional motions. The court denied all motions and sentenced appellant on the murder conviction to imprisonment of ten to twenty years and fined him $500.00 and costs. The court suspended sentence on the other charges. Appellant contends that (1) insufficient evidence exists to support the verdict of guilty of murder of the third degree; (2) replacement of trial counsel on post-verdict motions denied him effective assistance of counsel and equal protection; (3) the prosecutor committed reversible error when he cross-examined appellant concerning his failure to call certain witnesses; (4) the court erroneously charged the jury that appellant had the burden of proving self-defense; and (5) the verdict of guilty of both murder of the third degree and voluntary manslaughter was contrary to law.

Appellant moved out of their residénce and into a local YMCA. On June 24, 1974, appellant sought out Brown at a service station, where he discovered her in a phone booth. Appellant called for her to come out, but she refused. Appellant then began to approach her. Brown drew a pistol, pointed it at the ground and fired. Appellant retreated to his car and drove away. Ten minutes later, appellant returned with a gun. Brown ran into the station garage, pursued by appellant. It is unclear whether Brown fired another shot as appellant advanced towards her. Appellant entered the garage, grabbed Brown, threw her to the floor and announced, “Bitch, this is it.” Appellant leveled his gun at her head and fired five shots, striking her four times. Appellant then ran outside and fled in his car. This evidence is sufficient to support the verdict of guilty of murder of the third degree. See <em>Commonwealth v.

Indeed, new counsel filed supplemental post-verdict motions raising the issues upon which appellant now relies, whereas trial counsel filed only boilerplate motions.

In the course of that side bar discussion, defense counsel indicated that he “ . did not hear . . . ” the court charge the jury regarding the “ . . . degree of proof necessary for [the jury] to entertain the defense of self-defense properly.” The trial judge then summarized his thinking as to the allocation of the burden of proving self-defense, and asked defense counsel if he was requesting the court to charge that defendant had the burden of proving self-defense by a preponderance of the evidence.

Where a defendant sets up self-defense, as was done in this case, to justify or excuse a killing, the evidence relied upon, whether it comes from his side of the case or from the Commonwealth’s side, or from both, must be weighed by you in determining whether the Commonwealth has met its burden of proof. Hence you may find the defendant guilty only if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was not justified under the circumstances in reasonably believing that the use of deadly force was then and there necessary to protect himself against death or serious bodily injury. On the other hand, if you are not so satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt then you may find that self-defense has been established, that the killing was justifiable and, therefore, acquit the defendant on all of the homicide charges.”</p>
