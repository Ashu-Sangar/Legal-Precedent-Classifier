Mayhew died seized of real estate in Philadelphia and elsewhere, which she devised as follows: “I give and bequeath to my said daughter Gertrude Estelle Mayhew all my personal property and the interest of all real estate belonging to me, as long as she lives, but if my said daughter Gertrude Estelle Mayhew should marry, then at her death the interest of my real estate goes to her issue.</p>

Eleanor, one of the six, instituted proceedings to parti<a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>tion the real estate; in this she was joined by four of the other children. Gertrude P. Kuser, the sixth child, objected to it because her children, five in number, were not made parties to the proceeding, claiming that they had an interest in the estate and that unless they were so made parties a proper partition could not be had. The basis of her claim was that the word “issue” used in the will of her grandmother, “without explanatory or qualifying words, or the will failing to indicate a different meaning, means that descendants of all degrees of consanguinity” are to share equally, or per capita.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[183,939,1155,1241]]]'>The life tenant was survived by six living children and no issue of deceased children. Of these six living children, Mary had one child, Charles two, Margaret four, Francis none, Eleanor none, and Gertrude, the real appellant, five. The children and grandchildren of the life tenant together number eighteen, and it will readily be seen that under the appellant’s contention as to the testatrix’s meaning of “issue,” Gertrude Kuser and her children would receive six-eighteenths or one-third of the whole estate, and the other branches of the family varying shares in proportion to the number of children in each at the death of the life tenant. Eleanor, the unmarried child of the life tenant, and Francis, married but without children, would each receive but one-eighteenth. The court below denied appellant’s claim and held that “issue” as used by the testatrix meant that where there are children of the life tenant and also living children of these children (grandchildren of the life tenant), such children of the life tenant were intended to take to the exclusion of their issue. In other words, that the proper distribution is per stirpes and not per capita. Gertrude Kuser, by the guardian of her children appointed ad litem, has appealed.</p>

Where words used might under a given construction lead to a result that is highly improbable, the court will lean toward q <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>construction that will carry out the natural intention of the testator. See 6 Illinois Law Eeview 230. But, of course, where the meaning of the testator may be ascertained from the will, it must govern. Here the word “issue” is neither qualified, explained nor modified by any context, and this court must for the first time fully decide the construction to be given the word when used as it .is in the will now before us. The courts of other states and of England have considered this matter, and two conflicting rules have been evolved as a result.</p>
    <p id="b112-5" data-blocks='[["BL_112.5",112,[295,884,1153,853]]]'>Testatrix created a life estate, with a remainder to the “issue” of the life tenant.

Superior Ct. 404</a>. Did she mean that the remainder was to be divided equally among the living children of the life tenant, and if a child was deceased, go per stirpes to its issue; or did she mean, as appellant contends, that the remainder should be divided into equal parts and distributed indiscriminately per capita among all of the children, grandchildren, or perhaps great-grandchildren alike? Did she by “issue” mean that all descendants of every degree of consanguinity should share alike per capita? It seems that to state the latter question is to answer it, for anything more contrary to a presumed testamentary intent can' scarcely be imagined; yet there is authority of note which supports the affirmative of this proposition'.</p>

Prior to this act, one of the courts of that state expressed its opinion that its construction of “issue” did violence to the intent of the testator. See Petry v.

Ordinarily, a testator in creating a life estate for one as the special object of his bounty (if that object is to continue within his special care) would next naturally consider only the'immediate issue of such life tenant, that is, his children. A parent’s solicitation is usually paramount for his child, for grandchildren it is not so intent, and for great-grandchildren still further removed. Here, the testatrix provided for her daughter for life, and at her death she might naturally be expected to look after her daughter’s children; but assuredly her inclination would not be to go to remoter degrees in search of beneficiaries, nor should any artificial rule of construction or any forced interpretation of the words she used carry the intent to that extent. We therefore agree with the growing majority of states which hold that where the word “descendants” or “issue” is unexplained in the context of the instrument, children do not take concurrently or per <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>capita with their parents, but take per stirpes.

Courts were formerly inclined to construe it in this way, as heirs of the body or descendants'"; but this construction arose generally in cases where the rule in Shelley’s Case was involved.

That rule was for a long time in our judicial history much favored, with the result that courts often used its reasoning and effect in other circumstances or under other conditions where such application might be said to be questionable. From such cases as these; there crept into our books numerous statements to the effect that issue meant heirs of the body. See Gest v. Way, <a href="/whart/2/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="2 Whart. 445" data-case-ids="1830447" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0445-01">2 Whart. 445</a>; Miller’s App., <a href="/pa/52/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="52 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1002262" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0113-01">52 Pa. 113</a>; Taylor v.

But in all of these cases it is important to note that there follows immediately after the broad generalization the qualification that “issue” will not be so construed where there is anything present to show a contrary intention. Hence, the artificial conclusion to the effect that “issue” meant “heirs of the body” reached by early courts, influenced by a leaning toward the rule in Shelley’s Case, can no <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>longer be regarded as. applicable in interpreting the word where the context of the will does not lead to. such conclusion. ! Where a user has failed to make clear in what sense he has used the word, it is not at all surprising that courts have reached opposite conclusions, and it is only by following the results with the apparent considerations that must have been in testator’s mind that one comes to a just and equitable decision.</p>
