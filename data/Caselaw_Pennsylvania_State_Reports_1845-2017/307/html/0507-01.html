Defendant, aged forty-nine, lived on the opposite side of the street at number 1841. Between one and two o’clock, April 12 1930, defendant’s ten-year-old daughter and the four-year-old son of the decedent Miller had some childish altercation in the street. Miller was playing cards on a door step near by, when his attention was drawn by his small son to their quarrel. He gave the child a stick and told him to strike the girl. Then, defendant’s son — aged eighteen, — approached Miller (described as a “pretty large” man) and remonstrated, whereupon Miller struck him in the face and knocked hi'm down on the payment twice, the second time leaving him unconscious. The young man was assisted into his house, not however until his mother, wife of defendant, attacked or attempted to attack Miller. In the afternoon Miller went to a ball game. During the day, defendant had been working on his farm some distance away. He came home between four and five o’clock; he, himself, fixed the time at 4: 45. He found his wife much agitated, and on inquiring the reason, was informed by her of the circumstances in which Miller had assaulted their son. Several witnesses <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>testified that after he came home they heard him threaten to shoot Miller. Shortly after 5:30, Miller returned from the ball game. As he stood on the front step of his house, intending to enter, defendant came out of his house with a shotgun and shot Miller. The records of the police station show that the shooting was reported there by telephone at 5: 45. The evidence is not clear whether the shell discharged by the gun was loaded with buck shot or smaller shot.</p>

Com., 65 Pa. 5L Probably as a result of the decision in Schoeppe’s Case, the Act of February 15, 1870, P. L. 15, was passed, creating a “radical change in our criminal jurisprudence,” as this court said in that case, and providing for appeal without special leave, a provision subsequently incorporated in the Constitution. The Act of 1874, P. L. 219, reenacted this right and provided for exceptions as in civil cases. The next important change came with the Act of April 22, 1903, P.

P. Law. Rev. 14. The most recent enlargement of the scope of review is contained in the Act of May 14, 1925, 14 P. L. 759, under which defendant was sentenced. The pertinent words, now for consideration, are “......In cases of pleas of guilty, the court, where it determines the crime to be murder of the first degree, shall at its discretion impose sentence of death or imprisonment for life.” By the act (another “very radical change in the law:” Com. v. Madaffer, <a href="/pa/291/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="291 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1107314" data-case-paths="/pa/291/0270-01">291 Pa. 270</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20875" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="139 A. 875">139 A. 875</a>), the legislature recognized and established degrees of culpability, provided two possible penalties, and vested the jury with discretion to determine by its verdict which of the two should be inflicted; it also provided that, on a plea of guilty, the court must determine the appropriate penalty and impose sentence accordingly.</p>

Appellant’s brief states the following fact, not contradicted by the Commonwealth. “This case was heard, and, without argument of counsel on either side, the learned trial judge immediately, upon the conclusion of the hearing of the testimony, entered the judgment of guilty of murder in the first degree and immediately sentenced the defendant to death.” We are all of opinion that the gravity of the duty to be performed in such cases requires that the judge who hears the evidence on a plea of guilty, should at least make and file a brief memorandum which will reveal the reasons for the sentence imposed. That procedure will .not only facilitate review to determine whether the legislative mandate has been complied with, but will also make it unnecessary for this court to return the record for a written opinion pursuant to Rule 58. As this is the first appeal challenging the penalty imposed pursuant to the statute, we shall dispose of it without delaying decision by remitting the record for such opinion.</p>

This is the case of an industrious man without criminal record, whose character as a peaceful law-abiding citizen was testified to by a number of persons. After he returned from his day’s work and found his wife and son in the condition described, he committed the crime under the resulting provocation, and in circumstances, which, we think, place him within the legislative classification requiring the milder of the two possible sentences. The imposition of a sentence of death, instead of life imprisonment, was such abuse of discretion as to require modification by resentence. We <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>are not commuting the sentence or otherwise performing the duty of the pardon board. “To reduce a sentence by amendment alters the terms of the judgment itself and is a judicial act as much as the imposition of the sentence in the first instance U.
