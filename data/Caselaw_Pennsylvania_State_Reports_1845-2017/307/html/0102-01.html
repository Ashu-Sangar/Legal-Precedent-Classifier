    <p id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[185,803,1153,808]]]'>Article 3, section 23, of the Constitution provides that the power to change the venue in civil and criminal cases shall be vested in the courts, and that it be exercised in such manner as shall be provided by law. It is the duty of the person whose cause comes within those named by the legislature to comply strictly with the statutory provisions in determining the right to have his cause heard by another judge or in another county: Little v. Wyoming Co., <a href="/pa/214/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="214 Pa. 596" data-case-ids="946001" data-case-paths="/pa/214/0596-01">214 Pa. 596</a>, 599.

However, the Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 363 controls this case. Section 3 of that act reads: “Whenever by reason of sickness, absence, interest, or other cause......a judge of a court of common pleas in a judicial district having no orphans’ court, may be unable to sit in any matter depending on the orphans’ court of such district......it shall be lawful for said judge to call upon any judge ......to preside in and determine such matter.” Venango County has no separate orphans’ court and is within this class.</p>

The fact that the judge was not called in to pass on the main question involved, but only a subsidiary point, the decision of which had no bearing on the substantive question involved, will not take the question out of the apparent scope of the act. There is no conflict between this act and its predecessors which affects the matter before us. The Act of 1917 enlarges, as to orphans’ courts, the causes for which change of the hearing judge may be had, and would seem to embrace any reason. Moreover, it specifically permits the calling in of any judge in the Commonwealth.</p>
    <p id="b132-5" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[291,1062,1150,520]]]'>The only question open to us is whether the appellant has brought himself within the terms of the statute by presenting a cause which would render the judge unable to sit in the matter pending before him. The proper practice on a plea of prejudice is to address an application by petition to the judge before whom the proceedings are being tried. He may determine the question in the first instance, and ordinarily his disposition of it will not be disturbed unless there is an abuse of discretion.</p>

But, while the mediation of courts is based upon the principle of judicial impartiality, disinterestedness, and fairness pervading the whole system of judicature, so that courts may as near as possible be above suspicion, there is, on the other side, an important issue at stake; that is, that causes may not be unfairly prejudiced, unduly delayed, or discontent created through unfounded charges of prejudice or unfairness made against the judge in the trial of a cause. It is of great importance to the administration of justice that such should not occur. If the judge feels that he can hear and dispose of the case fairly and without prejudice, his decision will be final <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>unless there is an abuse of discretion. This must be so for the security of the bench and the successful administration of justice. Otherwise, unfounded and ofttimes malicious charges made during the trial by bold and unscrupulous advocates might be fatal to a cause, or litigation might be unfairly and improperly held up awaiting the decision of such a question or the assignment of another judge to try the case. If lightly countenanced, such practice might be resorted to, thereby tending to discredit the judicial system. The conscience of the judge alone is brought in question; he should, as far as possible, avoid any feeling of unfairness or hostility to the litigants in a case. If the judge wishes a full exposition of the question of unfairness, he may follow the unusual practice of Judge Parker and summon another judge to decide it, but he is not required to do so.</p>

To sustain the charge, the exceptant is not limited to the instant case, but he may show personal ill will to client or counsel, or temperamental prejudice on the particular class of litigation involved, or any other recognized ground. The charge of disqualification is serious and should not be made lightly or frivolously. Yet the suitors and counsel should be free of embarrassment in making such charge when just ground exists; and where the judge whose fairness has been challenged submits the case to the determination of another judge, the door is thrown open for proof of the charges as it would be if he had heard the case.</p>

    <p id="b134-5" data-blocks='[["BL_134.5",134,[301,497,1155,1562]]]'>Dr. Crawford died testate in 1925, having given his residuary estate “to and for the benefit of the fatherless children of France.” The heirs contested the will and the French Embassy employed Hastings to resist their claim. He was to be paid on a contingent basis, only if a fund should be secured for the benefit of the French orphans. Pursuant to such employment, he entered his appearance for the French National Committee of Childhood, a department of the French Republic, and thereafter conducted the litigation successfully before the auditor, the Orphans’ Court of Yenango County, and this court. See Crawford’s Est., <a href="/pa/294/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="294 Pa. 201" data-case-ids="1113393" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0201-01">294 Pa. 201</a>. The estate amounted to approximately $200,000 and the residuary estate awarded for the benefit of the French orphans was $72,861.49. The French Embassy petitioned the orphans’ court to pay Hastings the sum of $10,000 as a reasonable fee. This petition was presented in January, 1929, and in August the court dismissed the embassy petition and invited Mr. Hastings to present his own petition. However, the court later reinstated the original petition and held hearings as to the reasonableness of such fee. This was on November 15, 1929, when fourteen members of the local bar testified that the fee was reasonable. The case was not decided for many months when Mr. Hastings presented his petition alleging the disqualification of Judge Parker. The effect of this has already been discussed. Judge Parker, on October 4, 1980, finally awarded a fee of $4,000 and expenses of $120.00.</p>
