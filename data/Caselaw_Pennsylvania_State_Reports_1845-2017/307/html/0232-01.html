Marzolf and Charles Marzolf in favor of Bobert E. Austen on a nonnegotiable judgment note dated February 1, 1926, payable ten days after date. On May 11, 1927, Charles Marzolf presented his petition alleging his signature was a forgery, made without his knowledge or direction and without consideration to him, and a rule was granted on the plaintiff to show cause why the judgment should not be opened as to Charles Marzolf and he permitted to defend. An answer was filed by plaintiff and testimony taken. The court refused to open the judgment and discharged the rule on April 18,1928. On appeal by defendant to this court we reversed the order of the lower court and made absolute the rule to open the judgment: Austen v. Marzolf, <a href="/pa/294/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="294 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1113450" data-case-paths="/pa/294/0226-01">294 Pa. 226</a>.</p>

Plaintiff introduced evidence of consideration to John A. Marzolf, the other defendant, and delivery by him of the note in question. There was also testimony of expert witnesses as to the genuineness of the signature of Charles Marzolf. The note in question was admitted in evidence over defendant’s objection; in addition plaintiff attempted to introduce the record of the entry of judgment, but the trial judge properly excluded this; under the authority of Harris v. Harris, <a href="/pa/154/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="154 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="842396" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0501-01">154 Pa. 501</a>.

Castner, <a href="/pa-super/21/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="21 Pa. Super. 294" data-case-ids="844346" data-case-paths="/pa-super/21/0294-01">supra,</a> page 330. Evidence by competent witnesses as to the genuineness of the signature raises a question of fact for the jury, and the note is then admissible in evidence : Depew v.

Moreover, once plaintiff has proved the signature, consideration and delivery may be presumed from the fact that the instrument is under seal. In Sigfried v. Levan, 6 S. &amp; R. 310, which was an action of debt upon a bond, the defendant having pleaded “non <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>est factum,” this court said: “Proof of the handwriting is sufficient to enable the jury to presume, in such case, that sealing and delivery took place, although the handwriting does not import sealing and delivery; it is not only proof of the obligor’s signature, but it is presumption that it is a deed executed....... Where the handwriting of the obligor is proved, it is evidence of everything in favor of the instrument.” To the same effect are Hamsher v. Kline, <a href="/pa/57/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="57 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1010464" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0397-01">57 Pa. 397</a>, and Miller v.

They do not affect the Avell established rule that, where the judgment has been opened generally, it is competent for defendant to make any legal defense: Whitmire v.

In other words, a plaintiff who relies upon a sealed instrument is not obliged to prove consideration to take the case to the jury. The seal imports consideration: Mack’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="68 Pa. 231" data-case-ids="1024564" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0231-01">68 Pa. 231</a>. Nevertheless, where the judgment has been opened generally on the ground of forgery, it is competent for defendant to raise the question of consideration, despite the presence of the seal.
