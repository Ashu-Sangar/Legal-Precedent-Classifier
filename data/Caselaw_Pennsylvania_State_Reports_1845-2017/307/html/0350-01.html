The Tarentum Savings &amp; Trust Company, executor, filed its account, claiming credit, among other things, for payment of $9,016.84 upon a note to Peoples National Bank of Tarentum, the appellant. The guardian ad litem appointed for the minor legatees under the will objected to this credit, and, after hearing, the learned court below disallowed it and surcharged the executor with the amount. From this decree Peoples National Bank of Tarentum appealed, assigning the disallowance of the credit as error.</p>

      <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>The nóte in question was a judgment note for $10,000, made by the R. C. &amp; K. Beverage Company, by S. B. Cunningham, secretary and treasurer. It is dated February 25, 1928, payable four months after date, and endorsed by D. H. Beardon, S. B. Cunningham and A. E. Kelley, directors and owners of all the stock of the company. The note matured June 25,1928, and was not protested, nor was any notice of dishonor given to the endorsers. Interest on the note was paid by the company, which is a corporation formed in 1926 in succession to a partnership composed of the same parties. The company is still doing business. Daniel H. Beardon, one of the endorsers, died April 9, 1928, which was before the maturity of the note. His widow was executrix and sole legatee under his will, and received an estate valued at a sum slightly in excess of $5,000. The Peoples National Bank also held a collateral note of Mr. Beardon for $3,000, which became due August 3, 1928. At that time Mrs. Beardon called at the bank and gave her note to take its place, pledging as security certain shares of stock, and she then agreed to take her husband’s place on the $10,000 note of the company — of which she had been, after Mr. Reardon’s death, elected a director — in consideration of the bank’s not presenting the note ás a claim against his estate, but by some oversight she did not endorse it. Her note for $3,000 has been paid by her executor, and the shares of stock pledged as collateral surrendered to it.</p>

C. &amp; K. Company for $20,000, covering its real estate and plant, and executed a declaration that this bond and mortgage were taken to secure the $10,000 note held by the Peoples National Bank, and also two other notes of the company, for $1,200 and $8,500, held by itself, and for which renewal notes had been given endorsed by Cunningham, Kelley and Mrs. Beardon as sureties. No action has been taken by the mortgagee, <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>which is also the executor of Mrs. Reardon’s estate and the present accountant, on the bond or mortgage, although no interest on the mortgage debt has been paid by the mortgagor, R. C. &amp; K. Company. Instead, the Tarentum Savings &amp; Trust Company, as executor, paid all these obligations of the R. C. &amp; K. Company out of Mrs. Reardon’s estate, and claimed credit therefor in its account. The court below disallowed these credits and no appeal has been taken from the disallowance of the two notes aggregating $9,700, this appeal having been taken solely from the disallowance of the payment made on the $10,000 note to the Peoples National Bank, on September 25, 1930, at which time the executor required a refunding receipt. This payment was made almost two months after the filing of the executor’s account.</p>

Superior Ct. 125</a>, that Reardon was liable, because, as a director and stockholder of the company, there was sufficient consideration for a promise by him to pay its obligation, and since such contract would serve his own interest it was not within the statute and need not be in writing. The cases cited as authority are not in point, because there those charged with liability were sureties who had bound themselves to pay the corporate obligation, whereas, in the case at bar, there is no contract of guaranty or sure<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>tyship, but mei*ely an endorsement, which cannot be construed into á parol contract of guaranty (Wilson v.

    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[297,844,1150,533]]]'>Appellant also contends that Reardon was liable upon the note because it was a renewal of an obligation incurred by the partnership of which he was a member before its incorporation in 1926. The answer to this contention is that there is not a word in the record to support it. The note was made February 25, 1928, long after the incorporation of the company, and there is no testimony that it was given to replace or renew any prior <em>indebtedness; </em>so far as is shown by the record it was an original undertaking.</p>

This argument is the same as that made to establish Reardon’s liability, and it must fall for the same reason. The decedent’s only promise'was to endorse the note and take her husband’s place thereon; there is no evidence to support appellant’s argument that her agreement was to pay this debt of the company. Even if the endorsement had been made, it could not be given effect as a parol contract of guaranty. As her agreement was to assume her husband’s liability on the note, and since he was not liable to pay it, her assumption of liability could have no effect. There is no force in appellant’s contention that she conceded her husband’s liability; and that it is now too late for her estate to raise the question. Her action in making the agreement was as fully consonant with a desire to assume whatever liability he may have had on the note <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>as with an admission that it constituted a valid debt of Ms estate.</p>
