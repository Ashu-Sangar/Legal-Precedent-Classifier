Defendant contends (1) that it took the due bill for value without actual knowledge of invalidity, or knowledge of facts imputing bad faith; (2) that if the due bill was invalid when issued, the transaction was subsequently ratified; (3) that, in any event, as defendant was acting with another as coexecutor in receiving the due bill, the defendant alone is not liable.

In order that the facts may fully appear to show the theory of appellee, we state them substantially as given in appellee’s brief, slightly condensing the statement. On March 18, 1929, Frederick M. Mitchell, co-executor of the Henry F. Mitchell estate, telephoned Brown, counsel for the estate, that he had an offer from McCulloch to buy 700 shares of Union Bank stock owned by the estate, and asked him to negotiate with McCulloch. Brown telephoned Bishop, vice-president of defendant, coexecutor, told him of the offer, and procured authority to represent the estate in the transaction. Mc-Culloch, then president of Union Bank, told Brown that he wished to buy the stock personally and expected to make a profit out of it, “had a deal on,” and offered $300 a share. Later that day, Brown received an offer of $350 per share from E. B. Smith &amp; Company, and after Mc-Culloch had increased his bid to meet this offer, E. B. Smith &amp; Company made a firm offer of $400 per share. On March 19th, when advised of this offer, McCulloch told Brown that he would take the stock at that price, and inquired how long it would be before he would have to pay for it; Brown answered he thought McCulloch would have almost ten days. A purchase and sale memorandum was signed by McCulloch and Brown dated March 19th. On March 25th, Bishop advised Brown that the stock had been delivered and paid for and the $280,000 had been entered on defendant’s books to the credit of Mitchell estate.</p>

McCulloch told Fairlamb at the time that he had arranged for a loan to take up and make good the clearing house due bill, which loan he would receive that day.

Burton then made out the due bill, and delivered it to the messenger of defendant. Fairlamb then handed the stock to McCulloch. Fairlamb was not a director of Union Bank and had no authority to issue the due bill. No money was received from McCulloch on that day or later to take up the charge and the due bill was entered and thereafter carried as a cash item in an account known as “city checks and other cash items.” The due bill was <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>paid to defendant through the clearing house out of funds of Union Bank.

Fairlamb in turn delivered the note to Burton; and the same has since been carried in the note teller’s department as cash. The brown ledger charge was thereupon destroyed by Fairlamb. McCulloch never arranged for a loan with Union Bank; and the McCulloch note was never authorized or formally ratified by the directors or the finance committee of Union Bank; nor was a loan of $280,000 to McCulloch ever authorized by the directors or finance committee of Union Bank.</p>

Members issuing due bills shall have inserted names or clearing house numbers of the institutions through which they are to be cleared. A member shall give these due bills to other member institutions upon demand, in payment of items at their counter, when the amount exceeds $500.” Plaintiff, in its reply, admitted that “bank due bills are so largely and generally used in the payment or settlement of debts and in other commercial transactions, that they have acquired the characteristics of cash, and, when drawn, signed and issued by the officers duly authorized to issue the same, they become absolute undertakings of the bank issuing them and an appropriation of its credit in the. clearing house to which the due bill is presented and through which it is settled.”</p>

These words from section 5, are the same as those used in section 56 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and should have the same construction in the interest of desirable uniformity in the construction of commercial paper. As the instrument was good on its face, there was no apparent reason for inquiry; it remained good until shown to have been taken in “bad faith,” and the burden of proving that was on plaintiff. On this subject, the learned trial judge said: “In the case at bar we find that the payee had knowledge of such facts that his [its] action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith, and so was bound to inquire whether • the fiduciary was committing a breach of his obligation as fiduciary in drawing or delivering the instrument....... The test in a case like the present one, where bank funds are used to pay the personal indebtedness of a bank officer*, is that of ‘duty of inquiry’ and not that of bad faith.” If the evidence supported the finding that defendant “payee had knowledge of such facts that [its] action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith,” it would have been dishonest to take the due bill because of this subjective bad faith, and, that fact established, inquiry would have elicited nothing more, and would have no further place in the problem, and plaintiff’s right to get back its money would be established; this would follow, not because no inquiry was made, but because of defendant’s knowledge of the officer’s breach of trust without inquiry. Inquiry is unnecessary if a payee already knows the facts; it may be necessary when the facts are not known. When it is decided that inquiry should have been made, and was not, a taker will be held to have <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>acted in bad faith, if inquiry should have elicited the officer’s misappropriation; a payee is not excused for not discovering what he could so have learned. As, earlier in his adjudication, the judge had made a definite finding of fact that “defendant failed to make any inquiry whatever into the authority of McCulloch,” and apparently put his decision on that ground, it may be that what was said about ‘bad faith,’ in the extract quoted above, was intended to be an inference from the finding of fact that no inquiry was made. But, that merely brings the question back to the starting point without demonstrating anything, because there was nothing on the face of the due bill to make inquiry necessary; under the statute, it was unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b523-3" data-blocks='[["BL_523.4",523,[171,1122,1154,1287]],["BL_524.1",524,[310,357,1152,1719]]]'>Laying the due bill aside, then, is there evidence of bad faith in the record? We can find none. When the evidence is examined, it is manifest that defendant acted in good faith from beginning to end; there was no motive for or profit in wrongdoing. Section 1 of the act provides that “A thing is done ‘in good faith’ within the meaning of this act, when it is in fact done honestly, whether done negligently or not.” The executors delivered the stock at the same price for which they had a bid in competition with McCulloch’s; defendant gave value for the due bill. It is reasonable to assume that if the executors had doubted McCulloch’s integrity, they would have sold to Smith &amp; Co. and not to a buyer whose standing was questionable. Appellee says that there was newspaper publicity on March 21st, the day before the delivery of the stock, that the Union Bank had had “business dealing with alleged bootleggers and a rum-ring,” which should have put defendant on notice that there was something wrong; that “publicity” amounts to nothing as evidence of notice in a transaction like that before us: Chemical Nat. Bank v. Tuttle, 2 Sad. 328, see page 333; 46 C. J., page 549. It is also suggested that some inference should be made against appellant because it first asked for a certified check or bank check <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>or due bill, and in the letter transmitting the stock for delivery, asked for a due bill to the order of the Mitchell estate or to itself. In view of the admitted general use of such clearing house due bills as cash, that request will not support an inference of bad faith; on the contrary, if the subject was thought of at all, appellant knew that the clearing house rules required the certificate of two persons (neither being McCulloch) to the lawful issue of a due bill. McCulloch did not transfer the bank’s funds to the defendant. The mere fact that a bank officer was buying something and using the facilities of his bank to make payment, will certainly not support an inference of bad faith or wrongdoing; the statute recognizes that an officer of a bank may be a customer of the bank (Act of June 14, 1901, P. L. 561, amended April 26, 1929, P. L. 812), and the Uniform Fiduciaries Act is drawn with that fact in contemplation; part of the business of a bank is paying money on behalf of its customers to persons to whom it is not indebted. But appellee says, delivery of the stock was made on the fifth day after Brown received authority from the executors to act, instead of taking almost ten days as he told Mc-Culloch might be required; surely bad faith in taking the due bill cannot be predicated of diligence in performing the executoi*’s duty to convert an asset of their estate. Defendant had no interest in the stock or in its sale, except as coexecutor; the proceeds of the due bill would not belong to defendant; it knew nothing about McCulloch’s arrangement with Yice-President Fair-lamb ; it was entitled, for aught that appears, to assume that the registered fiduciaries, Frank and Brown, would not violate their trusts.</p>

He gave no instructions to Frank or Burton; their instructions came from the vice-president and treasurer.

It quotes the general rule stated in Fehr v. Campbell, <a href="/pa/288/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="288 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="1100844" data-case-paths="/pa/288/0549-01">288 Pa. 549</a>, that one who takes “negotiable paper which appears to be, or which the taker knows to be, the property of a corporation, for the purpose of applying such paper to the personal use of one of the officers of such corporation, or of a third party, is bound to inquire as to the authority of the officer to make such use of the paper, and if no inquiry be made, the taker is held as though he had knowledge of all that inquiry would have revealed.” That rule was applicable in Fehr v. Campbell, because the note in question, the property of a corporation, was transferred for less than its face by the president of the corporation, with the understanding that the transferee, when he collected it from the maker, should use part of the proceeds to pay a debt due himself by the president of the corporation who conducted the negotiation. But the express terms of that rule exclude its application to the present case, because this instrument was drawn by designated fiduciaries, who were in no wise interested in the obligation which it paid; McCulloch, the president was not a party to it. <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>That rule might apply if McCulloch had given a cheek or draft signed by him, as president, on funds of Union Bank in its depository; such an instrument would then have carried on its face notice of his breach of trust.

It was also applied in Schmitt v. Potter Title &amp; Trust Co., <a href="/citations/?q=61%20Pa.%20Super.%20310" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="61 Pa. Super. 310">61 Pa. Superior Ct. 310</a>, in which the officer of a corporation (one, Coleman) in his official capacity drew checks on the corporation’s bank account and with them paid his debts; here, too, there was warning of possible breach of authority on the face of the paper. But it cannot be said, as appellee suggests, that it appears that McCulloch was using the bank’s funds to pay his debts, in the sense in which personal debts of an officer were shown by the face of the instrument to be paid in any of the three cases mentioned. Another of Coleman’s reported transactions may, however, be referred to at this point to illustrate the rule that is applicable to the present case: Schmitt v. Mellon Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa-super/67/0453-02" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="67 Pa. Super. 453" data-case-ids="629113,629187,629202" data-case-paths="/pa-super/67/0453-02,/pa-super/67/0453-03,/pa-super/67/0453-01">67 Pa. Superior Ct. 453</a>. Coleman, as treasurer of a corporation, drew a corporate check specifically showing on its face that it was given to pay his personal debt. Notwithstanding that warning, the check was certified by the drawee bank; it came into the hands of defendant who collected it for a forwarding bank. On the failure of Coleman’s corporation, the receiver sued to recover on the ground “that the check bore upon its face the evidence that Coleman was using the funds of his company to pay his personal debt and that the Mellon Bank was therefore put upon inquiry,” etc. But it was properly held that the “certification is equivalent to an acceptance” (section 187 Neg. Inst. Law, 1901, P. L. <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>194); that “When the trust company [drawee] certified the check it became responsible for its payment. ...... When this check came into the hands of the Mellon Bank duly certified it was not concerned as to the relations, between Coleman and the corporation of which he was treasurer.” The statute relieved defendant bank from inquiring whether Coleman and his company had agreed that he should pay his debt by using the funds of the corporation, or whether he was misappropriating its funds.

The great volume of the commercial transactions of the country requires the use of checks, drafts and similar instruments; a large part of them must be drawn or negotiated by fiduciaries or agents; they must pass through banks all over the country. Uniform and definite rules were found necessary to take the place of diverse and conflicting rules that had grown up concerning constructive notice of breach of fiduciary obligations in order that commerce might proceed with as little hindrance as possible and, at the same time, that loss for breach of such obligation should fall on the party directly responsible for the faithless agent and not on one who was a mere conduit to transmit the fund; this necessity led to the enactment of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act, already adopted in fourteen states. If now we adopted the contention of appellee, and held that, though two fiduciaries, specially registered for the purpose of issuing the instrument in suit, had executed it, the statute <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>did not mean what it said, because the due bill was used by the president of the bank to pay for his purchase, we should nullify the statute and create the very condition of uncertainty which it was passed to correct.

In Whiting v. Hudson Trust Co., supra, in considering a check drawn by a fiduciary in breach of his trust, Cardoza, J., said: “The payee of the check, before delivering it to the defendant, had caused it to be certified. The legal result was the same as if he had received the cash over the counter [citing cases]. Between the drawee bank and its depositor, the check had been paid.......The payee was the owner of a chose in action, the drawee’s promise to pay, just as much as if he were the holder of a cashier’s draft: Goshen Nat.

Yet there is no difference in substance between the two modes of payment, unless it be that the holder of the due bill would seem to be in safer position in consequence of the Uniform Fiduciaries Act, than the holder of a certified check, because the due bill required two authenticating signatures while certification would require but one. By certifying a check, a drawee bank asserts that the drawer has an account in the bank to the amount of the check, and, in that belief, the defendant would have the right to accept the check. But defendant had precisely the same right to accept the due bill on the same ground, and, as the evidence shows that every member of the clearing house knew that the due bill passed as cash, defendant was justified in accepting it in the belief that everything was done that was required. It is true that in either case the fact might be otherwise, i. e., that McCulloch had not put the bank in funds; but in neither case, could the defendant know it; it could rely on the bank’s declaration that he had, just as, in the second of Coleman’s Cases, supra, the Mellon Bank was entitled to rely on the certification by the drawee bank, even though the check bore on its face a statement that it was being used to pay the agent’s personal debt.</p>
