Briegel was married when the condemnation took place. His wife brought this bill against the city and her husband to have a portion of this fund set apart for her by virtue of her interest in lieu of her dower expectancy in the property. The award has been paid to a trustee pending the proceeding. Her husband denies her right to any part of the award, and the court below sustained his contention. The sole question before us is whether a fund raised through condemnation of a husband’s land is subject to a claim by his wife by virtue of her contingent dower interest in the land?</p>
    <p id="b120-6" data-blocks='[["BL_120.9",120,[285,1332,1152,747]]]'>The theory of eminent domain comes from the absolute right of the sovereign to take property for public use. All title interests must be included in the taking. It would be unthinkable that outstanding interests or rights in the land should remain in others after condemnation; to permit such interests to remain would materially interfere with the completion of the purposes for which the government, or those acting for it or in its right, have taken the property through eminent domain. It is, therefore, a matter of public policy that condemnation operates against all interests directly connected with the title of land, including all unrecorded equities or hidden interests indirectly connected with or growing out of such titles.</p>

Appellant argues that, because dower is barred by eminent domain and is a thing of value, the interest it stands for should be safeguarded by the court by attaching or fastening a lien on the fund. This act, she says, would in no way affect the right of eminent domain as the contest would be between wife and husband.

J. 493. While dower, strictly speaking, is an interest in real property which the wife acquires in land of her husband by reason of marriage, the common law rule as to dower has been altered by statute, and our Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 429, section 3, provides, “That the share allotted to the widow shall be in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common law, so <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>far as relates to land of which the husband died seized.” It further provides, “That her share in lands aliened by the husband in his lifetime, without her joining in the conveyance, shall be the same as her share in lands of which the husband died seized.” In discussing dower, we refer to statutory dower; though the rules governing the question involved would apply alike to common law or statutory dower.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.5",122,[297,770,1155,1294]]]'>In the condemnation of lands for public purpose, liens, encumbrances or mortgages are divested as a matter of public policy, since it would be inconvenient, prejudicial to and destructive of the right of eminent domain to have such items remain as a charge on the property. Since the lien of a legacy, judgment, or mortgage against property taken by eminent domain is thus divested, it attaches forthwith to the fund realized from the land and the owner is regarded as a trustee for the benefit of others directly interested who are not necessarily parties to the proceedings. See Schuylkill Navigation Co. v. Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 416, 418. We so held in Deckert’s App., <a href="/watts-serg/5/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 342" data-case-ids="477628" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0342-01">5 W. &amp; S. 342</a>, though the insolvent owner of land condemned “had the legal right to receive the money from the company, and payment to him would have been a good payment without notice of the equitable interest.” But although he was the owner of the land, yet, as respects legacies charged on the land, he was a trustee for others who had an equitable lien. The theory of equitable lien was created “under the head of preventive justice.” Equity in that case would have restrained payment of the money to the owner, but the money was impounded so that the rights of claimants could not be destroyed by passing it on to the insolvent.</p>

She was entitled to the fund unconditionally. See Sharpless v.

Before dower exists, three things must occur, marriage, seisin of the husband, and his death before the death of his wife. Prior to his death dower is a mere intangible, inchoate, contingent expectancy; it is not an interest in the land and cannot rise to the dignity of a vested right, it vests only at the death of the husband. Such a contingent expectancy is not the subject of gift, sale, attachment or devise. Then when land is condemned for public or quasi public use, the fund received in payment is personal property.

Appellant misconceives the full force of the proceeding in eminent domain. Under it title passes when compensation is paid or secured, as it was here. Eminent domain is the exercise of the strong arm of the government to take property for public use without the owner’s consent. Land in private ownership is always subject to this right no matter how diversified the interests in it may be or in what right the title owners may hold the land. In this respect it is a qualified fee, subject under the Constitution to be compensated for. The owner of land does not initiate or take part in the proceeding to condemn — taking his land from him is an involuntary act so far as he is concerned. The State in effect says, we want this land, we reimburse you with money according to the value of the land. If a deed from husband and wife is made for land taken for public purposes under the right of eminent domain, there is no question that the wife has no dower right in the fund; if the parties do not voluntarily make a deed, the law, through eminent domain proceedings, does what amounts to the same thing for them. The effect of con<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>demnation is the same as an involuntary or judicial sale of land wherein neither wife nor husband is required to make a deed and in which dower is barred as a claim on the fund realized; filing a bond is equivalent to a sheriff’s deed or other similar transfer under any involuntary transfer of land. It has the same force and effect as a deed from husband and wife within the scope of the taking. There can be no dower expectancy or lien therefore under such circumstances. Where the parties cannot agree on the amount of money to be paid for the land, or for some reason (as here) a title under a deed may be questionable because of a wife’s nonjoinder, and compensation has been secured, the legal steps taken therefore are to secure that compensation. But, when condemnation proceedings are had, that is, by exploration, appropriation and compensation paid or secured, the title ipso facto is transferred. This is evidenced either by taking a deed, by a bond when filed and approved, or by other appropriate proceeding in cases of municipalities.</p>

We agree with the decisions in the latter states. The decisions in the former states are based on the premise that the wife has such an interest in her husband’s land as should be included in the award. If she has, then the same claim could be made in surplus from sales for a husband’s debts, partition proceedings or all manner of involuntary transfers of title of a husband’s land. It is opposed to our theory of dower, that it only becomes certain on the death of the husband before the wife. If, as these authorities hold, the money realized is real estate representing the wife’s interest, what becomes of it when she dies before the husband? Is it reconverted into personal property which it always was, and if it belongs to the husband why was he deprived of its use to the same <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>extent that he could make of the land while the wife, lived?
