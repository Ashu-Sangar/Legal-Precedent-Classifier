Williams was convicted of murder and sentenced to death are stated quite fully in the preceeding case against Clara Grace Prophet, and need not be repeated except as they are necessary to an understanding of the present case. Williams, when on the stand in his own defense, testified to the agreement to murder Prophet, <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>in this respect substantiating the confessions introduced against him and Mrs. Prophet. His testimony was as follows: “What I was to do on the first floor was to make this appear as if a burglar had entered the house, to cover up the real reason for this crime. I was to make it appear as though a burglar had entered the house by opening the drawers in the dining room, dumping them out, and I was supposed to take the screen out of the back window and open the back door. In other words, I was to make it look on the first floor as if a burglar had entered and committed the crime, to cover up the real reason, which was the agreement between me and my sister. I was in such a state of mind I had only one object when I entered that house. That was to kill my brother-in-law, and I did.” In addition to controverting certain aspects of the confession the defense was insanity when the crime was committed, although he was sane at the trial. The assignments all relate to trial errors, including the alleged error in the rejection of evidence to mitigate the penalty.</p>
    <p id="b165-3" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[209,1430,1155,863]]]'>Considerable evidence to show circumstances calculated to induce insanity was excluded by the court below. This was manifest error. “As human conditions of every sort are created or influenced by external environment, so too the diseased mental condition which we term insanity may be precipitated, intensified or otherwise affected by external events coming to the apprehension of the person. Accordingly, circumstances calculated to induce this mental condition may always be admitted to evidence the probability of such affectation; the only limitation is that the circumstance be in itself capable in some degree of producing such an effect......and that some further foundation for probability be laid by other evidence that there was a diseased mental condition”: Wigmore, Evidence, 2d ed., 483, section 231.</p>

Why the chance was taken of a reversal by a protest to evidence which at the time would not have hurt its case materially, may be accounted for by the intense zeal and earnestness to prevent the culprit’s escaping punishment. In this, the trial judge overstepped the security guaranteed the accused to a fair trial. As we stated in a case some years ago, it is not wise to rigidly exclude evidence “because its materiality is not clearly obvious.” It is better to give the benefit of the doubt to the prisoner in rulings on trivial evidence. “A case such as the Commonwealth so manifestly presented, should not be placed in peril of a reversal by technical rulings on evidence which could not have weakened the Commonwealth’s Case”: Com. v.

Counsel for defendant asked his sister, Grace Prophet, to relate conversations with him as to Prophet’s relations with her, as a circumstance tending to derange his mentality up until the crime was committed. These conversations, relating to the abnormal sexual attacks on her and her son, might have so aroused his anger and passion, so preyed on his weak or even normal mind, and so dethroned his reason, that it became impossible for him to know the difference between right and wrong, and that in this state of mind he killed Prophet.

It should be evidence of circumstances calculated to cause or induce insanity. In discussing mental capacity, Professor Wig-more says in his work on Evidence, second edition, volume 1, section 228, page 473, that, “The first and fundamental rule, then, will be that <em>any and all conduct </em>of the person is admissible in evidence. There is no restriction as to the kind of conduct. There can be none; for if a specific act does not indicate insanity it may indicate sanity. It will certainly throw light <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>one way or the other upon the issue. ‘Upon this I believe that no difference of opinion will be found to exist’ (Wright v. Tatham, 5 Cl. &amp; F. 670, 715).” “Such an issue [insanity] opens a wide door for the admission of evidence, as every transaction of the testator’s life, every expression he ever used, and his manner of conducting himself on the most ordinary concerns, may have a bearing on the question.” Denman, L. C. J., in Doe d. Tatham v. Wright, 6 Nev. &amp; M. 132, 146. In Commonwealth v.

While such evidence usually consists of acts, yet statements to others indicating an unsound mind may be received. The hearsay rule forms no objection to the statements to third parties since they are received without reference to the truth of the statement, being merely indicative of a state of mind. While a basis for insanity may be shown followed by evidence of insanity as indicated, there must be limitations as to the character of the evidence to be admitted under this rule. Thus under its guise, evidence unrelated to a state of mind or its cause should not be received. Nor should evidence of inconsequential conversations be admitted as a cause. To allow such evidence would open <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>the door to the manufacture of testimony which the Commonwealth would have little, opportunity to rebut.</p>

The court below must exercise its discretion in determining whether the evidence offered would have a tendency to unseat the mind. The evidence should be such that a person of average intelligence would be warranted in believing it would have that tendency; if the individual affected be mentally inferior or subnormal, the test of admissibility is lessened.

That act introduced a new feature in the procedure of homicide trials; it established a new penalty, life imprisonment, and placed on the jury the responsibility of fixing the punishment where a first degree murder was committed. Theretofore conviction of a wilful, deliberate, premeditated murder was followed by the death penalty, and a penalty of life imprisonment or pardon could be secured only through mitigating circumstances in an appeal to the board of pardons. Now when a murder is committed, in speaking of a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated murder, it must be contemplated in terms of both punishments. Does the Act of 1925 open a new field of evidence to the extent here claimed or that might be considered by the pardoning power, or effect a procedural change which would render it necessary for the jury by supplementary verdict to fix the punishment? In at least one state the law permits a supplementary verdict to fix the penalty, this by statute. We held in Com. v.

Apart from the fact that the Act of 1925 is silent on the subject, the fundamental objection to the introduction of such evidence is that the jury may be prejudiced by a familiarity with these prior convictions when considering the question of guilt or innocence. We endeavored to relieve this possible difficulty by directing the trial court to explain carefully to the jury the limitation on this evidence. Even so, there can be little doubt that the admission of a prior conviction trenches very strongly on the fundamental rule of evidence, that a distinct crime unconnected with that on trial cannot be given in evidence against a prisoner as proof of the crime on trial; it shows a moral disposition to commit crime. But, as stated in Com. v.

In each of the four cases, it has appeared that the accused was in a violent manner an habitual offender against society.

A first degree verdict is a finding that the accused wilfully, deliberately, and premeditatedly killed his victim. Where the trial judge is convinced that such crime was committed for profit, such as the crimes of highway robbery, burglary, murder for life insurance, bank holdups, and the like, and that the criminals are habitual offenders against society, then prior convictions may properly be received by the jury as an aid in determining the penalty to be inflicted. Where prisoners are known as habitual criminals of the type thus described, who kill for mercenary purposes, the death penalty should be inflicted as a protection to society. It is also possible that there are other kinds of homicide where death is the result of sordid passion, which ought to be followed by the death penalty, where prior convictions could be used.

Where punishment is to be inflicted by the jury and they are permitted to consider other matters clearly relevant for the attention of a judge or jury in passing sentence, the acts or circumstances should be such as naturally beget mercy; if, however, they point to or exhibit a mind filled with anger, vindictiveness, and mercenary gain, with a reckless disregard of consequences, a merciless spirit toward its victim, with the selection of time and place as a result of careful preparation, such acts would scarcely be appropriate as calling for mercy in a sentence. If evidence of these circumstances was admitted in the present case, the defendant would be asking the jury to find that though he had a clear undei’standing of his act, which was, in part at least, to profit from the insurance money, mercy should be extended to him because he was outraged at Prophet, who was a wicked man, and because his sister and the world were well rid of him.</p>

The declarations which defendant might introduce are in many instances self-serving statements made prior to the homicide and might well be considered part of a deliberate attempt to evade responsibility for the crime as established by the Commonwealth’s own theory of it. The evidence <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>here offered should not be received where the testimony-in the case shows a crime committed for profit which defendant admits was part of his motive.</p>

The Act of 1925 cannot be used as a shield to protect men who scorn the laws of society, who murderously prey on it for profit, and who commit acts regardless of consequences for mercenary gain. Such men are not entitled to palliation of their offense by showing that the act was, from their point of view, for a meritorious purpose, the merit being conjured in their own minds and of which they are the sole judge.</p>
    <p id="b179-4" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[200,949,1153,1013]]]'>Defendant also urges that he wished to show, under the Act of 1925, his motive for the crime. We held in Commonwealth v. Buccieri, <a href="/pa/153/0535-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="153 Pa. 535" data-case-ids="840271" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0535-01">supra,</a> at page 544, at a time when only the death penalty was inflicted for first degree murder, that where the Commonwealth has proved a fully formed purpose to kill, “no motive is sufficient to account for a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated murder; hence evidence of motive is immaterial and therefore inadmissible.” Defendant argues that this principle should not prevail under the Act of 1925, that after the prisoner is found guilty of murder of the first degree, when the punishment alone is to be determined, the reason given for the rule excluding motive must give way. As stated above in discussing mitigating circumstances, the motive here offered is one of justification or excuse for a crime for profit. The same reason for excluding the evidence in mitigation of the penalty would exclude evidence of motive under the Act of 1925.</p>

We do not hold that in a proper case mitigating circumstances in relief of the penalty cannot be shown. It is very largely a matter in the discretion of the trial judge who must exercise sound <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>judicial judgment. It should be such evidence that in fairness and mercy a jury or a judge should consider it in imposing sentence. If the evidence is admitted, the jury should be clearly instructed as to its purpose and that it must be considered only after a verdict of first degree is found. This conclusion leads the writer to the opinion, as expressed by Professor Wigmore (Wig-more, Evidence, 2d edition, volume 1, section 196, 2b, page 129), that if this court cannot provide for a supplementary verdict, the legislature should.</p>
