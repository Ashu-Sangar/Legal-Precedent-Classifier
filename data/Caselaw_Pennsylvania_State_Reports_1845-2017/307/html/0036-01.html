He was dismissed, and, as justification, it is asserted that he failed to devote himself exclusively to his employer’s business during the hours of employment. Defendant charges that the plaintiff was interested in a rayon company in which his father had an interest, and that he tried to and did sell stock of this company during normal busi<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>ness hours. Plaintiff admits his father was interested in such company; but explains that rayon was then a new and interesting subject of conversation to defendant’s customers in the millinery trade, and that often, in discussing defendant’s business, “rayon” would naturally come up. He claims he spoke of it to his friends and acquaintances as he might discuss any ordinary topic of the day. While naturally interested in his father’s welfare, he denies working for the rayon company or for his father, and that either he or his father were interested in the sale of stock, as another concern sold it. A careful review of the evidence convinces us that there was a real dispute as to the times, places, manner and purpose of plaintiff’s acts. Many of them were merely incidental occurences that might arise with a salesman in the performance of the duties of his master; at least the evidence is not so clear that we could say as a matter of law he was guilty of such dereliction of duty as entitled him to dismissal. The court below submitted the question to the jury in a clear and explicit charge, and instructed them that if they believed plaintiff was not devoting his entire time exclusively to the interests of his employer, they should find for the defendant. The jury evidently believed plaintiff, and as this was the second trial with the same result, there ought to be no doubt their conclusion was correct.</p>
    <p id="b65-3" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[191,1758,1152,425]]]'>The acts of an employee which will justify dismissal need not be such as injure the employer; the latter need not show that the employee’s conduct caused him to suffer loss. A master is not compelled to keep an employee for a given term in service until his business has suffered pecuniary loss; if the employee is unfaithful, disobedient, disloyal, or does not properly perform his duties, he may be discharged.</p>

To successfully pursue this occupation he must possess many qualities, none the least of which is ability to engage in what is commonly known as a line of “sales talk.” Such an employee. cannot rigidly adhere to “shop” or the subject-matter of his master’s business, but to ingratiate himself with the buyer and to put himself on friendly terms, he must do many things of an incidental nature. The latitude to be permitted one acting in this capacity is uncertain, but his acts should certainly not detract from the furtherance of his master’s business, nor should they, beyond the scope of such business, consume time otherwise than in the master’s business.</p>

Since the plaintiff’s father was interested, this incident may have furnished the excuse to indulge in talk to aid his father, but the evidence does not disclose sufficient for us to say that he thereby violated the duties of his employment. It is a close case on this point, but we are not convinced the court below committed error in submitting the question to the jury. In all the cases wherein we have held that there was sufficient justification, it was reasonably clear from undisputed evidence that the employee was guilty of misconduct.</p>

It is claimed that the contract is invalid because the New York statute of frauds provides: “Every agreement, promise or undertaMng is void, unless it or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and subscribed by the party to be charged therewith, or by his lawful agent, if such agreement, promise, or undertaking, (1) By its terms is not to be performed within one <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>year from the making thereof”: Consol.

Under the law of this State it was valid but under the law of New Jersey it was not. Its validity was upheld and the commission allowed. The lower court said: “Moreover, the validity of the contract as affected by the statute of frauds is controlled by the law of this State and not by that of New Jersey, and Callaway’s contract of employment, made in this city, was valid, as the law of the place of making a contract governs as to the formalities: Story, Conflict of Laws, section 262; Wharton, Conflict of Laws, section 693a; Roubicek v.

L. 522</a>.” We affirmed this order per curiam. The validity of a contract as affected by the statute of frauds is generally to be determined by the law of the place of contract. See 12 C. J. 451. The contract in this case was to be performed in various states, and this illustrates the value of the rule above indicated, for, if the place of performance was to control, the law would find itself in a hopeless tangle. In Goodrich, Conflict of Laws, 232, it is stated: “Real difficulty, however, appears in cases where performance by the promissor is to take place in more than one state, and the agreement is valid by the law of one and not the other...... There seems nothing left but to apply the local contract rules of the lex loci contractus, unless the question of validity is to be chopped up into as many pieces as there are different places for performance.” See also Morgan v.
