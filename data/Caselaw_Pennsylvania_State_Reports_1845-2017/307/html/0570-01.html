The stocks and policy were delivered to defendant at the time of the execution of the deed of trust, and, by virtue of powers of attorney also then duly executed by the settlor, they were forthwith transferred to the defendant as trustee.</p>

The evidence showed that the will was executed the day after the deed of trust, that in talking it over with the scrivener, before execution, the settlor asked the scrivener, who was a lawyer, whether he could eliminate plaintiff from any interest in the trust assets, and the scrivener told him he could, “that a settlor could give away his property, could make any disposition he liked of his personal property and that he was not defrauding his wife of any rights. And I followed the Windolph Case [Windolph v. Girard Trust Co., <a href="/pa/245/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="245 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="326216" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0349-01">245 Pa. 349</a>] in giving that advice, and the execution — the preparation and execution of the instrument followed.” On the faith of this advice the settlor executed the deed of trust, with the “declared purpose to eliminate his wife” from any interest in the assets conveyed thereby, leaving to her only the $40 a month given by the will, which, as stated, was also being prepared at that time. There was no other evidence in any way antagonizing the validity of the trust, but the testimony showed also that, from the day the deed was executed, defendant had exclusive control of the assets specified in it.</p>

The statement of the triál judge that “In order that a trust may be active, the trustee must be charged not only with ministerial acts but also with discretion,” does not help appellee, even if correct, since, as we have shown by the foregoing extract from the deed, the trustee had a discretionary power to continue the assets in their then present form, if it saw fit so to do, or to sell them and reinvest the proceeds in other securitiesr^The citation of Hemphill’s Est., <a href="/pa/180/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="180 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="888348" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0095-01">180 Pa. 95</a>, as sustaining the trial judge’s conclusion on this point, is an unfortunate one, since there it was held that “a trust to pay the ‘net income’ of realty to the cestui que trust involves the exercise of discretion by the trustee” and makes the trust an active one; a conclusion applied to personalty also in Simonin’s Est., <a href="/pa/260/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="260 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="1040202" data-case-paths="/pa/260/0395-01">260 Pa. 395</a>, 397.

There are many early decisions which hold that, so far as concerns his personal estate, a husband may do what he pleases with it, and the wife cannot be heard to complain. See Killinger v. Reindenhauer, 6 S. &amp; R. 531; Pringle v.

The reason for this conclusion is well stated in the first of the cases cited, 6 S. &amp; R. 535-6: “A man can never be said to commit a fraud on the contingent rights of others, where it depends on his own act whether they shall ever exist. The rights of [the wife], other than to her common law dower, he could defeat in the same manner as he could the succession of his heirs.” So, also, it was said in Lines v. Lines, <a href="/pa/142/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="142 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="976735" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0149-01">142 Pa. 149</a>, 165: “It is the settled law of this State that a man may do what he pleases with his personal estate during his life. He may even beggar himself and his family, if he chooses to commit such an act of folly. When he dies, and then only, do the rights of his wife attach to his personal estate.” Those decisions are all based on the general rule that if one.has the legal right to do a particular thing, the law will not inquire into his motive for doing it: Jenkins v.

During the early years of married life, she may have helped him to acquire this very property. Indeed, it is the joint efforts of husband and wife which are usually responsible for the prosperous condition of the husband. The ultimate goal of the two is to accumulate sufficient property, real and personal, not only that their children may, in a measure, be properly cared for; but, more especially, that in old age each may be provided for, notwithstanding the death of the other. The common practice has '' invariably been to place property thus acquired in the name of the husband. Indeed, placing it otherwise <em>isy </em>looked upon, at times, with suspicion.</p>

BlackstoneN, speaks of it, “The reason which our law gives for adopting it, is a very plain and sensible one; for the sustenance of the wife, and the nurture and education of the <em>/ </em>younger children.” Kent, in his Commentaries, states. <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>“This humane provision of the common law was intended for the sure and competent sustenance of the widow, and the better nurture and education of her children.” Our legislature too has recognized this “moral” claim; its latest expression, the Act of 1917, placing the husband and wife on a parity, and providing that either spouse is entitled absolutely to the same share in the estate of the other as if that spouse had died intestate. The earlier acts likewise gave to either the right to claim against the other’s will if an effort was made to deprive one spouse of these rights. Indeed, so high is the regard for these marital rights that it may be safely stated that they occupy an important place in the contract of marriage. The acquisition of them has been regarded as such a substantive part of the marriage contract, that certain dispositions of personal or real property by either party before the fact of marriage in an effort made to cut out these “marital rights” have been declared to be a constructive fraud on the marital rights of the injured party. While deeds and other instruments disposing of property in anticipation of marriage are declared void as against the other party to the marriage contract, it is now possible, under the decision in the instant case, to entirely set aside such rights without fear after the fact of marriage.</p>

It is no answer to say that a fair minded husband would not do this; it should not be possible for any husband to do it.</p>

I believe that to permit such an invasion of the wife’s marital rights by making it possible for her husband to deprive her of them at his pleasure is against the best in<a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>terests of society, and that such decision may be fruitful of consequences that will become exceedingly harmful. It is my opinion that an adherence to our former decisions, as I view them, will produce far better results, prevent grievious injustice, and work for the general betterment of the marital state. It must be understood^ that what has been done to deprive the wife of this right, has not been done by an act of the legislature, but by thg/' decision of this court in sustaining the husband’s act. I frankly concede that there must be a certain liberality^ with respect to the alienation of personal property; it cannot be burdened with postmortem or contingent claims that would cause, titles to be in turmoil whenever property is thus transferred. In transferring such/' interests they should be freed from such claims. But\ that is far different from upholding the deliberate attempt that is here made by the husband to deprive his wife of her postmortem rights and still retain for hiim/ self all the benefits of the property until his death.</p>

He could change the beneficiaries even to the day of his death. He had the right to revoke the trust and retake physical possession of the property at any time. In other words, his hand/ never left the property nor its benefits until his death severed the connection. He placed the property in the name of this third party as trustee solely to prevent his wife from having any share whatever in it after his death. It would seem to me that the mere statement of such facts ought to be sufficient in themselves to require a court of law to defeat the husband’s purpose.</p>

This conclusion is <em>1 </em>based on a false premise; her rights do not depend on 4 his act, they exist through legislation, and they are not on the same, but on a much higher plane than those “of ^Tqs heirs.” Her claim, being statutory, is superior to that of the heirs. Heirs as such have no ground for claiming fraud as against a testator, but the right of the wife has always been regarded as protected until the decision in this case. It is based on the contract of marriage reinforced by legislative enactment, and she cannot be deprived of it by will. Moreover, when the opinion in Killinger v. Reidenhauer, supra, was written, no statute existed fixing marital rights by permitting the wife to take against her husband’s will, as is now the case.</p>

The majority opinion quotes the statement from Lines v. Lines, <a href="/pa/142/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="142 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="976735" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0149-01">142 Pa. 149</a>, 165: “It is the settled law of this State that a man may do what he pleases with his personal estate during his life. He may even beggar himself and his family, if he chooses to commit such an act of folly. When he dies, and then only, do the rights of his wife /Attach to his personal estate.” It is no doubt true that where the transaction is in good faith a husband may make an absolute disposition of personal property by gift inter vivos to the detriment of his wife, but in such a case there must be an absolute separation of title from Xthe husband, one that can be enforced against the donor. He cannot give it with.a siring attached, thereby keeping his hand on the property until he dies, and then call ~IFan absolute gift. In giving it, he must separate himself entirely from it. This is well illustrated by our cases. Pringle v. Pringle, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20Pa.%20281" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="39 Pa. 281">39 Pa. 281</a>, was a contest over an assignment or gift inter vivos of personal property, actually consummated by the husband. Judge Shaks<a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>wood, in reiterating the rule as to a husband’s power over his personal property, says: “This is perhaps to be regretted, but it is too well settled now to be shaken.” To support his reasoning he quoted from Judge Gibson in Ellmaker v. Ellmaker, <a href="/watts/4/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="4 Watts 89" data-case-ids="1842752" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0089-01">4 Watts 89</a>: “Who is so ignorant as not to know that a husband may dispose of his chattels during the coverture without his wife’s consent, freed of every postmortem claim by her?” But that statement of Judge Gibson was made in 1835, when a husband’s dominion over his personal property was absolute. He could then dispose of it by gift or by will and his widow had no rights; but in 1848 this was changed and ever since that time a widow has had a right in the personal property of her deceased husband. No doubt what was meant was that the disposition by the husband must be complete, and the delivery vest a real title in the donee, enforcible by him as against the donor. In the same class of absolute gifts is Ross’s App., <a href="/pa/127/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="127 Pa. 4" data-case-ids="565747" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0004-01">127 Pa. 4</a>, where it was held that even as to these absolute gifts it must be clear that there is no evidence of “fraudulent intent” or no showing that the gift was “in fraud of the rights of the wife.”</p>

The father had named himself as trustee for his children, and the income from the trust went to the children from the moment the trust was created. He reserved the light of revocation, and, as trustee, he exercised control over the corpus. It was held that the trusts were valid inter vivos gifts to his children made “in good faith,” and could not “be impeached on the ground that they are a fraud on the rights of the widow.” The husband received no benefit from this trust. Justice Sterrett makes it clear that the power of the husband in disposing of personal property is limited by his exercise of good faith.</p>

My opinion is that it does not cover a situation such as we have before us today, nor should it be held to have overruled our previous rulings on this question.</p>

There was nothing the law could lay its hands on to impose the tax either through the right of succession or that of enjoyment.

This right may be called the right of succession or the right of enjoyment, but whatever it is called, it is the same thing that is reserved here for the benefit of the widow. The cases are not to be distinguished by the fact that one arose under a taxation statute and the other involves the protection of marital rights. The taxing statute could not be given effect unless there was something in the settlor to attach. That something which carried the line of succession of the property for the purposes of taxation, was the enjoyment of it, and that same enjoyment of it by the settlor to the date of his death is the thing that here carries the line of succession to his beneficiaries, and it is at that point that the widow should be permitted to step in and claim her right.</p>

Good faith is essential.” The majority opinion concedes this. <em>What act is more fraudulent than a deliberate and acknowledged intent on the part of the husband to evade and frustrate the operation of mi act of assembly, and to breach the contract of marriage and violate the rights that are part of it? </em>As stated in Duncan’s App., <a href="/pa/43/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="43 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="483172" data-case-paths="/pa/43/0067-01">43 Pa. 67</a>, such fraud would be strong enough to avoid any contract. Indeed, unless such facts as those outlined in this case are sufficient to show fraudulent intent, then that intent cannot be shown, and such expressions as “It is true a fraudulent intent will defeat a gift,” and “Good faith is essential,” are mere words and mean nothing. Such, however, is not the case. That fraudulent intent is shown by such acts is apparent from the cases. Water-house v. Waterhouse, <a href="/pa/206/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="206 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="931875" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0433-01">supra,</a> is perhaps one of the best illustrations of this. There the husband said, “Unless you sign a deed, I intend to leave the State and dispose of all my property.” He did not leave the State, and he <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>did not dispose of the property. What he did was to give to his brother a chattel, a bond, and in a contest between the widow and the brother, wherein she claimed the gift was in fraud of her marital rights, we said: “The burden was on the plaintiff [brother] to establish by the preponderance of testimony, that the judgment was honestly confessed for a bona fide debt due him from the defendant. The power and duty of the court to aid the wife sought to be defrauded is well settled. In the...... case of Wells v. Bunnell, <a href="/pa/160/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="160 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="852168" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0460-01">160 Pa. 460</a>, we said: ‘The law will lay its hands upon a fraudulent scheme to deprive the wife of her dower and will open or stay proceedings upon a judgment confessed without a full bona fide consideration.’ There are many other authorities to the same effect. Of course, if the judgment was fraudulent and without consideration, the brothers would not openly proclaim their agreement as to its purpose; when the wife was to be cheated they would not call witnesses to their agreement.” There was no other evidence of fraud in that case than the intention on the part of the husband to defeat the marital rights of his wife, and his brother joined in that purpose. There is similar evidence of fraudulent intention in our case, that the husband’s intent was to defeat his wife of her dower, and that his counsel and the trust company joined in that purpose.</p>

This was a suit on the bond, and the court said: “The fraud contemplated consisted not in making the bond, but in the use that was to be made of it...... the bond, being a chattel, was the exclusive property of the husband, yet a married woman has an interest in her husband’s chattels — contingent, to be sure, but still such as may be defrauded.” Hendrickson v.

A voluntary disposition in contemplation of marriage, without the knowledge of the other party, is void at the instance of the party affected, <em>where the beneficial use of the gift is retained by the donor, </em>(Duncan’s App., supra) and even if it is not (Robinson v. Buck, <a href="/pa/71/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="71 Pa. 386" data-case-ids="1031273" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0386-01">71 Pa. 386</a>).

Compare the fraud in that case with the fraudulent purpose shown in our case. The wife’s just <em>expectation as widow </em>is a right that equity should protect under circumstances here related, and the conduct of the husband should be condemned by the court. Robinson v.

There the husband secretly made a deed of trust of personalty on the day of, but prior to, his marriage, reserving a life estate to himself, the remainder to his collaterals. The court held that the wife during the lifetime of the husband was not entitled to relief, and adopted the opinion of the lower court by Willson, J., which stated, “I, of course, do not intend to decide that the plaintiff [the wife] would have no right, upon the death of her husband preceding her own death, to ask that the deed of trust should be annulled to the extent of enabling her to take that share of the principal of the estate which would belong to her under the intestate laws, if no such deed of trust had been made. In my opinion she would undoubtedly have that right, but I think that until that time shall come she has no ground upon which she can successfully attack the validity of the deed in question.”</p>

The marriage relation is based on “contract and confidence,” and <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>persons in that relation owe to one another the strictest good faith in their mutual dealings. The rights of each are exceedingly high and if one right is higher than the other, it should be that of the wife. While the law cannot concern itself with disappointments in' hopes, expectations, sentiment or romance,, it does concern itself with those hopes and expectations that have materialized in the form of property owned before or acquired after marriage. To say that property does not have any substantial place in the rights of both parties (no matter in whose name it is held) is to deny to the married state one of its chief attributes. To hold that this right cannot be protected from abuse is virtually to deny its existence. Of what avail is it if either party can destroy the right of the other or treat it as has been done in this case? What the law has always undertaken in this State and what it should seek to protect for the wife’s benefit is an interest in property “to be enjoyed at the time when the death of her husband would impose on her circumstances of dependency and need, when the customary support and protection of her husband are removed.”</p>
