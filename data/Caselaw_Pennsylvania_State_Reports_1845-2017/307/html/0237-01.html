During the same interval, though defendant at times extracted gas from well No. 2, there were long periods when none was obtained. For a while, the casing of this well wanted repair and quantities of water collected in it. With the <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>well in this useless condition, defendant ijj the fall of 1928, withdrew the defective casing and put in a new one, pumped out the water, and in January, 1929, drilled the well from the Murrysville sand which had contained the gas (depth 1,440 feet), to another sand, designated in the evidence as the Hundred Foot sand, 60 feet deeper, with the result that the rock pressure, theretofore varying from three to four pounds, was increased to over six hundred pounds, and with an enormous increase in gas production.

He [defendant’s agent] said ‘Go ahead and sign it and I will mail your old lease back.’ Father trusted to his honesty, but he never did.” Appellant complains that this evidence was received against its objection that it was “in violation of the parol evidence rule.” The evidence was properly received. The bill averred that defendant “fraudulently asserted that it holds the said oil and gas lease upon said farm......”; this averment was admitted in the answer with the denial that such title was “fraudulently” claimed. Defendant also admitted that the “recording of said lease agreement and the existence of said 1897 agreement and the claim of title thereunder by this defendant has prevented and will prevent the plaintiffs from making sale of leases of said oil or gas which is of great value......” It was therefore relevant and important to show, if it was the fact, that the agreement of 1897 was executed in rescission of and substitution for the lease of 1891; in part, the fact is shown by a reading of the paper in the light of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence; it finds additional support in the statement of the witness that an inducement to its execution was the promise of defendant’s agent that he would return the original lease to the lessor, if he would sign the second agreement. To permit the defendant to stand on both papers, when one of them was obtained on defendant’s promise to surrender the other, would defraud the plaintiffs. Such evidence is received to prevent the fraudulent use of the writing: Excelsior Saving Fund, etc., v.

      <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>What, then, is the scope and meaning of the second agreement? To aid in determining that, we may place ourselves in the position of the parties when it was made and consider the circumstances of the transaction. Defendant had two wells, drilled in 1891 pursuant to the lease; it was paying $400 a year for them, and was obliged to pay that sum for the balance of the term, and as much longer as gas was produced in paying quantities and marketed. The rock pressure and volume of the gas had so diminished that gas could not be produced in paying quantities, at the price defendant had agreed to pay (see Young v. Oil Co., <a href="/citations/?q=194%20Pa.%20250" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="194 Pa. 250">194 Pa. 250</a>). The lessor was not bound to reduce the rent to enable defendant to make the wells pay. Defendant wished to be relieved from paying Avhat it had agreed to pay. Accordingly, the parties met, the defendant acting by an agent of admitted authority. He produced for the lessor’s signature the document of April 1, 1897, containing terms which, we must assume, had previously been agreed to. This document was essentially different from the original lease and provided for essentially different conditions. One of the new conditions Avas that defendant Avas relieved of liability for the sum of $400 a year for Avhieh it was liable for several years to come; plaintiffs were to have the continued use of well No. 1. The rights and liabilities created by the lease of 1891 were superseded because defendant in substance represented that Avithout sustaining loss it could no longer perform the consideration it had agreed to perform in order to maintain its rights under the original lease. It was because it could not afford to perform, that it desired to be released, and the problem of the negotiation was to state the terms of an agreement that both parties would substitute for the original lease. As also indicating that a substitution was contemplated, when defendant’s agent presented the document for execution, the lessor Avished to postpone signing it until defendant surrendered the original lease to him, perhaps erroneously thinking that <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>possession of the paper was essential to discharge the contract. He was nevertheless pursuaded to sign the substituted contract on the promise of defendant’s agent that the original lease would be sent to him. This conclusion also finds support in the condition of well No. 1; the evidence is that the gas which the lessor was able to take from that well was so meager in quantity on account of low pressure and small volume, as even to be inadequate for heating his dwelling house. Our consideration of what the parties stated in the agreement, in the light of the circumstances in which it was made, leads us to agree with the court below that the agreement can have been intended only as a complete substitute for the original lease.</p>

The difficulty with these positions is, that, from the evidence which has already been referred to briefly, the learned court below concluded that defendant abandoned such rights as it had under the agreement of 1897 in “said well No. 2,” when it deepened it to another gas-producing sand. The well was drilled deeper, not by accident, but pursuant to specific written instructions from the defendant to its authorized employees engaged in repairing the defective casing in the well; it was intentionally done, after receiving plaintiffs’ protests against it. The evidence supports the finding of the chancellor, approved by the court in banc, that defendant abandoned the well as granted in 1897. See Cole v.
