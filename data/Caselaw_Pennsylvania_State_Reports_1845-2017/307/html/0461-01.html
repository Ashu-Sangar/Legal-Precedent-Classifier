First: That the fund was the property of Adam Weir, and therefore passed under his will and not under the deed of trust; the court held that as the account of the trustee had been confirmed absolutely, that position could not be maintained after confirmation, — that the only question open was to whom the fund should be distributed: Wylie’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="92 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="490805" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0196-01">92 Pa. 196</a>, 198, and cases cited, p. 199.

Appellant acquiesces in those conclusions. Third: That by his will Adam Weir attempted to alter the distribution of the trust fund specified in the deed, by providing that a daughter’s share in the fund, which was vested by the deed, would be divested if a daughter died, without issue, after the testator but before his wife; and that the daughter Fannie, with knowledge of the circumstances, elected to take and received large benefits under the will, thereby estopping herself, and her executor, from now claiming the share that she would otherwise have taken under the terms of the deed of trust: Shelley’s Est., <a href="/pa/287/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="287 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1099540" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0105-01">287 Pa. 105</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=134%20A.%20468" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="134 A. 468">134 Atl. 468</a>, and cases cited page 110.

It directed that at the death of his wife the trustee should ‘pay to my daughters, or their living children, the above mentioned trust funds with interest accrued,’ and the legal meaning of language such as this has been held to be that the distribution to be made at the termination of the life interest shall be among the then living daughters, and the children of any of them deceased: Rowland’s Est., <a href="/pa/141/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="141 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="974904" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0553-01">141 Pa. 553</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20735" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="21 A. 735">21 Atl. 735</a>].” We do not think that decision applies. In that case it was held that the testator intended to preserve the principal for his grandchildren by means of a trust for the payment of income to his wife and children for life; on the death of a son, without surviving issue, his representative claimed that the son was entitled to income pur autre vie, i. e., until the death of the last surviving child, instead of merely for his own life; this court, however, decided that such claim was inconsistent with the intention of the testator.

The testamentary trust for the life of the widow was necessary to enable her to receive the income for her life and therefore, as a convenience of administration, involved the postponement of the payment, not the vesting, of the principal to, or “settlement” with, his daughters: Marshall’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="262 Pa. 145" data-case-ids="1044445" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0145-01">262 Pa. 145</a>, 149, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.%2063" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="105 A. 63">105 Atl. 63</a>; Groninger’s Est., <a href="/pa/268/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="268 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="1061559" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0184-01">268 Pa. 184</a>, 191; Reed’s Est., <a href="/pa/307/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="307 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1138165" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0482-01">307 Pa. 482</a>. There is nothing in the will taken as a whole, inconsistent with the intention to vest the daughters’ shares at his death, nothing to indicate that he had any reason for, or thought of, making any part of the daughters’ interest in his estate contingent. In this connection it is necessary to keep in mind the rule “that an interest is to be construed contingent only when it is impossible to construe it as vested”: Rau’s Est., <a href="/pa/254/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="254 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="1025421" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0464-01">254 Pa. 464</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%201068" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="98 A. 1068">98 Atl. 1068</a>; that the intention to create a contingent interest “should appear plainly, manifestly and indisputably:” McCauley’s Est., <a href="/pa/257/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="257 Pa. 377" data-case-ids="1032402" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0377-01">257 Pa. 377</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.%20827" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="101 A. 827">101 Atl. 827</a>. Briefly, the will provided as follows: By items two, three, four and five each daughter, by name, received a farm, the home farm going to Fannie M. Weir. Item six gave his wife a home in the mansion house on the home farm during widowhood, and by item seven she received furniture and other personal property. Item eight, quoted above, dealt with the trust fund. Item nine provides that “if any of my daughters should die without issue living, <em>previous to my death, </em>[italics, the writer’s] then their bequests shall revert to <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>my remaining living daughters or their living children.” After disposing of other personal property he provided, in item 17, that the residue should “be divided [by persons named to make the division] among my daughters or their living children, share and share alike......,” and that property [referred to in this item] of doubtful value should be disposed of by the same persons “as they might deem best,” the proceeds “to be divided among my daughters or their children share and share alike.” Item 18 disposed of insurance payable to his estate in installments, by directing that it be paid to his “wife during her natural life and at her death to be paid to my daughters share and share alike.” It seems clear to us that he intended to treat his daughters as nearly alike as possible and intended that all the estates and interest should vest at his death. In Marshall’s Est., supra, it is said: “The law leans to vested rather than to contingent estates, and the presumption is that a legacy is vested: Carstensen’s Est., <a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.%20495" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="46 A. 495">46 Atl. 495</a>]; Tatham’s Est., <a href="/pa/250/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="250 Pa. 269" data-case-ids="1017024" data-case-paths="/pa/250/0269-01">250 Pa. 269</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=95%20A.%20520" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="95 A. 520">95 Atl. 520</a>]; Neel’s Est., <a href="/pa/252/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="252 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1021597" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0394-01">252 Pa. 394</a> [<a href="/citations/?q=97%20A.%20502" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="97 A. 502">97 Atl. 502</a>]; Rau’s Est.
