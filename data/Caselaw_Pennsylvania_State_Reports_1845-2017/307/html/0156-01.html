    <p id="b182-7" data-blocks='[["BL_182.13",182,[286,1548,1153,588]]]'>The bill was dismissed in the court below on the theory that it was multifarious and that complainant had adequate remedy at law. Where distinct and independent causes of action are joined in one bill, or several parties not connected with the controversy in its legitimate scope are joined, a bill in equity is multifarious. But, if the court, in its discretion, believes the joinder in one suit of different matters or parties will promote the convenient administration of justice, the bill will be sustained. See Buie 36, Equity Buies: Pittsburgh v. Pittsburgh &amp; L. E. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/263/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="263 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="1047526" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0294-01">263 Pa. 294</a>, 301.</p>

If, during the course of the trial, it is convenient for any reason to hear the cause <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>against any one or more of the defendants separately, the court may do so. Our Equity Rule 36, which governs much of the above, was taken from the federal Rule 26, which in turn is based on the English rule. The interpretation of this rule by the federal courts is that it is not prohibitive of anything permissible in chancery before its adoption: International Organization, etc., v. Red Jacket C. C. &amp; C. Co., 18 Fed. (2d) 839, 848; Low v.

We agree with the court below that if plaintiff’s claim was only for the amount paid for alleged services, stated as it was in an exact amount, there would have been not only an adequate remedy at law, but, the action being against two defendants who might have and no doubt would have different defenses, the bill would also be multifarious; however, there are other matters in the bill.</p>

This receiver’s bill was a proper one to bring against officers charged with collusive mismanagement, and with wilful neglect of corporate affairs to the detriment and disadvantage of the corporation. The bill alleged the payment of salaries to these defendants without authority; payment of dividends in excess of $9,000 to themselves out of capital when there was an apparent deficit in excess of $13,000; and that complainant, as the court’s officer, could not secure possession of the books of the corporation, though demand had been made for them.

The bill seeks to require the defendants to account for the losses which resulted from their negligent and fraudulent management of plaintiff’s affairs. The relief asked against all the defendants is the same and while acting in the same official. capacity as directors of the corporation.” See also Pittsburgh v. Pittsburgh &amp; L. E. R. R.

It is, of course, probable that one of the defendants may have, with respect to certain phases of the charges, a different defense, but if they as officers of a company collusively joined to perpetrate some wrong against the company, and thereafter enjoyed the fruits of that wrong, they would be jointly liable for their conduct and jointly and severally liable to account for their illegal acts, and equity, without doubt, has jurisdiction of such cause.
