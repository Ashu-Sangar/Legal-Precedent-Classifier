After hearing, a certificate of public convenience permitting the transfer was issued by the commission. The Borough of Brookville opposed the sale and appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed the public service commission’s order and remitted the record for further proceedings. The order of the Superior Court directed that the fair value of the property be determined and that the rate case brought by the residents of the Borough of Brookville against the Solar Electric <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>Company, which was and still is pending before the commission, be disposed of before final action upon the application for the absolution of the Solar Electric Company by the larger corporation. Appellants contend this proceeding is not a rate case and that the question of rates should not now be considered. We, however, are in accord with the Superior Court in its opinion that “Not only the rights of the immediate parties to this sale are involved, but the public’s interest is to be protected, and it may be detrimentally affected if an excessive consideration is paid. The purchaser is assuming the debts of the Solar Electric Company but the record is silent whether the price is fair or exorbitant. The debts may be utterly disproportionate to the value of the property. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the amount of the investment will call for a corresponding return in dividends and it may fairly be assumed that their payment would fall finally on the consumers in the borough. Whether the consideration is commensurate with the fair value of the property is, therefore, an essential fact which should have been found and not ignored. It makes no difference whether this consideration is in the form of cash, securities, or an assumption of the company’s obligations. Evidence should have been offered to show the value of the property and that fact determined before the approval of its sale.”</p>
