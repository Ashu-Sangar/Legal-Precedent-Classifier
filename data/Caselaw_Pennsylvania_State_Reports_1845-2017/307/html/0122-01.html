This child was cared for by defendant’s mother, and, sometime after 1922 when she married Prophet, the deceased, was brought to live in the family. Marital difficulties soon arose, and multiplied as the years passed. Two children were born of the union, Warren 7%, and William 5 <em>y2 </em>years of age.</p>

Upon her return home, although no definite plan was formed until later, she still retained the idea of getting rid of her husband.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[305,502,1155,1616]]]'>About November 6th, Mrs. Prophet’s brother Harold, who happened to be at her house, spoke to her about his financial difficulties and said he would like to have $500. His sister replied that she was disgusted by troubles and quarrels with her husband and that it would be worth that sum not to live the life she was living. Further conversation turned to her husband’s life insurance, and Mrs. Prophet told her brother that it amounted to about $3,000; $2,000 in one company, $1,000 in another, and a third, $260 on a weekly premium policy. Harold remarked that the $260 would be sufficient to bury him. Nothing further developed at this time. On November 18th, Harold again visited his sister and asked her if she was still planning the death of her husband. She said she was, and their plan for the murder was then discussed though no date fixed. Mrs. Prophet was to give him a key to the front door of the house, he was to enter, ransack the house and give it the appearance of a burglary. After this he was to go upstairs to the bedroom and make a noise to waken Prophet, who was expected to mistake him for a burglar. Harold was then to choke Prophet to death, wearing gloves so as to leave no clue. If he was successful in killing Prophet, he was then to strike his sister and choke her so that when the police arrived, she would have an excuse for not sending in an alarm. Harold was to bring with him . a revolver, so that, if he did not succeed in choking Prophet to death, he might kill him with the revolver. He was then to make his escape through the back window or the back door.</p>

In connection with her subsequent denial that she took any part in the crime, it is interesting to note that her brother, in testifying on her behalf, admitted that she pointed out the key on the tea wagon to him, although he denied taking it. For what purpose other than in the furtherance of their common criminal design, would she have pointed it out to him? Harold said he would come between midnight and four o’clock, and although the night was not mentioned, Mrs. Prophet took it for granted he would come during that night.</p>

They occupied a double bed in the front room of their home. She did not go to sleep, but lay awake, awaiting the appearance of her brother. Harold meanwhile had gone home but returned during the night, parking his car a square from the house. At four-thirty he entered the house and what followed we relate in her own words. She said: “I had not went to sleep all night, as I was expecting Harold’s arrival. I heard Harold moving in the bedroom, and then I could see his shadow on the window shades, indicating Harold was standing alongside of the bed, where my husband was lying. He stood over my husband’s bedside for fully five minutes before making any movements to commit the murder. The next thing I heard was a thud, as though my husband had been struck over the head with an instrument. My husband groaned and rose up in the bed, showed resistance. Harold and my husband wrestled on the bed and both rolled over me onto the floor. I got out on the opposite side of the bed, where my husband had been lying, and I ran around to the foot of the bed, to the doorway. I stood near the door afraid to move. Thus I was in a position to clearly see the struggle of my brother and my husband on the floor. During this struggle I distinctly saw my brother twice strike my husband over the head with the revolver. I then heard my husband say, ‘All right, fellow, I give <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>up, I’ll give you all my money, I’ll tell you where it is.’ My brother never said a word, but I heard two shots, but did not see my brother fire them, as he was lying on top of my husband with his back towards me.”</p>

He did not go out the back door or the back window as he had arranged, but went out the front door and disappeared. On leaving, he went over to the store where he had at times been employed, and there hid the revolver between the rafters in the cellar. He then went to- the store where a brother of his was employed, and hid the key of the house in that cellar. He then started back to his farm in the country.</p>

The cab dispatcher notified the police and Mrs. Prophet went to the house with the taxi drivers. She told these men in a conversation which took place in the room where the deceased was lying, that she had been in bed asleep and was awakened in bed by a man rolling over her. When she got up she found her husband had been shot and was lying on the floor. She appeared calm, not in the least excited. She showed no signs of grief, and informed the persons assembled that her husband was dead. The witnesses found the pillows and sheets on the bed mussed up and covered with blood. When she was interrogated as to why her nightgown had no blood on it, although her bathrobe had blood on it, she said that possibly blood had been splashed there when "my husband was hit on the head.” Later she informed them and the officers that her husband had treated her well. Afterwards, at police headquarters, both Mrs. Prophet and her brother made confessions. Defendant’s confession, in writing and signed by her, was offered in evidence ; and this ended the Commonwealth’s case.</p>

While the struggle was going on, she said she ran to the foot of the bed calling to them to stop.</p>

Her version of the story which she told the police officer covers some 30 pages of the record. It depicted a wretched life with her husband, who, ¡according to her story, had become very abusive because her first child, Ruth, the illegitimate, was living with them; he severely criticised her management of household affairs; and she was subject to various sexual abuses practiced not only on her, but on. one of her children. She said her brother was aware of these conditions, and a week prior to the killing had upbraided her husband about his conduct toward his <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>family. Yet it appeared from her own testimony that Prophet was under some financial strain, and was scarcely able to make ends meet. Expenses for the home which had been purchased, and for interest on the mortgage, repairs, insurance, taxes, light, and telephone, together with the sum of $20.00 a week which Mrs. Prophet received for household expenses, and several dollars contributed every week for the support of his mother, consumed all his earnings. The Commonwealth in rebuttal showed Prophet to be outwardly a man of exemplary habits.</p>
    <p id="b154-4" data-blocks='[["BL_154.5",154,[289,932,1150,258]]]'>The jury disbelieved her story, as well they might, and returned a verdict of first degree murder, fixing the penalty at life imprisonment. Mrs. Prophet was very fortunate; from the evidence the jury would certainly have been warranted in fixing a sterner penalty.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.6",154,[288,1203,1152,856]]]'>The questions raised on this appeal relate to trial errors, and many are directed to the cross-examination of the accused as to her version of the confession she alleges that she related to the police officer. Her defense was that she took no part in the killing, did not know it was to take place, and had no agreement with her brother to slay her husband. The only way to get her story of marital relations before the jury was to give her version of the confession to contradict that actually contained in the signed document. No doubt the real purpose of this evidence was to incite the sympathy of the jury by placing before them a picture of her supposed deplorable married life, and thus relieve her from responsibility for the act committed. The statements pictured the deceased in the darkest light possible, and could have been very easily manufactured.</p>

It was entirely proper for the district attorney to cross-examine the accused as to these revelations, with a view of testing her credibility. While neither their truth nor falsity was in issue, whether or <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>not she actually stated these facts to the police was in issue. Therefore, inquiries as to the improper relations with her employer, a married man with two children, the birth of her child, the conduct of the child’s putative father towards it and her, her relations with him after its birth, the receipt of money from him, her knowledge of his other unlawful acts, were all proper subjects for cross-examination since they were directly traceable to her own testimony in which she had pictured herself as a good woman who had been wronged by her employer and her husband.</p>
    <p id="b155-3" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[191,951,1153,1124]]]'>The court did not err in refusing to permit her brother to testify as to his relations with the accused or to detail the offenses practiced against him by the deceased. Previous difficulties or quarrels between deceased and others than the defendant would be incompetent under the defense here pleaded. For the same reason it was incompetent to show the brother’s hostile feeling toward deceased, or his reason for carrying a revolver. Whether it should appear that he intended to kill Prophet on account of his conduct or whether he carried the revolver for his own protection in going to work, was immaterial since defendant knew nothing of the revolver or his intent.

The pointed attack made on the deceased by the alleged narration of deceased’s conduct to the police officer, opened the door to the admission of such character evidence. Ordinarily, the character of the deceased is not in issue, and is normally brought into the case only when there is a plea of self-defense, and then under well defined limitations, but as defendant, for the purpose we stated above, pictured Prophet to be a moral degenerate, it was proper for the State to show the good character of the man who was killed. Evidence of general reputation for violent or bad character on the part of the deceased is not essential to render admissible evidence of his good character; it may be proved in a case where the defense has shown particular traits of character such as quick temper, violence, easily provoked, or likely to provoke a difficulty, though no evidence of general reputation as to bad character has been given: Wharton on Homicide (3d edition) 439, section 270.

The same question may arise where the homicide is said to have been provoked by some <em>other immoral act </em>of the deceased [italics ours].”</p>
