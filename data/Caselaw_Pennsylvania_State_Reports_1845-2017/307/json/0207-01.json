        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nDefendant appeals from judgment on a verdict for personal injury. Plaintiff alighted from a train at Johnstown, and walked on the platform to the stairway leading down to the station floor at the street level for the purpose of leaving the station. 'He slipped on a banana skin as he took the first step from the platform to the stairway. The time\" was about 9 o\u2019clock p. m. March 9, 1928. The platform and stairway are of modern construction. The breach of duty specifically averred, and therefore the issue tried, was that defendant failed (in the words of the statement of claim) \u201cto exercise proper supervision and inspection over the said station and the various parts thereof, and [permitted] the aforesaid banana skin to lie and remain in a place where plaintiff and other passengers must pass for such a length of time that said employees could not have failed to know of its presence.\u201d\nWe need not discuss the evidence generally; it is sufficient to say that on this record defendant\u2019s negligence and plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence were for the jury. But we all agree that appellant\u2019s first assignment of error must be sustained.\nA witness, Robinson, against objection and exception, testified that over a year before the accident, in February, 1927, he \u201ckicked an apple-core off the platform\u201d; and that in \u201c1928, in February,\u201d he \u201csaw orange skins downstairs where the fellow was sweeping.\u201d Timely objection was made to the proposed evidence as \u201cincompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial, and for the reason that the question would not indicate, and the answer could not establish, that the skins or peels referred to in the question had anything to do with the accident in question.\u201d To that objection, plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied that it was \u201cnot offered for that purpose.\u201d The learned trial judge received the evidence \u201cin view of the allegation in paragraph 7\u201d of the statement, generally averring that the \u201cplatform, steps and waiting room......were, on said 9th of March, 1928, and for a long time prior thereto had been, in a highly dangerous and unsafe condition. Defendant\u2019s said employees failed in the duty of inspection and care of said premises, that the floors were permitted to become littered with refuse thrown thereon by persons using the same, and there suffered to lie in the portions of said platform, steps and waiting room necessarily traversed by passengers going to and from defendant\u2019s said trains.\u201d\nWe must consider the assignment of error in the light of the record when the evidence was offered. When Robinson was called, the court and jury had already heard the evidence of plaintiff, who described precisely how the accident happened, the manner in which he slipped, etc., and the condition of the banana skin. The evidence of other witnesses had also been received, two of them testifying that on the same evening, about an hour and a half before the accident, they had been on the same platform and had seen a banana skin lying on the approach to, and near the top of, the stairway quite near the point where plaintiff stepped on such a skin. They described the banana skin and other surrounding circumstances. That evidence was sufficient to prove the averment specifically made in the statement of claim that defendant, on that evening, had neglected its duty to take proper care of the platform in the respect alleged, and had suffered it to remain in that condition long enough to charge defendant with constructive notice of the condition. The burden of proof was on plaintiff; the presence of the banana skin on the platform, without actual or constructive knowledge of that fact, would not impose liability (Green v. R. R. Co., 214 Pa. 240); but, under the evidence of the plaintiff and of the two witnesses referred to, constructive notice was for the jury: Greenfield v. R. R. Co., 305 Pa. 456. A prima facie case was therefore made out.\nWith that state of the proofs, we come to the contentions of the parties with respect to Eobinson\u2019s evidence. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel says his question was designed \u201cto show an habitual condition of the station platform.\u201d Even if we assume, without deciding, that careless maintenance of the station at some earlier time, as averred in the 7th paragraph, could be relevant, and not too remote, we are of opinion that, after a prima facie case had been made out on the specific issue referred to, the single instance of February, 1927, could not be received as sufficient proof of careless maintenance generally, and that was all that was offered (Rosensteil v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 230 Pa. 273, 279); the sweeping of the floor in February, 1928, is evidence of the exercise of care, not lack of it.\nPlaintiff contends that the objection was general, and that, if a general objection is overruled, the ruling will be sustained if the evidence is proper for any purpose : Philadelphia House Wrecking Company v. Nolen, 252 Pa. 443, 446. But that principle does not apply here. The objection was two-fold; first, it was specific, \u2014 that the evidence was \u201cincompetent,\u201d that is, insufficient to show habitual carelessness; and, second, that it \u201cdid not establish that the skins or peels......had anything to do with the accident in question.\u201d We pass the second reason because plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that the evidence was \u201cnot offered for that purpose,\u201d and consider the objection of insufficiency in relation to paragraph 7 quoted above. The specific objection, that the evidence was incompetent, was directed to a point of substantive law, i. e. that the isolated instance was insufficient to prove habitual carelessness; on that ground, the objection should have been sustained (see discussion in Rosensteil v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., supra). The record does not, therefore, present a case where the evidence was admissible for some purpose, but one where it was not admissible for any purpose. Having offered sufficient evidence of the direct issue of the breach of duty on the night in question to make out a prima facie case, it was unnecessary, and would be merely confusing to the jury (cf. Aiken v. R. R. Co., 130 Pa. 380, 395; McCaffrey v. Schwartz, 285 Pa. 561, 572), also to try the collateral issue intended to be suggested by the question and answer.\nWe cannot say that the error was harmless; the evidence must have been considered important by plaintiff or it would not have been offered; as it had no place in the case and may have affected the result materially, we must sustain the assignment.\nThe judgment is reversed and a new trial is awarded.",
