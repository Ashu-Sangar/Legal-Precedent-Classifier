Does the Superior Court\u2019s decision conflict with Pennsylvania law, and the reasoned decisions of other appellate courts by limiting a claim under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8371 to the unreasonable refusal by an insurance company to pay a valid claim?\nb. Does the Superior Court\u2019s decision conflict with the Rules of Statutory Construction under Pennsylvania law by interpreting the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law requires [sic]that \u201cjustifiable\u201d reliance under common law fraud must be established to bring a claim under the Statute, as well as does the decision contradict the reasoned decisions of appellate courts in other jurisdictions that require a lesser standard of reliance to bring a claim under those States\u2019 consumer protection statutes[?]",
