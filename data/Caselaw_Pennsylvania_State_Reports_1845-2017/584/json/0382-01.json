        "text": "OPINION\nChief Justice CAPPY.\nIn this appeal, we are asked to determine whether the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (\u201cMVFRL\u201d or the \u201cLaw\u201d), 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1701 et seq., renders an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle ineligible to recover first-party benefits when such an owner is injured in an accident which does not involve the owner\u2019s uninsured vehicle. For the reasons that follow, we hold that, under these circumstances, the MVFRL bars the owner from recovering first-party benefits. We, therefore, affirm that portion of the Superior Court\u2019s order reversing the trial court\u2019s entry of partial summary judgment in favor of Appellants.\nThe undisputed facts and relevant procedural history underlying this appeal are as follows. Bernell Swords (\u201cFather\u201d) was the owner of a 1997 Chevrolet S-10 pick-up truck. Father insured his truck through Appellee Pennland Insurance Company (\u201cPennland\u201d). On September 14,1999, Father gave permission to his son, Wayne Swords (\u201cSon\u201d), to use the truck. On that day, Son was involved in an automobile accident in New Holland, Pennsylvania while operating Father\u2019s truck. At the time of the accident, Son owned a vehicle which he registered with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation but for which he never obtained any insurance coverage.\nFollowing the accident, Son sought to recover first-party benefits pursuant to Father\u2019s Pennland policy. Pennland denied Son payment of first-party benefits.\nFather and Son (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) then filed suit against Pennland in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County. Appellants\u2019 complaint consisted of eight counts, which included a request for a declaratory judgment. Appellants specifically contended that as a result of the accident, Son incurred medical and other expenses that qualify as first-party benefits under the MVFRL. Appellants asserted that Pennland was statutorily mandated to cover these expenses pursuant to various provisions of the MVFRL. Accordingly, Appellants sought to have the court declare that Pennland was required by the MVFRL to provide Son with first-party benefits.\nPennland filed an Answer and New Matter, arguing that Section 1714 of the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1714, requires the owner of a vehicle registered with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to insure the vehicle as a condition precedent to obtaining first-party benefits under the MVFRL. Because Son owned a registered but uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident, Pennland averred that it properly denied Son first-party benefits pursuant Section 1714.\nAfter answering Pennland\u2019s New Matter, Appellants filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on their declaratory judgment count. They argued that Pennland\u2019s act of denying coverage to Son was contrary to settled law as announced in this Court\u2019s decision in Henrich v. Harleysville Insurance Companies, 533 Pa. 181, 620 A.2d 1122 (1993), and the Superi- or Court\u2019s decision in Kafando v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, 704 A.2d 675 (Pa.Super.Ct.1998). Appellants asserted that these decisions hold that the limit on first-party benefits contained in Section 1714 of the MVFRL does not apply to a driver who is not operating his or her uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident. Relying on this authority, the trial court granted Appellants\u2019 Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\nOn appeal, a unanimous en banc Superior Court reversed and remanded. Swords v. Harleysville Insurance Companies, 831 A.2d 641 (Pa.Super.Ct.2003). The court found that the language of Section 1714 unambiguously requires that \u201cin order to be eligible to receive first-party benefits!] a person must have the required insurance on any and every vehicle currently registered in that person\u2019s name in Pennsylvania at the time of the accident in question.\u201d Id. at 645 (emphasis in original). In reaching this conclusion, the Superior Court necessarily overruled its decision in Kafando, determining that the Kafando court misinterpreted our decision in Hen-rich. Swords, 831 A.2d at 643.\nIn order to appreciate fully the reasoning of the Superior Court on this point, a brief review of our decision in Henrich and the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Kafando is necessary. In Henrich, Elizabeth Henrich, a passenger in her friend\u2019s uninsured vehicle, was injured when the vehicle veered off of the road. 620 A.2d at 1123. At the time of the accident, Henrich owned a registered but uninsured vehicle. Henrich was considered a \u201ccovered person\u201d under the terms of her father\u2019s automobile insurance policy and, therefore, sought to recover uninsured motorist coverage from her father\u2019s policy. Her father\u2019s insurer denied coverage, arguing that Section 1714 of the Law precludes owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from recovering any insurance benefits. Id. This Court ultimately allowed Henrich to recover uninsured motorist coverage and determined \u201cthat Section 1714 does not apply to Ms. Henrich because she was not operating her own uninsured motor vehicle at the time of the accident.\u201d Id. at 1124 (emphasis in original). Relying primarily on Henrich, in Kafando, the Superior Court held that Section 1714 did not bar Kafando, the owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle, from recovering first-party benefits because he was not injured in his uninsured vehicle, but rather, he was injured as a passenger in a properly registered and insured vehicle. See Kafando, supra.\nIn its opinion regarding the matter sub judice, the Superior Court focused on the fact that Son was seeking first-party benefits, not the uninsured motorist coverage that Elizabeth Henrich sought. Because a claim for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage is based on various provisions of the MVFRL which are distinguishable from the first-party benefits that are statutorily unavailable to owners of registered but uninsured vehicles pursuant to Section 1714, the court stated that any discussion of first-party benefits in Henrich is dictum and that the Kafando court erred in relying on Henrich in reaching its conclusion that because Kafando was not injured in his uninsured vehicle, he was not precluded under Section 1714 from recovering first-party benefits. Swords, 831 A.2d at 643-46. Lastly, the Superior Court found support for its decision in Section 1713 of the MVFRL, concluding that Section 1713 indicates that the Legislature intended first-party benefits to follow the person and not the vehicle. Swords, 831 A.2d at 646.\nFor these reasons, the Superior Court reversed the trial court order and remanded the matter to the trial court. Appellants then petitioned our Court for allowance of appeal, which we granted. Swords v. Harleysville Insurance Companies, 579 Pa. 694, 856 A.2d 835 (2004).\nThe standards which govern summary judgment are well settled. When a party seeks summary judgment, a court shall enter judgment whenever there is no genuine issue of any material fact as to a necessary element of the cause of action or defense that could be established by additional discovery. Fine v. Checcio, 870 A.2d 850, 857 (Pa.2005). A motion for summary judgment is based on an evidentiary record that entitles the moving party to a judgment as a matter of law. In considering the merits of a motion for summary judgment, a court views the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party. Finally, the court may grant summary judgment only when the right to such a judgment is clear and free from doubt. Id. An appellate court may reverse the granting of a motion for summary judgment if there has been an error of law or an abuse of discretion. Id. n. 3. Whether the MVFRL precludes owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from recovering first-party benefits is a question of law; accordingly, our standard of review is de novo. See id. Our scope of review, to the extent necessary to resolve the legal question before us, is plenary. Id.\nBy way of background, the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act (\u201cNo-Fault Act\u201d) was the predecessor to the MVFRL. In 1984, the Legislature repealed the No-Fault Act, replacing it with the MVFRL. \u201c[T]he primary concerns in repealing the No-Fault Act were the spiraling costs of automobile insurance and the resultant increase in the number of uninsured motorists.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). In fact, this Court specifically has recognized that \u201cthe MVFRL reflects a heightened concern by the General Assembly toward the increasing consumer cost of automobile insurance attributable in part to motorists who ignore the legal requirement that they insure their vehicles.\u201d Windrim v. Nationwide Insurance Company, 537 Pa. 129, 641 A.2d 1154, 1157 (1994).\nIn order to address this heightened concern, the MVFRL \u201crequired (and requires) that a vehicle owner show financial responsibility at the time of registration in terms of an ability (by way of insurance or otherwise) to respond to specified damages claims, [ ] and subjects owners to penalties for failing to maintain financial responsibility.\u201d Lewis v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 568 Pa. 105, 793 A.2d 143, 150 (2002) (citing 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1714 and 1305(d)). Such penalties are reflected throughout the MVFRL and evidence the intent of the Legislature to forcefully deter people from failing to insure their vehicles. See, e.g., 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1786(d) (\u201cThe Department of Transportation shall suspend the registration of a vehicle for a period of three months if it determines the required financial responsibility was not secured as required by this chapter and shall suspend the operating privilege of the owner or registrant for a period of three months if the department determines that the owner or registrant has operated or permitted the operation of the vehicle without the required financial responsibility.\u201d)\nOur task here is to interpret Section 1714 of the Law, a specific penalty provision of the MVFRL. In interpreting the MVFRL, as in all matters requiring statutory interpretation, we are guided by the provisions of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501 et seq. Under the Statutory Construction Act, the object of all statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intention. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the statute is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nWe, therefore, begin by examining the words employed by the Legislature in drafting Section 1714 of the MVFRL. Section 1714, entitled \u201cIneligible claimants,\u201d states, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]n owner of a currently registered motor vehicle who does not have financial responsibility ... cannot recover first party benefits.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1714. The Law defines \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d as\n[t]he ability to respond in damages for liability on account of accidents arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle in the amount of $15,000 because of injury to one person in any one accident, in the amount of $30,000 because of injury to two or more persons in any one accident and in the amount of $5,000 because of damage to property of others in any one accident. The financial responsibility shall be in a form acceptable to the Department of Transportation.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1702. Thus, when the definition of \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d is read into Section 1714, in order for a claimant to be ineligible to receive first-party benefits, he or she must be an owner of a currently registered motor vehicle who does not have the ability to respond in damages for liability on account of accidents arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle in the appropriate amounts delineated by the Law. Moreover, an owner\u2019s financial responsibility must be in a form acceptable to the Department of Transportation.\nHere, the parties do not dispute that Son owned a currently registered vehicle at the time of the accident. Appellants, however, argue that Son had financial responsibility at the time of the accident, as he was driving Father\u2019s properly insured vehicle when the accident occurred. Penn-land posits that regardless of whether Son was operating an insured vehicle at the time of the accident, he himself did not have financial responsibility as defined in Section 1702 of the Law and, therefore, is precluded from recovering first-party benefits per Section 1714. We agree with Pennland.\nThere is no ambiguity in Section 1714 as it relates to eligibility for first-party benefits. We, therefore, hold that Section 1714 of the MVFRL clearly and unambiguously renders an owner of a currently registered motor vehicle ineligible to recover first-party benefits when the owner fails to meet the requirements of financial responsibility as detailed in the MVFRL. The General Assembly did not qualify this preclusion by limiting its reach to situations in which an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle is in an accident involving his or her uninsured vehicle, and we are not at liberty to add such a qualification in the face of the clear and unambiguous words of Section 1714.\nMoreover, in the context of Section 1714, \u201cwho\u201d most certainly refers to \u201can owner of a currently registered vehicle.\u201d Section 1714, thus, requires every owner of a currently registered vehicle to have his or her own financial responsibility in order to be eligible to receive first-party benefits. This conclusion is supported by Section 1782 of the Law. Section 1782, entitled \u201cManner of providing proof of financial responsibility,\u201d provides in pertinent part as follows:\n(a) General rule.\u2014Proof of financial responsibility may be furnished by filing evidence satisfactory to the department that all motor vehicles registered in a person\u2019s name are covered by motor vehicle liability insurance or by a program of self-insurance as provided by section 1787 (relating to self-insurance) or other reliable financial arrangements, deposits, resources or commitments acceptable to the department.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1782 (emphasis added). Section 1782 makes clear that the Legislature intended to require an owner of a registered vehicle to insure his or her vehicle in a manner acceptable to the Department of Transportation in order to prove the owner\u2019s financial responsibility. Consequently, the MVFRL does not allow owners such as Son to rely on the financial responsibility of others to circumvent the preclusion set forth in Section 1714. As such, Appellants\u2019 argument that Son had financial responsibility because he was driving Father\u2019s insured vehicle fails.\nIn addition to this failed argument, Appellants insist that Henrich requires us to find that Son is not precluded from receiving first-party benefits under Section 1714 because he was not operating his uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident. On the other hand, Pennland agrees with the Superior Court\u2019s assessment of Henrich.\nAt first blush, our disposition of the issue sub judice seems to be in tension with Henrich, particularly the explicit holding therein. See Henrich, 620 A.2d at 1124 (\u201cWe hold that Section 1714 does not apply to Ms. Henrich because she was not operating her own uninsured motor vehicle at the time of the accident.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Such a conclusion, however, is proved false upon a closer examination of the MVFRL. This exercise reveals that the result we reach here and the result reached in Henrich both comport with the MVFRL.\nWhile the MVFRL mandates in Section 1714 that owners of registered but uninsured vehicles cannot recover first-party benefits, the Law does not preclude such owners from recovering damages for injuries sustained as a result of automobile accidents. Indeed, the Law deems owners of registered but uninsured vehicles to have chosen the limited tort alternative. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(a)(5). This deemed choice allows an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle to be, at least, \u201celigible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law....\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1705(d). Accordingly, when an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle is the innocent victim of an accident, he or she can sue in tort and, at the very least, recover damages for economic loss. Such a result is consistent with Henrich, which allowed Ms. Henrich to recover uninsured motorist coverage, which, together with underinsured coverage, merely \u201cserves to promote the recovery of damages for innocent victims of accidents with uninsured or underinsured drivers.\u201d Lewis, 793 A.2d at 151 (emphasis added).\nThere can be no doubt that in passing the MVFRL, the Legislature sought to penalize owmers of registered vehicles who do not maintain financial responsibility. As we stated in Henrich, however, we will not attribute \u201charsh motives to the legislature unless they were clearly spelled out.\u201d Henrich, 620 A.2d at 1124. In Section 1714 of the MVFRL, the Legislature could not have been any clearer insomuch as it intended to preclude owmers of registered vehicles who do not have financial responsibility from being eligible to recover first-party benefits, regardless of what vehicle in which they are injured. Yet, nowhere in the Law did the Legislature expressly preclude owmers of uninsured vehicles from being eligible to receive the benefits of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage if such an owner qualifies to receive this coverage pursuant to another person\u2019s policy. Minus such an express preclusion, the result in Hen-rich is sound\u2014the MVFRL does not preclude owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from recovering uninsured or underinsured coverage.\nWhile we are convinced that the result reached in Henrich was correct, we nonetheless must temper Henrich\u2019s purported holding. Because the MVFRL does not expressly preclude owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from benefiting from uninsured and underinsured coverage, it was unnecessary and improper for Henrich to rest its otherwise sound decision on the premise that Section 1714 did not preclude Henrich from recovering uninsured motorist benefits because she was not driving her uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident. As such, while we continue to adhere to the result in Henrich, we are compelled to isolate the explicit holding of Henrich to the facts presented in that case. In any event, the result in Henrich does not afford Son shelter from Section 1714.\nHaving rejected Appellants\u2019 arguments, we conclude that because Son was the owner of a registered vehicle at the time of his accident and because he failed to meet the requirements of financial responsibility as detailed in the MVFRL at the time of his accident, Section 1714 of the MVFRL renders Son ineligible to recover first-party benefits. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the Superior Court\u2019s order reversing the trial court\u2019s entry of partial summary judgment in favor of Appellants, and we vacate the Superior Court\u2019s order in all other respects.\n. In their complaint, the Swords named Harleysville Insurance Companies as the defendant. Pennland notes in its brief to this Court that at the time of Son\u2019s accident. Father was insured by Pennland, now Harleysville Pennland Insurance Company. According to Appellee, Pennland is one of a group of related insurers, and Harleysville Insurance Companies is not an insurer but merely a trade name. While Pennland has pointed out the correct identity of Father\u2019s insurer since the inception of this case, it does not and has not challenged Appellants\u2019 right to pursue this action based on this oversight.\n. The MVFRL defines first-party benefits as \"[mjedical benefits, income loss benefits, accidental death benefits and funeral benefits.\" 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1702.\n. In addition to filing an Answer and New Matter, Pennland filed preliminary objections to several of the counts enumerated in Appellants' complaint. The parties, however, apparently agreed to postpone the resolution of Pennland's preliminary objections until after a decision was reached regarding Appellants\u2019 claim for declaratory relief.\n. Although the trial court\u2019s order did not dispose of all claims and all parties, it did affirmatively declare Son\u2019s right to recover first-party benefits from Pennland. Therefore, the order was a final, appealable order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(2) and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7532. See Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company v. Wickett, 563 Pa. 595, 763 A.2d 813 (2000) (finding that an order that affirmatively or negatively declares the rights of the parties constitutes an immediately appealable order under Pa.R.A.P. 341(b)(2) and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7532, notwithstanding the fact that the order does not dispose of all claims and all parties).\n. Section 1713 of the Law provides in pertinent part as follows:\n(a) General rule.\u2014Except as provided in section 1714 (relating to ineligible claimants), a person who suffers injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle shall recover first party benefits against applicable insurance coverage in the following order of priority:\n(1) For a named insured, the policy on which he is the named insured.\n(2) For an insured, the policy covering the insured.\n(3) For the occupants of an insured motor vehicle, the policy on that motor vehicle.\n(4) For a person who is not the occupant of a motor vehicle, the policy on any motor vehicle involved in the accident. For the purpose of this paragraph, a parked and unoccupied motor vehicle is not a motor vehicle involved in an accident unless it was parked so as to cause unreasonable risk of injury.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1713.\n. Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 489, No. 176, \u00a7\u00a7 101-701 (codified at 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1009.101-1009.701) (repealed).\n. We also note that the Superior Court\u2019s order inadvertently directed the trial court to enter judgment in favor of Pennland and against Appellants. Such a directive was inappropriate. The only matter before the Superior Court was Appellants' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. Whether Pennland was entitled to relief on its preliminary objections or any other of its filings was not at issue. Thus, the Superior Court merely should have reversed and remanded for further proceedings.\n. We note that Appellants suggest that not allowing Son and owners like him to recover first-party benefits is unduly harsh when such owners decide to leave their uninsured vehicles at home, choosing instead to drive properly insured vehicles. While the preclusion set forth in Section 1714 may be harsh, so long as legislation is constitutional, it is the prerogative of the Legislature to employ harsh consequences in order to accomplish the policy behind the legislation. \"Such policy determinations ... are within the exclusive purview of the legislature, and it would be a gross violation of the separation of powers doctrine for us to intrude into that arena.\u201d Glenn Johnston, Inc. v.
