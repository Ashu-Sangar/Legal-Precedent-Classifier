      {
        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nJudith Wachs, appellee, is the widow of James Wachs who was killed in an automobile accident while driving a company vehicle on his way to work for appellant American Office Systems (AOS). Appellee filed a Workers\u2019 Compensation fatal claim petition seeking benefits. Appellant Donegal Insurance denied coverage, stating decedent was not in the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident; he was merely en route to work, which typically is not compensable. See Peterson v. WCAB (PRN Nursing Agency), 528 Pa.279, 597 A.2d 1116, 1119 (1991) (\u201cThe general rule is that an employer is not liable to the employee for compensation for injuries received off the employer\u2019s premises while the employee is travelling to or from work.\u201d).\nDecedent was an office equipment technician who had worked for AOS, but left for approximately three years to work for a competitor; he was recruited back to AOS in 1991. Decedent demanded, as a qualifying condition of his return to AOS, that he be provided a company car. See N.T. Hearing, 10/28/99, at 21 (VP of Service Operations: \u201cThe only way he would agree to come back to work for AOS, and it was perfectly clear, is that if he had a company car. Because of the fact, I don\u2019t even think he owned his own car at the time.\u201d). Decedent drove the provided vehicle from his first day of re-employment with AOS until the fatal accident; he took the vehicle home each night and drove it each morning to AOS\u2019s office or a scheduled appointment with a client.\nAt first, decedent\u2019s work schedule required him to be out of the office about 90% of the time. He typically received a service call list for the following day, and left from home in the company vehicle to the clients\u2019 locations; other times, he would receive an early morning call at home designating which locations he was to visit. This pattern continued until he was promoted to a supervisory position, after which his duties kept him at the home office most of the time; on the day of his death, decedent was traveling to AOS\u2019s home office to repair two fax machines a client had dropped off to be serviced.\nThroughout his employment with AOS, decedent was paid an hourly wage which started at 8:00 a.m., and did not include transit time; he was required to be either at the office or at a client\u2019s location by 8:00 a.m. Decedent never carried a pager, company cell phone, nor was he on-call on a 24-hour basis. AOS provided decedent with a credit card to pay for the gas and repairs to the company vehicle. At the time of decedent\u2019s rehire, almost all AOS technicians were provided company cars; at the time of his death, decedent was the only technician still driving a company car.\nAfter his death, his widow, filed a fatal claim petition. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) denied the petition, finding appellee failed to prove decedent was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of his death. The WCJ reasoned decedent was no longer a roving technician but a supervisor who spent most of his time at AOS\u2019s headquarters; decedent had a fixed place of employment. Further, the WCJ credited the testimony of decedent\u2019s immediate supervisor, who stated decedent had no client visits scheduled the day he died and was scheduled to fix two fax machines at the office that morning.\nOn appeal, the WCAB determined the WCJ\u2019s findings did not support a denial of benefits, and remanded for additional findings of fact and conclusions of law. The WCAB stated: \u201cour independent review of the record reveals that too many of the findings of the WCJ do not appear to support his conclusions....\u201d WCAB Opinion, 8/17/01, at 8. Additionally, the WCAB opined \u201cit would appear that the agreement to provide the Decedent with the automobile (he had the same automobile for his entire period of employment, 1991 through the date of death, October 26, 1998) was an agreement in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business or affairs.\u201d Id.\nOn remand, the WCJ reiterated and reaffirmed his prior findings of fact and conclusions of law, stating it was clear decedent was en route to AOS\u2019s headquarters at the time of his death. Reasoning decedent was merely in transit to a fixed employment location, and he was not paid for transit time to and from work, the WCJ held decedent was not acting in the scope of his employment or furthering the interests of his employer at the time of the accident\u2014the WCJ again denied appellee\u2019s fatal claim petition. Satisfied the WCJ adequately addressed its previous concerns and properly clarified his findings, the WCAB affirmed.\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed, concluding the WCJ and WCAB overlooked the fact that appellee had adequately-proved decedent obtained the company car as part of his employment contract. Regardless of whether decedent was traveling to AOS\u2019s office or a client location at the time of the accident, the court opined decedent was acting within the scope of his employment because the employment contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d applied. See Rox Coal Co. v. WCAB (Snizaski), 768 A.2d 384, 386 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), affirmed, 570 Pa. 60, 807 A.2d 906 (2002). This Court granted review to determine whether decedent was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of his death, and whether the contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d is still viable.\nThe Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act) provides that \u201c[e]very employer shall be liable for compensation for personal injury to, or for the death of each employe, by an injury in the course of his employment....\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 431. Section 301(c)(1) of the Act defines the terms \u201cinjury\u201d and \u201cpersonal injury\u201d \u201cto mean an injury to an employe, regardless of his previous physical condition, arising in the course of his employment and related thereto....\u201d Id., \u00a7 411(1). The Act further directs that the term \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment\u201d shall not include:\n[A]n injury caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him, and not directed against him as an employe or because of his employment; nor shall it include injuries sustained while the employe is operating a motor vehicle provided by the employer if the employe is not otherwise in the course of employment at the time of injury; but shall include all other injuries sustained while the employe is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, whether upon the employer\u2019s premises or elsewhere....\nId.\nGenerally, the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d holds that an injury or death sustained by an employee traveling to or from a place of employment does not occur in the course of employment; thus, it is not compensable under the Act. Biddle v. WCAB (Thomas Mekis & Sons), 539 Pa.343, 652 A.2d 807, 809 (1995); Village Auto Body v. WCAB (Eggert), 827 A.2d 570, 573 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003). However, such an injury or death will be considered to have been sustained in the course of employment and thus is compensable under the Act if one of the following exceptions applies:\n1) claimant\u2019s employment contract includes transportation to and from work;\n2) claimant has no fixed place of work;\n3) claimant is on a special mission for employer; or\n4) special circumstances are such that claimant was furthering the business of the employer.\nBiddle, at 809 (citation omitted); Rox Coal, at 386; Wells Fargo Co. v. WCAB (Pacheco), 764 A.2d 1147, 1150 (Pa.Cmwlth.2000); City of Philadelphia v. WCAB (Stewart), 728 A.2d 431, 432 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999).\nThe claimant bears the burden of proving \u201cthe injury arose in the course of employment and was related thereto.\u201d Olszewski v. WCAB, 167 Pa.Cmwlth. 521, 648 A.2d 1255, 1257 (1994) (citing Krawchuk v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 497 Pa. 115, 439 A.2d 627 (1981)). Whether an employee is acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of his injury or death is a question of law and is renewable de novo. See Empire Kosher Poultry v. WCAB (Zafran), 154 Pa.Cmwlth.276, 623 A.2d 887, 889 (1993).\nAppellants contend the employment contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d is inapplicable because \u201cthere was no actual written employment contract in place between the decedent and the Employer that provided for transportation.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief, at 17 (emphasis deleted). Appellants argue it was merely customary and cost-effective at AOS, at the time of decedent\u2019s rehire, for technicians to receive company cars; nothing in decedent\u2019s employment contract specifically provided that he be provided one. Upon rehire, decedent signed a one-year employment contract which was not updated\nthroughout his subsequent seven-year employment with AOS. See Janis v. AMP, Inc., 856 A.2d 140, 147-48 (Pa.Super.2004) (employee\u2019s continuation of employment after expiration of contract term results in renewal by implication of same contract, under same terms and conditions). Included with the contract was an employee manual which contained a provision for a company car; decedent\u2019s contract did not designate that his employment was contingent on him receiving a company car.\nAlthough not memorialized in decedent\u2019s written employment contract, a reviewing court must look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether an employee\u2019s contract did, in fact, provide for transportation to and from work. See Olszewski, at 1257 (to prove employment contract exception, claimant must produce \u201ccontract or unequivocal testimony that such provision [for transportation] did in fact exist....\u201d); Empire Kosher Poultry, at 890 (customary in industry to provide transportation to and from work, and employer adhered to custom); Unity Auto Parts, Inc. v. WCAB (Bigley), 148 Pa.Cmwlth.4, 610 A.2d 1071, 1074-75 (1991) (court considered whether oral agreement existed to provide transportation as part of employment contract); Sylvester v. Peruso, 286 Pa.Super. 225, 428 A.2d 653, 655 (1981) (employment contract for transportation can be \u201ceither expressly or impliedly\u201d).\nHere, appellee offered unequivocal testimony, accepted by the WCJ as fact-finder, that decedent conditioned his reemployment with AOS with the requirement that he be provided a company car. In its opinion, the WCJ found:\nAs a result [sic] interview meetings were conducted and the witness [VP of Service Operations] was authorized by the President [of AOS] to offer an agreement to the decedent with the understanding between the decedent and the employer that the only way he would return to work for AOS would be if he had a company car which served the purpose of providing transportation going back and forth to work.\nWCJ Opinion, 7/31/00, at 6. Further, decedent was issued the vehicle from his first day of employment and drove it continuously until his death, more than seven years later. The only time decedent did not drive the vehicle was when he was on vacation or when the vehicle was being repaired, at AOS\u2019s expense. Based on this evidence, and the continuity of conduct throughout decedent\u2019s employment, appellee established that decedent\u2019s use of the company vehicle was pursuant to his employment contract. The contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d was satisfied.\nRegardless of whether appellee proved decedent\u2019s use of the company vehicle was incident to his employment contract, appellants argue the General Assembly in 1993 amended \u00a7 301(c)(1) of the Act to abrogate the common law employment contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d by inserting the language: \u201cnor shall it include injuries sustained while the employe is operating a motor vehicle provided by the employer if the employe is not otherwise in the course of employment at the time of injury.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1). Appellants allege the General Assembly sought to eliminate this exception by requiring employees actually be in the process of furthering the employer\u2019s interests at the time of injury; driving to a fixed place of employment, appellants contend, is not acting in the scope of one\u2019s employment.\nThe Commonwealth Court in Rox Coal, supra, dismissed an identical argument, holding: \u201cAlthough Employer would have us interpret the phrase inserted into section 301(c)(1) as eliminating the employment contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d... we soundly reject Employer\u2019s position.\u201d Rox Coal, at 389. The court reasoned the General Assembly\u2019s insertion of the restrictive language actually reaffirmed what the courts had already recognized and had enforced: employees injured while driving a company vehicle are not entitled to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits unless they are acting within the scope of their employment at the time of injury or can prove an exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule.\u201d The court stated the inserted phrase dispelled any doubts about an automatic entitlement to benefits from an injury sustained in a company vehicle. Id., at 390; see Unity Auto Parts, Inc., at 1075 (\u201cthe fact that the claimant was injured while traveling home in the employer\u2019s vehicle does not automatically support a conclusion of law that the injury occurred in the course of employment\u201d).\nBased on the plain meaning of \u00a7 301(c)(1), we accept the reasoning of the Commonwealth Court in this case and Rox Coal that the employment contract exception to the \u201cgoing and coming rule\u201d is still viable. Further, because appellee established by substantial evidence that decedent\u2019s negotiated employment contract included transportation to and from work via a company car, and decedent was killed on his way to work in that car, we affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order granting fatal death benefits to appellee.\nOrder affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justices NIGRO and BAER are with the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice CASTILLE and Justice NEWMAN join.",

        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nBecause I view the common-law employment contract exception to the going-and-coming rule as irreconcilable with the Legislature\u2019s 1993 amendment td Section 301(c)(1) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, I would hold that the exception no longer existed at the time of the accident.\nAs the majority notes, the courts have traditionally recognized several exceptions to the common-law going-and-coming rule, which generally precludes compensation under the Act for injuries sustained while driving from one\u2019s home to a fixed place of work, or while returning home. Among these is the employment contract exception, pursuant to which compensation is available so long as the employee was driving a company car supplied under the terms of his or her contract of employment. The rationale behind that exception was artieulated in McIntyre v. Strausser, 365 Pa. 507, 76 A.2d 220 (1950), where this Court stated:\nOrdinarily the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Acts have no application where the employe is going to or coming from his work. But where the contract of employment provides that the employer shall furnish the means of going and returning from work, the employe is regarded as engaged in the furtherance of his employer\u2019s business during such transportation.\nId. at 509, 76 A.2d at 221 (emphasis added).\nThe critical 1993 addition to Section 301(c)(1) proceeds as follows:\n[N]or shall [the term \u201cinjury arising in the course of employment\u201d] include injuries sustained while the employe is operating a motor vehicle provided by the employer if the employe is not otherwise in the course of employment at the time of injury.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1) (emphasis added).\nOn its face, this provision categorically precludes compensation for injuries sustained while driving a company car unless the employee is \u201cotherwise\u201d acting in the course of employment at the time of injury. The term \u201cotherwise,\u201d in this context, indicates that the employee must be acting in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business in some capacity beyond merely driving the vehicle. The statutory amendment, then, on its face abrogated the common-law employment contract exception to the going-and-coming rule; as noted above, that exception had its genesis in a judicial imputation of the state of being engaged in the furtherance of the employer\u2019s business to the driver of a company car provided pursuant to an employment contract.\nThe majority reaches the opposite result by stating that the legislative amendment at issue did little more than re-affirm what the courts had already recognized and enforced for decades. See Majority Opinion, 584 Pa. at 485-87, 884 A.2d at 863. To the extent that one can discern any lack of clarity in the statutory text (which I cannot), the legislative history of Act 44 clarifies that its primary purpose was to reform the workers\u2019 compensation system so as to reduce the burden upon employers, as the high cost of the system was contributing to a business-unfriendly environment in Pennsylvania as compared to neighboring states, resulting in a net loss of businesses and jobs. See, e.g., 1993 House Legis. Journal 518, 543-47 (daily ed. March 30, 1993) (remarks of various Representatives concerning the need to reform the workers\u2019 compensation system so that businesses do not close or move out-of-state); 1993 Senate Legis. Journal 443 (daily ed. March 31, 1993) (reflecting the Senate\u2019s understanding of the overriding purpose of the. bill to reform the workers\u2019 compensation system to make it less burdensome upon the business community); id. at 472-73 (daily ed. April 19, 1993) (same). In light of these numerous statements affirming the need for reform, it is difficult to accept the majority\u2019s position that the amendment to Section 301(c)(1) carried no legislative intent to alter the circumstances under which benefits would be available solely as a result of driving a company car. See generally 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(7) (instructing courts to consider a bill\u2019s contemporaneous legislative history in resolving any perceived lack of clarity in its text); DeLellis v. Borough of Verona, 541 Pa. 3, 15 n. 11, 660 A.2d 25, 31 n. 11 (1995) (finding legislative floor remarks instructive in interpreting a statute).\nI also respectfully differ with the majority\u2019s affirmative suggestion that the amendment to Section 301(c)(1) signifies that \u201cemployees injured while driving a company vehicle are not entitled to Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits unless they are acting within the scope of their employment at the time of injury or can prove an exception to the \u2018going and coming rule.\u2019 \u201d Majority Opinion, 584 Pa. at 485-87, 884 A.2d at 863 (emphasis added). The amendment\u2019s text contains no indication that proving a common-law exception to the going-and-coming rule may operate effectively to nullify the limitation set forth. Rather, as discussed, the wording is absolute in its preclusion of benefits unless the employee is \u201cotherwise\u201d acting in the course of employment.\nIn sum, I would conclude that the 1993 amendment to Section 301(c)(1) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act abrogated the common-law employment contract exception to the going- and-coming rule, and that the rule otherwise applies to the facts of the present case. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the WCAB\u2019s order denying benefits.\nJustice CASTILLE and Justice NEWMAN join this dissenting opinion.\n. This restrictive language was inserted by the Act of July 2, 1993, P.L. 190, No. 44, \u00a7 5 (\"Act 44\u201d).\n. The majority reaches its result in part by relying on the Commonwealth Court's decision in Rox Coal Co. v. WCAB (Snizaski), 768 A.2d 384 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001). On appeal, this Court determined that the Commonwealth Court's discussion of this issue was mere dicta because the employer had waived any objection to the employment contract exception during proceedings before the agency. See Rox Coal Co. v. WCAB (Snizaski), 570 Pa. 60, 71, 807 A.2d 906, 912 (2002). In any event, dicta or not, I believe that the Commonwealth Court's reasoning in Rox Coal was erroneous. The Commonwealth Court did not articulate any persuasive basis for its interpretation that the 1993 amendment merely solidified judicial precedent concerning the going-and-coming rule; additionally\u2014and somewhat illogically\u2014the court relied largely upon a pre-amendment decision to conclude that all of the exceptions to the going-and-coming rule remain in force even in the post-amendment setting. See id. at 389 & n. 14 (citing William F. Rittner Co. v. WCAB (Rittner), 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 596, 600-01, 464 A.2d 675, 678 (1983)).\n. Appellee does not argue that any other exception applies presently.",
