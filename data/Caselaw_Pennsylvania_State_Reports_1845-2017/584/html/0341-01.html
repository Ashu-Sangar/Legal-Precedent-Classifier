This Court has recently examined the proper calculation of a claimant’s AWW under amended Section 309(d) in two cases involving materially distinct circumstances, but which are instructive in resolving the issue here. In <em>Hannaberry HVAC v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Bd. (Snyder, Jr.), </em>575 Pa.66, <a href="/pa/575/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="834 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="630352,9080745" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0066-01,/a2d/834/0524-01">834 A.2d 524</a> (2003), we determined that the overall purpose of the 1996 amendments was to ensure an accurate calculation of an injured worker’s average wages/earning capacity; and we held that the diminished wages the claimant in that case had earned as a part-time student worker were not to be included in calculating his AWW, where his disabling work injury occurred after he had graduated from high school and had been working for three months as a full-time employee. In the second matter, <em>Colpetzer v. Workers’ Compensation Appeal Bd. (Standard Steel), </em><a href="/pa/582/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="870 A.2d 875" data-case-ids="650337,9019860" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0295-01,/a2d/870/0875-01">870 A.2d 875</a> (Pa.2005), the injured claimants had received no wages during relevant periods in the prior year only because they were on disability as a result of prior compensated work injuries; this Court held that an accurate calculation of AWW in that instance required that the periods of prior disability not be treated as if the claimants had no earning capacity at that time, but instead, the AWW already established for the prior work injuries is the measure of the AWW for the relevant prior periods of disability.</p>

Each Claimant maintained a continuing employment relationship with Employer, pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, but were subject to periodic layoffs during downturns in Employer’s production cycle, including layoffs in each of the four quarters immediately preceding the work injury at issue. In each case, both the Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) and the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“WCAB”) construed the Act as requiring that the periods of time when Claimants earned no wages due to layoffs be included in the calculation of their AWW pursuant to Section 309(d), which provides for an averaging of the weekly wages earned in the highest three of four immediately preceding work quarters. Claimants appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which consolidated the appeals and then reversed, concluding that the layoffs resulted in Claimants working less than a single completed period of thirteen weeks in the previous year and that the AWW was to be calculated pursuant to subsection 309(d.2), which authorizes a prospective calculation of AWW measured by multiplying the worker’s hourly wage rate by his expected weekly work hours. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the WCJ and the WCAB that Section 309(d) controls, and that the periods of time during which Claimants received no wages because of periodic layoffs must be included in the computation of AWW.

The three cases proceeded before the WCJ upon stipulated facts. Due to recurring periodic layoffs in the previous year, none of the Claimants had continuous wage earnings for a complete thirteen-week period in the year preceding injury. In accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Claimants maintained their plant seniority and Employer continued to provide them with healthcare benefits and contributions to their retirement accounts, notwithstanding the periodic layoffs. Because Employer considered each Claimant to be “in its employ” for four consecutive periods of 13 calendar weeks in the 52 weeks immediately preceding injury, Employer calculated the AWW pursuant to Section 309(d).</p>

Accordingly, in the WCJ’s view, Employer properly calculated Claimants’ AWW pursuant to Section 309(d).

The panel then reviewed Claimants’ respective work histories. Each Claimant had been laid off for at least some portion of each of the four thirteen-week periods preceding injury; thus, none had actually “worked” an entire thirteen-week quarter. For example, Claimant Reifsnyder, who was injured on November 23, 1998, had been laid off numerous times including, but not limited to: from 11-3-97 to 1-25-98, during the 1st thirteen-week period; from 2-25-98 to 3-2-98, during the 2nd period; from 7-20-98 to 8-9-98, during the 3rd period; and from 8-17-98 to 9-20-98, during the 4th period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Because none of the Claimants actually <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>worked any complete 13-week period due to work layoffs, the panel held that benefits should be calculated pursuant to subsection 309(d.2).

Employer posits that the various parts of Section 309(d) are designed to account for employment relationships of differing lengths: <em>ie., </em>Section (d) governs work relationships of one year or more; subsection (d.l) governs work relationships of more than one, but less than three consecutive periods of thirteen calendar weeks in the preceding year; and subsection (d.2.) governs the shortest of work relationships, <em>ie., </em>where the employee has worked less than a complete period of thirteen calendar weeks. Employer notes that each Claimant here was a long-term employee, not a recent hire; each had earnings in more than one thirteen-week period in the year prior to his injury; and each had suffered periodic layoffs in the year before injury as a result of purely economic factors. Employer maintains that the recent hire provision set forth in subsection 309(d.2) simply cannot apply in this scenario; instead, Section 309(d), which looks to a claimant’s actual earnings during the relevant periods within his recent, continuous employment relationship, is the only proper and accurate measure of AWW. Employer also cites numerous cases in which this Court and the Commonwealth Court alike have recognized that being “employed” does not necessarily refer only to the days the employee works, but encompasses the entire period of an ongoing employment relationship.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Employer argues that these cases recognize that subsections 309(d.l) and (d.2) are only applicable where there is no long-term employment relationship, which is simply not the case here.</p>

Employer posits that different employees in materially identical situations could be treated differently, depending on the fortuity of how soon after a layoff an injury occurs. Employer argues that Section 309(d), which focuses on the length of the employment relationship and provides a <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>fuller picture of the relationship, avoids such inconsistent application.</p>

Claimants submit that they were earning their “customary” hourly wages at the time of their work injuries, and accordingly, their AWW should be based upon an extrapolation from those typical hourly wages, as provided by subsection 309(d.2).</p>

Claimants note that Section 309(d) provides the AWW formula for employees who were “employed” for three or more 13-week periods and subsection 309(d.l) likewise applies to employees “employed” for more than one but less than three completed 13-week periods. Subsection 309(d.2), however, has a different focus: it applies to “employees” who have “worked” less than a complete 13-week period. Claimants maintain that the General Assembly must be presumed to have intended a different analysis when it used the distinct term “worked.” Claimants’ continuous employment relationship therefore cannot be deemed controlling on the question of the applicability of subsection 309(d.2); the fact that they “worked” less than a full 13 weeks in the quarter immediately preceding their work injuries and worked no other completed quarters, requires that their AWW should be calculated pursuant to subsection 309(d.2).</p>

In this regard, Claimants necessarily dispute the notion that subsection 309(d.2) was intended to apply only to new employees, noting that the General Assembly could have expressed that intention more clearly by adopting limiting language like “new employees who work less than 13 weeks” or speaking in terms of the length of employment (as Section (d) and subsection (d.l) do). Instead, Claimants emphasize that the provision speaks only of “employees” who “work” less than “a complete period of thirteen weeks.”</p>
    <p id="b676-4" data-blocks='[["BL_676.4",676,[233,1003,1156,1064]]]'>Claimants also argue that there is nothing in the structure of Section 309 to suggest that the General Assembly intended that hourly-wage workers subject to layoff should find a reduction in the calculation of their AWW, when otherwise identically situated salaried workers are not subject to the same reduction. Claimants note that Sections 309(a), (b), and (c), which govern injured workers paid on a yearly, monthly and weekly basis respectively, do not require that the worker actually worked all of the weeks in some look-back period in order to have his AWW fixed according to his salary. In other words, the assertion is that there is no provision in those Sections that would allow for a reduction in AWW in instances where the worker was subject to layoff, furlough or other break in pay. Since Section 309 does not penalize salaried workers for layoffs, and does not specifically address layoffs, furloughs, or other periodic work cessations, Claimants argue that it should not be construed as reflecting an intention that hourly-wage workers should have their AWW calculation “deflated,” merely because they had been laid-off in the previous year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Three decisions from this <em>Court—Triangle Building Center, supra, Hannaberry, supra, </em>and <em>Colpetzer, </em>supra—are particularly helpful to our consideration. <em>Triangle Building Center </em>involved a concurrent employment situation governed by the last clause of Section 309(e) of the Act, which provides that where an employee is working under concurrent contracts with multiple employers, his wages from all employers “shall be considered as earned from the employer liable for compensation.” 77 P.S. 582(e). The claimant in <em>Triangle Building Center </em>had been laid off by one employer for approximately two months at the time he was injured in the other employer’s employ. The question for this Court was whether the temporary layoff from the concurrent employment “precluded assessment of [the claimant’s] concurrent earnings experience within the average weekly wage calculation.” 746 <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>A.2d at 1109.

This Court then concluded that the General Assembly directed inclusion of concurrent wages in the benefits computation “to create a reasonable picture of a claimant’s pre-injury earning experience for use as a projection of potential future wages and, correspondingly, earnings loss.” <em>Id. </em>at 1113.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

The issue was how properly to calculate the AWW in instances where there were relevant weeks in the look-back period in which no wages were earned only because of prior disabling work injuries. The employers argued that these periods should be included in a calculation of AWW under Section 309(d) as periods of zero wages, while the claimants argued, among other points, that the AWW could properly be computed under Section 309(d) only if the AWW for the no-wage periods were fixed by importing the AWW which had been already established for the claimants’ prior disabling work injuries.</p>

Nevertheless, we believe that the structure and plain language of the statute clearly indicate that Section 309(d), not subsection 309(d.2), controls the calculation and also provides an accurate measure of such a type of worker’s economic reality and earning capacity. As previously stated, Section 309(d) and subsections (d.l) and (d.2) address work/employment relationships of differing lengths. Section 309(d) governs employees with the longest work/employment <em>histories—ie., </em>employees who have been employed for at least four consecutive periods of thirteen calendar weeks. Subsections (d.l) and (d.2) address progressively shorter employment relationships: (d.l) governs employees employed for at least one, but less than three consecutive periods of thirteen calendar weeks; while (d.2) addresses cases of recent hires, <em>ie., </em>employees who worked less than a single complete period of thirteen calendar weeks at the time they suffered a work injury.</p>

Both (d) and (d.l) include look-back periods encompassing the preceding fifty-two weeks, in search of “completed” thirteen-week periods; in contrast, subsection (d.2) has no such long-term focus, and indeed, it provides for a prospective <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>calculation of potential earnings. By its terms, (d.2) contemplates persons for whom there is little work history 'with the employer upon which to calculate the AWW. Viewing the interrelationship of these subsections, we deem it unlikely in the extreme that the General Assembly intended (d.2) to supplant (d) or (d.l) anytime a long-term employment relationship happens to involve periods with a “work” cessation. Instead, we conclude that subsection (d.2) was intended for instances that it plainly covers; <em>i.e., </em>those instances of work injuries to recently-hired employees for whom there was, by definition, no accurate measure of AWW other than taking the existing hourly wage and projecting forward on the basis of the hours of work expected under the employment agreement.</p>
    <p id="b681-4" data-blocks='[["BL_681.4",681,[169,1040,1156,1303]]]'>Claimants here had a long-term employment relationship by which their actual history of earnings and earning capacity could be measured fairly, and we think the statute clearly was designed to capture that entire relevant period, rather than projecting an AWW from their hourly wages. Although they were subject to periodic layoffs, these Claimants nevertheless maintained continuous employment relationships with Employer, indeed for periods of fifteen and nineteen years. Thus, even in those down times where layoffs occurred, Claimants retained significant rights/accoutrements of employment, such as plant seniority, healthcare and sick leave benefits, and employer contributions to their retirement accounts. In addition, Claimants all returned to work with Employer following their respective layoffs, evidencing an ongoing employment relationship despite the periods of inactivity. Notably, the general rule set forth in Section 309(d) does not speak in terms of the continuity of “work,” but rather, the continuity of the “employment” relationship. The fact that Claimants were not “working” during the periods when they were laid off does not mean that their long-term “employment” relationship was severed. <em>See Colpetzer, </em><a href="/pa/582/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="870 A.2d 875" data-case-ids="650337,9019860" data-case-paths="/pa/582/0295-01,/a2d/870/0875-01">870 A.2d at </a>886 n. 9 (“The fact that the Claimants in these appeals were not ‘working’ during their periods of disability does not mean that they were no longer ‘employed’ by their employers.”).</p>

      <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>Claimants’ argument premised on the fact that subsection (d.2) speaks of periods of “work,” in contrast to the “in the employ of the employer” language found in (d) and (d.l), is unpersuasive. Employer responds to Claimants’ argument by suggesting that recent hires subject to subsection (d.2) may still be in a probationary work period, and thus not be deemed in the technical “employ” of the employer; or they may be transient workers who fail to complete a thirteen-week period of employment with any one employer in a given year. Given the variety of circumstances attending such short-term or incipient employment relationships, Employer argues, it was sensible for the General Assembly to use the term “worked” rather than the “in the employ of’ language which was used to describe relationships of a longer duration. Viewed in light of the overall structure of the Act, as described above, Employer’s reading is persuasive. In any event, we fail to see how subsection (d.2) can be read as revealing a legislative intent to negate the very language just employed to cover the longer-term employment relationships clearly contemplated in (d) and (d.l). Moreover, since the legislative scheme generally looks to the year past as the most accurate measure of AWW, it would be illogical to “project” the number of hours an employee was “expected” to work as the basis for fixing his AWW in an instance where, as here, there is in fact an on-going employment relationship, albeit one subject to periodic layoffs, for the year-long period preceding the work injury.</p>

Claimants argue that including periods of layoff pursuant to Section 309(d) leads to a situation where hourly-wage workers are treated unequally compared to salaried workers, whose wages are not offset if they were subject to layoffs. But this fact this does not mean that Section 309(d) is an inaccurate measure of the injured hourly worker’s earning capacity or AWW; to the extent there is an inaccuracy, it would consist of an over-calculation of the AWW for salaried workers subject to layoff. Though this perceived inequity might be a basis upon which to seek legislative relief, it is no basis upon which this Court may refuse to apply the statute as <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>plainly written. Moreover, Claimants’ argument that subsection (d.2) should control would not necessarily address the inequity they believe they have discovered. The “terms of employment” spoken of in (d.2) could well include periods of anticipated layoff, and could thereby reduce the number of hours the employee was expected to work.</p>

Presumably, by forwarding this argument, Claimants mean to suggest that they were subject to shorter layoffs in years past. The statute, however, fixes a look-back period of a certain length as the best measure of earning capacity. There can be a myriad of reasons why a worker’s pay varies from year to year. It was the prerogative of the General Assembly to fix the relevant look-back period, and it has determined that the past year is the best measure for fixing AWW in the case of long-term employees.</p>

We realize that the parties are in agreement that Claimants in the case <em>sub judice </em>received unemployment compensation for periods of work layoff. The fact that no wages are deemed attributable to these periods of layoff, notwithstanding receipt of unemployment benefits, is consistent with <em>Colpetzer </em>because a person who is laid-off from work is not in the same situation <em>vis a vis </em>the Workers’ Compensation Act as a person who is rendered unable to work, or whose work options are restricted, because of a work injury. The laid-off worker can seek to supplement his income with another job; the disabled worker either cannot do so at all or, at a minimum, is impaired in his ability to obtain comparable employment. The Act concerns itself with compensable work injuries and their effect upon earning capacity; a decline in a worker’s earnings which results from business or economic forces is not the same as a decline in that worker’s earnings due to a job-related impairment. The Workers’ Compensation system operates to insure a worker <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>against the economic effects of a workplace injury, not against the economic effects of variations in the business cycle.

I write separately only to distance myself respectfully from the majority’s conclusion that unemployment compensation benefits should not be included in the computation of an employee’s AWW under Section 309(d) where an employee’s relationship with an employer involves periodic layoffs. Maj. Op. at 358-60, 883 A.2d at 548. Notwithstanding that the parties could have directly raised, briefed and argued this issue explicitly before this Court, they have not. Therefore, I believe it would be more prudent to delay consideration of this difficult issue until a party raises it directly and the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>Court has the benefit of focused advocacy concerning whether inclusion of the unemployment compensation benefits in the AWW would provide a more “accurate measure of a worker’s earnings history and earning capacity.” Maj. Op. at 358-60, 883 A.2d at 548. In all other respects, I join the erudite majority opinion.</p>

Although the majority also lays claim to the application of a plain-meaning approach, I am not persuaded that this characterization is supported. In this regard, while on the one hand the majority gives effect to the substantial difference in connotation between the terms “work” and “employment” in some aspects of its analysis, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, <em>op. </em>at 357-58, 883 A.2d at 547 (“Notably, the general rule set forth in Section 309(d) does not speak in terms of the continuity of ‘work,’ but rather, the continuity of the ‘employment’ relationship.”), it nevertheless proceeds to equate these two terms in a pivotal passage construing Section 309(d.2). <em>See id. </em>at 357-58, 883 A.2d at 547 (equating “employees who worked less than a single complete period of thirteen calendar weeks at the time they suffered a work injury” exclusively with “recent hires” for purposes of Section 309(d.2)).</p>
