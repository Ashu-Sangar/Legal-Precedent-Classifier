Unlike the defendant in <em>Basemore, </em>appellant seeks to forward his ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, a stage which is governed by the <em>Grant </em>rule. An ineffectiveness hearing will be appropriate when, and if, appellant chooses to forward ineffectiveness claims upon collateral review under the PCRA. Accordingly, we dismiss each of appellant’s ineffectiveness claims without prejudice to appellant’s right to pursue these claims via a petition for relief under the PCRA.</p>

A person is guilty of first-degree murder where the Commonwealth proves that (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502; <em>Commonwealth v.

On June 19, 1997, Capone and several acquaintances allegedly opened fire with firearms on appellant’s house, located at 2902 Palethorp Street in Philadelphia. Sometime before 8:00 p.m. on June 20, 1997, appellant noticed a man, who apparently looked very much like Capone and was wearing a bandana on his head, driving a new, blue Toyota Corolla that appellant knew to be owned by Capone in and around appellant’s neighborhood. At around 8:00 p.m., after having observed the Toyota driving in his neighborhood, appellant entered a light-colored station wagon parked in front of his house and exited the car carrying an AK-47 assault rifle. Appellant then went into an abandoned house at 2913 Palethorp and ascended to the roof of the building. About a minute later, the Toyota Corolla rounded the corner of Cambria and Palethorp Streets and began traveling on Palethorp, past the abandoned building. Upon seeing the car, appellant opened fire on the vehicle and its driver, strafing the rifle <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>from side to side and spraying bullets up and down Palethorp Street. Unbeknownst to appellant, Capone was not in the Toyota Corolla, but rather, the car was being driven by Carlos Martinez, to whom Capone had apparently sold the car that very day. Six of appellant’s shots shattered the car’s windows, and one shot struck Martinez in the back.

Furthermore, the decision in <em>Bruno </em>hinged upon the trial court’s initial failure to caution the jury adequately about its obligation to avoid media exposure, a duty the trial court squarely undertook in the instant case. Whereas, in <em>Bruno, </em>the court merely offered a suggestion, here, the court affirmatively directed the jury not to “read or watch the news accounts of this trial.” N.T., 7/2/98, at 107. Finally, the decision in <em>Bruno </em>expressly recognized that “questioning jurors as a group or giving special precautionary instructions may be a sufficient precaution depending on the facts of the particular case.” <em>Bruno, </em><a href="/pa/466/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="466 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1714962" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0245-01">466 Pa. at 267-68</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="466 Pa. 245" data-case-ids="1714962" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0245-01">352 A.2d at 52</a>.

After being shot in the back, Martinez attempted to exit the car through the driver's side window but became too weak and eventually lost consciousness, so that his body was slung partially out of the window with his head almost touching the ground. Philadelphia Police Officer Rafae Guadalupe, who responded to a radio call regarding the shooting, found Martinez lying on the ground next to the car and bleeding heavily from the chest. Officer Jerry Torres transported Martinez to Temple University Hospital in his police cruiser, but Martinez was pronounced dead within a half hour of arriving at the hospital. An autopsy revealed that a bullet struck Martinez in the back, traveled through his kidney, spleen, stomach, liver, and inferior vena cava, and exited under his ribs on the right side of his abdomen. The cause of death was determined to be the massive bleeding from the wound to the inferior vena cava.</p>
