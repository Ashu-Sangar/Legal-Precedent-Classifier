The record below establishes that on August 5, 1996, Jennifer Myers was robbed, tied up, and sexually assaulted at the art gallery she owned and operated in York County. Although Ms. Myers did not know the identity of her attacker at the time of the assault, she subsequently recognized Appellant as her attacker when she saw him working at a Sheetz convenience store in Hanover. Detective Arthur Smith went to the store and told Appellant that he wanted to speak with him about the assault of Jennifer Myers. The detective asked Appellant if he was carrying any weapons, to which Appellant responded that he was .not but that he had a loaded gun under the driver’s seat in his car parked outside in the Sheetz parking lot. Detective Smith then walked to Appellant’s car and seized the gun, along with a pair of sunglasses that matched a description of those worn by Ms. Myers’ assailant. Appellant was arrested and his car was towed, impounded and inventoried. During the inventory search, police found rope matching that used to restrain Ms. Myers during the assault and a newspaper article that covered the assault. Appellant was charged with the robbery and attempted rape of Ms. Myers.</p>

She had been shot three times, once in her chest, <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>once in her left shoulder and once in her left eye. Witnesses stated that they had heard three bangs in rapid succession from the gallery at approximately 1:00 p.m. and Sandra Eller positively identified Appellant as the person who almost struck her with his car as he was leaving the shopping center in which Ms. Myers’ art gallery was located. Police quickly focused their investigation on Appellant and learned that Appellant had tampered with the recorded time on a videotape in an attempt to fabricate an alibi for the time of Ms. Myers’ murder and also discovered a letter that Appellant had written to Ms. Myers, asking her for forgiveness. Police arrested Appellant for the murder of Ms. Myers on October 29, 1997.</p>

The trial court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of imprisonment of 9 to 18 years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Meanwhile, Appellant’s murder trial commenced on October 26, 1998. At trial, the Commonwealth argued that Appellant’s motive for killing Ms. Myers was to prevent her from testifying at the trial for his attempted rape and robbery charges. In addition to presenting Appellant’s letter to Ms. Myers, the videotape of the fabricated alibi and Ms. Eller’s testimony placing Appellant near the art gallery at the approximate time of the murder, the Commonwealth presented several other witnesses who testified that they saw a strange man wearing a black wig in the area of the art gallery at the time of the murder. Furthermore, Joseph Leuw, a fellow inmate with Appellant, testified that Appellant told him that he had been in the area of the art gallery on the day of the murder and that he had a wig in his car that belonged to his daughter. The Commonwealth also presented a gunshot residue expert as a witness, who testified that the flannel shirt, pants, hat and sneakers that Appellant was wearing on the day of the murder all <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>tested positive for gunshot residue.

This, however, is simply not a claim that we can consider here as it attempts to challenge the effectiveness of counsel in a matter other than the one that is currently on appeal. Perhaps in recognition of this, Appellant tries to link his counsel’s representation at his robbery trial to the outcome of his capital case, asserting that the improperly admitted physical evidence from the car led to a guilty verdict in his robbery and attempted rape trial and that those convictions, in turn, were used by the Commonwealth in Appellant’s murder trial as evidence of Appellant’s motive for murdering Ms. Myers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> However, this tangential relationship aside, the fact remains that Appellant is seeking relief in the instant case on the basis of his counsel’s alleged failures in a separate matter, which was based on separate charges, and for which he had a separate trial and a separate trial attorney. Of <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>course, the proper venue for Appellant to raise a claim relating to his counsel’s performance at his robbery trial is in an appeal that stems from <em>that </em>trial, and not in an appeal that stems from a wholly distinct trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, Appellant is not entitled to relief on the basis of his first two claims.</p>

Appellant first asserts that the trial court erred by denying him access to the mental health records of his daughter on the basis that Appellant was on a “fishing expedition designed to attempt to discredit [his daughter] in any way possible.” Tr. Ct. Op. at 24. Appellant argues that, as the witness’s father, he knew first-hand that his daughter had been diagnosed with depression, a panic disorder and agoraphobia and as such, his attempt to obtain and use his daughter’s medical records to challenge her competency was not in any way a “fishing expedition.” As both the lower court and the Commonwealth point out, however, communications between a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist and their patients are confidential under 42 Pa.C.S. § 5944 and this Court has clearly held that the statutory privilege pursuant to Section <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>5944 is not outweighed by a defendant’s right to cross-examine witnesses or his due process rights. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Moreover, it is worth noting that Appellant could have asked either his daughter or his wife, who also testified against Appellant, questions concerning his daughter’s mental health in an effort to challenge her competency, but opted not to.

Appellant appears to argue, however, that this Court should consider his underlying ineffectiveness claims related to his robbery trial in this appeal because the trial court linked the two cases together by hearing argument on Appellant's ineffectiveness claims from both the robbery case and the instant case at the remand hearing. While the trial court did indeed consider Appellant's ineffectiveness claims from both cases at the remand hearing, nothing in the record indicates that the two cases were ever officially consolidated for purposes of that hearing, appeal or otherwise. In fact, as noted above, when the Commonwealth originally filed a motion to consolidate the two matters, Appellant actually <em>opposed </em>that motion and the trial court denied it.</p>

Under these circumstances, we feel compelled to direct the trial court to enter a final order disposing of Appellant's PCRA petition in the robbery case so that Appellant has the opportunity to appeal that disposition to the Superior Court.

Appellant appears to argue that he was entitled to inspect his daughter’s records pursuant, to his constitutional right as a parent to her "custody and management.” Of course, as the Commonwealth points out, this claim is completely specious as Appellant did not seek her records for this purpose but rather, sought them to challenge her competence to testify. While Appellant argued in his pre-trial motion seeking his daughter's mental health records that he wanted to view those records so that he could make a parental decision as to whether it was in his daughter's best interest to testify, he does not reiterate this argument here, which is just as well considering that it would be hard for Appellant to make an objective assessment as to whether it was in his daughter’s best interest to testify <em>against </em>him.</p>

Indeed, while Appellant's daughter could not always remember the exact dates of when certain things happened, she did remember the general timeframe in which events occurred and answered questions in a way that supports the trial court’s conclusion that she had the ability to communicate and to perceive and recall the events about which she testified.</p>
