Appellee entered his parents’ house for a short time and then attempted to return to his vehicle. His parents, however, warned him not to drive because he was visibly intoxicated. A verbal altercation ensued between Appellee and his father, who threatened to call the police if Appellee attempted to drive. Appellee then repeatedly beat his 79-year-old father and 73-year-old mother with several rifles that were located in the house. As a result of this attack, Appellee’s mother suffered bruised ribs and his father was rendered blind in his left eye and lost the use of his left arm and hand. Later that evening Appellee was arrested and charged with two counts each of aggravated assault, simple assault, and harassment. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 2702, 2701, and 2709(a)(1), respectively.</p>

Wagner, Jr., conducted a hearing to determine whether Appellee suffered from mental illness at the time of the incident, and whether he was competent to stand trial. The sole witness was Laszlo Petras, M.D., director of the forensic unit and attending chief psychiatrist at Mayview State Hospital (“Mayview”). Dr. Petras had treated Appellee for schizophrenia at Mayview several years earlier, and had additionally treated him upon his re-admission shortly after the present offense. As to the first issue, Dr. Petras rendered an expert opinion, expressed within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Appellee was legally insane at the time of the <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>offense. <em>See </em>N.T. Dec. 14, 2001, at 21. After examining Appellee, Dr. Petras also opined that he was not presently competent to stand trial. Dr. Petras explained, in this regard, that Appellee believed that his attorney was part of a countywide conspiracy to “put him away,” and thus, could not assist in his defense. <em>See generally Commonwealth v. Uderra, </em><a href="/pa/580/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="580 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1100635" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0492-01">580 Pa. 492</a>, 515-516, <a href="/pa/580/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="862 A.2d 74" data-case-ids="1100635,1100675,9158484,9158575" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0492-01,/pa/580/0491-02,/a2d/862/0074-01,/a2d/862/0074-02">862 A.2d 74</a>, 88 (2004) (noting that competency to stand trial is measured according to a defendant’s ability to understand the nature and object of the proceedings, and to participate and assist in his defense).</p>

This ruling was made without prejudice to Appellee’s ability to offer the same plea at a future date when he became competent. <em>See id. </em>at 35.

The trial court denied the motion by order dated October 12, 2002. In an accompanying opinion authored by President Judge Franks, the court refused to render a merits disposition of the claim that it had erred in rejecting Appellee’s plea, on the basis that the plea had been heard and ruled upon “by another member of this Court in an order dated December 14, 2001.” All of Appellee’s other claims were rejected on the merits.</p>

The majority focused its analysis on the trial court’s statement, on December 14, 2001, that the basis for its decision to reject Appellee’s plea was that it was unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellee was mentally ill rather than legally insane. It suggested that this case presents an issue of first impression, namely, whether the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard may <a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>be utilized in rejecting a plea tendered in accordance with Section 314(b). In this regard, the majority indicated that such standard “is consistent with that which is set forth in Section 314(a), which allows the trier of fact to reject an insanity defense raised by the defendant <em>at trial, </em>and instead find the defendant guilty but mentally ill.” Superior Court Op. at 7 (emphasis in original). The majority stated, however, that, in contrast to subsection (a), subsection (b) does not indicate any specific degree of proof by which the defendant must demonstrate mental illness at the time of the offense, nor does it require that the defendant be deemed legally sane at the time of the offense. Accordingly, the majority found that the trial court had erred in applying Section 314(a)’s beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement in deciding whether to accept Appellee’s plea of guilty but mentally ill. The court granted a new trial on this basis, prior to which Appellee could seek to enter a plea.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

The dissent noted that the trial court retained discretion to reject Appellee’s plea pursuant to Rule 590(A)(3), Pa.R.Crim.P., and opined that the trial court had acted within such discretion because it was merely allowing for a possible jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. <em>See </em>Dissenting Mem. at 3. Finally, the dissent concluded that the trial court’s actions did not result in any prejudice because, even if Appellee had been permitted to plead guilty but mentally ill, he could still have received the same sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 3 n. 5 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9727(b)(1)).</p>

Both the majority and the dissent addressed whether Judge Wagner erred by refusing Appel<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>lee’s plea at the conclusion of the December 14, 2001 hearing premised upon his application of the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. However, Appellee has never objected to Judge Wagner’s determination in that regard; indeed, counsel affirmatively assented to the court’s ruling as Appellee was then admittedly incompetent to waive a potential insanity defense. The crux of Appellee’s claim is, and has always been, that the trial court erred by refusing to accept his guilty plea <em>after </em>he became competent in March of 2002 because, at that time, he could validly waive any insanity defense. <em>See </em>Superi- or Court op. at 3 (reciting the pertinent appellate issue as whether “the trial court err[ed] when it refused to accept the Appellant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill <em>after Appellant was determined to be mentally competent” </em>(emphasis added)); Motion for a New Trial and Arrest of Judgment, filed August 12, 2002, at 1 <em>(“Once the Defendant was determined to be competent, </em>the court erred when it refused to accept the Defendant’s plea of guilty but mentally ill.” (emphasis added)). Appellee tried several times, without success, to obtain a ruling on his motion to reinstate the plea after regaining competence. The trial court never ruled on the reinstatement motion and, therefore, it never re-employed the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>
