Her father’s insurer denied coverage, arguing that Section 1714 of the Law precludes owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from recovering any insurance benefits. <em><a href="/pa/533/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="533 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1837554" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0181-01">Id.</a> </em>This Court ultimately allowed Henrich to recover uninsured motorist coverage and determined “that Section 1714 does not apply to Ms. Henrich because she was not operating <em>her own </em>uninsured motor vehicle at the time of the accident.” <em>Id. </em>at 1124 (emphasis in original). Relying primarily on <em>Henrich, </em>in <em>Kafando, </em>the Superior Court held that Section 1714 did not bar Kafando, the owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle, from recovering first-party benefits because he was not injured in his uninsured vehicle, but rather, he was injured as a passenger in a properly registered and insured vehicle. <em>See Kafando, <a href="/a2d/704/0675-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="704 A.2d 675" data-case-ids="11876876" data-case-paths="/a2d/704/0675-01">supra.</a></em>

Consequently, the MVFRL does not allow owners such as Son to rely on the financial responsibility of others to circumvent the preclusion set forth in Section 1714. As such, Appellants’ argument that Son had financial responsibility because he was driving Father’s insured vehicle fails.</p>

    <p id="b718-4" data-blocks='[["BL_718.4",718,[237,490,1160,1117]]]'>While the MVFRL mandates in Section 1714 that owners of registered but uninsured vehicles cannot recover first-party benefits, the Law does not preclude such owners from recovering damages for injuries sustained as a result of automobile accidents. Indeed, the Law deems owners of registered but uninsured vehicles to have chosen the limited tort alternative. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(5). This deemed choice allows an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle to be, at least, “eligible to seek compensation for economic loss sustained in a motor vehicle accident as the consequence of the fault of another person pursuant to applicable tort law....” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d). Accordingly, when an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle is the innocent victim of an accident, he or she can sue in tort and, at the very least, recover damages for economic loss. Such a result is consistent with <em>Henrich, </em>which allowed Ms. Henrich to recover uninsured motorist coverage, which, together with underinsured coverage, merely “serves to promote the recovery of damages <em>for innocent victims of accidents </em>with uninsured or underinsured drivers.” <em>Lewis, </em><a href="/pa/568/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="793 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="163638,9446790" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0105-01,/a2d/793/0143-01">793 A.2d at 151</a> (emphasis added).</p>

As we stated in <em>Henrich, </em>however, we will not attribute “harsh motives to the legislature unless they were clearly spelled out.” <em>Henrich, </em><a href="/pa/533/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="533 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1837554" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0181-01">620 A.2d at 1124</a>. In Section 1714 of the MVFRL, the Legislature could not have been any clearer insomuch as it intended to preclude owmers of registered vehicles who do not have financial responsibility from being eligible to recover first-party benefits, regardless of what vehicle in which they are injured. Yet, nowhere in the Law did the Legislature expressly preclude owmers of uninsured vehicles from being eligible to receive the benefits of unin<a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>sured and underinsured motorist coverage if such an owner qualifies to receive this coverage pursuant to another person’s policy. Minus such an express preclusion, the result in <em>Hen-rich </em>is sound—the MVFRL does not preclude owners <em>of </em>registered but uninsured vehicles from recovering uninsured or underinsured coverage.</p>
    <p id="b719-4" data-blocks='[["BL_719.4",719,[179,631,1157,737]]]'>While we are convinced that the result reached in <em>Henrich </em>was correct, we nonetheless must temper <em>Henrich’s </em>purported holding. Because the MVFRL does not expressly preclude owners of registered but uninsured vehicles from benefiting from uninsured and underinsured coverage, it was unnecessary and improper for <em>Henrich </em>to rest its otherwise sound decision on the premise that Section 1714 did not preclude Henrich from recovering uninsured motorist benefits because she was not driving her uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident. As such, while we continue to adhere to the result in <em>Henrich, </em>we are compelled to isolate the explicit holding of <em>Henrich </em>to the facts presented in that case. In any event, the result in <em>Henrich </em>does not afford Son shelter from Section 1714.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">7</a>
