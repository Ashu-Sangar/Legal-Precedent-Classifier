Both the Court of Common Pleas and the Commonwealth Court found that the township commissioners who rejected the subdivision plan in this instance met the requirements of the Code by providing sufficient specificity for at least some of the sixteen reasons they gave for rejection of the plan. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[167,1051,1157,797]]]'>Appellant, Elias Kassouf, owns a tract of land in Scott Township, Allegheny County, on which he planned to construct a residential subdivision. In 1998, appellant began the process of obtaining township approval for the subdivision by filing an application for approval under the township’s Steep Slope Ordinance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellee township denied appellant’s application, and he appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. On October 16, 1998, the court reversed the township’s decision and granted appellant steep slope approval. The following summer, the township attempted to withdraw the approval and require appellant to reapply under a new steep slope ordinance. In response to appellant’s Petition for Clarification, the trial court found that the township could not void appellant’s approval by repealing the prior ordinance and enacting a new one.</p>
    <p id="b547-7" data-blocks='[["BL_547.7",547,[170,1876,1153,313]],["BL_548.1",548,[233,293,1151,670]]]'>On June 13, 2000, appellant filed an application for final subdivision approval of his plan for the tract of land. The application was referred to the township commissioners who, according to township policy in existence at the time, reviewed all applications for completeness before referring them to the township planning commission. The commissioners rejected <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>the plan on June 27, 2000, due to a deficiency in the submission. Appellant submitted a revised subdivision plan on July 25, 2000; this time, the township commissioners referred the plan for consideration to the planning commission. In addition, the revised plan was referred to the township’s engineer, Lennon, Smith, Souleret Engineering, Inc., for review. The engineer determined that the subdivision plan did not conform to the township’s zoning ordinance, subdivision and land development ordinance, grading ordinance, and storm water management ordinance, listing 66 items for appellant to correct or address. The engineer’s report specified the defects found, the requirements not met, and cited to the applicable ordinances.</p>

The commission also heard testimony from residents who complained of flooding and other problems they believed derived from a prior subdivision development in the area which was constructed by appellant. Appellant requested and was granted a sixty-day extension of time for review of his subdivision plan, thereby postponing review until the planning commission’s October 18, 2000 meeting. The township commissioners would then review the planning commission’s recommendation at its October 24, 2000 meeting.</p>

The township engineer reviewed the plan and concluded that it still did not conform to the township’s zoning, subdivision and land development, grading, and storm water management ordinances, this time listing 30 items to be addressed or corrected. This engineer’s report, like the first one, detailed the defects in the plan, the requirements not met, and cited to the four ordinances implicated. Some defects in the July 25, 2000 plan remained uncorrected by appellant in the October 9, 2000 plan, and these defects were again listed as requiring action by appellant. At its October 18, 2000 meeting, the planning commission voted unanimously, with one abstention, to make an unfavorable recommendation regarding the plan to the township commissioners.</p>

The engineer concluded that the latest plan still did not conform to the four ordinances. On November 22, 2000, appellant submitted a letter responding to some of the issues raised in the engineer’s November 17 letter. On November 28, 2000, the township commissioners met and, after discussing appellant’s various submissions, the timing of those submissions, and the engineer’s report, the commissioners voted unanimously to reject appellant’s subdivision plan. The commissioners issued a written decision on December 5, 2000, specifying sixteen independent reasons for denying appellant’s application for subdivision approval.</p>

However, appellant had refused to supply geotechnical information and reports from which the commissioners could determine if the disturbance deviated from that previously permitted, or if the plan met the requirements of the township’s storm water management and zoning ordinances. The trial court found that appellant’s refusal to comply with the requests for geotechnical information was, in itself, sufficient reason to justify the commissioners in rejecting appellant’s plan.</p>

Alternatively, the panel noted that the commissioners’ decision incorporated by reference the township engineer’s report and correspondence, which provided greater detail as to the ordinance requirements implicated and the corresponding defects in the plan, and cited to the applicable ordinances.

Appellant notes that, in <em>Coretsky v. Board of Commissioners of Butler Township, </em><a href="/pa/520/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="520 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1815577" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0513-01">520 Pa. 513</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="520 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="1815577" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0513-01">555 A.2d 72</a> (1989), this Court held that the requirements of Section 508(2) are mandatory. Appellant further notes that there are three essential requirements that comprise the mandate in Section 508(2), to wit: the decision disapproving the application must include (1) a specification of any defect in the application; (2) a description of the requirements in the applicable statute or ordinance which have not been met; and (3) a citation to the statutes or ordinances relied upon. Appellant acknowledges that the township commissioners’ decision letter set forth sixteen independent reasons for denying his application, but he argues that each of those reasons failed to comply with at least two of the three mandatory criteria set forth in Section 508(2). One pervasive defect, in appellant’s view, is that the commissioners’ citations to the ordinances involved referred only to the relevant section numbers, without indicating which specific ordinance (zoning ordinance, subdivision and land development ordinance, grading ordinance, or storm water management ordinance) was at issue.</p>

Appellant argues that <em>Advantage Develop</em>

      <em>ment </em>is inapposite because, in that case, the engineer’s report was specifically incorporated by reference and it was actually physically attached to the township’s decision. The decision in this case attached no such document, and moreover, appellant submits, the references in the decision to various comments and objections of the township engineer were not tied “to any specific letter or other communication.” Thus, appellant argues, he could not know “with any certainty” which comments of the engineer were actually being “incorporated” into the decision so that he could better understand the township’s objections to his subdivision plan.</p>

Appellee argues that the purpose of Section 508(2) is substantive: <em>i.e., </em>it is designed to provide an applicant whose plan has been denied a sufficient understanding of the decision to enable him to determine whether to challenge it, and in turn, to provide a basis for the agency or a court to evaluate any such challenge. Brief for Appellee, 11, <em>citing Advantage </em>Development, <a href="/a2d/743/1008-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="743 A.2d 1008" data-case-ids="11493892" data-case-paths="/a2d/743/1008-01">743 A.2d at 1012</a>. Thus, in appellee’s view, “simple statements of the defects, requirements and provisions are more than adequate.” Appellee further argues that, so long as any of the 16 reasons listed in its decision satisfied the statute, the denial must be upheld. Appellee then argues that reasons (2) through (7) and (14), as set forth in the township decision letter, considered without reference to any other document, clearly set forth specific defects in the plan, the requirements not met, and the ordinance provisions at issue. With respect to appellant’s complaint that the references to ordinances in these instances were to section numbers, without stating which of the ordinances was at issue, appellee responds that the decision made plain the four ordinances which were at issue overall, the content and context of the objections as described made plain which ordinance was at issue; and thus, the failure to refer to the specific ordinance applicable to each <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>citation did not prevent appellant or the trial court from understanding these reasons for the denial.</p>

Appellee notes that the township engineer’s report is divided into sections addressing each ordinance; the report then lists the defects, and makes reference to the applicable ordinances. Appellee argues that nothing in the statute or the case law suggests that the requirements of Section 508(2) cannot be met by incorporation by reference. Similarly, with respect to appellant’s argument that a document which is being incorporated by reference must be attached to the decision, as happened in <em>Advantage Development, </em>appellee argues that there is nothing in the statute or the case law to suggest that such physical attachment is required. With respect to appellant’s professed uncertainty as to which of the township engineer’s submissions was being referred to and incorporated into the decision, appellee argues that what was at issue then before the commissioners was appellant’s “final” submission, and therefore, the references to the engineer’s opinion obviously referred to its November 17, 2000 report, because that was the report which addressed appellant’s final submission.</p>

Although <em>Coretsky </em>is viable law in Pennsylvania, it does not answer the question posed today. The issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is not whether the commissioners were required to comply with Section 508(2)—plainly, they were, and they admit as much. The question is whether the commissioners’ decision as rendered in fact does comply. In this regard, we see no overarching, disqualifying difficulty with the notion of “incorporation by reference.” The Commonwealth Court’s decision in <em>Advantage Development </em>is indeed instructive. In that case, the Board of Supervisors of Jackson Township <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>issued a decision denying a developer’s final subdivision plan.

If the reasons for a denial consist of defects which have already been adequately set forth in an engineer’s report, or other documentation provided to the developer and available to the municipal authority in its decision-making process, it would be a pointless elevation of form over substance to require the authority to essentially cut- and-paste those conclusions into its own decision letter.

The gravamen of this complaint is that the commissioners refused to consider the letter appellant submitted on November 22, 2000, in response to the township engineer’s review of appellant’s November 14, 2000 “final” plan. Appellant argues that a municipality must provide a land use applicant a reasonable opportunity to respond to objections and/or to modify plans.

In any event, to the extent that the commissioners failed to fully consider the letter prior to voting and reducing their decision to writing, and failed to submit the letter to the township engineer for further review, we find no basis to upset the commissioners’ decision in the circumstances <em>sub judice. </em>Appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court’s holding in <em>Raum v.

Appellant’s revisions resulted in substantial delays in the consideration of his plan. At the township commissioners’ October 24, 2000 meeting, the commissioners set a firm dead<a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>line for appellant’s final revision of November 14, 2000. Up to that point, the township engineer had extensively reviewed and responded to all of appellant’s submissions. Our review of the township engineer’s letters indicates that the engineer was not raising new or additional defects in the plan; rather, the plan suffered from the persistence of certain of the same defects noted in earlier reviews of appellant’s plans.

While reciprocal actions taken in good faith are required of the parties, a reciprocal good faith standard cannot simply eliminate the inherent discretionary powers of a municipality in this area. Appellant’s plan raised multiple issues related to non-compliance with ordinances, and appellant was made aware of these defects on a number of occasions between July and October of 2000. That he failed to adequately address them all prior to the November 14, 2000 deadline does not establish bad faith on the part of the township in electing to act without granting him additional time to address the defects.

In the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is easier to conclude that it was appellant who failed to act in good faith. Appellant failed to submit a conforming revised plan by the deadline set by the township commissioners after the township engineer had reviewed and commented upon several revisions of appellants plan.

    <p id="b564-8" data-blocks='[["BL_564.8",564,[226,1600,1157,738]],["BL_565.1",565,[167,291,1152,143]]]'>I join the opinion of the majority in all respects except for its conclusion that the Township Commissioners were not required to review Appellant Elias Kassoufs submission of November 22, 2000, prior to the Commissioners rendering a final decision on his application for subdivision approval. The record is replete with evidence that the Commissioners engaged in a virtual war of attrition against this developer and this development, and thus, acted in less than good faith in considering Appellant’s land use application. In light of the Commissioner’s recalcitrant conduct and in fairness to both parties, I would remand this matter for the Commissioners to fully consider the letter Appellant submitted on November 22, 2000, in response to the Township engineer’s review of Appellant’s November 14, 2000, plan; to give Appellant a “last <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>chance” opportunity to respond to any objections or modify his plan; and for final consideration of the plan by the Commissioners.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[166,462,1155,690]]]'>First, as acknowledged by the majority, it is far from clear whether the Commissioners considered Appellant’s November 22, 2000, letter submitted in response to the Township Engineer’s review of Appellant’s plan. Majority Opinion at pp. 235-37, 883 A.2d at 474. The Commissioners’ decision letter makes vague references to a letter dated November 27, 2000, however, no such letter exists. Even if, as the majority supposes, the Commissioners meant Appellant’s letter of November 22, 2000, but simply erred in their reference thereto, there is no indication that the Commissioners fully considered the letter prior to voting—indeed the record strongly suggests just the opposite, that the Commissioners did not review Appellant’s revised plan.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b565-5" data-blocks='[["BL_565.5",565,[168,1174,1152,585]]]'>Second, while I agree with the majority that, in general, “reciprocal actions taken in good faith are required of the parties” and that “a reciprocal good faith standard cannot simply eliminate the inherent discretionary powers of a municipality in this area,” Majority Opinion at pp. 237-39, 883 A.2d at 475, the majority’s analysis of the parties’ conduct focuses solely on the shortcomings of Appellant. I believe that the majority fails to consider the entire experience of the parties regarding the process of obtaining the Township’s approval for the subdivision, which clearly establishes an equal lack of good faith on the part of the Township.</p>
    <p id="b565-6" data-blocks='[["BL_565.6",565,[167,1782,1155,366]],["BL_566.1",566,[236,293,1157,775]]]'>Specifically absent from the majority’s analysis regarding the good faith of the parties is any discussion of the litigation at the initial stages of the subdivision approval process. In early 1998, Appellant sought approval by the Township of the development of Appellant’s property as a residential subdivision. Approval was sought under the applicable ordinance as well as the then-applicable steep-slope ordinance. The Town<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>ship denied steep-slope approval. Appellant appealed this determination to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, which in October 1998, reversed the Township’s decision and granted steep-slope approval. Yet even after the court’s order granting steep-slope approval, in mid-1999, the Township boldly required Appellant to obtain a <em>new </em>steep-slope approval before he would be permitted to file his subdivision plan. This was because the Township had repealed the old steep-slope ordinance and had replaced it with a new steep-slope ordinance. Again, Appellant was forced to seek recourse in the courts and on November 15,1999, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County ruled that the Township could not reject Appellant’s prior steep-slope approval by repealing the prior ordinance and enacting a new steep-slope ordinance.</p>
    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[235,1101,1155,202]]]'>Thus, the longer view of this seven-year odyssey not only reveals an obdurate Township, employing dubious methods to prevent development of this property but also brings the events that followed into their proper focus.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[231,1326,1158,733]]]'>Thereafter, in June 2000, Appellant filed an application for final subdivision approval. The Township Commissioners initially rejected Appellant’s application, determining that it was incomplete. After re-submitting the application in July 2000, the Commissioners approved referral of the plan for consideration by the Township Planning Commission. The application also was reviewed by the Township engineer, who found 66 defects in the application. Thereafter, Appellant and the Planning Commission engaged in a lengthy period of discussion to arrive at a plan that was acceptable to the Township. Certain defects remained outstanding. Concessions, however, were made by Appellant including a reduction in the number of lots from 19 to 15. Ultimately, the Planning Commission recommended denying the plan on October 18, 2000.</p>
    <p id="b566-6" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[231,2083,1154,256]],["BL_567.1",567,[175,286,1153,96]]]'>The matter was then referred to the Township Commissioners. Specifically, the plan was scheduled for the agenda for decision by the Commissioners only six days later—October 24, 2000. In light of the date on which the Township Commissioners were to consider the plan, Appellant revised the plan <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>and on October 23, 2000, Appellant submitted the plan for the Commissioner’s October 24th meeting.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[174,415,1157,632]]]'>At the October 24, 2000 meeting, the Commissioners were hesitant to consider the plan as it had only been recently received. Appellant expressed his belief that the Commissioners were not required to act that evening, and the Township solicitor recommended granting Appellant an extension. The Commissioners set November 14, 2000 as the date for Appellant to submit a final plan, indicating that a decision would be made at their November 28, 2000, meeting. Appellant agreed to this three-week period to file his plan, with, according to Appellant, the proviso that the Township engineer would promptly comment on Appellant’s October 23, 2000 submission.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[174,1085,1156,477]]]'>The Township engineer, however, did not offer his comments on the plan prior to its due date—November 14. Without the engineer’s comments on the prior plan, and the looming deadline, Appellant submitted a revised plan on November 14th. It was not until November 17, 2000, three days after Appellant’s plan was due, that the Township’s engineer responded to Appellant’s prior plan. On November 22, 2000, five days after receipt of the Township engineer’s comments, Appellant resubmitted his plan.</p>
    <p id="b567-6" data-blocks='[["BL_567.6",567,[175,1593,1157,472]],["BL_568.1",568,[248,294,1150,97]]]'>A review of the transcript reveals that the November meeting appeared to be a foregone conclusion. When the plan was placed before the Commissioners as an agenda item, the first comment on the plan was a motion to reject the plan. There was no request for a report by the Township engineer or from the Township solicitor, and there was no request for comments by Appellant. The Commissioners immediately considered a motion for rejection. After limited discussion, the Chairman called for a vote after expressing his reservation regarding <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>voting without reviewing the most recent submission. The Commissioners unanimously rejected Appellant’s plan.</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[246,420,1152,742]]]'>In conclusion, while I join the majority’s opinion in virtually all respects, I respectfully dissent from its analysis regarding the respective good faith of the parties. While Appellant may have not at all times acted in good faith, the Township, as evidenced by its seven-year battle against development of this property, also acted in less than good faith. Accordingly, in fairness to both parties, I would remand the matter to the Commissioners to consider the letter Appellant submitted on November 22, 2000, in response to the Township engineer’s review of Appellant’s November 14, 2000 plan, to give Appellant a final opportunity to respond to any objections made thereto or a final chance to modify his plan, and for the Commissioners to render a final determination approving or disapproving of the plan.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[245,1224,1025,97]]]'>Madame Justice NEWMAN joins this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>

      <p id="b565-7" data-blocks='[["BL_565.7",565,[172,2183,1151,152]]]'>. For example, the President of the Board of Commissioners, Craig P. Steven, expressed discomfort with voting on the plan without reviewing the revised plans, R.R. 404, and the record suggests that the other Commissioners did not even see the revised plan. R.R. 400-01, 404.</p>

Although an express agreement by the Township’s engineer to provide a response prior to the due date for the submission of the final plan does not appear to be contained in the record, it is axiomatic that receipt of the Township engineer’s response to the October 23, <em>2000 </em>submission after the date on which the "final” submission was due would be valueless to Appellant.</p>
