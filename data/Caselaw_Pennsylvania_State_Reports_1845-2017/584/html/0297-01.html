As the Superior Court noted, Ted testified at trial that Bruce told him: “[I]f I [Ted] didn’t do this, not one [presumably Doug] would be gone, two [presumably Doug and Ted] would be gone. Meaning that if I didn’t get it done, not one [would be] fired, two are fired.” Ted spoke to Doug sometime in June of 1992 about not pursuing his WC claim, explaining that if Doug did not sign the release abrogating his rights under the Workers’ Compensation Act, Bruce would fire them both. Doug initially agreed to sign the release. Ted testified that Doug said, “Dad, to save your job, I will sign it.” Ted evidently had a change of heart, and later told Doug that he need not sign the release. Doug presumably took his father’s <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>offer to heart, as he declined to execute the release.

Dr. Yonas Zegeye performed the surgery, and subsequently proffered her expert opinion that Doug’s injury was the result of his lifting of heavy computer equipment while at work. Approximately a month thereafter, on July 16, 1992, Bruce called a meeting and requested that his son, Bruce Jr., Ted, Doug, and Doug’s wife attend. The purpose of the meeting was to attempt to coerce Doug into signing the release of his WC benefits. Again, as noted by the Superior Court, Ted’s testimony during the trial of this case described the meeting as follows: “[Bruce] gave Doug a paper and he said, ‘Doug I want this signed;’ and Doug responded, ‘Uncle Bruce, I can’t sign this paper.’ ” Thereafter, Bruce and Doug got into an argument which escalated to the point where Bruce told Doug, “get the ‘f out of the shop, you’re fired,” causing Doug and his wife to exit the meeting. Bruce then turned his attention to Ted telling him: “remember what I told you.” Ted took this to mean that he was also fired because he had not convinced Doug to sign the release. Ted gathered his personal belongings and left Motor Sales the same day.</p>

The DOL asked Motor Sales to send information regarding Doug’s termination from employment to permit evaluation of the UC claim. Motor Sales responded that Doug was on medical leave<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> and as of September, 1992, had neither resigned nor been terminated from employment.</p>

Thus, Doug had not voluntarily terminated his employment. The DOL also determined that Doug’s conduct prior to and during that incident did not constitute willful misconduct. Finally, the DOL determined that as of September 24, 1992, Doug’s physician had released him only to engage in limited light duty work.

Motor Sales appealed that decision, but eventually withdrew the appeal. Accordingly, Ted was paid UC benefits.</p>

The jury awarded Ted compensatory damages totaling $192,000, but declined to award punitive damages. Motor Sales filed post-trial motions seeking remittitur and judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>The trial court denied those post-trial motions, and Motor Sales appealed to the Superior Court.</p>

Nevertheless, we note that the <em>Lins </em>court confronted the precise issue before us and, as the four-prong test used therein serves as a convenient analytical framework for disposition of this matter, we do employ it herein solely as an aid in deciding this case.</p>
    <p id="b629-5" data-blocks='[["BL_629.5",629,[172,1463,1153,528]],["BL_630.1",630,[238,298,1155,89]]]'>Our first inquiry is whether a clear public policy is implicated in Doug’s termination by Motor Sales. In <em>Shick, </em>we held that an employee cannot be terminated for seeking WC benefits. Such decision would be a Pyrrhic victory for Doug and all other Pennsylvania employees, if it could be as easily circumvented as Motor Sales contends here. We believe it is self-evident that if public policy prohibits termination for seeking workers’ compensation, it also prohibits termination for declining to compel a subordinate employee to not seek compensation. We, thus, have little difficulty in concluding <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>that there is a clear public policy supporting the logical incremental extension of <em>Shick </em>to the facts of this case.</p>

For the reasons just stated, we believe it clear that such supervisory employee requires our protection. Indeed, there is little doubt that the policy of protecting subordinate employees’ rights to seek WC benefits will be well-nigh eliminated if employers can avoid the rule of <em>Shick </em>by pressuring and firing supervisors who do not or cannot coerce subordinate employees into foregoing their rights. Moreover, it would be equally repugnant for this Court to turn its back on such supervisors, who amount to innocent pawns in a conflict between employer and subordinate employee, and, nevertheless, would find themselves out of employment without cause or recourse absent this decision.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.5",630,[230,1354,1157,681]]]'>Third, we consider whether employers in general have an overriding justification for considering a supervisory employee’s refusal to terminate a subordinate employee seeking WC benefits as a factor affecting the decision to discharge such supervisory employee. In the instant case, it appears from this record that Motor Sales has no justification, let alone one that overrides all, for terminating Ted because he refused to coerce Doug into foregoing his compensation benefits. Further, we agree with the Superior Court that an employer, such as Motor Sales, may not justify a supervisory employee’s termination based on his or her refusal to perform a directive which is violative of public policy as enunciated in case law, such as the one at issue here.</p>

Initially, we note that the jury in this case entered its verdict through special interrogatories. It was asked: “Was the termination of plaintiff, Theodore C. Rothrock, due to the <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>filing or pursuit of claim for workers’ compensation by plaintiff, Douglas Rothroek?” It answered: “Yes.” After the close of the trial, Motor Sales requested, <em>inter alia, </em>judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>Accordingly, as we now review this case, in substance we are being asked to grant judgment <em>n.o.v., </em>and accordingly we may consider only the evidence supportive of the verdict, providing the verdict winner with the benefit of any doubt. <em>Degenhardt v.

In accord with that standard of review, we, without hesitation, conclude that the jury was free to believe that upon learning of Doug’s injury, Bruce told Ted to force Doug to sign documents waiving compensation, or face personal termination. At the July 16, 1992 meeting, when Doug refused to waive his benefits, Bruce first told Doug he was fired and threw him out <em>of </em>the business, and then immediately turned to Ted and said remember what I told you, alluding to his prior threat that if Doug did not waive benefits, Ted would be fired. Thus, we find it self-evident that Ted’s refusal to dissuade Doug from pursuing benefits was not only a substantial factor in Motor Sales’ decision to fire Ted, but was the only factor.</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[174,1488,1156,375]]]'>On the basis of all the above, we hold, as a necessary corollary to the policy established in <em>Shick, supra, </em>that a Pennsylvania employer may not seek to have a supervisory employee dissuade a subordinate employee from seeking WC benefits. If an employer does so, the supervisory employee shall have a cause of action for wrongful discharge from employment.</p>
    <p id="b631-5" data-blocks='[["BL_631.5",631,[175,1906,1156,428]]]'>Before closing, we must consider whether the Superior Court erred in extending the rule of <em>Shick </em>to this case. Motor Sales accurately points out that <em>Shick </em>was decided in 1998, and that Ted was terminated in 1992. Accordingly, Motor Sales argues that retroactive application of the alleged new principles of law announced in <em>Shick </em>and its extension in this case would unfairly burden employers with the obligation of “predicting the future.”</p>

      <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Contrary to Motor Sales’ assertion, we do not believe that <em>Shick’s </em>application to this case implicates retroactivity concerns. As noted earlier, trial in the instant case was actually stayed pending disposition of <em>Shick, </em>and accordingly the parties had the benefit of that decision during all but the pre-trial proceedings herein. In Pennsylvania, the general rule is that we apply the law in effect at the time of the appellate decision. <em>Blackwell v.
