The Honorable Joan Orie Melvin authored the majority opinion for a fractured <em>en banc </em>court, reversing the trial court, concluding that full tort remedies were available to the children, and finding that Section 1705(a)(5) bound only Theresa, as the owner of the registered but uninsured vehicle to the limited tort option. The majority rejected the reasoning of the Commonwealth Court in <em>Hames, </em>concluding that the court failed to provide an analysis of the relevant sections and definitions provided in the MVFRL. Moreover, the majority found that the Commonwealth Court improperly equated the term “named insured” in subsection (b)(2) with “owner” in (a)(5) and thus disregarded the statutory definitions of the terms and created a fictitious insurance policy under which the children would be “insureds” subject to the limited tort option. The majority observed that the Commonwealth Court apparently reached this conclusion in part to avoid providing greater rights to the children of uninsured motorists than to children of financially responsible parents who opted for limited tort coverage. Judge Orie Melvin rejected the suggestion that the children of uninsured motorists would be better off than children whose parent chose limited tort coverage due to a number of other consequences resulting from a parent’s failure to insure a vehicle, such as criminal penalties and fines, lack of uninsured motorist coverage, and potential tort claims against the parent, if the parent was at fault in an accident.</p>

In construing a statute, the courts must attempt to give meaning to every word in a statute as we cannot assume that the legislature intended any words to be mere surplusage. Furthermore, we should avoid construing a statute in such a way as would lead to an absurd result. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922.

In <em>Names, </em>the Commonwealth <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>Court failed to take into account the distinction between an “owner” and a “named insured” which the General Assembly took pains to distinguish. Section 1705(f) specifically defines a “named insured” as “[a]ny individual identified by name as an insured in a policy of private passenger motor vehicle insurance.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(f). Had the legislature intended to equate the two terms they could have specified such in either subsection (a)(5) or (f) by defining a “named insured” to include both individuals actually named in an insurance policy and those deemed to have chosen the limited tort option pursuant to 1705(a)(5), or by specifying that an uninsured owner will be deemed to be a named insured in a limited tort insurance policy.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> This Court may not amend the statute but instead must examine the statute as drafted by the legislature.

Furthermore, the owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle would be denied recovery of first party benefits under any other policy, which include medical, income loss, accidental death, and funeral benefits under Section 1714 or denied recovery under the Assigned Claims Plan pursuant to Section 1752(a)(3). Moreover, the owner would be subject to the penalties, including criminal charges, fines, and suspension of operating privileges, under Section 1786.

The responsive opinions in this Court and the fractured opinions in the Superior Court below evince that reasonable minds may differ as to whether the legislature intended to bind the children of owners of registered but uninsured vehicles to limited tort coverage in the same way it bound children of parents who affirmatively elect limited tort coverage. Unlike the concurring and dissenting justices, we cannot state with certainty that the provision of full tort benefits to the children of owners of registered but uninsured vehicles would undermine the legislative purpose of premium reductions by adding significant cost to insurance premiums of other Pennsylvanians or by inducing those who currently have chosen limited tort policies to abandon their current insurance, and all the inherent benefits, in order to secure full tort benefits for their children. We find such a theoretical hypothesis necessarily suspect given the many benefits that insurance provides and the limited number of children affected by this decision, which only applies to those children who suffer non-serious injuries, because even if they were deemed to be bound by limited tort, seriously injured children of uninsured owners, like others bound by limited tort, would have a right to seek damages for pain and suffering. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d).</p>

I join in the result that the Majority reaches because of the unambiguous words of Section 1705(b)(3) of Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL), 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(b)(3). By holding that the children of an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle are not bound to limited tort remedies despite the fact that their parent is deemed to have chosen the limited tort option, this Court confers greater benefits on children of parents who have not maintained financial responsibility than on those with financially responsible parents. Nevertheless, as the Majority states, “the clarity of the language does not require us to look to the purposes of the statute.” Majority Opinion at 207-09, 883 A.2d at 457. I write separately to express my opinion that I find it difficult to believe that the legislature could have intended this outcome when it provided for the election of tort options and financial responsibility at Section 1705 of the MVFRL.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

Because Holland drove without insurance, and paid no premium whatsoever, her children are now entitled to pursue noneconomic damages, in the same way they would have had their mother bought the full tort option. Stated most simply, the direct result of the Majority’s decision is to encourage and reward failure to comply with the law, an outcome that the legislature surely did not intend when it implemented the MVFRL. While I am sympathetic to the plight of some families who may be unable to afford automobile insurance, even with the lower premium charged for the limited tort option, the fact is that the MVFRL requires it. To comply with the law, an individual need not buy full tort and can maintain financial responsibility by choosing the limited tort option. However, the problem in this case is that Theresa Holland did neither; rather, she drove without insurance. The inability to afford automobile insurance does not allow for an exception to the requirement of maintaining financial responsibility.</p>

The Majority applied <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>the literal wording of this Section, which is the only way this Court can read it because the words are clear. This requires us to determine that the Holland children are entitled to the full tort option because they do not own a car and are not named insureds, since their mother drove an uninsured car. Because it is true that the Holland children did not own the registered uninsured car, they are not precluded from maintaining an action for noneconomic loss.</p>

In <em>Hames, </em>the Commonwealth Court concluded that children of an owner of a registered but uninsured vehicle were bound by their mother’s deemed selection of the limited tort option. I believe that these two conflicting determinations reflect the dilemma that this matter presents—applying the literal words of one section of the statute yields a result that the legislature likely did not intend to govern the outcome in the instant case. The fractured Superior Court Opinion in this matter, too, indicates the difficulty of reconciling the words of Section 1705(b)(3) with the intent of the MVFRL. <em>Holland v.

    <p id="b538-4" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[232,514,1160,1213]]]'>I do not believe that the legislation was promulgated to bestow greater benefits on children of the uninsured than on those whose parents purchased insurance. The Majority intimates that providing full tort benefits to children of uninsured parents will not contribute to escalating insurance costs, labeling that a “theoretical hypothesis,” which is “necessarily suspect,” due to a lack of record evidence regarding the addition of costs to the system. Majority Opinion at 207 n. 15, 883 A.2d at 456 n. 15. I maintain that there can be little doubt that allowing recovery of full tort remedies in the absence of the payment of any premium adds costs to the system. In <em>Windrim, </em>we stated that “in passing the [MVFRL], the Legislature was primarily concerned with the rising consumer cost of automobile insurance, created in part by the substantial number of uninsured motorists who contributed nothing to the pool of insurance funds from which claims were paid.” <em>Windrim, </em><a href="/a2d/641/1154-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="641 A.2d 1154" data-case-ids="11296791,775553" data-case-paths="/a2d/641/1154-01,/pa/537/0129-01">641 A.2d at 1156</a> (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, I take exception to this assertion and posit that we can take judicial notice of the fact that when people recover full tort remedies for which they have paid no concomitant premium, the system incurs a cost for which it is not compensated. I see no need to provide record evidence of what is, in fact, a truism.</p>

In the absence of that specific language, the Majority correctly concludes that it would be necessary for the legislature to insert additional words into Section 1705(a) to demonstrate its intention that children be bound by the choices of their parents.</p>

Section 1705(a)(5) is included in the same section as Section 1705(a)(l)A., which states that Pennsylvania law “give[s] you the right to choose a form of insurance that limits your right and the right of members of your household to seek financial compensation.... ” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(l)A. If the mother of the Holland children had actively chosen limited tort, instead of driving without insurance, her children would have been the recipients of that choice, pursuant to Section 1705(a)(l)A. However, their mother did not choose, and the legislature left a hole with the “deemed to have chosen” language by not providing that, as in Section 1705(a)(l)A., the children, too, are “deemed to have chosen” the option of their mother.</p>

I believe the majority looks at the statute through an overly narrow lens, and by doing so it overlooks the ambiguity that arises when each provision of this statute is given effect. The words of § 1705 lack clarity when its parts are read <em>in pari materia, </em>and since the goal of judicial interpretation of this void in the statute is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> we are required to ascertain that intent and to interpret the statute in a manner consistent therewith.</p>

Judge Bowes cited spiraling auto insurance costs and the resultant increase in the number of uninsured motorists as the foremost reasons for the 1990 amendments to the MVFRL. <em>Holland v. Marcy, </em><a href="/a2d/817/1082-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="817 A.2d 1082" data-case-ids="9369132" data-case-paths="/a2d/817/1082-01">817 A.2d 1082</a>, 1096 n. 7 (Pa.Super.2002) (Bowes, J., concurring and dissenting, joined by Johnson and Lally-Green, JJ.)

Judge Bowes noted the legislature enacted the 1990 amendments to the MVFRL to deal with the high costs of auto insurance and to make auto insurance affordable for uninsured motorists by establishing limited tort benefits, which could be purchased at <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>lower premiums. <em><a href="/a2d/817/1082-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="817 A.2d 1082" data-case-ids="9369132" data-case-paths="/a2d/817/1082-01">Id.,</a> </em>at 1096 n. 7. Because the legislature’s goal was to ensure there would be no excuse for driving without some form of insurance, the MVFRL should be construed to avoid rewarding motorists who intentionally neglect to purchase insurance. <em><a href="/a2d/817/1082-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="817 A.2d 1082" data-case-ids="9369132" data-case-paths="/a2d/817/1082-01">Id.,</a> </em>at 1096 (citing <em>McClung v.

    <blockquote id="b542-4" data-blocks='[["BL_542.4",542,[275,695,1116,572]]]'>Pursuant to the MVFRL, only a “named insured” under an insurance policy can choose a tort option. By indicating that an uninsured automobile owner is considered to “have chosen” the limited tort option, the legislature intended the uninsured vehicle owner to be treated like a named insured under an insurance policy. When read <em>in pari materia, </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(a)(5) and § 1705(d) support such an interpretation of the MVFRL.... Clearly, this language evinces an intent by the legislature to create the legal fiction of an insurance policy where the uninsured owner of a vehicle stands in the shoes of a named insured.</blockquote>

Therefore, pursuant to § 1705(b)(2), the limited tort option also applies to the minor children of the “named insured.” I would reverse the determination of the Superior Court and remand for findings as to whether Joel Holland sustained permanent serious disfigurement permitting recovery under the limited tort option.</p>
