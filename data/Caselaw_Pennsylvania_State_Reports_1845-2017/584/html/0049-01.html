Essentially, DPW sought to determine whether changes should be made to CYS’s policies and procedures, to help prevent future tragedies.</p>

DPW sent its findings and recommendations to Lehigh County’s county executive. The county executive distributed the review to other individuals within the county who were responsible for preparing a “plan of correction.” When completed, that plan was submitted to DPW.</p>
    <p id="b376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_376.6",376,[240,1208,1155,891]]]'>Sometime thereafter, the administrators filed a petition for issuance of a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>to the regional director of the Pennsylvania Office of Children and Youth Services. The estate sought pre-complaint discovery from DPW, to assist in determining whether they had a claim against CYS or any other public agencies. Specifically, the administrators sought a subpoena requiring DPW to produce all “notes, records, reports and/or correspondence prepared and compiled by [CYS] in connection with [DPW’s] reviews of [CYS’s] procedures in the child abuse investigations of [the babysitter].” Petition for Issuance of Subpoena <em>Duces Tecum, </em>11/13/00, at 2. DPW asserted that the child death review was confidential under the CPSL, <em>see </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 6339 (designating certain child protective services information as confidential), and that the administrators were not among the individuals to whom such confidential information could be released. <em>See id., </em>§ 6340 (pertaining to release of confidential information).</p>

We hold child death reviews are what the General Assembly has designated them: intergovernmental performance audits, not reports pursuant to § 6339, and are available to only those authorized in § 6343(b).

Rather, I prefer to simply trust that DPW will continue to faithfully monitor the performance of county agencies, conducting performance audits when warranted, and that county agencies and their employees will continue to cooperate with such audits so as to maximize the protections provided to abused and neglected children.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">4</a>
