    <p id="b688-11" data-blocks='[["BL_688.9",688,[245,1200,1152,582]]]'>In November of 1999, while working as an inventory picker in a warehouse operated by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (the “PLCB”), Appellee, John Gallagher, fell through an opening in an elevated walkway. He later commenced a negligence action against the PLCB; World Transportation, Inc., a logistical company that provided distribution and warehousing support to the PLCB; Appellant, Trans Freight Systems, Inc., which was also involved in the warehouse operations and which was World Transportation’s parent corporation; and others. Among other injuries, Appellee claimed to have suffered a disabling brain injury.</p>

Appellee made a pre-trial request pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 213(b), styled as a motion <em>in limine, </em>to have the question of which entity was his employer and the remaining trial issues bifurcated and otherwise to prohibit the mention of workers’ compensation during the proposed, separate <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>general liability and damages proceedings. Appellant acknowledged that the collateral source rule precludes references to other sources of recovery that are deemed irrelevant at trial, in order to avoid the possibility that an improper inference by jurors of a double recovery on the plaintiffs part might diminish due and proper damages which would otherwise be assessed against the tortfeasor. <em>See, e.g., Lobalzo v. Varoli, </em><a href="/pa/409/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1883205" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0015-01">409 Pa. 15</a>, 21, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.2d%20557" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="185 A.2d 557">185 A.2d 557</a>, 561(1962). Appellant contended, however, that such collateral source information is admissible for limited purposes where it has specific relevance to a liability issue in a civil case. In this regard, Appellant posited that its payment of workers’ compensation premiums on Appellee’s behalf tended to show that it was, in fact, Appellee’s employer, and thus, not a proper party to the action. The trial court agreed with Appellant’s position on this point and denied relief on the motion, but with the proviso that the “parties may mention workers’ compensation only to show that premiums were paid on behalf of plaintiff.” <em>See </em>Reproduced Record (“R.R.”), at 286a; <em>accord </em>R.R., at 291a (reflecting the trial court’s admonishment to counsel that “any mention of a collateral source would be barred, any payments”).</p>

According to Appellee, the subject of workers’ compensation is so inherently prejudicial that errors in permitting references to it cannot be corrected by simple admonishments to jurors to ignore the topic. In this regard, Appellant points to some of the more forceful statements of this Court which have arisen in various contexts.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Additionally, Appellee disputes the relevance of the premium payments to the employer identity issue, noting that the question of employment status is one of law, which turns on the exercise, or the right to exercise, control. Furthermore, even if it were to be determined that there was a disputed factual question as to which premium payments could be deemed relevant, Appellee’s position is that the court was bound to implement bifurcation to prevent the possibility of taint, particularly since an employer, as a matter of law, cannot be a party in a personal injury action brought by an employee against a negligent third party. <em>See Heckendorn v.

When a juror hears that a plaintiff has previously-received compensation for his injuries, it is only natural for the juror to weigh that information, either consciously or not, in the calculation of damages due to the plaintiff and decrease the plaintiffs award, thereby allowing the tortfeasor to “ride to immunity from his wrong on the back of worker’s compensation paid by someone else.” <em>Boudwin, </em><a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.2d%20259" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="188 A.2d 259">188 A.2d at 259</a>.

The majority apparently would have required the plaintiff to file a partial summary judgment motion to gain a “global pre-trial disposition of the question” and therefore does not fault the trial court’s "apparent <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>understanding that the facts may have been in dispute and, correspondingly, its decision to proceed with the fact finding process.” Maj. Op. at 374-76, 883 A.2d at 558. As I believe the bifurcation motion and the universally acknowledged proscription against placing collateral sources of recovery before a jury should have prompted the court to determine if the factual and legal issues relating to the employer issue required presentation to the jury, I conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in deferring determination of the issue until conclusion of the trial, when the damage was irreparable.</p>
