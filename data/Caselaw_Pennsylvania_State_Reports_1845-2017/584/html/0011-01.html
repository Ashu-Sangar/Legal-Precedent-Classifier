In this case, the Superior Court applied <em>Grant </em>and dismissed Appellant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Presently, we are asked to consider whether this court should recognize a “short sentence” exception to the general rule announced in <em>Grant. </em>For the reasons stated herein, we agree with the disposition of the Superior Court and reject a “short sentence” exception. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>

During the course of the riot, police observed individuals in the crowd pounding on cars and observed two or three individuals shake and bring down a lamp post. Appellant was observed by the police shaking a lamp post during the course of the incident. As a result of his participation in the incident, the police charged Appellant with the misdemeanor offenses of disorderly conduct and failure of a disorderly person to disperse and with the summary offense of criminal mischief. A jury convicted Appellant of all three charges on November 14, 2000. On December 14, 2000, the trial court sentenced Appellant to thirty days to twenty-three and a half months in prison plus the payment of fines. The trial court’s order also provided that Appellant could remain free on bail until his appeal was <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>final.

Following the hearing, the trial court denied the post-sentence motion. New counsel entered an appearance on Appellant’s behalf and filed a Notice of Appeal in the Superior Court on May 7, 2001. Appellant filed his brief in the Superior Court on October 23, 2002, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and raising an issue related to counsel’s effectiveness at trial.</p>

    <p id="b338-7" data-blocks='[["BL_338.7",338,[239,1625,1154,636]]]'>The issue in this case arises because under the plain language of the Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), an appellant is only eligible for post-conviction relief if he is “currently serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation or parole for the crime.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(1). Following this court’s decision in <em>Grant, </em>claimants are to wait until the collateral review stage before raising claims of ineffectiveness. Thus, the net effect of these two rules is that claimants may not have the opportunity to raise a claim challenging trial counsel’s effectiveness if their direct appeal is final at a time when they are no longer serving a sentence of imprisonment, probation, or parole.</p>

In this case, Appellant argues that he is placed in the unfair position of losing his opportunity to litigate his ineffectiveness claims. Appellant concludes that such a result conflicts with the intent of <em>Grant, </em>which was to offer “a petitioner the best avenue to effect his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.” <em>Grant, </em><a href="/pa/572/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="813 A.2d 726" data-case-ids="716471,9381173" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0048-01,/a2d/813/0726-01">813 A.2d at 738</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[165,1107,1159,841]]]'>The Commonwealth responds that Appellant is in such an “unfair” position by his own doing. The trial court originally permitted Appellant to defer his sentence until after his direct appeal was final, but Appellant elected to serve his sentence while his direct appeal was pending. Thus, Appellant essentially has “mooted” his own opportunity to take advantage of the PCRA. Similarly, the Commonwealth contends that Appellant waived this issue by failing to raise it until after the Superior Court ruled on his direct appeal. Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). Turning its attention to the <em>Grant </em>decision, the Commonwealth asserts that the Superior Court certainly had no power to create an exception to <em>Grant, </em>only this court has such power. Further, the Commonwealth argues that this court should not recognize a “short sentence” exception to <em>Grant, </em>since such an exception would undermine the reasoning underlying that decision.</p>
    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[167,1979,1156,256]],["BL_340.1",340,[240,298,1153,463]]]'>We will address the Commonwealth’s preliminary challenges before addressing the primary issue raised in this case. First, the Commonwealth argues that Appellant’s predicament is self-created since he opted to serve his sentence early. We are not going to foreclose Appellant’s opportunity to raise the <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>issue in this case merely on the basis that Appellant chose to serve his sentence before his direct appeal was final. In fact, the instant case presents a perfect vehicle to review this issue, since Appellant will not have the opportunity to pursue collateral relief as he has finished serving his sentence. Moreover, the “short sentence” issue has been percolating in the Superi- or Court since <em>Grant </em>was decided; and the instant case presents this court with an opportunity to resolve this question.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[233,812,1157,1005]]]'>Second, the Commonwealth argues that this issue is waived since Appellant did not raise it until after the Superior Court decided his direct appeal on September 10, 2003. According to the Commonwealth, the fact that Appellant filed his appeal and brief before <em>Grant </em>is not relevant, rather Appellant had a duty to amend his brief following our decision in <em>Grant. </em>First, <em>Grant </em>was not decided until over two months after Appellant filed his brief before the Superior Court. Additionally, in the months following <em>Grant, </em>it was unclear how the decision was going to be interpreted by the lower courts and applied in any given case. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Grant, </em><a href="/pa/573/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="573 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="197200" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0141-01">573 Pa. 141</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="821 A.2d 1246" data-case-ids="197146,197200,9141217,9141253" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0140-01,/pa/573/0141-01,/a2d/821/1246-01,/a2d/821/1246-02">821 A.2d 1246</a> (2003) (clarifying that <em>Grant </em>will “not apply to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel where the immediate appellate court on direct appeal has rendered a disposition on the merits.”) Indeed, immediately following our decision in <em>Grant, </em>the Superior Court applied <em>Grant </em>in certain cases and ignored <em>Grant </em>in favor of a “short sentence” exception in other cases. Accordingly, we disagree that this issue is waived.</p>

One of the salutary, corrective, and visionary features of <em>Grant </em>was its recognition that direct and collateral review should be permitted to play the distinct and essential roles they are supposed to serve in the criminal justice system. The appropriate forum for litigating claims of ineffectiveness is under the PCRA. That “short sentence” defendants may not be able to pursue such claims is an appropriate consequence of a legislative choice made by the people’s duly-elected representatives. It makes no more sense to torture post-trial practice to convert it into a quasi-PCRA role than it does to torture the direct appeal process to serve the same <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>quasi-collateral function. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims, as a class, are no more important than other substantive constitutional claims deemed cognizable under the PCRA, such that they must be afforded an <em>ad hoc, </em>judicially-created, extra-PCRA forum.

For instance, it seems logical that, in a case where the defendant is serving a lengthy sentence, if the trial court is essentially asked to permit a defendant to compress collateral/PCRA review into his post-trial motions and direct appeal, the cost of doing so should be an explicit waiver of the right to pursue a <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>later petition as of right under the PCRA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> The post-verdict process should not be allowed to become a vehicle by which a defendant secures a second round of collateral attack as of right, raising new claims of ineffective assistance, where the PCRA explicitly envisions a single collateral challenge, in the absence of the extraordinary circumstances governing serial petitions as set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b).</p>
