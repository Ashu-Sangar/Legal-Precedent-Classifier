In response, Appellee filed a “Motion to Examine [Complainant] ... For Competency,” wherein he requested that Complainant be evaluated by a psychologist to determine whether he was competent to testify. After holding several hearings on the matter, the trial court granted Appellee’s motion and directed Complainant to submit to an examination by Appellee’s proposed psychologist. The Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the trial court’s ordering of a psychological exam was premature, when the trial court judge had not first attempted <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>to determine Claimant’s competency based on his own observations at a competency hearing. In denying the Commonwealth’s motion, the trial court noted that it was in a “difficult position” because the trial was scheduled to begin just six days later, Tr. Ct. Op. at 2, but it nonetheless reaffirmed its earlier order directing Complainant to submit to an exam by Appellee’s proposed psychologist. At the same time, however, the trial court directed the psychologist to confine the examination to determining whether Complainant could “give a correct account of the matters that the witness has seen or heard regarding the incidents alleged.” Tr.

In its published <em>en banc </em>opinion, the Superior Court discussed the importance of the Commonwealth’s right to immediately appeal pretrial orders that are effectively “final” because such orders cannot be appealed later due to double jeopardy concerns. It further noted that this Court has not limited the Commonwealth’s right to certify an appeal pursuant to Rule 311(d) to only those circumstances in which the order at issue suppresses Commonwealth evidence. <em>See <a href="/a2d/828/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="828 A.2d 383" data-case-ids="9105674" data-case-paths="/a2d/828/0383-01">id.</a> </em>at 386 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

The Superior Court nevertheless concluded that here, the trial court’s order directing Complainant to submit to a psychological examination was not immediately appealable because it did not circumscribe the Commonwealth’s evidence. The Superior Court contrasted the situation at hand with one in which a trial court enters an order declaring a critical child witness incompetent to testify, in which case the Commonwealth is able to appeal because the order prevents it from presenting evidence necessary to prove its case. The Superior Court likewise opined that the Commonwealth could appeal an order denying a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the defendant from presenting psychological evidence as long as the Commonwealth certified that the order substantially hampered or otherwise terminated its case.</p>

The dissent took the position that the Commonwealth’s good-faith certification <em>alone </em>is sufficient to vest jurisdiction in the Superior Court in an appeal brought pursuant to Rule 311(d) and that because the Commonwealth in the instant case certified that its case <em>would </em>be terminated or substantially hampered by the trial court’s order, the Superior Court did indeed have jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 311(d).

Rather, we merely noted that the fact that the Commonwealth bears the burden of proof in a criminal trial provides the underlying justification for permitting the certification of appeals pursuant to Rule 311(d), and then went on to state that its interest in preserving its ability to meet that burden must be balanced against the defendant’s right to maintain control over his or her own evidence. Ultimately, in order to balance those two competing interests, we held that application of 311(d) .in the suppression context is limited “to those ‘circumstances provided by law in which a pretrial ruling results in the suppression, preclusion or exclusion of Commonwealth evidence.” <a href="/pa/575/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="575 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="630509" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0411-01">575 Pa. at 420-21</a>, <a href="/pa/575/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="836 A.2d 871" data-case-ids="630509,9298283" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0411-01,/a2d/836/0871-01">836 A.2d at 877</a>.
