Thus, Appellants assert that where plaintiffs elect to proceed with a strict-liability, crashworthiness case, they must necessarily forego claims against negligent tortfeasors for the divisible, enhanced injuries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Implicit in various aspects of Appellants’ argumentation is an attack on the trial court’s decision to denominate Pet-roll’s conduct as a substantial factor in causing the deaths of the Harsh family members based upon his criminal convictions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Indeed, substantial passages of Appellants’ briefs are dedicated to elaborating upon the evidence suggesting that the Harshes survived the initial impact caused by the truck for which Appellants bore responsibility, in furtherance of the position that Petroll’s negligent conduct should be viewed as <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>substantially remote from the losses associated with the resultant fire. Appellants nevertheless concede that, had the Estates not included the claims against General Motors on a strict-liability, crashworthiness theory, the Estates would have been entitled to assert claims for full liability as to all injuries, including death, against Appellants. Appellants’ principal argument thus contemplates that the Estates’ election to assert a crashworthiness claim yields an essential, corollary curtailment of the liability of an original negligent tortfeasor. Appellants cite Section 433A of the Second Restatement of Torts and Sections 16(a) and (b) of the Third Restatement of Torts, Product Liability, as supportive of this position, as well as a line of Pennsylvania intermediate appellate court decisions that have employed a multi-factor test to determine the propriety of apportionment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Finally, Appellants stress that they had no control over the design of the Lumina’s fuel distribution system, and therefore, contend that they should not be liable for deaths that it caused.</p>

Factually, Appellees emphasize the violent nature of the collision caused by Petroll’s negligence, and, in particular, the status of the crash as the impetus leading to the breach of the Lumina’s fuel distribution system, as the cause of the sparks that ignited released gasoline vapor, and as the reason why the Harshes were unable to dislodge the doors of the Lumina to escape the crushed and burning vehicle. Appellees argue that it is very clear that Petroll’s negligence combined with the design defect in the vehicle fuel system that was found by the jury to have been a concurrent cause of the fatalities. In this regard, they derive support from the facts; the directed verdict entered by the trial court against Appellants as to substantial-factor causation; the jury’s verdict; and Appel<a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>lants’ concession that had General Motors not been hailed into court on a crashworthiness theory that there would be no argument that Appellants were not susceptible to liability for the fatalities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> In response to Appellants’ position that they had no control over the Lumina’s design and the fire and deaths would not have occurred absent such defect, Appellees observe that they also had no control over Petroll’s criminally negligent conduct, without which there would have been no accident and no injuries at all.</p>

In their presentations regarding these principles, Appellees note that significantly different policies underlay the liability determination in the first instance (as to which a predominate concern is to limit manufacturer liability to injuries which their products can be fairly said to have caused), versus the imposition of joint and several liability (which favors the interests of an innocent, injured plaintiff over those of defendants who are concurrently responsible for the injury). Appellees believe that the federal court decisions cited by Appellant, <em>see supra note 2, are </em>not persuasive, since they reflect little or no effort to address these long-standing principles and policies enforced in the Pennsylvania courts. Furthermore, Appellees contend that the rule advocated by Appellants would present plaintiffs with an unfair and untenable choice, in terms of determining whether or not to assert crashworthiness claims, which would turn on the financial resources of the various, prospective defendants rather than the merits of the respective causes of action. General Motors also describes Appellants’ position as perverse, since it would shift liability from Petroll, who is guilty of egregious fault, to General Motors, whose liability was determined with no assessment of fault.</p>

As Appellees have developed, common law joint and several liability evolved on the theory that, as between an injured, innocent plaintiff and defendants whose breach of some duty is proximately related to the injury, it is preferable to allocate the risk of a default in the payment of due compensation to the defendants. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v.

The Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc. has also filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae </em>in support of General Motors’ position. A substantial portion of this <em>amicus </em>effort is dedicated to developing the position that strict liability theory is inconsistent with crashworthiness doctrine, at least in the design defect setting. In this regard, <em>amicus </em>notes that foreseeability resides at the core of crashworthiness theory, since by enforcing a duty to make products which will reasonably minimize harm in the event of accidents, courts require manufacturers to anticipate the possibility and nature of future accidents.

Our decision here touches on matters in conflict between the Third Circuit Court of Appeal’s decision in <em>Huddell, </em><a href="/f2d/537/0726-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="537 F.2d 726" data-case-ids="1050140" data-case-paths="/f2d/537/0726-01">537 F.2d at 726</a>, and those of the Eighth and Tenth Circuits in <em>Mitchell, </em><a href="/f2d/669/1199-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="669 F.2d 1199" data-case-ids="1161556" data-case-paths="/f2d/669/1199-01">669 F.2d at 1199</a>, and <em>Fox v. Ford Motor Co., </em><a href="/f2d/575/0774-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="575 F.2d 774" data-case-ids="930112" data-case-paths="/f2d/575/0774-01">575 F.2d 774</a>, 787 (10th Cir.1978). In addition to <em>Huddell’s </em>crafting of more stringent requirements in terms of the plaintiffs' delimiting of an enhanced injury, <em>compare Huddell, </em><a href="/f2d/537/0726-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="537 F.2d 726" data-case-ids="1050140" data-case-paths="/f2d/537/0726-01">537 F.2d at 737-38</a>, <em>with Mitchell, </em><a href="/f2d/669/1199-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="669 F.2d 1199" data-case-ids="1161556" data-case-paths="/f2d/669/1199-01">669 F.2d at 1203-05</a>, the <em>Huddell </em>court also indicated that principles of concurrent causation and joint liability should not apply relative to enhanced injuries in a crashworthiness context, <em>see Huddell, </em><a href="/f2d/537/0726-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="537 F.2d 726" data-case-ids="1050140" data-case-paths="/f2d/537/0726-01">537 F.2d at 738-39</a>, a position which we reject here, in favor of <em>Mitchell’s </em>approach on this latter point. <em>See Mitchell, </em><a href="/f2d/669/1199-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="669 F.2d 1199" data-case-ids="1161556" data-case-paths="/f2d/669/1199-01">669 F.2d at 1203</a> (“No one disputes under settled tort principles that a tortfeasor causing the original collision may be jointly and severally liable for the whole of the damage, that is, the entire verdict, even <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>though the original collision may not have caused all of the damage.”). Definitive resolution of the conflict concerning the development of the plaintiffs’ burden to prove injury enhancement is outside the scope of the present appeal.</p>
