Appellant and Williams walked a short distance and spoke for a few minutes, after which Williams departed as if he were upset. As Williams proceeded down the sidewalk and around the corner, Appellant stated, “you better come back with something big because I’m playing with them big boys.” Appellant and his brother, Damien Pressley, pursued Williams and, as they passed, Ms. Butler followed. When she turned the corner, Ms. Butler observed that Appellant had pinned Williams against a parked car, and that Appellant’s brother was striking Williams. Ms. Butler also noticed that Appellant and his brother were rifling through William’s pants pockets, removing drugs and money. Appellant’s brother then stepped away, raised his arm, and fired a single shot at Williams, stating afterward, “you want some more, you want some more?” Appellant and his brother fled from the scene. Williams died as a result of the gunshot wound, and Appellant was charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, robbery, and related offenses.</p>

In my view, there is a middle ground between the Majority Opinion and the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion, and that middle ground is consistent with both the plain language of Pa.R.Crim.P. 647, and the practicalities of jury trials. As I read the Rule, a post-charge objection is certainly required where the objection is based upon the content of the charge which has just been given. This is a sensible requirement. An objection to the charge as given ripens only after it has actually been given; it is only then that the party will know if the judge has followed earlier charging indications, or has misspoken, or has inadvertently omitted an expected or agreed upon point. Where, however, a specific point for charge is requested in advance of charging the jury, and the court indicates that it is not going to charge on that area at all, and the court keeps its word, I do not believe that the plain language of the Rule requires (nor should any such rule require) a redundant objection upon pain of waiver.</p>

It may believe that the subject of the charge, while a proper matter for the jury in an appropriate case, is not properly at issue in the case at bar. Or, the court may believe that a specific charge in the area is not required to guide the jury in any case (because it is a matter of common knowledge, or because the point would be argumentative, <em>etc.). </em>Or, the court may believe that, although the subject of the proffered charge is appropriate, the party’s <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>specific formulation is inaccurate, slanted, or incomplete, and the court intends to cover the point in its own form of the charge; the court, of course, is generally not required to employ certain “magic words.” By the same token, a party may deem itself aggrieved by a charge as given for two very different reasons: (1) because the court did not address an issue at all, leaving the jury with no guidance; or (2) because, although the court addressed the issue, its charge was inaccurate, slanted, or incomplete.</p>
    <p id="b958-5" data-blocks='[["BL_958.4",958,[241,790,1158,995]]]'>There certainly are instances—and apparently this case represents two such instances—where a pre-charge request for an instruction and a post-charge objection would be redundant and pointless. Here, appellant requested a missing evidence instruction and an instruction that the jury could convict him of a non-charged offense. The court rejected both charges outright, not based upon the form of the points forwarded or the language proposed, but because it deemed neither issue an appropriate one to inject into the jury’s deliberations at all. The court apparently kept its word, not addressing either issue, and a post-charge objection would have been redundant. In my view, Rule 647(B) does not require a post-charge renewal of objection in such an instance. That Rule speaks to the necessity of a post-charge objection where the objection concerns “portions of the charge” or “omissions therefrom.” The objection here, already clearly and completely made, was that the jury will not hear the point covered at all. There is no defective “portion” of the charge or “omission” from it.</p>

For example, the court may agree to issue a requested point, but then misspeak in the delivery. An objection should be forwarded; the court can cure the alleged error immediately. Or, the court may reject a party’s points for charge as written, while noting an intention to cover the same points in its own form of expression. A post-charge objection should be made, explaining how <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>the court’s form of expression, as actually delivered, was erroneous under the law. Or, the court may reject a proffered point outright, only to reconsider and then address the issue in its own language during the charge. Again, a post-charge objection should be forwarded, specifically explaining how the charge as given was erroneous.</p>

Thereafter, prior to counsels’ closing arguments, the trial court rejected Appellant’s requested points for charge on the record.

    <blockquote id="b962-6" data-blocks='[["BL_962.5",962,[286,891,1119,1056]]]'>The special-exception rule, as has so often been stated, is designed to prevent a party from sitting silently by, taking his chances on a favorable verdict, and then, in the event of an unfavorable verdict, complaining of matters which could have been corrected at trial had they been brought to the attention of the court in a timely fashion. In the present case, however, appellant’s counsel did not remain silent and await the verdict. Rather, he requested five points for charge addressed to the accomplice rule. Each of these points was refused, and defendant was granted an exception. The formal submission of requested points for charge serves the same function as a request for additional or different instructions at the close of the court’s charge. Both procedures present the issue to the trial judge. Both enable the court to avoid error by charging on the issue presented. In the case at bar, it would serve no useful purpose to require the defendant to request additional instructions ... since the court had already rejected points for charge because of its belief that as a matter of law [the instruction was not warranted].</blockquote>

This hyper-technical procedural requirement appears to be counter-intuitive to the court’s conduct of orderly trial proceedings and poses the risk that a litigant will be forced to alienate the trial judge, in a situation where heated debate over instructions may have just taken place, and the jury, which suffers the frustrations of lengthy delays as procedural wrangling drones on outside its hearing.</p>

As the purpose behind requiring an objection to an issue involving jury instructions is to give the trial court the opportunity to correct any error, I do not believe that such purpose is better served by requiring the trial court to rule on the same request twice.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a> As noted by the majority, the current practice in civil trials pursuant to Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 226 and 227, does not require a second objection to the court’s instruction in order to preserve appellate issues. Maj. Op. at 631-32 n. 8, 887 A.2d at 224 n. 8. Moreover, such practice is <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>consistent with our recent amendment of Pa.R.Crim.P. 720, which makes the filing of post-sentence motions optional, and, which specifies that “issues raised before or during trial shall be deemed preserved for appeal whether or not the defendant elects to file a post-sentence motion on those issues.” This amendment evinces a more liberal stance where issue preservation is concerned; I would continue with this liberal approach regarding the matter <em>sub judice.</em>

I agree fully with the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Castille that a post-charge objection would be required where the objection posed by counsel is based upon the content of a given charge which was not covered in the pre-charge on the record rulings or which was at variance with such rulings. The import of this opinion and, I believe, Justice Castille’s, is to emphasize that rulings specifically requested and made pre-charge should not have to be reiterated post-charge.</p>
