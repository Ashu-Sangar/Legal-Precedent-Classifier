The trial court, per the Honorable Michael Barasse, denied PP &amp; L’s motion, <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that a jury question existed concerning whether PP &amp; L, as an easement holder, was entitled to the protections that the RULWA provides to property owners. On permissive appeal of the court’s interlocutory ruling, the Superior Court reversed and remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of PP <em>&amp; </em>L. This Court then granted limited review in this matter to consider whether an easement holder, such as PP &amp; L, is entitled to the protection provided by the RULWA against liability for personal injury. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the Superior Court’s determination and find that, as a matter of law, the RULWA entitles an easement holder, who is a possessor of land made available to the public for recreational purposes, <em>see </em>discussion <em>infra, </em>to the same protections provided to a land owner. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

The power lines on the easement are serviced by an access road at the entrance to which PP &amp; L erected a steel swing-arm gate. The gate, which is painted bright yellow, was installed at the request of Lackawanna to reduce the incidence of illegal dumping and vandalism.</p>

When Jesse saw the gate, he attempted to avoid it by-swerving, at which time he hit a large rock protruding from the ground. This caused Jesse to be thrown off of his motorbike and into the gate. As a result of the collision, Jesse suffered a concussion and multiple fractures and dislocations that required surgical reconstruction.</p>

The matter was scheduled for trial and, following a pretrial conference, Lackawanna settled with the Stantons.

However, the trial court also determined that the question of whether PP &amp; L qualified as a RULWA “owner” was a disputed factual question for the jury to decide. In addition, the trial court found that there was a question of fact as to whether PP &amp; L willfully failed to warn Jesse of a dangerous condition, thus depriving PP &amp; L of immunity under Section 6 <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>of the RULWA.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Accordingly, the trial court denied PP &amp; L’s motion for summary judgment. It did so, however, without prejudice to PP &amp; L’s right to present its RULWA immunity defense as a factual matter at trial. The trial court then certified its order for appeal as one involving a controlling question of law as to which there was substantial ground for disagreement, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> PP &amp; L filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal with the Superior Court, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1311(b) (governing interlocutory appeals by permission).

The Stantons did not seek interlocutory review of the trial court’s order to the extent it was contrary to their <em>interests—i.e., </em>to the extent the court had ruled that the gate was a part of the land for purposes of RULWA owner immunity.</p>

Although no reported cases addressed the specific question of whether the holder of an easement is an “owner” under the RULWA, PP &amp; L relied on several cases finding that a holder of an easement is a possessor of property and is held to the same duty of care as an owner of property. PP &amp; L argued that it was an owner of the land because it was either an occupant or <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>a party in control of the premises. PP <em>&amp; </em>L further argued that the placement of the yellow swing-arm gate on the property within its easement did not preclude it from the benefit of immunity under the RULWA, and that the Section 6 failure to warn exception was inapplicable to the situation at hand. The Stantons responded that PP &amp; L was not an owner under the RULWA because it only held an easement; that, in any event, the gate was not covered by RULWA immunity; and that, even if the RULWA did apply to PP &amp; L and the gate, the Section 6 failure to warn exception to RULWA immunity applied to this matter.</p>

The Superior Court looked to the plain language of the RULWA and to its express policy <em>objective—i.e., </em>to encourage owners of land to make such land available to the public for recreational purposes, by limiting their potential tort liability. On the issue of whether PP &amp; L is an “owner” for purposes of the RULWA protection, the panel noted that PP &amp; L could be considered an owner if the easement rendered it an “occupant or person in control of the premises.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> The panel then consulted the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 328E, which states that if an easement holder has sufficient control over the premises, it may incur liability to third parties for injuries suffered upon the land. The panel concluded that such liability would cause easement holders to bar access to their land, thus contravening the express purpose of the RULWA. Taking the prospect of liability into account, the Superior Court panel concluded that the meaning of the term “occupant or person in control” under the RULWA should be deemed to be co-extensive with the liability-based definition of “possessor” under the Restatement § 328E. Therefore, the panel found that, if an easement holder exercises sufficient control to be subject to tort liability as a possessor under the <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>Restatement § 328E, it must also be deemed an owner entitled to the immunity protections of the RULWA.</p>
    <p id="b884-4" data-blocks='[["BL_884.4",884,[243,435,1152,747]]]'>The Superior Court next addressed PP &amp; L’s argument regarding its alleged willful or malicious failure to warn, under the RULWA Section 6 exception, 68 P.S. § 477-6, finding that appellants did not raise this claim in their complaint. The Superior Court further found that appellants had failed to demonstrate willful behavior on PP &amp; L’s part, and therefore determined that appellants’ complaint was insufficient as a matter of law to plead the Section 6 exception. The Superior Court concluded that the trial court erred in its finding that issues of material fact prohibited entry of summary judgment on either of these questions, and remanded for the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of PP &amp; L. The Superior Court did not address the trial court’s finding that the gate qualified as land for purposes of RULWA immunity.</p>

The Stantons argue that the RULWA is to be strictly interpreted and that easement holders are not specifically enumerated as a protected class within the plain terms of the statutory definition. The Stan-tons acknowledge that the Pennsylvania courts have not yet addressed the applicability of the RULWA to easement holders, but forward case law from two other jurisdictions that have done so. These jurisdictions, argue the Stantons, each recognize that it is within the province of the legislature, not <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>the judiciary, to include or exclude easement holders under the RULWA protection.</p>
    <p id="b885-4" data-blocks='[["BL_885.4",885,[155,430,1154,1343]]]'>The Stantons first rely upon a decision from the Maryland Court of Appeals, and argue that it found that Maryland’s original definition of “owner,” as “the possessor of a fee interest, a tenant, lessee, occupant or person in control of the premises,” did not include an easement holder. Appellants’ Brief at 12 (citing <em>Fagerhus v. Host Marriott Corp., </em><a href="/md-app/143/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="143 Md. App. 525" data-case-ids="119306" data-case-paths="/md-app/143/0525-01">143 Md.App. 525</a>, <a href="/md-app/143/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="143 Md.

The Maryland legislature later amended that definition to specifically include “the owner of any estate or other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossessory, including the grantee of an easement.” <em>See </em>Md.Code, Natural Resources, § 5-1101(e). The Stantons argue that, because Pennsylvania uses the same general definition of “owner” that Maryland did before its amendment, no RULWA protection can be provided in Pennsylvania under that definition. The Stantons also rely on a decision from the California Court of Appeal, which found that a pre-amendment definition of “owner” applied only to a holder of an exclusive possessory interest in the property. Appellants’ Brief at 14 (citing <em>Jackson v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em><a href="/cal-app-4th/94/1110-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="94 Cal.

Based on their analysis of these cases, the Stantons argue that .it is purely and exclusively up to the Pennsylvania General Assembly to change and expand the RULWA definition of “owner,” and that the courts have no authority to expand the narrow legislative grant of immunity.</p>

PP &amp; L argues that the Stantons’ reliance on Maryland and California case law is misplaced. PP &amp; L argues that, in point of fact, the Maryland courts have not addressed the issue of whether an easement holder is an owner under Maryland’s pre-amendment statute. Rather, the case cited by the Stantons addressed the issue of whether a property manager with a contractual duty to manage and maintain the premises, on behalf of a land owner, would be considered an owner under the Maryland statute. Appellee’s Brief at 9 (citing <em>Fagerhus, </em><a href="/md-app/143/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="143 Md.

PP <em>&amp; </em>L further argues that the California case is irrelevant here because the California pre-amendment statute required an “owner” to have “any estate in real property.” That definition is vastly different from the statute in force in Pennsylvania, which includes the language “occupant or person in control of the premises.” Appellee’s Brief at 9-10 (citing <em>Jackson, </em><a href="/cal-app-4th/94/1110-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="94 Cal.

As the RUL-WA does not specifically define either “occupant” or “person in control of the premises,” PP &amp; L urges us to use common dictionary definitions of these terms, which demonstrate that PP &amp; L was an occupant and a person in control of the premises. PP &amp; L also argues that consideration should be given to the policy objective of the RULWA: to encourage owners of land and water areas to make those tracts available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their potential tort liability. PP <em>&amp; </em>L also notes that this Court has previously found that an easement holder is generally subject to tort liability for injuries occurring on its easement precisely because it is considered a possessor of the premises and is required to maintain its easement and any equipment within it. Furthermore, PP &amp; L submits that it is a possessor of the <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>land pursuant to the Restatement § 328E, which defines a possessor, in part, as one who occupies the land with the intent to control it.</p>

As a matter of logic, a party with sufficient control over the land as to be exposed to liability should also be deemed entitled to the protections the RULWA offers to owners who open their land for public use. As pointed out by the Superior Court, to recognize potential tort liability in an easement holder, but to deny the RULWA’s ordinary negligence tort immunity to that same entity, would substantially undermine the stated purpose of the RULWA. Recognizing an easement holder as an “occupant or person in control” ameliorates this potential threat to continued public access to private land under the RULWA, and avoids a contrary and absurd result.

We also agree with PP &amp; L that the California case (Jackson) is irrelevant because the statute there specifically defined “owner” as one who had an estate in real property; the RULWA, on the other hand, includes the language “occupant or person in control of the premises.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

It is only where an easement holder exercises sufficient control over property that it would be deemed a possessor under the RULWA and Restatement § 328E. In this case, both the easement agreement between PP &amp; L and Lackawanna, and PP &amp; L's actual conduct, prove that it was a possessor of the property subject to the easement.</p>

The court there held that a power company need not have ownership rights in property to be considered an occupant, but instead could be considered such by placing and maintaining power poles and lines on the property. As an occupant, the power company was deemed to be entitled to immunity under an Illinois statute protecting occupants from personal injury claims filed by snowmobilers.</p>

We are aware that there was a third legal question essential to the grant of summary judgment in favor of PP &amp; L, as to which no appellate review has been afforded: the question of whether the swing-arm gate qualifies as "land” for purposes of RULWA immunity. Although the trial court addressed the issue in its opinion denying <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>summary judgment, ruling as a matter of law in favor of PP &amp; L, the Superior Court did not, even though both parties addressed the question. Nor did the Superior Court explain why it did not address the question. No doubt, the Superior Court ignored the issue because it had been resolved in PP &amp; L's favor, and the Stantons did not separately seek to appeal the interlocutory order; as a technical matter, the issue was not properly before the court.</p>
      <p id="b893-15" data-blocks='[["BL_893.2",893,[188,2034,1120,313]]]'>Since the Stantons were the prevailing party in the trial court, albeit on other issues, they were under no obligation to pursue an interlocutory appeal by permission to secure review of this third issue. The Superior Court’s mandate in this case, which this Court affirms, directs the trial court to enter summary judgment in favor of PP &amp; L. Upon entry of that order, the Stantons will be out of court, and will be free, if they so desire, to seek to appeal that final order to secure appellate review of the question concerning the swing-arm gate.</p>
