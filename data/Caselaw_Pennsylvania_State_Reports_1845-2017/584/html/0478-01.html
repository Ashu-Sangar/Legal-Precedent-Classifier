Decedent demanded, as a qualifying condition of his return to AOS, that he be provided a company car. <em>See </em>N.T. Hearing, 10/28/99, at 21 (VP of Service Operations: “The only way he would agree to come back to work for AOS, and it was perfectly clear, is that if he had a company car. Because of the fact, I don’t even think he owned his own car at the time.”). Decedent drove the provided vehicle from his first day of re-employment with AOS until the fatal accident; he took the vehicle home each night and drove it each morning to AOS’s office or a scheduled appointment with a client.</p>

He typically received a service call list for the following day, and left from home in the company vehicle to the clients’ locations; other times, he would receive an early morning call at home designating which locations he was to visit. This pattern continued until he was promoted to a supervisory position, after which his duties kept him at the home office most of the time; on the day of his death, decedent was traveling to AOS’s home office to repair two fax machines a client had dropped off to be serviced.</p>

Additionally, the WCAB opined “it would appear that the agreement to provide the Decedent with the automobile (he had the same automobile for his entire period of employment, 1991 through the date of death, October 26, 1998) was an agreement in furtherance of the employer’s business or affairs.” <em><a href="/pa/528/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="597 A.2d 1116" data-case-ids="1829820,1829832" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0278-01,/pa/528/0279-01">Id.</a></em>

The statutory amendment, then, on its face abrogated the common-law employment contract exception to the going-and-coming rule; as noted above, that exception had its genesis in a judicial imputation of the state of being engaged in the furtherance of the employer’s business to the driver of a company car provided pursuant to an employment contract.</p>

To the extent that one can discern any lack of clarity in the statutory text (which I cannot), the legislative history of Act 44 clarifies that its primary purpose was to reform the workers’ compensation system so as to reduce the burden upon employers, as the high cost of the system was contributing to a business-unfriendly environment in Pennsylvania as compared to neighboring states, resulting in a net loss of businesses and jobs. <em>See, e.g., </em>1993 House Legis. Journal 518, 543-47 (daily ed. March 30, 1993) (remarks of various Representatives concerning the need to reform the workers’ compensation system so that businesses do not close or move out-of-state); 1993 Senate Legis. Journal 443 (daily ed. March 31, 1993) (reflecting the Senate’s understanding of the overriding purpose of the. bill to reform the workers’ compensation system to make it less burdensome upon the business community); <em>id. </em>at 472-73 (daily ed. April 19, 1993) (same). In light of these numerous statements affirming the need for reform, it is difficult to accept the majority’s position that the amendment to Section 301(c)(1) carried no legislative intent to alter the circumstances under which benefits would be available solely as a result of driving a company car. <em>See generally </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(7) (instructing courts to consider a bill’s contemporaneous legislative history in resolving any perceived lack of clarity in its text); <em>DeLellis v.

On appeal, this Court determined that the Commonwealth Court's discussion of this issue was mere dicta because the employer had waived any objection to the employment contract exception during proceedings before the agency. <em>See Rox Coal Co. v.

In any event, dicta or not, I believe that the Commonwealth Court's reasoning in <em>Rox Coal </em>was erroneous. The Commonwealth Court did not articulate any persuasive basis for its interpretation that the 1993 amendment merely solidified judicial precedent concerning the going-and-coming rule; additionally—and somewhat illogically—the court relied largely upon a pre-amendment decision to conclude that all of the exceptions to the going-and-coming rule remain in force even in the post-amendment setting. <em>See <a href="/a2d/807/0906-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="807 A.2d 906" data-case-ids="11355589,270310" data-case-paths="/a2d/807/0906-01,/pa/570/0060-01">id.</a> </em>at 389 &amp; n. 14 (citing <em>William F.
