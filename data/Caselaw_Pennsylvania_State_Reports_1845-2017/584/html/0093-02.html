At purchase, the 3.379-acre lot was informally separated into two parcels by virtue of a 1982 lease (hereinafter, 1982 Lease) between Guido’s predecessor in title and Appellant Dubois Dutch, LLC’s predecessor lessee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Dubois Dutch owns and operates a Dutch Pantry Restaurant on a 2.605-acre area of the lot; Guido retains occupancy of the smaller portion of the parcel, approximately 0.772 acres in area, on which he built and maintains a convenience store and gas station.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>The present conflict arose because the 1982 Lease between Dubois Dutch and Guido contained an option granting Dubois Dutch the opportunity to purchase the Restaurant Parcel before the expiration of the 1982 Lease on February 29, 1999 (hereinafter, the Option). On June 19, 1996, however, before Dubois Dutch had exercised the Option and prior to the 1982 Lease’s expiration, Sandy Township repealed its 1964 Zoning Ordinance (hereinafter, 1964 Zoning Ordinance), which applied when the 1982 Lease and Option were executed, and adopted a new Zoning Ordinance (hereinafter, 1996 Zoning Ordinance), which required minimum lot sizes of 45,000 square feet in the area where the Property is located.</p>

On November 28, 1998, Dubois Dutch sought formal subdivision approval from the Sandy Township Planning Commission (hereinafter, Planning Commission).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Guido objected and the <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>Planning Commission rejected the subdivision approval request.</p>

As a defense to specific performance, Guido asserted that he could not perform his contractual duty because subdivision of the property would violate the 1996 Zoning Ordinance. Additionally, Guido countersued for ejectment, seeking possession of the Restaurant Parcel free of any claim by Dubois Dutch. Dubois Dutch filed preliminary objections to the ejectment action, raising the pendency of its prior action for specific performance, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1028(a)(6).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> On May 17, 1999, following a hearing, in an apparent effort to effectuate an amicable resolution of the parties’ dispute, the trial court directed Dubois Dutch to apply, once again, to the Planning Commission seeking approval of a formal subdivision of the Property.

    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[235,776,1158,622]]]'>On August 3, 1999, Guido filed an appeal from the Planning Commission’s decision with the Clearfield County Court of Common Pleas. On June 13, 2000, the trial court held a <em>de novo </em>hearing. The court found that the creation of the 1982 Lease and Option and Dubois Dutch’s attempt to execute the Option constituted a Subdivision of the property under the MPC as of June 1982. The trial court noted that equitable title of property subject to a lease coupled with a purchase option passes, upon exercise of a purchase option, not as of the date of exercise, but rather as of the date of option creation. Thus, it concluded that the 1965 Subdivision Ordinance governed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> Trial Ct. Op. at 8-9.</p>

      <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>The court then considered the 1965 Subdivision Ordinance’s requirement that the lots resulting from a Subdivision must “comply with the minimum requirements of the Sandy Township Zoning Ordinance.” Trial Ct. Op. at 13 (quoting 1965 Subdivision Ordinance § 611(A)). Concluding that the “minimum requirements” could be satisfied by use of the Zoning Ordinance’s exceptions, such as pre-existing non-conforming lots, the court held that the Gas Station Parcel satisfied the definition of non-conforming use because its lot size was “lawful” under the 1964 Zoning Ordinance, even if the property had not been formally Subdivided. Accordingly, the trial court held that the Gas Station Parcel constituted a permissible pre-existing non-conforming lot under the 1996 Zoning Ordinance. The court entered an order approving Dubois Dutch’s Subdivision application. Guido timely appealed that decision to the Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[174,1150,1155,512]]]'>A three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court by a vote of two to one.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>
      <em>See Guido v.

The majority found that a leasehold interest coupled with an option to purchase does not create a Subdivision of the property and, therefore, Dubois Dutch could not effectively “lock-in” the Gas Station Parcel as a pre-existing non-conforming lot by exercising its option to purchase a portion of the property after the 1996 Zoning Ordinance took effect. The Commonwealth Court held:</p>
    <blockquote id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[215,1686,1114,574]],["BL_424.1",424,[287,290,1107,251]]]'>There is simply no legal authority, or reason, to hold that the potential right to exercise an option to purchase, created by a lease in 1982, which Dubois Dutch did not seek to exercise until 1999, created a subdivision in 1982 under an ordinance which was no longer in existence when the option was exercised. In this case, Dubois Dutch’s right to pursue subdivision approval was no different in 1982 than it was in 1998, when it finally initiated its first request before the Township Supervisors. Although that right might not have arisen until Dubois Dutch elected to exercise its option, its decision to exercise its right, or to forego its right, was the <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>sole impediment to its right to official subdivision. Hence, any impairment to Dubois Dutch’s right to apply under the 1965 Subdivision Ordinance, rather than the [1997 Subdivision Ordinance], is the result of Dubois Dutch’s own decision to delay the exercise of its option.</blockquote>

The majority further rejected the trial court’s conclusion that the Gas Station Property could satisfy the 1997 Subdivision Ordinance’s requirement that the lots meet the “minimum requirements” of the 1996 Zoning Ordinance. It found that the “minimum requirements” could not be satisfied by way of exceptions to the 1996 Zoning Ordinance—e.g., by designation as a pre-existing non-conforming lot—and held that the only remedy available to Dubois Dutch was the modification provisions of the 1997 Subdivision Ordinance. The modification provision, modeled on MPC section 512, allows the municipality to modify any of its requirements if the literal enforcement of the provision would exact undue hardship due to the particular conditions pertaining to the land. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 10512.1(a). The court, however, noted that Dubois Dutch failed to provide the required written request for modification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>
      <em>See 53 </em>P.S. § 10512(b). Therefore, the majority found that, because Dubois Dutch had never sought Subdivision approval before the effective date of the 1996 Zoning Ordinance or properly requested modification, the trial court erred in approving the Subdivision application based on its finding of pre-existing non-conforming use.</p>

Thus, logic dictates that the property must have been divided-in-fact as of the effective date of that sale. We reject, however, Dubois Dutch’s argument that MPC section 107’s reference to “lease” compels the conclusion that the property was divided-in-fact at the time of execution of the lease. This contention, which echoes the trial court’s ruling,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> defies the plain language of the above definition. A careful reading reveals that division-in-fact may occur by any means, including changes in existing lot lines, and that such changes may occur <em>for the immediate or future purpose </em>of lease, or building or lot development. In contending that MPC section 107 contemplates the instantiation of property division <em>by way of </em>lease, Dubois Dutch and the trial court mistake ends for means and broaden the definition beyond its terms. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that “the potential right to exercise an option to purchase, created by a lease in 1982, which Dubois Dutch did not seek to exercise until 1999,” cannot in itself have divided-in-fact the property as of 1982. Guido, <a href="/a2d/809/1036-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="809 A.2d 1036" data-case-ids="11429360" data-case-paths="/a2d/809/1036-01">809 A.2d at 1041-42</a> (emphasis in original). To hold otherwise would lead to the absurd result that the Property would have been divided-in-fact by virtue of an inchoate interest in property the holder might opt not to exercise, leaving the owner with a division of his property he did not desire at the hands of someone with no interest in effecting such a division. However, just as the exercise of the Option passed equitable title to the optionee effective as of the date of the inception of the Option, so <em>must </em>
      <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>it have effectuated division-in-fact of the Property without which the idea that equitable title was then conveyed would be incoherent.</p>

To me, it is preferable merely to recognize from the outset that, while an optionee’s equitable title may in fact be deemed to relate back to the date of the execution of the option for certain purposes,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
