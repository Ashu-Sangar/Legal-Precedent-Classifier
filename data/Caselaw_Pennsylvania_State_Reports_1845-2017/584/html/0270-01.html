      <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>Appellee, Richard Sienkiewicz, Jr., trading and doing business as Montage Mini-Mart, Inc. (“Landowner”), is the owner of a commercial property located at 2801 Stafford Avenue in the Borough of Moosic, Lackawanna County, which he operated as a service station (with gasoline and diesel fuel offerings) and convenience store. The location of the business was selected to take advantage of the property’s close proximity to Interstate Route 81—highway traffic had access to the property (and from the property back to the Interstate) via a diamond-shaped set of ramps known as the Davis Street Interchange. The back (or south-facing portion) of Appellant’s property was visible from Davis Street, but no legal access was available from that side. Accordingly, vehicles exiting the highway traveled roughly west on Davis Street to a point just beyond Landowner’s property marked by a signal-controlled intersection with Stafford Avenue; executed a right turn to the north; proceeded past the west side of the property on a short curve (the “Stafford Curve”); continued on Stafford Avenue as the roadway straightened in a easterly direction along the frontage of the property and parallel to Davis Street (the “Stafford Straightaway”); and entered Landowner’s property from this (the north-facing) side. In this way, Davis Street, the Stafford Curve, and the Stafford Straightaway formed an open loop bounding three sides of Landowner’s property. The real property underlying both of these portions of Stafford Avenue (the Stafford Curve and the Stafford Straightaway) was owned by Anthony J. Rinaldi and, apparently, was never publicly dedicated. The roadway, however, was open for public use for more than two decades and was maintained by the City of Scranton, the boundary of which is immediately adjacent to the Stafford Straightaway.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The plans called for splitting the ramp closest to Landowner’s property (connecting Davis Street to the southbound lanes of Route 81), channeling eastbound traffic onto a new ramp which would curve across the highway and away from the property. Additionally, to extend the flow of westbound traffic, the re-design called for the Stafford Curve to be eliminated and replaced by a similar, new curve several hundred feet to the northwest, and for the Stafford Straightway to be extended to meet this new curve. The effect was to extend the closed end of the open loop formed by the roadways roughly 100 yards to the west, thus encompassing an adjacent property owned by Andrew G. Zubert, which was also operated as a commercial service station and convenience store. PennDOT also planned to eliminate the existing traffic signal at the intersection of Davis Street and the Stafford Curve; narrow the access to the Stafford Curve from 45 to 24 feet by installing curbing, effectively excluding commercial traffic; and vacate the Stafford Curve, thereby restoring it to Mr. Rinaldi’s private use and control. Finally, the planners contemplated the installation of curbing along the Stafford Straightaway, with openings to accommodate the direct access to Landowner’s property that were to be significantly narrower in width than the existing, wide-open access.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

According to PennDOT, these decisions should have been deemed dispositive of Landowner’s claim for damages based upon denial of access, but instead, they have been ignored by Landowner and the courts. In addition, PennDOT denominates as mere bootstrapping the Commonwealth Court’s consideration of measures that did not affect direct access (principally, the closure of the Stafford Curve) in its assessment of the interferenee-with-direct-access claim. It is PennDOT’s position that such measures clearly represent noncompensable alterations to traffic flow residing squarely within its exercise of its essential police powers in the public interest. <em>See generally Wolf, </em><a href="/pa/422/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="422 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="1901686" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0034-01">422 Pa. at 40</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="220 A.2d 868">220 A.2d at 871</a> (“[I]n the regulation of traffic and in the interest of public safety, the Commonwealth, acting within the scope of its police powers, may make reasonable rules and regulations which may dilute or diminish the rights of abutting property owners without liability to respond in damages.

Therefore, the trial court specifically noted that [Landowner’s] decrease in gasoline and convenience items sales and revenues are largely attributed to the fact that tractor-trailers, motor homes, tour buses and large trucks can no longer access this property by way of Stafford Avenue. It is important to note that the Trial Court found that it was not just the curbing that caused [Landowner’s] business to close, but also it was the narrowing of [the Stafford Curve] during the construction project that also caused [Landowner’s] business to close.

However, the absence of any record evidence that curbing was ever installed along the Stafford Straightaway frontage of Landowner’s property wholly undercuts the common pleas court’s central factual finding relative to the interference-with-direct-access claim. Furthermore, as PennDOT argues, <em>Pane </em>and <em>Legislative Route 115 </em>establish that the agency’s unconsummated plans to narrow the direct access to the property are insufficient to support a cause of action relative to an asserted <em>defacto </em>condemnation, in the absence of some actual interference with direct access. <em>See Pane, </em><a href="/pa/422/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="422 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="1901688" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0489-01">422 Pa. at 497-500</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20913" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="222 A.2d 913">222 A.2d at 917-18</a>; <em>Legislative Route 115, </em>80 Pa.Cmwlth. at 170-72, <a href="/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%201267" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="471 A.2d 1267">471 A.2d at 1269-70</a>.</p>

Again, the evidence (as well as the common pleas court’s findings) establishes that direct access to Landowner’s property was always from the Stafford Straightaway; factually, there was never any direct access from the Stafford Curve. Rather, this portion of the roadway, like Davis Street and the Route 81 ramps, was merely part of an adjacent road system providing a convenient flow of traffic in the direction of Landowner’s property. As both a logical and a legal matter, then, the closure of the Stafford Curve was relevant only to Landowner’s diversion-of-traffic claim, as to which the analysis and conclusions of both the Commonwealth Court and the common pleas court are well-reasoned and correct. <em>See supra </em>
