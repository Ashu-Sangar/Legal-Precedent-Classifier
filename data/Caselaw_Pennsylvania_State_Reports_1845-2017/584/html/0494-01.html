    <p id="b825-5" data-blocks='[["BL_825.5",825,[165,845,1154,374]]]'>Eagle’s challenge to the Harms/Benefits Test arises as a result of a permit issued for its Royal Oak Landfill, a residual waste landfill in Chest Township, Clearfield County. Eagle filed submissions to obtain the permit between November 2000 and January 2001, which apparently complied with the requirements of the regulation which became effective January 13,2001.</p>
    <p id="b825-6" data-blocks='[["BL_825.6",825,[165,1260,1155,1083]]]'>Eagle’s documents identified a number of benefits flowing from the project. Eagle cited the following potential short term benefits: disposal of debris in the event of a disaster; payments for health and safety training courses for landfill operators; and use of coal excavated from the site. Eagle identified additional real short term economic benefits: jobs for local residents at the landfill; increased employment at businesses associated with or located near the landfill; increased local, state and federal income taxes as a result of increased employment; higher real estate taxes; a $2 dollar per ton host fee to the township (as specifically authorized by 53 P.S. § 4000.102(b)(7)); and provision of a recycling drop-off center. Eagle further noted real long term benefits of the project: replacement of wetland acreage (although the project would disturb .17 acres of wetlands, the disturbed wetland would be replaced with .42 acres of wetlands); improvement of the roads leading to the landfill; benefit to wetlands in the form of landfill runoff and reduced erosion; reclamation of a strip mine, and the resulting visual enhancement and increased soil fertility.</p>

      <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>In contrast, Eagle identified harms resulting from the landfill and described how those harms could or could not be mitigated. The potential harm of a malfunction of the leach-ate treatment plant could be mitigated by proper operation of the plant and utilization of a leachate storage tank.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Eagle recognized the potential negative impact on the residents of the area but concluded that any impact would largely be anticipatory and could be alleviated by working with the residents. Eagle acknowledged sediment-laden runoff as a harm but asserted that it could be mitigated by erosion and sedimentation control features, and various measures relating to sediment required by other regulations. Furthermore, the resulting sedimentary ponds would be beneficial to aquatic life and migratory birds. Eagle observed that an increased risk of fires, emergencies, and accidents that could result from the project would burden the local emergency services, but could be mitigated by contingency planning, fire protection measures, and payments to the local fire departments to cover the increased burden. Eagle further noted the short term harms caused by waste hauling trucks which include fumes, visual impact, noise, spills, and odors. Eagle offered to mitigate these harms by insuring that the trucks are well maintained and that other measures would be employed to reduce the dust, noise, and odors resulting from the site.</p>
    <p id="b826-4" data-blocks='[["BL_826.4",826,[242,1572,1157,466]]]'>Eagle acknowledged the long term harms of the project. After closure of the landfill, the land, which is currently woodland, would be converted to grassland. Eagle argued that, although the conversion could be viewed as a harm, it could also be seen as a benefit because it would increase species diversity in the area. Another long term harm is the negative aesthetic aspect of the landfill, however, Eagle planned to mitigate this by planting vegetation around the perimeter of the landfill.</p>

The permit included Condition 22, which stated, “Failure to provide for all benefits described in these submissions would invalidate the Harms/Benefits analysis and will be a violation of this permit.”</p>
    <p id="b827-4" data-blocks='[["BL_827.4",827,[163,548,1157,586]]]'>Eagle appealed to the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB), objecting to Condition 22 and challenging the facial validity of the Harms/Benefits Test. Eagle asserted that, pursuant to Condition 22, it could be subject to penalties resulting from the failure to supply the benefits even if such failure were related to economic events outside of its control. Chest Township also appealed the decision to grant the permit and requested that the permit be revoked, asserting that the benefits did not clearly outweigh the harms. Eagle filed for summary judgment of Chest Township’s claims, asserting that the Harms/Benefits Test was invalid and unconstitutional.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Furthermore, the EHB concluded that the regulation did not constitute an unconstitutional taking, finding that the regulation did not require applicants to convey economic benefits, but rather merely to identify the social and economic benefits inherent in the project and demonstrate that those benefits outweigh the harms.</p>

He argued that the Acts are directed toward ensuring the protection of the environment and not the provision of social and economic benefits. He feared that if the EQB is allowed to utilize the Harms/Benefits Test in relation to the SWMA and Act 101, it will be able to do so in nearly all environmental legislation that references Article 1, Section 27, and thus make basic policy choices that should be reserved to the legislative branch.

While the permit application was pending, the regulation at issue in this case became effective. Tri-County submitted documents and an environmental assessment noting potential harms and benefits. In October, 2001, the DEP denied the permit because it concluded that Tri-County failed to mitigate adequately the increased risk of aircraft striking birds attracted to the food waste in the landfill which was located near the Grove City Airport.

First, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the Acts “clearly conferred broad supervisory power on the [EQB] over health, safety and welfare concerns beyond the narrow interpretation of simple protection of the environment from harm, and that the power conferred was broad enough to encompass the adoption of the harms/benefits test.” <em><a href="/a2d/818/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="818 A.2d 574" data-case-ids="9353551" data-case-paths="/a2d/818/0574-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/818/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="818 A.2d 574" data-case-ids="9353551" data-case-paths="/a2d/818/0574-01">at 581</a>. Second, the court found that the legislature signaled its intent to authorize a balancing of environmental concerns against social and economic concerns by including implementation of Article 1, Section 27 in the purpose sections of both Acts. Next, the court held that the Acts’ delegation of authority, which included the ability to adopt the Harms/Benefits Test, did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. Fourth, the court concluded that the Harms/Benefits Test was not facially unconstitutionally vague. The court further rejected the suggestion of Appellants that the benefits portion of the Harms/Benefits Test requires coerced contributions, but instead noted that the benefits must be related to the project and many times arise directly from the project. The court finally concluded that because the benefits arise from the project they do not violate the police power. The court therefore held that the regulation was authorized by the SWMA and Act 101 and was not otherwise unconstitutional.</p>

Apparently relying on information provided in the DEP’s August 24, 2002 nonbinding guidance document (Environmental Assessment Process, Phase I Review (EAP)) rather than the language of the regulation at issue, the dissent asserted that the purposes of the Acts were not “accomplished by the establishing of schools or the making of charitable contributions.” <em><a href="/a2d/818/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="818 A.2d 574" data-case-ids="9353551" data-case-paths="/a2d/818/0574-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/818/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="818 A.2d 574" data-case-ids="9353551" data-case-paths="/a2d/818/0574-01">at 585</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

Second, if we determine that the Acts do grant the EQB authority to promulgate the Harms/Benefits Test, Appellants argue that such grant of authority constitutes a violation of the non-delegation doctrine in that the decision to require social and economic benefits is a basic policy choice and that such decision must be made by the legislature.

We recognize that the overriding goal of the SWMA and Act 101 was to establish a comprehensive state and local solid waste management program, involving permits for disposal facilities, which would provide the necessary disposal facilities and also protect the environment and the public from improper and inadequate solid waste practices while encouraging conservation and recycling. 35 P.S. § 6018.102; 53 P.S. § 4000.102.

The Dissent has not pulled this concern out of thin air. Rather, the EQB has produced a “guidance document” which defines the regulatory term “social and economic benefits” as including precisely such items unrelated to the projects. If the actual regulations promulgated by the EQB in point of fact allowed for consideration of such unrelated matters on the benefits side of the equation, or if this case <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>involved a challenge to the EQB insisting upon such unrelated benefits before approving an application, the regulatory action could not pass muster in my opinion.</p>

The EQB perhaps should attend to redrafting any such material to conform to the statutory mandate, its regulations as issued, and the guidance of this Court’s opinion. In short, although I do not see the Dissent’s concerns as at all baseless, I am sufficiently satisfied that they are premature.</p>
