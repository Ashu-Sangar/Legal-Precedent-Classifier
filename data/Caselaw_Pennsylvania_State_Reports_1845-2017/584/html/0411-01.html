In this, the most recent litigation, Employer appeals by allowance from an Order of the Commonwealth Court affirming an Order of the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (Board) that affirmed in part and reversed in part the July 81, 2001 decision of a Workers’ Compensation Judge (WCJ).

On November 14, 1984, Claimant sustained a work related injury in the nature of a “back sprain.” At the time of his injury, Claimant was employed as a coil processor; he sprained his back lifting a coil weighing in excess of one hundred pounds out of the presses.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> On December 4, 1984, Employer issued an NCP acknowledging the specific work injury. In 1988, an independent medical examiner approved Claimant for sedentary or modified light-duty work. In 1989, another independent medi<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>cal examiner noted inconsistencies between the complaints of Claimant and his physical examination, and recommended that Claimant return to work without restriction. Pursuant to a Supplemental Agreement, Claimant’s benefits were reduced to partial disability effective November 16, 1989, as work was available to him within his physical capabilities. Also on that date, Claimant and Employer executed the appropriate documents so that Claimant could petition the Board for a commutation of his wage loss benefits. Claimant preferred to accept partial disability rather than an offer of employment because he had other means of support. Accordingly, his partial disability compensation of $154.00 for 500 weeks was commuted to a lump sum payment of $77,000.00, by Order dated February 28, 1990. As part of the commutation proceeding, the parties stipulated that Employer would “remain responsible for payment of reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to Claimant’s work injuries.... ” (Original Record, Stipulation: Proposed Findings of Fact; Conclusions of Law and Proposed Order, dated 24 January 1990, page 3.)</p>

After nearly five years of disability and increasing levels of depression, Claimant’s wife insisted that he see a psychiatrist and made the first appointment with Gerald Lisowitz, M.D. (Dr. Lisowitz). Critically, this occurred at approximately the same time that the commutation was being negotiated. Claimant saw Dr. Lisowitz from late 1989, some five years after the original injury, through sometime in 1999, when Dr. Lisowitz suffered severe heart problems and Claimant came under the care of Jonathan M. Himmelhoch, M.D. (Dr. Himmelhoch), his current treating psychiatrist. Although neither the Supplemental Agreement nor the Stipulation specifically referenced a psychiatric component to Claimant’s 1984 work injury, Employer paid all of the bills arising out of Claimant’s psychiatric care through August of 1998. Following a personnel change within Employer’s risk insurer and subsequent internal re<a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>view, Employer refused to continue these payments on the basis that they were not work related. Claimant then filed a Claim Petition on September 25, 1998, alleging that he suffered a psychiatric injury in the nature of depression that was precipitated by his 1984 back injury; the Petition sought payment of related medical bills as well as counsel fees, but did not request that the NCP be amended to reflect additional injuries. In its answer to the Claim Petition, Employer admitted only that Claimant suffered a work-related low back sprain on November 14, 1984, for which compensation was commuted in early 1990. Employer asserted that Claimant’s claim of psychic injury was barred by Section 311, 77 P.S. § 631,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and the statute of limitations contained in Sections 315 and 413(a) of the Workers’ Compensation Act (Act), Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, <em>as amended, </em>77 P.S. §§ 602,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> 772.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The WCJ also credited the testimony of Claimant and his wife, and rejected the argument of Employer that the Claim Petition was time barred. The WCJ concluded that payment of Claimant’s psychiatric bills by Employer constituted payments in lieu of compensation that tolled the limitations period of Section 315, rendering the Claim Petition timely. The WCJ believed that the payment of medical bills for such a long period of time lulled Claimant into a false sense of security that this was reasonable medical care related to his work injury. Further, the WCJ ordered Employer to pay for Claimant’s psychiatric care from 1998 into the future or until such time as that care was found to be unreasonable and unnecessary. Finally, Employer was ordered to pay the attorney’s fees of Claimant, based upon an unreasonable contest.</p>

The WCJ reviewed the charges individually and, by decision dated July 31, 2001, the WCJ again awarded attorney’s fees based upon an unreasonable contest. The WCJ noted that a report dated October 29,1990, from Anne S. Valko, M.D., who examined Claimant on his behalf, indicated that Claimant was receiving psychiatric care from Dr. Lisowitz, and that such treatment should be continued. This led the WCJ to conclude that Employer’s contest was unreasonable because Employer terminated payment of Claimant’s psychiatric treatment without receiving a medical opinion supporting denial of payment.

However, the court declined to address any perceived conflicts in the decisional law in favor of applying contract principles to resolve this dispute. The court reasoned that a commutation is an agreement between the parties terminating compensation liability on the part of the employer. In the present matter, the court agreed with the WCJ that Employer lulled Claimant into a false sense of security after the commutation by tendering payment of Claimant’s psychiatric bills. Based on this conclusion, the court held that Employer was estopped from raising a statute of limitations defense. According to the court, it was immaterial whether a Claim Petition or Review Petition was filed where Employer either intentionally or unintentionally misled Claimant into believing that his psychiatric problem was covered.</p>
    <p id="b743-4" data-blocks='[["BL_743.4",743,[175,1589,1155,418]]]'>In the alternative, the court decided that, by filing a Claim Petition, Claimant was actually seeking to enforce the 1990 commutation. In coming to this conclusion, the court interpreted the commutation award as a contract between the parties, which included Employer’s acceptance of its responsibility for Claimant’s psychiatric treatment. The court then applied Section 202 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1981), with particular emphasis on the following language:</p>
    <blockquote id="b743-5" data-blocks='[["BL_743.5",743,[219,2023,1111,202]],["BL_744.1",744,[360,293,1040,98]]]'>(4) Where an agreement involves repeated occasions for performance by either party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it by the other, any course of performance accepted <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>or acquiesced in without objection is given great weight in the interpretation of the agreement.</blockquote>

    <p id="b744-5" data-blocks='[["BL_744.5",744,[244,668,1155,750]]]'>Applying these precepts, the court noted that the course of performance for almost eight years was for Claimant to submit his psychiatric bills to Employer, and for Employer to pay them. Finding that the course of conduct of the parties reflected an acceptance by Employer that its obligation to continue to pay Claimant’s “reasonable and necessary medical expenses” included an obligation to pay for Claimant’s psychiatric treatment, the court determined that “Employer’s unilateral refusal to continue making those payments after August of 1998 was contrary to the terms of the 1990 commutation agreement” and that “[b]ecause Employer breached its promise under the commutation agreement, the WCJ properly ordered the NCP amended....” <em>Westinghouse Electric, </em><a href="/a2d/829/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="829 A.2d 387" data-case-ids="9100772" data-case-paths="/a2d/829/0387-01">829 A.2d at 393-94</a>.</p>

The WCJ denied and dismissed the fatal Claim Petition, but the Board reversed. Rox Coal simultaneously filed a Petition for Reconsideration and an appeal with the Commonwealth Court. On reconsideration, Rox Coal argued that the 1993 amendments to the Act eliminated the traveling exception to the going and coming rule.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The Board held that this defense was waived for failure to raise it before the WCJ.

Pursuant to the former section, payment of medical expenses and/or wage loss benefits as payments in lieu of compensation may toll the time limitations of Section 315. <em>Schreffler. </em>Conversely, however, pursuant to the latter, liability is established and medical expenses and wage loss benefits are then considered separately. 77 P.S. § 531(9).

Drake, </em><a href="/pa/555/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="555 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1701924" data-case-paths="/pa/555/0481-01">555 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/a2d/725/0717-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="725 A.2d 717" data-case-ids="11639732,1701924" data-case-paths="/a2d/725/0717-01,/pa/555/0481-01">725 A.2d 717</a>, 719 n. 2 (1999), we noted that “[a] commutation award substitutes one form of payment for another” and that “[cjommutation may be effected by private agreement, but it is usually done under a statute.” Employer correctly states that there is no “contract” between the parties for it to violate. A commutation is an award, reflected by an order of the Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> In determining whether to make such an award, the Board considers the stipulation of the parties as well as the best interests of all concerned to arrive at a conclusion. If Claimant wished to “enforce the commutation,” that is, if his intent was only to require that Employer reimburse the psychiatric treatment expenses referred to in the commutation Order, he should have filed a Penalty Petition pursuant to Section 435 of the Act, 77 P.S. § 991. It is significant, we believe, that Claimant recognized that Employer had not acknowledged his psychiatric problems in that he filed a Claim <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>Petition. Nowhere in his Claim Petition does he request that the NCP be amended to reflect additional injuries. While we are not prepared to say that contract principles are inapplicable in workers’ compensation proceedings, we do hold that they are not applicable to a commutation award.</p>

    <p id="b756-5" data-blocks='[["BL_756.5",756,[234,719,1158,1228]]]'>In summary, we observe that, when the employer has not accepted an initial work-related injury, a claim petition must be filed within three years of the date of injury. 77 P.S. § 602. That claim petition forms the basis for all injury claims that arise from the work incident, whether there was a material misstatement at the time that an NCP was issued or whether a subsequent emotional or physical condition flows from the original injury. 77 P.S. § 411, <em>Jeanes Hospital II. </em>When a claimant sustains additional injuries that result from the original harm, a timely petition must be filed to add the injuries to those for which the employer is already responsible. 77 P.S. §§ 771, 772, 773. When such a petition is filed, the WCJ must treat the respective burdens of the parties as if the review petition were an original claim petition. 77 P.S. § 773. While a certain logic existed within the Commonwealth Court’s line of cases, particularly <em>AT &amp; T, </em>because the employer had not accepted liability for problems that are not included in the NCP, the provisions of the Act do not support this interpretation. Moreover, by limiting claimants, who need to add additional injuries, to the three-year period following the date of the compensable injury, the Commonwealth Court has fostered a harsh result that is inconsistent with the humanitarian objectives of the Act.</p>

A statute of repose, however, is substantive and extinguishes both the remedy and the actual cause of action. Generally, the critical distinction in classifying a statute as one of repose or one of limitations is the event or occurrence designated as the "triggering” event. In a workers’ compensation claim, the common triggering event for statute of limitations purposes is the disability of the employee, which defines the accrual of the action. That is the point at which all the elements of the action have coalesced, resulting in a legally cognizable claim. <em>Vargo v. Koppers Co., </em><a href="/pa/552/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="552 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="559312" data-case-paths="/pa/552/0371-01">552 Pa. 371</a>, <a href="/a2d/715/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="715 A.2d 423" data-case-ids="11705523,559312" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/0423-01,/pa/552/0371-01">715 A.2d 423</a> (1998).</p>
      <p id="b749-6" data-blocks='[["BL_749.6",749,[205,1950,1119,389]]]'>A statute of repose, however, typically sets the triggering event as something other than the point at which the cause of action arises.

Because there is no right to appeal from a notice of compensation denial, and because there exists no authority that would permit any entity other than the employer itself to add to the employer’s admission in the notice of compensation payable, Claimant here should have filed a claim petition in order to receive benefits for the hip injury which he alleges also resulted from his April 8, 1989 work incident.</blockquote>

I respectfully differ, however, with its holding enforcing the statute of limitations set forth in that provision to preclude the relief awarded by the workers’ compensation judge in this case. Instead, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court’s decision to invoke equitable principles to preclude enforcement of such limitation solely with respect to a claim pertaining to a defined category of medical expenses that Employer paid throughout the statutory limitations period (and for an additional five years), with the plain implication that such payment was pursuant the express terms of a commutation order mandating that “Defendant/Employer will remain responsible for payment of reasonable and necessary medical expenses related to the claimant’s work-related injuries as required by the terms of the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act.” R.R. at 248a.

While the majority relies on Section 306(f.l)(9) of the Act, 77 P.S. § 531(9), to foreclose an award of such benefits, Section 306(f.l)(9) speaks to reviving an expired entitlement to benefits based upon gratuitous or mistaken <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>payments made after the expiration of an applicable statute of limitations, not to the fact of payments made within the limitations period, such as occurred here. <em>See <a href="/citations/?q=349%20A.2d%20920" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="349 A.2d 920">id.</a> </em>(“The payment by an insurer or employer for any medical, surgical or hospital services or supplies <em>after any statute of limitations provided for in this act shall have expired </em>shall not act to reopen or revive the compensation rights for purposes of such limitations.” (emphasis added)).</p>
