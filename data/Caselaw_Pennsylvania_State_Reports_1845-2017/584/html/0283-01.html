As the statute continues, § 1532(c)(1) states that the punishment of a suspension is imposed according to a graduated process where the first “offense” merits a six-month suspension, the second “offense” a one-year suspension, and for the third or subsequent “offense,” a two-year suspension. As such, the period of suspension clearly increases with the number of offenses, rather than the number of convictions. When taking this statutory scheme as a whole, it is logical that a graduation of penalties would apply for those who have committed offenses on more than one occasion, necessitating a greater license suspension. The focus of the statutory inquiry, therefore, is on determining if the party subject to the suspension has committed one, two, or three offenses. Accordingly, we hold that since a conviction of an offense is a conviction stemming from a criminal episode, an offense for the purpose of § 1532(c) is a single criminal episode. Thus, the number of convictions arising out of the commission of any single offense is limited only by the imagination of the charging authority.</p>

Again, these concerns are not present in license suspension cases, where the licensee has already been sentenced for the crimes on which the suspension is based (in this case, drug offenses; appellee received five years probation for each count). Finally, as this Court has noted, license suspension is “merely a civil consequence of a criminal violation.” <em>Plowman v.

Therefore, the double jeopardy protections afforded in the criminal setting are not applicable in such cases, and the “single criminal episode” analysis is unnecessary.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

The majority notes the record does not reflect details of the three and one-half month period of the stealing of the drugs (information apparently not necessary to the criminal plea, and not required by custom or statute to be forwarded to PennDOT), and from this concludes: "[tjherefore, Appellee's conviction was for a single 'offense' within the meaning of that term in this statute, that is, a single criminal episode.” Maj. Op., at 291, 883 A.2d at 508. I can find no logic to this alchemy. There were 16 offenses here, no matter whether the record shows they were part of one long course of conduct or not. An offense is simply a violation of the law, or a crime, <em>see </em>Black's Law Dictionary (17th ed. 1999); <em>accord </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 106, and multiple offenses (or crimes) may arise out of any particular single criminal episode. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 110(l)(ii) (requiring, as general rule, consolidation of multiple offenses arising out of single criminal episode).</p>
