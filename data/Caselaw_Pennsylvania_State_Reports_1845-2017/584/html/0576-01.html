When Mr. Hart refused to pay Appellant’s employer for the work, Appellant complained bitterly and blamed Bradley Hart for his lost wages. He vowed to make the Hart family pay.</p>

Appellant returned the following week with Owens and Eric Mason, and stole additional property. This time they also vandalized the Harts’ home by slashing furniture; ransacking closets; mutilating family photographs; pouring different liquids such as bleach, paint, and oil throughout the house; and, defecating and urinating on the floors. On September 4, 1983, Appellant burglarized Reverend Hart’s church, stole cash and computer equipment, and pinned a photograph of Bradley Hart to a wall with a letter opener. Then, in early January of 1984, Appellant, Mason, and Thomas Nixon went to the Harts’ home intending to rob them. The men abandoned their plan when they discovered the Harts had another person visiting in the house.</p>

When Bradley Hart answered the door, Appellant and Mason forced their way in at knifepoint. Initially, they coerced Bradley Hart into writing Appellant a check for nine hundred and thirty four dollars as settlement for the debt Appellant felt was owed to him. Next, the two men tied up the Harts on a couch holding them captive, while the intruders watched television and talked for several hours. Eventually, <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>they decided to separate the couple. Appellant took Fern Hart upstairs where he bound her hands and legs; covered her eyes, nose, and mouth with duct tape; strangled her with a necktie; and ultimately drowned her in a bathtub. Meanwhile, Mason took Bradley Hart to the basement where Mason forced Bradley Hart to lie with his face in a pan of water; placed his foot on Bradley Hart’s back; and strangled him to death with an electrical cord. Appellant and Mason fled, but not before they turned off the heat in the house and abandoned the Harts’ infant child on a bed in an upstairs bedroom.</p>

Again, our review of the PCRA petition belies this claim. Appellant did attach an affidavit-like document which he entitled “Declaration of Robert Wharton.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> However, in that document he lists instances of alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failing to challenge the admission of certain evidence at trial, for failing to challenge his confession as physically and psychologically coerced, and for failing to interview or present witnesses, including Appellant, to testify and impeach the Commonwealth’s evidence. In a second unlabeled attachment, Appellant categorizes instances of trial counsel’s ineffectiveness and his first PCRA counsel’s ineffectiveness for waiving issues “due to insufficient argument.” Again, Appellant makes no attempt to address the timeliness of his second PCRA petition in these attached documents and never mentions, much less argues, his claim of governmental interference, or any other exception for the PCRA’s basic time strictures.</p>

However, we agree with the Commonwealth that this is nothing more than a convoluted way of attempting to carve out an exception to the jurisdictional timeliness requirements of the PCRA for ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

However, the Prothonotary is required by Pa.R.A.P. 3304 to forward such documents to counsel. <em>See </em>Pa.R.A.P. 3304 (providing that where an appellant who is represented by counsel submits for filing any type of pleading <em>pro se, </em>the Prothonotary shall not docket that pleading, but instead, shall forward it to counsel of record).
