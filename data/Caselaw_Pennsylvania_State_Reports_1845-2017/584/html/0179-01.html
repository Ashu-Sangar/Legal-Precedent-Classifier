Section 2318 states, in pertinent part, that the warranty pursuant to § 2314 “extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty.” Appellee reasons that as Jerome was a family member of Robyn, the purchaser of the Cricket lighter, and as it was reasonable for Appellants to anticipate that a small child such as Jerome would use the Cricket lighter, then a breach of warranty claim will lie against Appellants.</p>

The word “ordinary” is readily understood to mean “common” or “average”. <em>See </em>American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 925 (1981). In the context of this matter, it is apparent that the ordinary purpose of the Cricket lighter was to allow an adult user to <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>produce a flame.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Its ordinary purpose certainly was not to be a two year old child’s plaything.

Frigiere stated that Appellants knew of the dangers posed by young children playing with butane lighters. Deposition testimony of Rene Frigiere, 1/16/1998, at 68-70. Frigiere also admitted that Appellants could have placed child resistant features on their butane lighters; Appellee emphasizes that Frigiere indicated that Appellants chose not to place such features on their lighters unilaterally as they feared that their adult customers would opt not to buy such a product. <em>Id. </em>at 47. As noted by Appellee, Appellants came to this conclusion, in part, after test-marketing such a product in France where they discovered that their adult customers disliked the lighter with the child resistant features as such a lighter was more difficult to use. <em>Id. </em>at 118-20. Appellee focuses on this testimony as she apparently believes that Appellants’ weighing <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>of financial factors is a resounding indictment of Appellants and assuredly shows that their conduct was outrageous.</p>

Yet, the question with which we are now presented is not whether this evidence could support a finding of negligence.

First, the allegedly dangerous aspect of this product did not arise out of intended use of Appellants’ product. Rather, it arose when the product was improperly utilized as a toy by a young child. While failure to mitigate and prevent a danger posed by misuses can give rise to liability in negligence, such a failure looks far less wanton than if the alleged danger arose in connection with the normal use of the product. Second, as acknowledged by both Appellee and Appellants, at the time this butane lighter was sold, it complied with all safety standards. Of course, compliance with safety standards does not, standing alone, automatically insulate a defendant from punitive damages; it is a factor to be considered in determining <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>whether punitive damages may be recovered. Finally, we flatly reject Appellee’s assertion that Appellants’ weighing of financial concerns in determining whether to incorporate additional safety features into its product on a unilateral basis establishes that Appellants acted wantonly. Rather, it shows simply that Appellants were considering all of the myriad elements that affect decisions a for-profit entity must make in manufacturing and marketing commercial products. Thus, we conclude that as a matter of law, Appellee has not adduced evidence sufficient to establish that Appellants’ conduct was so outrageous so as to support an award of punitive damages.</p>
