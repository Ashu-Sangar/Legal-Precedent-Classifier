Specifically, appellant raises seven <em>Brady </em>claims, relying on notations found in several police activity sheets and other documents contained in the archived police file concerning this case.

The newly discovered evidence exception, set forth in Section 9545(b)(l)(ii), however, does not require a merits analysis of the claim in order for it to qualify as timely and warranting merits review. The exception merely requires that the “facts” upon which such a claim is predicated must not have been known to appellant, nor could they have been ascertained by due diligence. Appellant asserts that the “facts” upon which his <em>Brady </em>claims are based derive from documents contained in this case’s archived police file, which were not “known” to him until after the filing of his initial PCRA petition.

Therefore, so long as the facts set forth in the police file were not otherwise known to appellant, the <em>Brady </em>claims he asserts are “timely” under the newly discovered evidence exception. In this case, it appears that six of appellant’s seven <em>Brady </em>complaints are reviewable on the merits, while the seventh is time-barred.

In October 2001, proceedings were commenced before the Honorable D. Webster Keogh, the Supervising Judge of the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, following a formal complaint filed by the Commonwealth regarding the improper use of subpoenas by the Federal Capital Habeas Corpus Unit of the Defender Association of Philadelphia (“Federal Defender”) to obtain archived police files. At these proceedings, it was revealed that between June and October 2001, the Federal Defender improperly subpoenaed the original police files for approximately twenty-five capital cases from the Philadelphia <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>City Archivist, apparently in an effort to circumvent the discovery requirements set forth in Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E). On October 29, 2001, Judge Keogh ordered that the archived police files obtained by the Federal Defender be sealed, thus precluding the Federal Defender from disclosing the contents of the files they unlawfully secured. In a decision letter dated February 8, 2002, Judge Keogh concluded that the Federal Defender’s actions constituted an abuse of the subpoena power to such an improper and illegal extent that he referred the matter to the Pennsylvania Disciplinary Board for appropriate action.</p>

The PCRA court, per the Honorable John J. Poserina, Jr., scheduled an evidentiary hearing for September 24, 2002 for the limited purpose of hearing testimony from an attorney from the Federal Defender regarding alleged undisclosed exculpatory evidence contained in the archived police file. On September 16, 2004, however, PCRA counsel filed a motion submitting that he required the archived police file in order to prepare for the evidentiary hearing. Attached to the motion was an order directing the Federal Defender to turn over the police file to counsel. The motion did not mention Judge Keogh’s existing order sealing all archived police files obtained by the Federal Defender. The PCRA court issued the order and appellant thereby obtained the archived police file from the Federal <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>Defender.

In this document, there is a notation that Commonwealth witness Bernard Jackson, who was the getaway driver during the robbery and an original codefendant of appellant herein, named Lawrence Woodlock as a codefendant. Appellant argues that this “statement” by Jackson is exculpatory as it is evidence that someone other than himself was involved in the robbery, or at a minimum, that someone other than himself was the shooter. Appellant argues that this statement supported the defense theory that Jackson simply made up a third robber in order to reduce the culpability of codefendant Bruce Reese.

We agree. Appellant’s claim that Jackson’s reference to Wood-lock automatically means that someone other than himself committed the shootings and robbery is purely speculative at best. The Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files. Furthermore, appellant’s argument that this document reveals that Jackson named Woodlock as a codefendant prior to identifying appellant is inaccurate. In his second formal statement to police on October 22, 1982, three days prior to the document at issue, Jackson identified the third participant in the robbery as “Monk,” appellant’s nickname. Moreover, this document would not have materially furthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was already extensively impeached by both appellant and Reese. Indeed, each codefendant cross-examined Jackson on the following: every inconsistency in his four police statements; that he was testifying on behalf of the Commonwealth pursuant to a plea bargain; and that he had several open robbery charges still pending and his testimony was motivated by a desire to receive lenient sentences for those crimes. Any additional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police notation would have been cumulative. Accordingly, the Commonwealth did not violate <em>Brady </em>by not disclosing this police activity sheet as appellant has failed to show its materiality.</p>

This document contains a photograph of Jackson with a handwritten notation to the right of picture stating “driver/witness not shooter by door.” Appellant concedes that the document does not reveal the source of the notation, but speculates that it might derive from a statement made by Jackson to the police, and if it was, it would directly contradict <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>Jackson’s testimony that he remained outside the bar in the car and did not witness the shootings.

The document further indicated that Jackson changed his story after being confronted by the police that he failed the polygraph test. The record reflects, however, that the Commonwealth disclosed to trial counsel, during pre-trial discovery, Jackson’s actual police statement from January 14,1983, which explicitly stated that Jackson failed the polygraph test and then changed his story.

Green was one of the three barmaids working the night of the robbery. Green was not an identification witness for the Commonwealth, and testified at trial that she did not see the faces of the perpetrators during the robbery. The PCRA court correctly concluded that, at trial, Green’s prior inability to identify appellant from a photo array would not have been admissible. As we have noted, inadmissible evidence cannot be the basis for a <em>Brady </em>violation. <em>See Mitchell, </em><a href="/pa/576/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="839 A.2d 202" data-case-ids="16743,9056715" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0258-01,/a2d/839/0202-01">839 A.2d at 216</a>.</p>

(In his first PCRA petition, appellant claimed that the Commonwealth violated <em>Brady </em>by misrepresenting the terms and conditions of the plea bargain extended to Jackson for his testimony.) Appellant’s claim fails. The cumulative impact of meritless <em>Brady </em>claims cannot be grounds for <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>relief. Additionally, appellant’s attempt to re-raise the <em>Brady </em>claim contained in his first PCRA petition is fruitless as it was previously litigated. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9544(a)(3) (a claim is previously litigated if “it has been raised and decided in a proceeding collaterally attacking the conviction or sentence”).</p>
    <p id="b801-4" data-blocks='[["BL_801.4",801,[167,606,1156,693]]]'>Appellant also raises one procedural claim on appeal. Appellant asserts that the PCRA court erred by not ruling on his request for discovery which sought a copy of the District Attorney’s entire file, memoranda, or documents in the Commonwealth’s possession that refer to any of the documents appellant characterized as <em>Brady </em>material in the instant PCRA petition, and information on the current whereabouts of any police officers mentioned in the alleged <em>Brady </em>material. Appellant contends that the revelation of the evidence found in the archived police file establishes the necessary “good cause” for discovery under Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E). Appellant’s claim is meritless as he misapprehends the requisite showing required to obtain discovery for a second PCRA petition.</p>
