On October 30, 1997, Appellant was injured in a motor vehicle accident, and was treated for the injuries he sustained. PEBTF paid a number of Appellant’s medical and hospital bills, some in 1997, and others in 1998. In connection with the accident, Appellant pursued an allegedly negligent third party, and secured a settlement of $100,000.

When established in 1988, PEBTF was a governmental plan within the meaning of ERISA and excluded from the Act’s coverage. From March 1994 until January 1, 1998, however, PEBTF became an ERISA plan due to private employer participation. Because PEBTF was an ERISA plan at the time of Appellant’s accident on October 30, 1997, the MVFRL, and more specifically, its anti-subrogation provision, was preempted. Therefore, PEBTF was able to pursue its right to subrogation against Appellant, which arose out of a provision that the trustees who administer PEBTF adopted in 1995.</p>

Appellant’s argument centered on the dates that PEBTF paid his medical and hospital bills, and relied on the analysis in <em>Wimer v.

Appellant also contended that nothing in his federal complaint amounted to a judicial <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>admission of PEBTF’s ERISA status and that his entitlement to counsel fees should have operated to reduce PEBTF’s judgment. Thereafter, Appellant supplemented the record with copies of statements of account and argued that even if PEBTF was an ERISA plan in 1997, it did not have a right to subrogation for payments made in 1998, and that the amount of PEBTF’s alleged subrogation claim was open to question.</p>

The trial court determined that at the time of Appellant’s accident, the Fund was an ERISA plan because the Teague Exhibit stated that “ ‘the PEBTF continued to maintain its ERISA status [from at least 1996 when the DOL confirmed the [Fund’s] ERISA status] through, and until January 1, 1998, when most of the private employers voluntarily withdrew with only <em>de minimis </em>private employer participation thereafter.’ ” Trial Court Opinion at 21 &amp; n. 2 (alteration in original).

Next, concluding that the date of Appellant’s accident, being “manipulation free,” dictated PEBTF’s entitlement to subrogation, the trial court rejected the analysis in <em>Wimer </em>and Appellant’s argument that summary judgment was improper because no documentation existed in the record to indicate precisely when PEBTF paid for Appellant’s medical treatment. <em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§ 1002">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§ 1002">at 22-25</a>.

The threshold issue upon which PEBTF’s entitlement to a judgment as a matter of law was premised was that PEBTF had the benefit of ERISA’s preemption of the MVFRL’s antisubrogation provision. So as to assert ERISA’s preemption of the MVFRL, PEBTF contended that from March 1,1994 until January of 1998, it was an ERISA plan because it was no longer subject to the governmental plan exclusion.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> PEBTF argued in the trial court and continues to argue on appeal that three purported facts are conclusive of this issue: Appellant’s judicial admission in his federal complaint that the district court had federal question jurisdiction; PEBTF’s decision to <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>view and conduct itself as an ERISA plan due to increased private sector employer participation; and the DOL’s confirmation of that decision.</p>

Neither PEBTF’s characterization of the record, nor its position that the record establishes that it was no longer a governmental plan and thereby covered by ERISA on October 30, 1997, has merit. First, Appellant’s allegation of federal question jurisdiction in his federal complaint, based on his anticipation of PEBTF’s assertion of ERISA preemption, is not a judicial admission that PEBTF was an ERISA plan. <em>See Tops Apparel Manufacturing Co. v. Rothman, </em><a href="/pa/430/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="430 Pa. 583" data-case-ids="1915719" data-case-paths="/pa/430/0583-01">430 Pa. 583</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=244%20A.2d%20436" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="244 A.2d 436">244 A.2d 436</a>, 438 &amp; n. 8 (1968) (reiterating that the term “judicial admission” refers to an advantageous allegation of fact that is made by a party in a pleading or stipulations or the like). Furthermore, contrary to PEBTF’s assertion, the label that PEBTF assigned itself under ERISA is irrelevant. PEBTF’s status as a governmental plan is a matter for the court to decide by construing <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201002" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="29 U.S.C. §§ 1002">29 U.S.C. § 1002</a>(32) and determining whether or not it applies. <em>See, e.g., Hightower v.

There is no authority to support the proposition that the DOL’s silence in the face of PEBTF’s Form 5500 filings has any legal significance in this context. In addition, the DOL’s correspondence to PEBTF in July of 1996 was only an information letter, setting forth the DOL’s previously stated view in connection with other inquiries “that the inclusion of more than a <em>de minimis </em>number of private sector employees as participants in an otherwise governmental plan will result in the plan no longer having the status of a governmental plan within the meaning of section 3(32) of ERISA[;]” it did not address PEBTF’s status under ERISA one way or the other.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a> Therefore, we conclude that PEBTF failed to show that the record established that on October 30, 1997, it was an ERISA plan entitled to ERISA’s preemption of the MVFRL’s anti-subrogation provision and that it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1035.2(1).

The DOL responded in an Opinion Letter (Letter), which Appellee argues states that covering more than a <em>de minimis </em>number of private sector employees would result in a loss of the governmental plan exemption and ERISA qualification. Appellee relied on the Letter as showing that Appellee was indeed <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>ERISA qualified until January of 1998, when it voluntarily relinquished its ERISA status and its right to subrogation.

    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[228,621,1157,953]]]'>At the heart of Appellee’s argument is the Letter’s reference to a 1995 DOL Opinion Letter (Letter 95-27A), which implies that a non-governmental employee coverage of approximately eight percent still amounts to <em>de minimis </em>coverage of private sector employees. <em>See http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/programs/ori/advisory95/95-27a.htm </em>(last visited 7/26/05). In Letter 95-27A, the DOL stated that 270 private sector employees out of 3500 participants in the plan, approximately 7.7%, was insufficient to exceed the <em>de minimis </em>criterion; as such, the plan was still considered a governmental plan for failing to meet the <em>de minimis </em>standard concerning nongovernmental employee coverage. Although opinion letters are not necessarily binding, and refer only to the factual situation related therein, a material issue of fact arises as to whether or not Appellee falls within the governmental plan exemption.

It should be noted that Appellant submits his own criteria stating that in 1997, total Commonwealth contributions to PEBTF amounted to $285,066,966.00, and private contributions in 1997 were a mere $1,589,358.00. Using these figures, the non-government employee contributions totaled a little more than one-half of one percent (0.5%). The Letter did not address the particular situation of Appellee, but merely stated that a plan must include more than a <em>de minimis </em>number of private sector employees. By virtue of the reference to Letter 95-27A, it is reasonable to interpret the Letter as stating that Appellee was still a governmental plan. However, Appellee argues that the <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>sheer number of employees, although small by percentage, may be the deciding factor in determining whether a plan still falls within the governmental plan exemption.

In Letter 95-15A, the DOL concluded that a two percent composition of private sector employees did not exceed the <em>de minimis </em>standard, which is a greater percentage than the one in the instant matter. The generic Letter sent to Appellee, combined with a reading of the two other DOL opinion letters, suggests that the trial court and Superi- or Court were hasty in classifying Appellee as ERISA qualified. Accordingly, we must determine the tipping point in terms of percentages or numbers of non-government employees covered that will cause the governmental plan exemption to be lost.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[162,1218,1160,888]]]'>I am sympathetic to the argument by Appellee that it would be a breach of fiduciary duty pursuant to'ERISA, subjecting its members and the funds itself to fines, if Appellee failed to file the appropriate ERISA forms when ERISA qualified. As a result of this duty, Appellee argues that it is in the best position to determine its status pursuant to ERISA and should-not be penalized for attempting to avoid the harsh consequences, labeled draconian by Appellee, imposed by ERISA for failure to comply with its terms. However, as noted by <em>Triplett, supra, </em>and the dissent in the Superior Court, a litigant’s attempt to classify itself, even if believed to be correct, does not make it true. “[Tjhere is no reason to think that a plan’s determination of its status under ERISA is any more meaningful than any litigant’s determination of its status under any statute. I thus find that Appellee’s interpretation of itself as a non-governmental plan is not relevant.” <em>Triplett, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20238944" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="1999 WL 238944">1999 WL 238944</a> at *3.</p>

The generic response was not an invitation to Appellee to interpret itself as it saw fit. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>PEBTF covered a mere 1.2% of private sector employees contributing approximately one-half of one percent (0.5%) in monetary terms. As such, the mathematical data available to PEBTF, which the DOL brought to its attention, clearly indicate that its coverage of private sector employees did not exceed the <em>de minimis </em>threshold.</p>
