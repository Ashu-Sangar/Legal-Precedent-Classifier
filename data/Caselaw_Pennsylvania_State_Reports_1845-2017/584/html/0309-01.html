In this case, a Workers’ Compensation Judge (“WCJ”) found that appellant/cross-appellee Rite Aid Corporation, a privately insured employer (hereinafter “Employer”), properly took the offset and the Workers’ Compensation Appeal Board (“the Board” or “WCAB”) affirmed. The Commonwealth Court reversed, however, finding that the Section 204(a) offset was available only to self-insured employers. None of the tribunals below addressed the equal protection claim raised by appellee/cross-appellant Denise Kramer (hereinafter “Claimant”): the workers’ compensation tribunals, because they lacked authority over a constitutional challenge claim, and the Commonwealth Court, because it ruled in Claimant’s favor on non-constitutional grounds. For the reasons set forth below, we find that Section 204(a) allows all employers to offset workers’ compensation benefits in the amount of a severance payment, and that, so construed, Section 204(a) does not violate equal protection. We therefore reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the underlying decision of the WCJ.</p>

Claimant received workers’ compensation benefits for temporary total disability through June 28, 1998, when she returned to work with injury-related restrictions. On March 12, 1999, Employer relocated its Shiremanstown facility to Maryland, and as a consequence, Claimant was laid off.

The payment was part of a “Severance Agreement” contained in a January 7, 1998 Addendum (“Addendum”) to the most recent collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) between Employer and Teamsters Local 776 (“Union”), the union for Employer’s employees, which covered the period from July 27, 1997 through July 23, 2000. Before July 27,1997, prior CBAs had required Employer to remain in Pennsylvania, but the most recent CBA allowed Employer to leave the state and relocate to Maryland. Under the Addendum, employees agreed not to engage in a strike, slowdown, or boycott, in exchange for severance payments at the time of their layoff. Nothing in the CBA or the Addendum addressed the prospect of offsetting these anticipated severance payments against workers’ compensation benefits.</p>

The WCJ denied Claimant’s petition on January 21, 2000, holding that the $3,355.02 lump sum Claimant received under the CBA was, in fact, a severance payment as defined in the relevant regulations, <em>see </em>34 Pa.Code 123.2,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and that Employer timely and properly took an offset pursuant to Section 204(a) of the Act.

      <em> </em>and (3) Section 204(a), as amended in 1996 to provide for the offset of severance benefits, and as interpreted by the tribunals below, violated equal protection. A panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed in a published opinion by the Honorable Rochelle S. Friedman. The panel first found that the $3,355.02 lump sum payment to Claimant was a severance payment because she had received it pursuant to the CBA Addendum, and under the heading “Severance Agreement,” which provided for “severance benefits.” The panel further found that nothing in the Severance Agreement limited Employer’s ability to apply a severance pay offset under Section 204(a). However, the panel agreed with Claimant that Employer was not entitled to the severance benefit offset. The panel noted that an injured employee who subsequently receives a severance payment paid by an “employer directly liable” for the payment of workers’ compensation in effect forfeits workers’ compensation disability benefits in the amount of those severance payments. The panel then found that the offset provision is intended to be afforded to the employer, not its private insurer, noting that the Act does not always use the terms “employer” and “insurer” interchangeably, and that it is the insurer who is directly liable for the actual payment of workers’ compensation benefits. Because Employer here was not directly liable for the payment of Claimant’s workers’ compensation benefits, but rather was insured, making its insurer directly liable, the panel held that Employer was not entitled to a Section 204(a) offset. Judge Dan Pellegrini filed a Concurring Opinion in which he concurred in the result only. Judge Pellegrini would have found that Employer was not entitled to the offset for a different reason, <em>ie., </em>because the check received by Claimant was not a severance payment, but instead was otherwise earned income. <em>Kramer v.

    <p id="b642-6" data-blocks='[["BL_642.6",642,[234,1323,1161,1014]]]'>Employer argues that the language in Section 204(a) is ambiguous at least insofar as it concerns the applicability of the offset provision to privately insured employers. Employer posits that, if the General Assembly had intended to restrict the availability of severance offsets only to self-insured employers, it could have done so easily and explicitly by using the modifier “self-insured.” Indeed, Employer notes that the Act contains a separate provision, Section 305, 77 Pa.C.S. § 501(a)(2), specifically addressing self-insurance. In Employer’s view, the severance benefit offset adopted in 1996 reflects a legislative determination that a claimant should not receive duplicate benefits in the form of severance pay and workers’ compensation for the same loss of earnings. The offset thereby curtails the cost of work injuries. Employer notes that workers’ compensation insurance rates are based in part upon claims history, and therefore, the reduction of workers’ compensation benefits via severance offsets ultimately curtails costs even for privately insured employers, since the offset should result in lower future insurance premiums.</p>

      <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>Employer further asserts that the only logical interpretation of the phrase “employer directly liable for the payment of compensation” is to understand it as a reference to cases where there are multiple concurrent employers. This asserted construction results in a scheme which would reduce the costs of work injuries by making the offset available only to the employer actually liable for the work injury, and not to any other employer the employee may have. Employer argues that, when this purpose of the offset provision’s language is considered, it is clear that the General Assembly intended that the offset apply to privately-insured as well as self-insured employers.</p>
    <p id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[174,945,1160,958]]]'>Employer further argues that its interpretation is supported by settled rules of statutory construction, citing 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932(b) (statutes <em>in pari materia </em>shall be construed together), and § 1922(1) (General Assembly does not intend result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable). Looking to related provisions in the Act, Employer queries why Section 204(c) would require employees to report regularly to the insurer any receipt of severance benefits if the General Assembly truly intended the offset provision to apply only to self-insured employers. Employer also notes that, once liability for a work injury is established, the Act as a whole does not distinguish between employers based on their insurance status; rather, the employer and the insurer are seen as one. Employer further argues that this Court has discouraged drawing distinctions between self-insured employers and privately insured employers. Such a uniform treatment of employers would also ensure the uniform treatment of employees.</p>

Claimant further argues that Employer’s interpretation renders the language “directly liable for compensation” mere surplusage.</p>
    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.4",644,[238,512,1154,617]]]'>Claimant also submits that the terms “employer” and “insurer” are not interchangeable in all instances. Thus, in Claimant’s view, although Section 305 of the Act states that insurers are entitled to all of the employer’s immunities and protections, this Section does not grant an insurer all of the employer’s rights, such as the right to an offset. Claimant also disputes Employer’s assertion that Section 204(c) requires employees to report regularly to the insurer the receipt of other compensation that postdates the compensable injury, asserting that, when properly construed, Section 204(c) in fact requires employees to report this information to their employer.</p>
    <p id="b644-5" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[232,1163,1157,840]]]'>Claimant further argues that the supposed legislative purpose of precluding double recoveries for the same loss of earnings is not advanced by granting a private insurer a credit for severance pay. Claimant notes that prior to the 1996 amendment’s adoption of a severance offset, the courts had recognized that there was a different intent behind severance pay and workers’ compensation benefits. Since the amendment, Claimant avers that courts have continued to allow an employer to take credit for a severance payment only if the payment is directly employer-funded. Furthermore, Claimant argues that the simultaneous receipt of severance benefits and workers’ compensation benefits does not represent an impermissible double recovery because severance is paid as a result of the employee’s separation from the employer regardless of injury, while workers’ compensation is paid to compensate the physical inability to work caused by a workplace injury.</p>

Thus, Claimant notes that the General Assembly easily could have included the word “insurer” if it had intended the offset to apply to insurers as well as employers, while Employer asserts that the General Assembly just as easily could have used the phrase “self-insured employer” if it wanted to make explicitly clear that the offset was intended to be limited only to that class of employers. Moreover, the General Assembly’s use of the word “liable” (“employer directly liable for the payment of compensation”) could be construed either narrowly—as evidencing liability in the sense of the entity who ultimately writes the compensation check, which would suggest that only self-insured employers would be entitled to the offset—or more broadly, as speaking in terms of the legal predicate for the award of workers’ compensation benefits. In the latter instance, a privately insured employer could be said to be “liable” for the payment of compensation, even though, by obtaining private insurance, that employer secured a source for discharging its liability for the actual benefits payment.</p>

In short, the first and fourth articles are ancillary, descriptive, unsubstantive and are both basically procedural in significance. It would have been inappropriate for the legislature to have included the workmen’s compensation insurance carrier as synonymous with employer in section 103 of article I of the act, because that section was delineating the status of employer and employe for the limited purposes of their status as parties to the statutory agreement to accept the compensation system which was set up in article III * * *. Chronologically speaking, it would be pointless and fruitless to discuss the insurance carrier in article I of the act, because the need for insuring could not arise until article III had become operative. It is the ‘master’ alone (who, before he accepts the act, has no need for a compensation insurance carrier), who is concerned with the substantive provisions of articles II and III. The employer not only has the right to reject the act, but frequently has done so____ Article IV set up all of the provisions for every form of process and remedy available to a claimant and the manner in which liability of the employer to him is to be met, satisfied, settled, concluded and released; so that ... the insurance carrier shares every one of the obligations, prerequisites, benefits, and release rights of the employer. Thus, we find the legislature stating in section 401 that the employer, who had to be defined in section 103 solely as the ‘master’ for articles II and III purposes, would, for all remedial or procedural purposes, be taken to be a complex entity, including within its scope the compensation insurer (be it a private company or the State Workmen’s Insurance Fund), and the agent of such ‘master’.”</blockquote>

Accordingly, the analysis of the structure of the Act accepted by the <em>Brown </em>plurality and by later decisions of this Court, which equates the employer and its workers’ compensation insurance carrier for remedial purposes (and thus draws no distinction between self-insured and privately-insured employers), remains convincing and ultimately is controlling here.</p>

In this regard, it is indeed significant that, once an employer has accepted the Act, and once liability for a work-related injury has been established, the Act generally does not distinguish between self-insured employers and those who purchase private coverage. For instance, Section 301 provides that, “Every employer shall be liable for compensation for personal injury to ... each employe, by an injury in the course of his employment, and such compensation shall be paid in all cases by the employer, without regard to negligence.... ” 77 P.S. <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>§ 431. This “liability” provision makes no reference to insurers, but a later provision, Section 305 does, as it provides that where an employer purchases workers’ compensation coverage, the insurer “shall assume the employer’s liability hereunder, and shall be entitled to all of the employer’s immunities and protection hereunder....” 77 P.S. § 501(a)(1). This “immunity and protection” is the necessary concomitant of the liability accepted. Interpreting Section 204(a) so that only a self-insured employer is entitled to the “protection” or “immunity” of a severance benefit offset would negate this provision, and create an inconsistent and absurd result.</p>

Double recovery for the same loss is thus avoided. Making severance offsets available to all liable employers in that position should effectively reduce the cost of work injuries because, contrary to Claimant’s argument, it appears that a reduction in workers’ compensation benefits paid out should reduce future insurance premiums. This is so because premiums for insurance coverage for workers’ compensation are based not only on the classification of the type of business and its annual payroll, but also on the company’s prior “experience modification” or claims history.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> The Pennsylvania Rating Bureau states that, “Under experience rating insureds that maintained favorable loss levels in prior years receive a premium reduction ... while those with poor past loss experience are charged an increased premium.” Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Rating Bureau, <em>Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Experience Rating Plan. </em>Accordingly, any reduction in claims payout, including reductions resulting from severance offsets, should result in lower future insurance premiums for the privately-insured employer.</p>

(USF &amp; G Co.), </em>566 Pa.420, <a href="/pa/566/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="781 A.2d 1146" data-case-ids="706231,9480562" data-case-paths="/pa/566/0420-01,/a2d/781/1146-01">781 A.2d 1146</a>, 1153 (2001). Reasonable workers’ compensation cost containment for employers, and the concomitant competitive benefit such cost containment offers for Pennsylvania businesses, unquestionably is a legitimate state concern.</p>
    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[168,1475,1153,743]]]'>The disputed point is whether the legislation at issue accomplishes its salutary purpose, <em>i.e., </em>whether the severance pay offset bears a rational relationship to controlling workers’ compensation costs. <em>Leheny, </em><a href="/f3d/183/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="183 F.3d 220" data-case-ids="11544257" data-case-paths="/f3d/183/0220-01">183 F.3d at 226</a>. In this regard, Claimant repeats an argument she forwarded on Employer’s appeal contending that the goal of reducing insurance costs is not achievable via the severance benefit offset because the calculation of workers’ compensation insurance premiums, a process which is regulated by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, does not include a consideration of severance payments. Claimant further argues that the goal of eliminating double recovery cannot be achieved because workers’ compensation benefits and severance payments are made to compensate different losses.</p>
    <p id="b661-6" data-blocks='[["BL_661.6",661,[170,2245,1151,95]],["BL_662.1",662,[237,296,1156,947]]]'>We cannot agree. In the case of a self-insured employer— and in reviewing the constitutionality of the severance benefit <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>offset, we cannot lose sight of that circumstance—the offset directly reduces the employer’s costs. Moreover, there is nothing irrational or arbitrary in offsetting severance benefits, irrespective of whether the employer is self-insured or privately insured. The worker experiences only one loss of earnings at a time, even if there is a prospect of compensation for that loss from multiple sources. The offset does not disadvantage the injured worker <em>vis a vis </em>his uninjured colleagues who also receive severance benefits because those workers do not receive a double benefit, in the form of workers’ compensation payments, from the employer. Because the employment relationship is the basis for providing both severance payments and workers’ compensation benefits (whether or not the compensation is paid through an outside insurer), the employer can avoid paying duplicate benefits for the same loss of earnings by using the offset. We conclude that the severance benefit offset bears a rational relationship to achieving the legislative goals.</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[233,1268,1158,629]]]'>Furthermore, as we have already concluded in resolving Employer’s appeal, in the case of employers with private insurance, rates are based at least in part on past payment experience. If the insurer pays a claimant less for workers’ compensation because the employer made severance payments to the claimant, which the insurer then offset against the compensation benefit, there is a prospect of reduced rates in the future. It is of no moment how efficiently the goal of cost reduction is accomplished because it is not this Court’s task, in conducting a rational basis review, to say whether the statute is the wisest or best means to accomplish the legitimate legislative purpose. <em>McCusker, </em><a href="/a2d/639/0776-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="639 A.2d 776" data-case-ids="7863579" data-case-paths="/a2d/639/0776-01">639 A.2d at 781</a>.</p>

Nonetheless, I agree with the majority’s application of the rational basis test to Section 204(a), as well as the ultimate conclusion that the statutory provision is not violative of equal protection principles.</p>

    <p id="b664-5" data-blocks='[["BL_664.6",664,[242,769,1156,960]]]'>I agree with the majority that § 204(a) of the Pennsylvania Workers’ Compensation Act, 77 P.S. § 71(a), allows both self-insured and privately-insured employers to offset Workers’ Compensation benefits in the amount of a severance payment. However, I write separately because I do not agree that § 204(a) is ambiguous with respect to the question presented here. I find the phrase “employer directly liable for the payment of compensation and the benefits from a pension plan” is clear and unambiguous. <em>See <a href="/us/472/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="472 U.S. 612" data-case-ids="1512478" data-case-paths="/us/472/0612-01">id.</a> </em>Rite Aid is the employer directly responsible for providing its employees with Workers’ Compensation coverage and pension benefits. If Rite Aid decides to contract that responsibility out to a private insurance company, it does not absolve Rite Aid of its duty to provide such benefits to its employees. Thus, Rite Aid remains the “employer directly liable for the payment of compensation and the benefits from a pension plan” despite the fact that Rite Aid does not directly send the Workers’ Compensation payments to its injured employees.</p>

Majority Op., at 328-30, 883 A.2d at 530. If a claimant is currently receiving compensation from a previous employer for a permanent injury, for example, and is also currently receiving Workers’ Compensation benefits relative to a separate injury from his current employer when he is laid-off and receives a severance payment, the phrase “employer directly liable” ensures that only the current employer takes the offset. I also agree that the General Assembly did not intend for § 204(a) to permit a <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>self-insured employer to take the offset, and yet deny privately-insured employers the same privilege. Majority Op., at 328-31, 883 A.2d at 530-31. However, while I agree that both self-insured and privately-insured employers are entitled to the offset, I do not believe it is necessary to engage in statutory construction to reach such a conclusion. I would hold both the self-insured and privately-insured employers are entitled to the offset, and that the private insurer in this scenario is entitled to take the offset by virtue of employer’s entitlement to the offset.</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[170,850,1156,368]]]'>Thus, I would hold § 204(a) is unambiguous, and it means just what it says, <em>i.e., </em>that the employer directly liable for the payment of compensation or pension benefits—whether the employer pays those benefits himself or contracts with a private insurance company to pay his employees those benefits—is entitled to an offset in the amount of a severance benefit against an award of Workers’ Compensation benefits.</p>
