Both girls are African-American. Magliocco, who is Caucasian, shouted profanity and racial epithets at the two girls, then entered his house and returned with a baseball bat. As he walked out onto the pavement in front of his steps, swinging the bat, Magliocco continued to yell racial slurs and other vulgar language at the two girls, saying he was going to make sure there were no more “niggers” living on his block. Tamara, who lived on the block, ran into her house and called the police. Soon thereafter, Officers Damon Evans and Michael Coston of the Philadelphia Police Department arrived, saw Magliocco on his front steps, and heard him saying he was “going to kill every nigger on the block.” Officer Evans told Magliocco to drop the bat; Magliocco responded, “I’m not going to talk to you, nigger.” Magliocco eventually threw the bat down and the officers placed him under arrest.

A person is guilty of PIC if he “possesses any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 907(a).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Prior to 1995, the “definitions” subsection of the PIC statute (which was found in then-subsection (c)) defined an “instrument of crime” as: “(1) anything specially made or specially adapted for criminal use; or (2) anything commonly used for criminal purposes and possessed by the actor under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for lawful uses it may have.” In 1995, this Court considered the issue of whether a baseball bat, not specially made or adapted for criminal use, could be deemed “commonly used” for criminal purposes such that it could qualify as an instrument of crime under the second cited definition. <em>See Commonwealth v. Ngow, </em><a href="/pa/539/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="539 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="474245" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0294-01">539 Pa. 294</a>, <a href="/pa/539/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="652 A.2d 305" data-case-ids="474245,7866920" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0294-01,/a2d/652/0305-01">652 A.2d 305</a> (1995). The <em>Ngow </em>Court held that the Commonwealth must present evidence of the proportionality of the criminal use of baseball bats in order to prove common use, rather than, for example, relying upon anecdotal evidence or newspaper articles detailing attacks with baseball bats. Because the record in <em>Ngow </em>lacked such empirical evidence, this Court vacated Ngow’s PIC conviction. In a concurring opinion, this author noted that the General Assembly was free to address the apparent inequity uncovered in <em>Ngow—i.e., </em>that attacks with a baseball bat, as opposed to <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>attacks with a firearm or other deadly instrument, are not necessarily subject to separate punishment—by amending subsection 907(c) to eliminate the word “commonly” from the second definition of an instrument of crime. <em><a href="/pa/539/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="652 A.2d 305" data-case-ids="474245,7866920" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0294-01,/a2d/652/0305-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/539/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="652 A.2d 305" data-case-ids="474245,7866920" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0294-01,/a2d/652/0305-01">at 307</a> (Castille, J., concurring).</p>

Act 27 was printed in accordance with 1 Pa.C.S. § 1104 (governing Adoption and Publication of Constitutional and Statutory Provisions) (“Section 1104”), which provides that when such amendatory statutes are printed, provisions which have been stricken or eliminated by the amendment are to be placed in brackets, while new words, phrases or provisions inserted into the statute by the amendment are to be printed in italics or with underscoring.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Thus, the single change to <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>the PIC statute was indicated in the printing of Act 27 by placing the word “commonly” in brackets (and boldface).

Act 98, like Act 27, specifically identified itself as amendatory, <em>ie., </em>in pertinent part, “Amending Title 18 (Crimes and Offenses) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, further providing for the offense of possessing instruments of crime.... ” Session Laws of Pennsylvania, Session of 1996, p. 552. Act 98 added a totally new subsection 907(c), criminalizing the possession of body armor in the course of committing, or attempting to commit, a felony. Act 98 also redesignated the definitional section (former subsection^)) as subsection (d); added a definition of “body armor;” and raised the first letter of the word “anything” in the definitional section from lower to upper case.

The unacknowledged reappearance of the word “commonly” in the 1996 amendment, an amendment which served primarily to criminalize the possession of body armor, has generated the instant controversy.</p>
    <p id="b576-5" data-blocks='[["BL_576.4",576,[242,516,1155,777]]]'>Magliocco concedes that the PIC statute was amended by Act 27 of 1995 to eliminate the “commonly” used requirement from the second definition of an instrument of crime, but he contends that the definitional qualifier must be deemed to have been restored as part of the body armor amendment added by Act 98 of 1996. Magliocco argues that a person who consulted the “official source material” for legislation <em>(i.e., </em>the Session Laws printed by the Legislative Reference Bureau) would be led to believe that the word “commonly” was reinserted as part of the second definition of an instrument of crime. Because the Commonwealth did not offer empirical proof of the commonality of the criminal use of baseball bats at trial, as required by the <em>Ngow </em>Court’s interpretation of the former “commonly used” definition, Magliocco argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his PIC conviction.</p>
    <p id="b576-6" data-blocks='[["BL_576.5",576,[236,1324,1155,786]]]'>Magliocco argues in the alternative that, even if the reappearance of the word “commonly” in the 1996 PIC amendment was in error, that qualifier still must be deemed an element of the crime under the second definition because, otherwise, the statute would violate due process by failing to provide fair notice of the conduct deemed criminal. In Magliocco’s view, the PIC statute must be construed to avoid such a notice violation, and therefore, common use must again be deemed an element of PIC under the second definition. Magliocco further argues that, although most of the decided cases addressing fair warning arise from vague or overbroad statutes, the same principle is implicated when a statute is narrow and precise, but when a court interprets the statute to mean something different from what is suggested by a literal reading of its terms.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that both the Act 27 amendment and the Act 98 amendment occurred during a relatively short period of time, and thus, it is unremarkable that the 1996 amendment worked off the earlier unamended version of Section 907 containing a word which was stricken by the 1995 PIC amendment. In support of its argument concerning the proper reading of Section 907 as amended, the Commonwealth also invokes Section 1954 of the Act, entitled “merger of subsequent amendments,” which specifically contemplates and governs circumstances involving multiple amendments to a statute:</p>
    <blockquote id="AsB" data-blocks='[["BL_577.4",577,[215,985,1110,526]]]'>Whenever a statute has been more than once amended, the latest amendment shall be read into the original statute as previously amended and not into such statute as originally enacted. This rule applies whether or not the previous amendment is referred to and whether or not its language is incorporated in the latest amendment.

The Commonwealth submits that Sections 1951 and 1954 of the Act exist for the very purpose of avoiding interpretive disputes such as the one that Magliocco pursues here, where two separate amendments follow closely upon one another. The Commonwealth further argues that one need only properly read the 1996 amendment pursuant to the specific and unambiguous principles of construction set forth in the Act to realize that the word “commonly” was not reinserted into the second definition of an instrument of crime in the PIC statute.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that Magliocco relies on Volume 1 of the 1996 <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>edition of the Session Laws of Pennsylvania as proof that the word “commonly” was legislatively readopted as part of the second definition of ah instrument of crime, but fails to acknowledge that, in the very same volume, Section 1951 of the Act is quoted, thereby specifically reminding readers of the proper manner by which to construe amendatory statutes. Furthermore, the Commonwealth notes that the preface of every edition of the Pennsylvania Session Laws as well as Purdon’s Pennsylvania Legislative Service (a commonly-used secondary source for legislation) clearly explains that only properly highlighted terms in the collected Acts actually alter existing legislation. Consultation of the original statute and prior amendments, thus, is contemplated and that consultation clearly reveals the current content of a statute.</p>

The court recognized that the 1996 amendment, which criminalized the possession of body armor, worked off of a version of the PIC statute that did not include the 1995 deletion of the word commonly.

The panel held that the Act did not empower it to accept as controlling any portion of an amendatory statute that was not printed in the designated manner. Because the word “commonly,” which was deleted in 1995, did not appear italicized or underscored in the 1996 amendment, the panel concluded that it could not accept Magliocco’s con<a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>tention that the 1996 amendment restored the common use requirement to the second definition.</p>

Indeed, the panel majority recognized that if the General Assembly did not intend Section 1954 to apply in a case such as this, then this provision of the Act would serve no purpose. The panel found that the reading plainly mandated by Section 1954 required it to recognize the 1995 deletion of the word “commonly” as having been incorporated into the 1996 amendment. Thus, the panel held that the 1996 amendment did not reintroduce a common use element into the second definition of an instrument of crime; rather, the appearance of the word “commonly” in the 1996 amendment was a legal nullity. Accordingly, the panel majority found that Magliocco’s conviction for PIC was proper. <a href="/a2d/806/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="806 A.2d 1280" data-case-ids="11367263" data-case-paths="/a2d/806/1280-01">806 A.2d at 1284-85</a>.</p>

Section 907(d) is to be read by including both the 1995 deletion of the word “commonly” in the second definition and the 1996 additions of the provisions respecting body armor. That reading is legislatively commanded irrespective of “whether or not the previous amendment is referred to and whether or not its language is incorporated in the latest amendment”—the precise circumstance which is presented in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The statutory change effected by the 1995 amendment (a single deletion) is to be deemed “as though [it] had in fact been incorporated therein” into the 1996 amendment. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1954.</p>

Indeed, the dispute does not concern interpretation of the statutory language, but instead the specific language actually enacted by the General Assembly. This Court’s determination of what the statute says—specifically, whether the word commonly is a part of it—is commanded by specific provisions of the Statutory Construction Act. That determination effectuates the plain language of the statute as actually enacted and amended, and there is nothing vague or uncertain in the meaning of the PIC statute’s definition of an instrument of crime, once so apprehended. Instead, the due process challenge here only arises from the adequacy of the method of memorializing and conveying legislative intent in the case of successive amendments to a statute. While the <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>proper analysis of that conveyance of legislative intent requires consultation of other legislative provisions which specifically address the successive amendment scenario and make the statutory construction answer clear, we do not believe that such a construct violates due process.</p>

The very notion of a fair notice requirement presupposes a reasonably intelligent citizen who, if interested, is capable of educating himself concerning the status of the law. So long as courts presume that putative criminal defendants consult (or could consult) the session laws to apprise themselves of what conduct is prohibited before they act, it is no great or onerous additional step to indulge the concomitant assumption that they read those session laws according to legislatively-prescribed principles of construction. In this regard, it is notable that the Statutory Construction Act’s interpretive provisions are not aimed exclusively at courts, or lawyers, or legislative specialists; rather, the Assembly broadly mandated that, “[i]n the construction of the statutes of this Commonwealth, the rules set forth in this chapter shall be observed, unless the application of such rules would result in a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1901.

However, any reader who sought to ascertain the status of the PIC statute following the 1996 amendment, and who thereby consulted Volume I of the 1996 Laws of the General Assembly, would see that Section 1951 of <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>the Statutory Construction Act is quoted, and instructs the reader how to read statutory amendments. Additionally, the preface of every edition of these Session Laws (as well as Purdon’s Pennsylvania Legislative Service, the unofficial source of Pennsylvania legislation), clearly explains that only the highlighted terms in amendatory acts actually change the words of the existing statute.

There is no suggestion that this printing was intended to reflect the definitive, self-contained, current statement of Section 907 as it existed following the 1996 amendment. Rather, Act 98 was explicitly designated as amendatory, purporting to highlight additions and deletions to Section 907 as it previously existed. Consultation with the pre-existing statute, thus, is presupposed, and it is no more difficult to find the prior version of the statute, and the rules of construction, than it is to find the amendment. No legal system dependent upon the salutary assumption that persons know the law could persist absent a concomitant assumption that those who are inclined to find the law are capable of doing so according to general, easily found, and clear principles of construction. Accordingly, we conclude that this Court’s construction of Section 907, which is commanded by Section 1954 of the Statutory Construction Act, does not violate due process, and that construction makes clear that the word “commonly” is not a part of the second definition of an instrument of crime.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The Superior Court properly affirmed Maglioeco’s PIC conviction.</p>

Moreover, the Commonwealth notes that other provisions in the Crimes Code recognize this distinction.

The Commonwealth submits that, by not adverting to the term of art “conviction” in Section 2710’s reference to the predicate offense, but instead addressing the mere “commission” of a qualifying offense, the General Assembly clearly and unambiguously revealed its intention hot to require a conviction of that predicate offense.</p>

The Commonwealth maintains that, since an ethnic intimidation conviction requires a finding that the underlying offense was committed, the trial judge’s guilty verdict on ethnic intimidation must be construed as representing a finding that Magliocco committed terroristic threats, even though she declined to convict him of it as a separate crime. Any inconsistency in the trial court’s verdicts, the Commonwealth argues, is no basis for awarding relief upon a sufficiency of the evidence claim since consistency in verdicts is not required and an acquittal “ ‘cannot be interpreted as a specific finding in relation to some of the evidence.’ ” Commonwealth’s Brief, 9-10, (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

This is so because, <em>inter alia, </em>the qualifying offense (here, terroristic threats) is actually incorporated into the ethnic intimidation statute as an element of the crime; accordingly, proof was required not simply that the offense of terroristic threats was committed, but that that offense was committed beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court’s specific verdict of acquittal on that very question, Magliocco argues, necessarily precludes a finding that the Commonwealth sustained its burden respecting that element of the crime of ethnic intimidation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

In order to find Magliocco guilty of ethnic intimidation in this ease, the factfinder had to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that, among other things, he actually “committed” the offense of terroristic threats. But, the Commonwealth did not merely allege that, for purposes of an ethnic intimidation prosecution, Magliocco committed terroristic threats with a malicious racial animus. Instead, the predicate offense was actually charged and actually prosecuted, and that prosecution resulted in an acquittal-a finding that, for whatever reason, the Commonwealth failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant “committed” terroristic threats. Given the special weight afforded acquittals, since the factfinder in this case specifically found that Magliocco did not commit the offense of terroristic threats, the conviction for ethnic intimidation, which requires as an element the commission beyond a reasonable doubt of the underlying offense, simply cannot stand.

The practical consequence of the General Assembly's subsequent deletion of the word "commonly” could be appreciated-only by one who was familiar with <em>Ngow. </em>Thus, appellant's argument that the 1996 Amendment misled citizens as to the statutory elements assumes that citizens may be deemed familiar not only with statutory language, but also with interpretive case law-a level of legal sophistication arguably greater than the ability to properly read successive amendatory statutes properly.</p>

    <p id="b592-7" data-blocks='[["BL_592.6",592,[237,932,1156,1013]]]'>On the fair-warning issue implicated by Appellant’s conviction for possessing an instrument of a crime, I agree with the position taken by President Judge Emeritus McEwen in his concurring and dissenting opinion in the Superior Court. <em>See Commonwealth v. Magliocco, </em><a href="/a2d/806/1280-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="806 A.2d 1280" data-case-ids="11367263" data-case-paths="/a2d/806/1280-01">806 A.2d 1280</a>, 1290 (Pa.Super.2002) (McEwen, P.J.E., concurring and dissenting). Principally, I support the position that, under applicable due process principles requiring fair warning of punitive consequences, the corrective construction of the possession-of-an-instrument-of-crime statute applied by the majority is too remote from the statute’s prescribed terms to justify departure from those plain terms to support the imposition of criminal punishment. <em>See generally McBoyle v. United States, </em><a href="/us/283/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="283 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="434101" data-case-paths="/us/283/0025-01">283 U.S. 25</a>, 27, <a href="/us/283/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="283 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="434101" data-case-paths="/us/283/0025-01">51 S.Ct. 340</a>, 341, <a href="/us/283/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="283 U.S. 25" data-case-ids="434101" data-case-paths="/us/283/0025-01">75 L.Ed. 816</a> (1931) (“Although it is not likely that a criminal will carefully consider the text of the law before he murders or steals, it is reasonable that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.”).</p>

To the degree that constitutional principles are involved, the majority’s holding appears to me to be in tension with decisions of the United States Supreme Court. <em>Cf. United States v. Powell, </em><a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">469 U.S. 57</a>, 64-69, <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">105 S.Ct. 471</a>, 476-79, <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">83 L.Ed.2d 461</a> (1984) (declining to overturn a criminal conviction based upon inconsistency between verdicts, where jurors convicted a defendant of using the telephone to facilitate the commission of certain felonies, but acquitted on the felony counts themselves).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> In terms of common law decision making, I acknowledge that there are reasonable counterarguments lodged against the approach taken in prevailing decisions governing inconsistent verdicts. <em>See, e.g., </em>Eric L.

It has been the concern of the United States Supreme Court however, that, once exceptions to the general rule against the affordance of relief based on inconsistent verdicts are devised, they are likely to overcome the general rule. <em>See Powell, </em><a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">469 U.S. at 67</a>, <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">105 S.Ct. at 478</a>. The Court’s reasoning is that distinctions defining the exceptions, including the prescribed-necessary-offense basis adopted by the majority here, cannot be reasonably maintained. <em>See <a href="/us/469/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="469 U.S. 57" data-case-ids="11958569" data-case-paths="/us/469/0057-01">id.</a> </em>(rejecting a prescribed-necessary-offense exception to the general rule proscribing relief based on inconsistent verdicts as “fall[ing] almost of its own weight”).</p>
