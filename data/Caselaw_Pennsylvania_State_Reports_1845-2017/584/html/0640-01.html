A person is guilty of first-degree murder where the Commonwealth proves that: (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to Mil. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d); <em>Commonwealth v.

An intentional Mlling is a “Milling by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other Mnd of willful, deliberate and premeditated Mlling.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). The Commonwealth may establish that a defendant intentionally Mlled another solely by circumstantial evidence, and the fact finder may infer that the defendant intended to Mil a victim based on the defendant’s use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim’s body. <em>Commonwealth v.

On Saturday, September 1, 2001, appellant, along with Steven Estes, Raymond Navarro Perez, and Michael Bourgeois, drove to the home of Lloyd and Beverly Good in Lititz, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, intending to commit a burglary while the Good family was absent on vacation. In furtherance of the agreement, the perpetrators gained entrance through a side garage door and ransacked the home. They stole a 1996 green Chevrolet Suburban and a 1996 silver Saturn sedan, both of which had been parked in the garage. They also stole a number of weapons: a .22 caliber revolver, a .32-20 caliber revolver, a Marlin 12 gauge bolt action shotgun, an Ithaca 12 gauge pump shotgun, a 30-06 Remington rifle, a Browning 300 Winchester Magnum rifle, two boxes of 300 shells, three boxes of 30-06 shells, two blocks of .22 shells, assorted hunting knives, a Jennings “Buckmaster” compound bow, a Jennings “Bear” bow, two 10-pump BB guns, and one one-pump BB gun.

That same day, the <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>Lancaster City Police recovered the Chevrolet Suburban, which was being driven by Estes. The next day, the Saturn was found abandoned on U.S. Route 222 in Manheim Township, Lancaster County. Also on that day, the Good residence was processed for latent fingerprints. Several prints were lifted, one of which matched fingerprints on file for Bourgeois. On September 5, 2001, police made unsuccessful efforts to locate Bourgeois at the residence of his mother, Lucy Smith, and her husband, Terry Smith, in Ephrata. That evening the Smiths went to 109 South 11th Street, Akron, which was leased to Drenea Rodriguez, to visit Bourgeois, who had moved out of the Smith home approximately two months earlier to live with Rodriguez, with whom he was romantically involved. During their visit, the Smiths informed Bourgeois that the State Police were seeking his whereabouts.</p>

Ms. Lamm advised the police that Terry Smith had not come to work during the morning hours that day, that she had not heard from him and that he usually reported to work in a reliable and consistent manner. Ms. Lamm reported that Lucy Smith was also not at work as an elementary school principal, which was unusual. Detective David Shupp and Officer Douglas Heilman responded to the Smith residence at approximately 10:30 a.m. and attempted to gain the attention of residents inside by knocking on the door and ringing the doorbell. They found the front door locked, but discovered that the rear sliding door was unlocked. Detective Shupp then checked in with his office and learned that Bourgeois was the son of Lucy Smith, that his fingerprint had been discovered at the scene of the Good burglary, and that firearms had been stolen from the house. Detective Shupp then requested additional assistance and was joined by Detective Ballinger and Sergeant Kurtz of the Ephrata Borough Police Department, and Officer Diane Houston from the Ephrata Township Police Department.</p>

Officer Heilman and Detective Shupp went upstairs and entered the master bedroom, where it was obvious that a struggle had taken place. They observed blood spatters on the mattress and wall and what appeared to be a body wrapped in a comforter on the floor in a pool of blood. This body was later identified as Lucy Smith. She had been severely assaulted on the left side of her head and shot in the head. Sergeant Kurtz located another body wrapped in bedding in a front bedroom, which was later identified as Terry Smith. This bedroom also showed signs of a struggle and Terry Smith had been stabbed repeatedly and shot multiple times in the head.</p>

Bourgeois admitted that he and Perez had committed the burglary. Bourgeois also stated that Perez had told him that the items taken from the Good residence were stored at Perez’s residence on Plum Street in Lancaster City. Bourgeois was subsequently arrested on the burglary charge. Detective ’ Brad Ortenzi of the Ephrata Police Department and Detective Sergeant Edward Tobin of the Warwick Township Police Department remained at Rodriguez’s residence to interview her. During that discussion, which took place on the front porch, appellant May came downstairs and Rodriguez introduced him to the detectives. Appellant agreed to talk to the detectives after they finished their conversation with Rodriguez. At about 3:30 p.m., the detectives began asking appellant about the whereabouts of Bourgeois over the days leading up to September 6, 2001. Upon request by Rodriguez, the detectives left the front porch and they asked appellant if he would accompany them to the police station. Appellant agreed.</p>

In response, appellant said that he wanted to talk to an attorney. The interview was concluded and appellant was driven back to the Rodriguez home. Approximately 50 minutes later, at 7:40 p.m. on September 6, 2001, Detectives Ortenzi and Tobin returned to the Rodriguez residence to arrest appellant for the Good burglary. The detectives were told that appellant could be found at his girlfriend’s residence. They then proceeded to 916 Main Street, Akron, and arrested appellant.

Appellant was then given <em>Miranda </em>warnings again, which he acknowledged in writing. Appellant then gave a statement to Detectives Ortenzi and Tobin in which he confessed to participation in the killings of Terry and Lucy Smith. Appellant stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had worn rubber gloves to the Smith residence and that Bourgeois did not, and that he was wearing jeans and a tee shirt which he had subsequently placed in the Rodriguez house.

The evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant intentionally, deliberately, and with premeditation participated in the murders of Terry and Lucy Smith. These victims were unlawfully killed; appellant actively participated in the killings; and that active participation, combined with the fact that the victims were assaulted with deadly weapons on vital parts of their bodies, was sufficient to permit the jury to find that appellant harbored a specific intent to kill. Even if appellant did not inflict the specific injuries which caused each of the Smiths’ deaths, the evidence proved that he clearly shared that intent with his accomplice, Bourgeois. Additional evidence of appellant’s specific intent to kill included the state<a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>ments he made to police. There was also substantial evidence of premeditation and motive. Several witnesses testified regarding the “brotherhood” formed between appellant, Estes, Bourgeois, and Rodriguez. One of appellant’s co-conspirators, Estes, testified about three conversations he participated in at the Rodriguez residence in which the robbery and murder of Terry and Lucy Smith were discussed between appellant, Rodriguez and Bourgeois. Estes’ girlfriend, Rosanna Sheaffer, also testified that following the burglary of the Good residence and the arrest of Estes in the stolen vehicle, she and appellant had a conversation during which appellant told Sheaffer that Estes was a part of their brotherhood and that they were not complete without him. Appellant stated that the group needed money to bail him out, showed Sheaffer a loaded gun, and said they were going to shoot the Smiths.</p>

Appellant first contends that the trial court abused its discretion in ruling that the Commonwealth could use hearsay evidence to prove his prior bad acts, including armed robberies and a shooting, in order to impeach Dr. Neil H. Blumberg, a forensic psychiatrist who testified for the defense. The background for this claim is as follows: The defense suggested that Dr. Blumberg would testify to the existence of three mitigating factors: (1) that appellant was under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murder; (2) that appellant’s ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct and his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law were substantially impaired; and (3) that appellant’s family background reflected circumstances that could be considered mitigating.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> Dr. Blumberg’s testi<a id="p656" href="#p656" data-label="656" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*656</a>mony would have concluded that, in his opinion, at the time of the murders appellant was suffering from: (1) cocaine intoxication; (2) alcohol intoxication; (3) polysubstance abuse; (4) bipolar disorder not otherwise specified; (5) cognitive disorder not otherwise specified; (6) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, combined type; and (7) borderline personality disorder with antisocial features. This proposed testimony concerning appellant’s mental state was based in part upon Dr. Blumberg’s interview of appellant, an interview during which appellant stated that he had not committed any acts of violence within the two-week period before the murders.</p>
    <p id="b980-5" data-blocks='[["BL_980.5",980,[241,905,1152,798]]]'>Before Dr. Blumberg testified, the defense made an oral motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the Commonwealth from cross-examining him about appellant’s alleged criminal conduct in the two weeks before the murders. Specifically, the defense moved to exclude alleged statements made by appellant, which were contained in a police report, as well as statements by Estes, Sheaffer and Pam Shirk, all indicating that appellant had committed, or claimed that he had committed, several armed robberies and a shooting within that time period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> The Commonwealth argued that it should be permitted to cross-examine Dr. Blumberg in relation to these violent acts in order to demonstrate that appellant had lied to Dr. Blumberg and that, in turn, the doctor’s diagnoses were suspect because they were based upon the faulty factual basis that appellant had provided.

Appellant also acknowledges that one such relevant purpose is to impeach an expert witness. Appellant argues, however, that a witness may not be impeached based upon mere hearsay, unless the hearsay consists of prior inconsistent statements made by that very witness. Appellant argues that his own statements, as memorialized in Corporal Guth’s report, were a police officer’s written account of what appellant said, a classic example of double hearsay; <a id="p658" href="#p658" data-label="658" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*658</a>and that his interview with Corporal Guth was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Appellant then argues that Estes’ statements, concerning the shooting, which are found in Detective Shupp’s police report, were also double hearsay; that Sheaffer merely told Detective Shupp what Estes had told her, which amounts to triple hearsay; and that Shirk’s statement to police does not appear to provide any evidence of appellant’s prior bad acts. Since none of the evidence which might have served as a basis to impeach the doctor’s testimony was admissible, nor did the evidence consist of actual prior inconsistent statements offered by the doctor, appellant argues, the trial court’s ruling was erroneous. Appellant also argues that the trial court’s denial of his motion deprived him of his right to confront witnesses against him; and the ruling particularly prejudiced him because it served to deprive the jury of evidence concerning appellant’s family history, his diagnoses of mental disorders, and an expert opinion that additional mitigating circumstances were present.</p>

Finally, with respect to appellant’s claim that the trial court precluded him from offering evidence concerning his family background, the Commonwealth again argues waiver due to the absence of objection below, and then notes that, in any event, the trial court never ruled that appellant could not present evidence concerning his family background, including testimony regarding his father.

While I agree with the majority that Appellant’s actual out-of-court apology to the Smith daughters constituted hearsay and was therefore not admissible, I nevertheless believe that the daughters should have been allowed to testify in general terms about their visit <a id="p670" href="#p670" data-label="670" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*670</a>with Appellant and that he appeared remorseful during that visit. Clearly, such testimony relating to the fact that the Smith daughters met with Appellant and what they observed first-hand during that meeting should not have been precluded on the basis that it was inadmissible hearsay. Rather, such direct observations were plainly relevant and therefore, as Appellant asserts, should have been admitted to support his contention that the catch-all mitigating circumstance applied to his case. <em>See Commonwealth v. Fletcher, </em><a href="/pa/580/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="580 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1100751" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0403-01">580 Pa. 403</a>, <a href="/pa/580/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="861 A.2d 898" data-case-ids="1100751,9190888" data-case-paths="/pa/580/0403-01,/a2d/861/0898-01">861 A.2d 898</a>, 918 (2004) (“The demeanor of a defendant, including his apparent remorse, is a proper factor to be considered by a jury in the sentencing phase of a capital case.”).</p>

Young, </em><a href="/pa/536/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="536 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="1843159" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0057-01">536 Pa. 57</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="637 A.2d 1313" data-case-ids="1843159,7371804" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0057-01,/a2d/637/1313-01">637 A.2d 1313</a> (1993), the case cited to by the majority in support of its conclusion that the daughters’ proposed testimony was inadmissible hearsay. In <em>Young, </em>this Court held that the appellant’s written letters to a nun to whom the appellant had expressed remorse were inadmissible hearsay given that the Commonwealth would not be able to cross-examine the appellant on their content. However, in <em>Young, </em>the nun, unlike the daughters here, was allowed to testify on behalf of the appellant and the Court specifically stated that the nun’s testimony was “in no way restricted, placed evidence of appellant’s character before the jury, and is not now in contention.” <em><a href="/pa/536/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="637 A.2d 1313" data-case-ids="1843159,7371804" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0057-01,/a2d/637/1313-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/536/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="637 A.2d 1313" data-case-ids="1843159,7371804" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0057-01,/a2d/637/1313-01">at 1322</a>. In fact, the Court made clear that the only issue before it was whether Appellant’s letters to the nun in which he expressed his remorse for the killings should have been admitted into evidence. Thus, while <em>Young </em>does indeed support the trial court’s ruling that Appellant’s out-of-court apology, like the letters in <em>Young, </em>was inadmissible on the basis that it was hearsay, it also supports the conclusion that the daughters here should have been allowed to testify about the fact that they met with Appellant as well as their personal impressions of Appellant’s character and remorsefulness from their meeting with him. As I believe Appellant is entitled to a penalty phase hearing in which the daughters can offer such testimony, I must dissent from the majority’s opinion effectively holding otherwise.</p>
