The rule is that a legacy is presumed to be general rather than specific, and the mere fact that the testator has given stock in amounts he has in hand, is not sufficient to overcome this presumption.

In this be would unquestionably be correct if tbe gifts bad stood alone, as that word bas been beld in numerous cases to show tbe intent of tbe testator to give tbe specific article rather than to have such an article purchased out of tbe general estate. After all, however, as bas been said, it is tbe intent of tbe testator that bas to be found, and in seeking it we are not confined to any particular word or phrase, nor to any particular part of tbe will, and tbe fact that tbe testator bad tbe number of shares so given, though not controlling, is significant. In the present case, tbe testator, it is true except in one or two instances, did not use tbe word my in connection with her gifts of stock, although, except in tbe case of tbe <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>Philadelphia Traction stock, she gave just the number of shares she owned at the time of her death. And as to that, it is admitted by all the parties in interest that she had, prior to December 6, 1907, 200 shares of this traction stock, of which on that day she transferred 100 shares to her husband — without consideration, as contended by the specific legatees; or, as a Christmas gift, as contended by the husband. And it may be that in the making of the will she had forgotten about this transfer, treated it as an advancement or intended to confirm her husband’s title and save dispute that might arise after her death with reference thereto.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b376-5" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[260,1018,1150,1414]],["BL_377.1",377,[191,359,1150,378]]]'>But that she did intend to give the stock owned by her to her various legatees we think is clear, when we read the eleventh item of her will whereby she provides for the payment of her debts, funeral expenses, money, legacies, costs and commissions incurred in the settlement of her estate, from her cash in bank, and provides that if this was insufficient for these purposes, “then I direct my executors to sell and dispose of my stock as may be necessary to each legatee to be apportioned according to the value of his or her bequest herein,” providing if there be any cash balance in bank it was to be divided between her husband and her daughter. This item illuminates the intent of the testatrix. Her thought was to divide her shares of stock amongst her legatees, giving each a certain number, and then, if possible, to pay out of the money in bank all other legacies and expenses. Fearing, however, that there might not be enough in bank to cover these claims, she provides, “If insufficient for these purposes, then I direct my executors to sell and dispose of such of my stock as may be necessary to each legatee to be apportioned according to the value of his or her bequest herein,” so as to provide a fund necessary to pay the expenses, and thus allow the balance to remain in their hands; and to be fair to all, she provides the sales shall be in proportion to the amount of their legacies. This is in effect assessing <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>each specific legatee of her stock with a ratable proportion of the deficit, thus charging the general legacies and expenses upon them — in accord with the old doctrine that where everything is given away specifically, the expenses and general legacies will be charged upon the specific legatees: Sayer v. Sayer, Precedents in Chancery, 392.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[193,748,1150,484]]]'>That this is the necessary interpretation of the clause is evident; otherwise, why should the testatrix provide only for a sale of her stock after her cash had been exhausted, and why provide only for a sale of so much as necessary, and a ratable sale? If she had intended general legacies, why should she have differentiated between her pecuniary legacies and the stock legacies, or why not between the stock which it is said she gave specifically, and that which it is argued she gave generally?</p>

They take their gifts so burdened, and are entitled to the benefit that goes with it, that is, the income that has accrued.</p>
