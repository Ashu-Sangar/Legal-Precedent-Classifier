    <p class="syllabus" id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[189,641,1153,974]]]'>A bill in equity for tbe partition of real estate averred that plaintiffs and defendants were tbe widow and heirs-at-law of E.; that during the lifetime of decedent an agreement was entered into by all parties with the decedent, whereby the real estate in question was agreed to be conveyed to the children in consideration of their agreement that decedent and his wife should have exclusive use of the homestead, free from taxes and repairs; that a judgment exemption bond in the sum of five thousand dollars should be executed by the children, conditioned for the payment of the annual sum of two hundred dollars to the parents, and the survivor of them; that each child should assume his or her proportionate share of the outstanding indebtedness of decedent, and pay his or. her proportionate share of the interest, taxes or repairs; that each child should pay an additional amount, if necessary, to maintain the parents, and that none of the children should encumber, transfer or sell their respective interests in the said property during the lifetime of the parents or the survivor of them. Defendants demurred to the bill. It was held by the lower court that the agreement above recited was a bar to a partition proceeding, during the life of the widow, and the demurrer should be sustained. On appeal, <em>held, </em>no error.</p>

Both these positions seem to us convincing. We have carefully examined the authorities relied upon both by'the defendants and by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs in their answering argument. It would seem to us that this is an effort to annul or cancel an agreement by indirection. We must construe the said agreement as one entire contract that must be regarded as a family agreement which is the peculiar object of the care and protection of courts. This family agreement provides that the parties thereto shall not sell or encumber the real estate during the lifetime of the widow. It is true that she as one of the plaintiffs agrees to relinquish any right to possession of any part of the premises, but she does not agree to cancel the judgment bond or have the judgment entered thereon satisfied. It is clear she cannot compel those of her children that are defendants to agree to an annulment or cancellation of any part of the agreement without relieving them from every burden thereunder. It is true the parties in interest by a subsequent action modified the family agreement to the extent that G. Frederick Musser was authorized to sell part of the land under certain limitations and restrictions, but this modification was by the joint and mutual agreement of all the parties in interest and cannot be relied on by any of the parties for an avoidance of the agreement in this issue. Until this family agreement is terminated by the mutual consent of all parties in interest or vacated by judicial decree it would seem to be and will remain a bar to proceedings in partition during the lifetime of the widow. There may be merit in the contention of the plaintiff that a partition is for the best interest of the members of the family, but they voluntarily placed themselves in the position where we find them, and it would seem that we are powerless under numerous authorities to give them relief in the method asked for.</p>

As we have found ourselves unable to direct a partition, the prayer for an accounting naturally and logically falls. In view of these conclusions we feel compelled to sustain the demurrer.</p>
