L. 239, to recover possession from defendants in the execution, it appeared that possession was resisted by virtue of a parol agreement made at or about the time of the sale, by which the plaintiff in the execution who became the purchaser at the sale, gave the defendants the privilege of redeeming the land by payment to him of his liens against it within sixty days. The option had expired and nearly a year elapsed before defendants sought to avail themselves of the privilege so granted. <em>Held, </em>judgment was properly entered for the plaintiff.</p>

Possession was resisted by virtue of a parol agreement made at or about the time of the sale by which the plaintiff in the execution, who became the purchaser at the sale, gave the defendants the privilege of redeeming the land by payment to him of his liens against it within sixty days. It was claimed by the defendants that the agreement made the plaintiff a mortgagee with no right of possession. The court found that on the defendants’ own showing the agreement, even if valid, was merely an option to purchase, and that it had expired and <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>nearly a year had elapsed without the defendants availing themselves of the privilege granted.</p>
