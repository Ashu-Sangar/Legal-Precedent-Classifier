L. 72, where defendant contended that the jurisdiction of the court was ousted by a proceeding instituted by plaintiff before the interstate commerce commission, for redress of the same grievances for which the action was brought, in which proceeding orders had been issued forbidding the practices complained of, and awarding reparation to plaintiff, the court did not err in sustaining the jurisdiction of the state court, where it appeared that practically all the coal mined by plaintiff during the period covered by the action had been sold f. o. b. cars at the mines, and was therefore not subject to interstate commerce regulation, that the action was not brought for violation of any federal statute, or for breach of any order of the interstate commerce commission, but for violation of a duty imposed upon defendant as a common carrier by the state law, and where it further appeared that no proceedings had ever been taken to enforce the award of the commission, and it did not appear that the award had ever been paid.</p>

Not to go into detail with respect to these several orders of the interstate commerce commission, it is sufficient for the purposes of this case, as we believe, to say that none of the said orders of the interstate commerce commission are shown to antedate the period of the action in this case, the earliest being that of the Hocking Valley Railway Company decided July 11, 1907. Generally speaking, it is contended on behalf of the defendant company that the existence of these orders, especially that with reference to the Pennsylvania Railroad, decided in 1910, indicates that the interstate commerce commission have occupied the field and thereby ousted the jurisdiction of all State courts with reference to the subject matter therein passed upon. We, however, do not take the same view with respect to the decision of the Puritan Coal Mining Company case. We believe the decision of the Supreme Court in that case must be considered as having been decided with full knowledge of the fact that the interstate commerce commission had, in special cases brought to their attention, promulgated certain rules and orders controlling future car distribution ; that is, distribution made subsequent to the date of the orders of the interstate commerce commission. The proof of this is that one of the cases cited by Mr. Justice Stewart, in his opinion, is that of Interstate <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>Commerce Commision v. 111. Cent. R. R. Co., <a href="/us/215/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="215 U.S. 452" data-case-ids="8290573" data-case-paths="/us/215/0452-01">215 U. S. 452</a>, which case especially involved an interstate commerce commission order of distribution. In the Puritan case Mr. Justice Stewart, after quoting from decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, thus summarizes: “We derive from this opinion these inevitable conclusions: (1) that where Congress prescribed a particular act, not in itself an offense at common law, jurisdiction with relation thereto attaches to the federal courts; (2) where the act is an offense at common law, and made so as well by State statute, in such case, except as other reasons may be shown, there is concurrent jurisdiction of it in the State courts; (3) that the Interstate Commerce Act does not attempt any more than does the common law to define what particular acts shall constitute unlawful discrimination, but commits that to the interstate commerce commission; (4) that when this commission has by its orders declared any particular practice or regulation observed by an interstate corporation as unreasonably discriminating, it is as though Congress has especially legislated with respect thereto, and such circumstance draws exclusive jurisdiction of the offense to the federal tribunal; (5) that except as to the thing the commission had defined and denounced as undue discrimination, the discrimination complained of may be adjudged by the State courts according to their own statute, or the common law as the case may be.” The learned justice then proceeds to show how the commission has exercised its jurisdiction, especially citing the case of Interstate Commerce Commission v. 111. Cent. R. R. Co., <a href="/us/215/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="215 U.S. 452" data-case-ids="8290573" data-case-paths="/us/215/0452-01">215 U. S. 452</a>, as an illustration of an adjudication which formulated general rules for the observance of all railroads; and holding in opinion that the regulation therein announced “is as much the law of the land as though written in the lines of the Interstate Commerce Act and that having been legislated upon by the commission exclusive jurisdiction with respect <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>thereto vests in the federal tribunal.” In distinguishing the Puritan ease the learned justice then says: “Here it is not complained that defendant had disregarded any order of the commission; nor has any order of the commission even remotely regulating the subject of the complaint here been shown. What is complained of is that the defendant having voluntarily adopted a system for the distribution of its cars which it must have regarded as just and equitable, and from which it makes no claim to be released, openly and flagrantly disregarded it by daily distributing to the Berwind-White Coal Company a much larger number of cars than its rating called for, while furnishing complainant with less than it was entitled to under its rating. The grouping of plaintiff’s mines in a class with others for purposes of service; the determination of the total number of cars to be devoted to such service; the ratings of the several mines within the group and the pro rata of distribution, were not matters regulated by the order of the commission, but matters decided upon by the defendant company with a view to avoid prejudice to the shipper. Had the plaintiff been dissatisfied with the regulation it could have appealed to the commission to correct it; had its appeal been sustained and followed by an order of amendment or correction of the regulation, then, upon subsequent disregard of the regulation as amended, plaintiff’s only forum for relief would have been the federal court, since in that case again Congress would have taken possession of the field. But there is nothing of that kind here; nothing but a case of discrimination pure and simple; not a specific offense creatéd by the express terms of the federal statute, not an offense against any order of the commerce commission, but an offense which could fall within the federal statute and the common law as well, ánd so be held to have been legislated upon by Congress, only as the interstate commerce commission has so declared. Our own State statute rests for its authority on the police power of the State, and its sole object is <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>to prohibit common carriers which derive all their powers from the State, and have been granted these to the end that they may serve public necessity and convenience, from practicing undue and unreasonable discrimination between shippers in the service they are created to render. The exercise of this power in the way indicated is not interfered with by the Interstate Commerce Act in the absence of action by the commerce commission specifically directed against the particular matter complained of. The thing condemned by our State statute and by the common law was a purely incidental matter indirectly affecting interstate commerce, just as was the discrimination in the case of the Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Larabee Flour Mills Co. (<a href="/us/211/0612-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="211 U.S. 612" data-case-ids="11928750" data-case-paths="/us/211/0612-01">211 U. S. 612</a>). The two cases on principle cannot be distinguished, and we but follow the plain guidance of that case in holding that the power of the state with respect to the subject matter of the present controversy remains undisturbed. It was not a question in the case whether the cars denied the plaintiff were intended for shipment within the state or beyond. It was sufficient that the offense was committed within the state.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b555-3" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[196,1565,1153,690]]]'>The above quotation from the Puritan case is equally applicable to the facts in this case. The offense alleged here is that of discrimination pure and simple. No specific offense created by the express terms of the federal statute is alleged to have been violated. Neither is any offense against any order of the commerce commission set up as the basis of recovery. The period sued for between October, 1905, and April 30, 1907, antedates all general rules, regulations or orders of the interstate commerce commission which could by any construction be said to be applicable to the case in hand. We are clear, therefore, that the general proposition of a want of jurisdiction in the State court is not sustainable.</p>

The learned counsel for defendant base their argument for this position on the opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart in the Puritan case, in which he subdivides his conclusions as to jurisdiction, and under the clauses 4 and 5 of said conclusions, which are as follows: “(4) that when this commission has by its orders declared any particular practice or regulation observed by an interstate corporation as unreasonably discriminating, it is as though congress had specially legislated with respect thereto, and such circumstance draws exclusive jurisdiction of the offense to the federal tribunal; (5) that except as to the thing the commission has defined and denounced as undue discrimination, the discrimination complained of may be adjudged by the State courts according to their own statutes, or the common law as the case may be.” Counsel, hence, argues that this plaintiff, by its complaint as to the method and rule of distribution, recognized and subjected itself to the jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission so as to draw exclusive jurisdiction to the federal tribunals. It contends further that the complainant in the Interstate Commerce case and the plaintiff in this case is obliged to proceed on its award, as pointed out by Sections 8, 9 and 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act. In other words, the contention is, that the action of the plaintiff, in thus resorting to the procedure prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Act in the cases in violations by carriers of the provisions of that act, subjected this controversy to the exclusive jurisdiction of the interstate commerce commission and by so doing rendered applicable to the situation the effective provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. That, therefore, the <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>federal legislation is applicable, even under the principles laid down by Mr. Justice Stewart in the Puritan case, and hence that the jurisdiction of the State court has been ousted, except that under the commerce act suit may be brought in a State court to enforce the award. We are clear that this contention is not tenable in respect to the facts in this case, for, first, the period sued for and right of action accruing antedates any order of the interstate commerce commission; and, second, the suit here does not purport to recover damages for that which is purely interstate commerce. The things complained of, therefore, were not violations of any orders of the commission. If Mr. Justice Stewart’s opinion is conceded by the defendant to be the law, it is clear that in no way does he make any order of the commission oust jurisdiction of the State court for an offense antedating the order. His opinion is, that without some order of the commission the particular offense complained of in this case was not an offense against the Interstate Commerce Act. The terms of that act were too general to define what was an offense under it. It remained and was left for the interstate commerce commission to define and specifically name that which constituted discrimination. When it does so define and particularize the field is occupied so far as interstate commerce is concerned. That opinion does not hold, and neither does any opinion in the state or federal courts hold that such jurisdiction is exclusive in tbe federal tribunals, except as to interstate commerce. As to commerce wholly within the State the Interstate Commerce Act itself expressly, in one of its provisos, says that it does not apply to transportation wholly within the State. This is one of the important clauses or provisos of section one. Reading into the Interstate Commerce Act, therefore, the order of the commission in the Puritan case, No. 1111, simply creates that which by future conduct of the railroad company will be an offense cognizable in that court as to interstate com<a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>merce only.

In this respect, of course, there is a wide divergence of contention in this case as to what is and what is not intrastate commerce. According to the undisputed testimony of the plaintiff’s witnesses, 95 to 98 per cent, of the coal mined at its several mines was sold by it f. o. b. cars at the mines. Irrespective of the point of destination we have held in this case, as in the Puritan case, that so far as the relation between the plaintiff company and the defendant company to coal sold f. o. b. cars at the mines was concerned it was an intrastate transaction; that it did not become the subject of interstate commerce until actually in transit, duly manifested to a point without the State. Cars, like sidings or switch connections, are simply a facility of transportation, absolutely necessary to the carrying on of the bituminous coal trade. The plaintiff, as well as the defendant corporations are State institutions, with State charters and subject to State regulations. It is only when in accepting commerce to transport without the State the carrier becomes subject to other than State laws and State courts. The coal mined in plaintiff company’s mines does not become, by the act of mining and loading, the subject of interstate commerce until <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>actually manifested. After being loaded, no car is the subject of interstate commerce and only becomes so by being manifested to some point without the State. Even then, when so manifested without the State, it is only when the car containing the coal so manifested is actually in transit that it becomes the subject of interstate commerce. At that time the coal on the car as commerce is not under and subject to the control of the shipper, if sold f. o. b. cars at the mines. It is then the property of the vendee, subject only to his control and for which the shipper cannot maintain any action in case of loss in transit, or in case of a refusal by the vendee to accept, or in case of demurrage charged against it. If sold by the railroad company because of nonacceptance or because of demurrage charged against it, the shipper has no right of. recovery. The railroad company owes no duty to the shipper and the relation of the parties with respect to the coal pertains wholly as between the railroad company and the buyer: Mull v.

In that case the question, as far as jurisdiction was concerned, turned on the point or place where the plaintiff’s relation to the coal terminated. If within the State, the relation of shipper to common carrier was not that of an interstate relation and left jurisdiction unquestioned in the State court. The United States authorities are to the same effect. Goods are not exports or in process of exportation until committed to a common carrier for transportation out of the State or started on such ultimate passage. When actually in transit to another state property becomes the subject of interstate commerce and ceases to be governed by domestic law with respect to taxes and begins to be governed by the national law of commerce regulation: <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>Coe v.

In that case a shipment of grain was made from Hudson, South Dakota, to Texarkana, Texas, via Kansas City, over certain railroads. At Texarkana it was transshipped to Goldthwaite, Texas, over two other railroads. Under a Texas statute a penalty was inflicted upon the railroad company making ultimate delivery, for rate extortion. The railroad resisted on the ground that the shipment having originated at Hudson, South Dakota, was an interstate one and not subject to the regulation of the state law. The Supreme Court held that the interstate character of the transportation ceased on arrival of the corn at Texárkana and that thereafter between points in Texas the railway company was subject to the state law. The same doctrine is reasserted in Southern P. Terminal Co. v.

A car at a tipple, duly loaded with coal, not manifested, is not actually delivered. Another case, which perhaps more clearly than any other case shows when coal is subject to the laws of the United States controlling interstate traffic is, United States v. D. &amp; H. Canal Co., et al., <a href="/us/213/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="213 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="8289641" data-case-paths="/us/213/0366-01">213 U. S. 366</a>. This case involved the interpretation of the commodities clause of the Hepburn Act prohibiting railroad companies from transporting between states, etc., any article or com<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>modity manufactured, mined or produced by or under its authority. It is there held by Mr. Chief Justice White, that the said commodities clause did not apply to coal mined and shipped, where the railroad company so mining and shipping had “in good faith before the transportation dissociated itself from said article or commodity.” In other words, he held that if at the time of transportation the coal was not owned, in whole or in part, by the transporting carrier, the prohibitive clause of the Hepburn Act did not apply. In effect, therefore, the case of the United States v. D. &amp; H. C. Co., <a href="/us/213/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="213 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="8289641" data-case-paths="/us/213/0366-01">213 U. S. 366</a>, is a clear recognition of the principle on which the decision in this case is based, namely, that the plaintiff having sold practically all of its coal f. o. b. cars at the mines, the coal so sold was not coal subject to interstate commerce regulations and was expressly excluded from the Interstate Commerce Act by the very letter of the act. This being so, it follows conclusively that this court had jurisdiction not only of the persons but of the subject matter of this controversy in any original action which the said plaintiff saw fit to bring in this court, either at common law or under our statutes. Hid it lose this right, however, by proceeding originally in a United States tribunal, namely, the interstate commerce commission? It did become the complainant before said commission. It did get an award of damages for what we understand to be practically the same subject matter. It did not, however, pursue that award to recovery. Neither is there any allegation that the award has been paid. Had it been paid by the defendant company another and different question might arise. The plaintiff saw fit either to abandon said action or to let it remain quiescent and to pursue its rights in this court, a State tribunal. The learned counsel for defendant contends that this suit is barred because of the recovery of the award. It is, of course, well settled that a judgment obtained in a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar to a second suit, whether in law or equity: Car-<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>ville v.

An award of arbitrators, after reference thereto, is equally binding: Lloyd v. Barr, <a href="/pa/11/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="11 Pa. 41" data-case-ids="404620" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0041-01">11 Pa. 41</a>; Garvin v. Dawson, 13 S. &amp; R. 246. The above cases cited from the brief of the learned counsel for the defendant are conclusive of the principles therein set forth, but the argument made therefrom to the effect that the award of the interstate commerce commission is equally a bar as is a judgment, a decree in equity or an award of arbitrators, is not sustainable on any authority. The language of the Interstate Commerce Act does not make the award a judgment enforceable by the commission or even by a court. It does make that award, when used as the basis of a suit in a United States court, a prima facie finding of the facts therein stated. An amendment to the original Interstate Commerce Act gives jurisdiction, after action by the interstate commerce commission, to state courts, but does not lay down even the principle that the award is prima facie evidence of anything. This award of the interstate commerce commission is clearly distinguishable from a judgment in every respect. It is not enforceable by any process. It does not become a lien upon any property of a defendant. It does not purport to be final and conclusive in any way. If used even as prima facie evidence of what it purports to contain, it is subject to attack when so used in a duly established court. Such attack could well raise the questions on which we base this opinion; first, that the commission exceeded its jurisdiction in making such an award for acts committed by the defendant prior to its order or decree; or, second, the defendant company could make a defense against the award alleging want of jurisdiction in the interstate commerce commission on the ground that the coal, which is the subject matter of the award, was sold f. o. b. cars at the mines and hence not interstate commerce. Thus using the very arguments on which we base the contention in the opinion in <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>this case for the right of jurisdiction in the State courts. If paid, it of course would have the effect of a bar, just as would a settlement or any other adjustment privately or publicly made. But it is clear that it is not and was not intended to have the effect of a judgment, and hence it cannot be said that the parties had their day in court before a court of competent jurisdiction. To be used as a bar or as the subject matter of a plea of res adjudicata there must be the award, unappealed from, of a duly constituted tribunal, the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or the decree following a bill in equity, duly enforceable by the regular recognized processes of the court or tribunal issuing the award, the judgment or the decree. The interstate commerce commission is not a court and does not purport so to be. Its functions are rather administrative than judicial. In its proceedings it does not necessarily follow or strictly observe the forms of legal procedure. The law provides that the commission must itself become an actor or party in a court of justice to enforce its decrees or sustain them when appealed from to the court. Hence, we conclude that this award cannot be used as a bar and could only be so used if paid by defendant, which is not alleged in this case.</p>

L. 72, 4 Purd. 3906. We have carefully examined the large volume of testimony submitted and are satisfied that the essential elements of the plaintiff’s case were made out by evidence which required it to go to the jury. There was considerable conflict between the testimony of the plaintiff and that introduced by the defendant as to the capacity of the plaintiff’s mines, the actual number of cars supplied to them, the proportion between the supply to the plaintiff company and to other companies which were alleged to have been unlawfully favored, the extent to which plaintiff would have been entitled to share in the alleged oversupply of cars to the favored companies, and the measure of damages, but the testimony was submitted to the jury by the learned trial judge in a clear and comprehensive charge <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>in which, we can find no reversible error. We must, therefore, regard the jury’s finding on these and the other questions of fact involved in the case as conclusive. The learned trial judge was appealed to by the defendant company to correct the errors complained of by it in the jury’s findings of fact, but after a complete review of the testimony in a clear and well-considered opinion, he held that the findings of the jury were sustained by the evidence and declined to disturb the verdict.</p>

The contention of the defendant company, which is the appellant here, is that in respect to the distribution of its cars to the several mines on its road it is subject exclusively to the obligations and prohibitions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and that if it has failed to observe or conform to these to the injury of the shipper, his recourse is to the federal tribunals designated by the Interstate Commerce Act as those before which actions of such a character can be maintained. We have sustained the jurisdiction of our courts in the Sonman case, holding that the question has been ruled in Puritan Coal Mining Company v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a href="/pa/237/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="237 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="988989" data-case-paths="/pa/237/0420-01">237 Pa. 420</a>, and Walnut Coal Company v.

If we correctly understand the defendant’s position, it is conceded that the Puritan case sustains the jurisdiction in the present case unless the proceedings instituted against certain railroad companies by the plaintiff and other shippers before the interstate commerce commission for the adjustment of car distribution and alleged discrimination differentiate it from that case. It is <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>claimed that the orders issued by the commission in these proceedings have ousted the jurisdiction of the state courts in matters dealt with by the commission. This contention is not tenable in view of the fact that the action was brought under our Act of 1883 to recover for unlawful discrimination in the distribution of freight cars, and the orders of the interstate commerce commission have no relevancy to or bearing upon the question raised in the record for adjudication. In his opinion refusing judgment non obstante, the learned trial judge, after quoting freely from the opinion of this court in the Puritan case to sustain his view on this branch of the present case, pertinently says: “The above quotation from the Puritan case is equally applicable to the facts in this case. The offense alleged here is that of discrimination pure and simple. No specific offense created by the express terms of the federal statute is alleged to have been violated. Neither is any offense against any order of the commerce commission set up as the basis of recovery. The period sued for between October, 1905, and April 30, 1907, antedates all general rules, regulations or orders of the interstate commerce commission which could by any construction be said to be applicable to the case in hand. We are clear, therefore, that the general proposition of a want of jurisdiction in the State court is not sustainable.”</p>

It appears that practically all the coal involved in this action was sold f. o. b. cars at the mines, and is, therefore, not subject to interstate commerce regulation. This is necessarily so on principle and seems to be the effect of the numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States which are cited and commented on in the opinion of the learned court below. It may also be suggested that the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>present action is not based on a violation of a federal statute or on any rule or regulation of the interstate commerce commission but on a tort committed against the plaintiff in violation of the statutory duty of the defendant company as a common carrier.

A judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction is a bar to further proceedings on the claim in any tribunal. But an award of the interstate commerce commission; is not a judgment in the sense that it concludes the enforcement of the claim on which it rests in a court having jurisdiction of the cause of action. The act of congress gives no such effeet to an award but simply makes it prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein in an action brought on it in a state or federal court. When introduced as evidence to support the claim it is, like other evidence, open to attack and may be wholly discredited.
