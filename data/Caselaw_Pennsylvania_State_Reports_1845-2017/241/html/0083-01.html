After a report by viewers against the bridge, there was a subsequent report by a board of reviewers in favor of the erection thereof, and providing for its northwestern terminus upon Hanover street, in the Borough of Plymouth. The board of reviewers also laid out an approach to the bridge, beginning in the center of Hanover street, in the Borough of Plymouth, at a point forty-five feet from the center of the westbound track of the plaintiff railroad company. The report of the viewers was confirmed and the order for the construction of the bridge and approaches was made. Plaintiff thereupon filed this bill in equity, to restrain the erection of the approach to the bridge, which would compel travelers crossing the bridge to also cross the tracks of the railroad company over an existing grade crossing, claiming that such erection would create a new grade crossing, in violation of the Act of June 7,1901, P.

    <p class="summary" id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[288,639,1154,1190]]]'>It seems to us that the above findings conclusively establish that no proceedings for the establishment of a new grade crossing is involved. The new bridge, together with the viaduct, will be completed at a point east of the railroad tracks, between those tracks and the Susquehanna river. It will discharge its traffic before reaching the railroad, and that traffic will then have to find its way across the railroad by way of established streets. There is to be no removal of a street from one place of crossing to another as there was in the case of Bogart v. The Penna. Railroad Company. The fact that the bridge is likely to produce additional traffic for the existing streets, does not change the nature of the street or convert an old crossing into a new crossing. That the terminus of the viaduct as planned, does not correspond exactly with the center line of the street which is called for in the report of viewers in consequence of which the bridge was authorized, does not change the fact that the traffic from the bridge will find its way to this street without any interference with the railroad company’s business, and without coming to the plaintiff’s right of .way.</p>

We may well admit what is reported in the adjudication, viz: that “though less dangerous than some ánd not more dangerous than many, the crossing is emphatically dangerous even under present conditions on a width of 16 feet with comparatively little travel along the street; so dangerous indeed that a paid watchman has been stationed there by the plaintiff for several years. With the opening of the bridge the amount of travel on foot, in automobiles and in other vehicles crossing the railroad at that point, will be enormously increased and <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>the danger will become correspondingly greater.” Bnt this will be so not because of any- added element of danger resulting from a change in physical conformation at the existing street crossing/ but because there will be greater use of the street. In other words, the crossing is just as dangerous for each individual who uses it now before the bridge is constructed. No crossing such as this upon a road perfectly level is necessarily dangerous when great caution is exercised by the individual passing over it, and by the railroad company in maintaining watchmen and gates.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-3" data-blocks='[["BL_119.4",119,[207,976,1150,648]]]'>But whether an existing crossing is dangerous or not, Whether the increased traffic that may through circumstances come to such a crossing makes the probability of serious accident greater or not, are matters with which in this proceeding the court should have no concern. The tendency on our part has been to make it a matter of conscience to prevent this great probability of accident at this crossing, and we find ourselves giving so much importance to that consideration that we are apt to lose sight of the fact that the case must go according to a reasonable construction that shall be given to the Act of June 7,1901, P. L. 531, in applying it here.</p>

Each of these plans involves very large expense, the purchase of valuable business real estate, and the building of what will be substantially a bridge several hundred feet long on a down grade from a point over the railroad approaching nearly six per cent., and having two sharp turns, according to one of the plans at right angles, and according to another of the plans at obtuse angles. Neither of the plans provides that this viaduct or bridge shall accommodate all kinds of commercial traffic, for it will not be possible to transport over this viaduct, according to either plan, certain articles having more than usual length like telegraph poles, smokestacks, <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>boilers, derricks, etc. The viaduct itself would open upon Main street of Plymouth, which is an active thoroughfare with much traffic but at best a narrow street, having in its middle the tracks of the Wilkes-Barre Company’s traction road. There will be very considerable danger of collision and damages from automobiles and other vehicles entering at the grade named or moving upon this street, even under present conditions, automobile accidents have occurred on this street and the danger will be increased largely by the existence of this new viaduct.</p>

As we have already pointed out, the viaduct which is part of the bridge construction and provided for in the plan, will be complete before it reaches the railroad. No new highway is to be constructed across the railroad. The traffic, whatever it may be, much or little, must find its way across the railroad over existing highways, and consequently this part of the prayer is really a slightly veiled endeavor to. compel judicially but by indirection what the statute has not authorized the courts to do directly, namely, the abolition of the grade crossing already existing in a case where there is no present purpose of making a new grade crossing, and in a manner not authorized by the Act of 1901. There is only one way to abolish an existing grade crossing under that act. That way lies within the power of the railroad company. The railroad company requires no assistance from this court to exercise that power. It is expressly granted by the statute and nothing more is needed than the willingness of the railroad company to pay for the change.</p>

The proceedings resulted in a decree of dismissal on the ground that the Act of 1901 did not apply because the bridge and its approaches at grade had been ordered in consequence of a view under the Act of June 13, 1836, P.

If a private individual were to lay but a piece of land located between the railroad and the river into town lots, and were about to sell those lots for building purposes whereby there would come a large accession of population that would have to use this ancient street crossing at grade, it would be hardly claimed that the railroad company could obtain an injunction to restrain the laying out of the lots, because thereby there will be a larger use of the crossing, and that thus the ancient street crossing would become substantially a new cross-. <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>ing from the circumstances of increased use. But the building of this bridge is just like the making of any other sort of improvement that comes with the growth of the community. It is a public necessity so found by a return of the grand jury approved by the court. It results from the natural growth of the community. The traffic coming over the bridge not being discharged directly upon the railroad but at a point (it matters not whether 45 or 450 feet distant) where it will naturally find its way or come upon an established street, should not have the legal effect of destroying the street and giving the railroad beyond those which it has already for its own protection under the Act of 1901. In other words, this circumstance of communal growth and improvement cannot be serviceable to the railroad company to shift the burden which it has under the statute, from its own shoulders to the public, and to compel the public to pay one-half the cost of abolishing an existing grade crossing.</p>

    <p class="author" id="AZg" data-blocks='[["BL_127.10",127,[484,1185,494,46]]]'>Mr. Justice Mestrezat,</p>
    <p id="b127-8" data-blocks='[["BL_127.11",127,[192,1239,1155,762]]]'>This case has been exhaustively considered in the majority and minority opinions in the court below and we do not think any extended discussion here would aid in the solution of the questions at issue. The controlling question is whether or not the building of the bridge and viaduct approach thereto requires in effect a new grade crossing at Hanover street, which is prohibited by the Act of Assembly of June 7, 1901, P. L. 531. The question was answered in the affirmative by the trial judge, and in the negative by the court in banc. It is clear, we think, from the facts of the case, disclosed by the evidence, that the construction of the bridge and the viaduct will not result in a new grade crossing in contemplation of the Act of 1901.</p>
    <p id="b127-9" data-blocks='[["BL_127.12",127,[187,2013,1156,429]],["BL_128.1",128,[279,351,1152,2070]],["BL_129.1",129,[198,370,1166,1033]]]'>Hanover street is an old and well established street, its exact width being uncertain. The court found that it was not less than sixteen feet and perhaps twenty or twenty-five feet. It extends from Main street over the plaintiff’s tracks to the Susquehanna river across which the bridge is being constructed. The report of reviewers appointed to locate the bridge fixed the western terminus of the viaduct at a point in the center of Hanover <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>street forty-five feet east of the center of the west bound track of the plaintiff’s railroad. It is clear, therefore, that if the bridge and viaduct are constructed in accordance with the report of reviewers, as confirmed by the court, the viaduct will not cross the plaintiff’s railroad tracks, nor will the traffic crossing the bridge be discharged on them. The viaduct will terminate east of the railroad and there discharge the traffic that passes over it. It is argued, however, that the western terminus of the viaduct will not be in Hanover street but will be at least ten feet north of that street and that, therefore, the street must be widened so as to accommodate the traffic which passes over the bridge. Conceding that the terminus of the viaduct will not be in Hanover street (which is denied by the appellees), as contended by appellant, it does not affect the question at issue in this proceeding, which is whether the construction of the bridge and viaduct will require a new grade crossing over the defendant’s tracks. The traffic will be discharged at the terminus of the viaduct which, as has been found by the court, will be at least thirty-five feet east of the nearest rail of the plaintiff’s switch track. As said by the court it will then have to find its way across the railroad by way of established streets. It is urged, however, that the construction of the bridge will produce additional traffic for the existing streets which must pass through Hanover street and over the crossing of the plaintiff’s tracks and will in effect create a new crossing. But this position cannot be sustained. The construction of the bridge undoubtedly will result in increased traffic on Hanover street and across the plaintiff’s tracks, but that does not change the character of the crossing, nor convert it from an old to a new crossing within the Act of 1901. The quantity of traffic does not determine the character of the crossing. The present crossing is undoubtedly a dangerous one. It is so regarded by the plaintiff company which has for many years maintained a watchman at the crossing. The <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>learned court in banc concedes that tbe traffic will be largely increased by reason of the construction of tbe bridge, and that tbe danger will become correspondingly greater, but in its opinion correctly says: “This will be so not because of any added element of danger resulting from a change in physical conformation at tbe existing street crossing, but because there will be greater use of tbe street. In other words, tbe crossing is just as dangerous for each individual who uses it now before tbe bridge is constructed. No crossing such as this upon a road perfectly level is necessarily dangerous when great caution is exercised by tbe individual passing over it, and by tbe railroad company in maintaining watchmen' and gates.” These are matters, however, as suggested by tbe court which do not control or rule this case. They are wholly outside and do not affect tbe issue. They are not sufficient to warrant tbe court in enjoining tbe construction of tbe bridge or tbe viaduct which has been duly authorized in conformity with law.</p>
    <p id="b129-3" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[200,1415,1153,760]]]'>While we agree with tbe court in banc that tbe plaintiff company is not entitled to enjoin tbe construction of tbe bridge and tbe viaduct because in effect it creates a new grade crossing over tbe plaintiff’s railroad, we think that in view of tbe conceded dangerous condition of tbe present crossing and tbe unquestioned increase of tbe traffic over it after tbe construction of tbe proposed improvement tbe bill should be retained as a'precaution*ary measure so as to enable tbe court to take such proceedings as may be deemed necessary in tbe future to insure, as far as possible, tbe safety of travel at that point. This will enable tbe court, upon cause shown, to exercise such control over tbe crossing as tbe dangers of tbe situation may require.</p>
    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[201,2186,1153,206]]]'>Tbe decree of tbe court below refusing tbe injunction prayed for in tbe bill is affirmed at the costs of tbe appellant, and it is ordered that tbe bill be retained for tbe purposes set forth in tbe opinion.</p>
