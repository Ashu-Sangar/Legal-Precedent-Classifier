The material parts of the deed conveying the title to the Andersons are as follows: “This indenture made 30th November, 1904, between Mary E. Heft,...... parties of the first part and William Anderson and Rhoda A. Anderson......parties of the second part. Witnesseth that the said parties of the first part for and in consideration......paid by the parties of the second part......do grant......unto the parties of the second part and their heirs and assigns, All the undivided four-fifths part of that piece or tract of land......It is understood and agreed that there is hereby conveyed an undivided ten-fifteenths part to the said William Anderson and an undivided two-fifteenths part to the said Rhoda A. Anderson, so that Rhoda A. Anderson, being already the owner of an undivided three-fifteenths part as devisee of her father, will be the owner of an undivided five-fifteenths part. Together......with the appurtenances. To have and to hold......unto the said parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns to the only proper use, benefit and behoof of the said parties of the second part their heirs and assigns forever.” ......William Anderson died intestate 24th of December, 1910, leaving to survive him the said Rhoda and three children, two of whom were by her, the said Rhoda, and, by a former wife, one, Mary Blease the plaintiff. Since the death of William Anderson, the said Rhoda has held the entire tract of land claiming to own <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>the same by entirety by reason of the purchase aforesaid and her survival of her said husband. The plaintiff, Mary Blease, claims that by the said deed, the decedent, William Anderson, her father, owned an undivided ten-fifteenths interest in the said land and that she is entitled to one-third of the ten-fifteenths, or two thirds of said tract of land. William Anderson was the father of three children, of two of which Rhoda A. Anderson was the mother. It was natural, therefore, that the father should want to take title so that his estate might be shared equally by his children. This purpose was admirably subserved by the deed, if it conveyed to each a particular estate, but the purpose was entirely subverted if the deed conveyed an estate by entireties. In the case before us looking both at the form of the deed considered as a whole and at the character of the transaction including the circumstances surrounding the parties, we are constrained to hold that the said William Anderson and Rhoda A. Anderson did not take an estate by entireties with right of survivorship as,to the described twelve-fifteenths but that William Anderson took individually an undivided ten-fifteenths. interest and Rhoda A. Anderson took an undivided two-fifteenths interest in the said land. Judgment is directed to be entered in favor of the plaintiff, Mary Blease, and against the defendant, Rhoda A. Anderson, for an undivided two-ninths interest in said land (being an undivided one-third of said undivided ten-fifteenths) subject to the dower right of said Rhoda A. Anderson. In addition to the foregoing facts, it appears that the purchase money was paid by the grantees in the proportions represented by their respective interests as designated in the deed.</p>

Nobody ever doubted that the husband was competent to take in severalty, and under recent legislation the competency of the wife to take and hold real estate as her own is just as clear as that of the husband”; then referring to Bramberry’s Est., <a href="/pa/156/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="156 Pa. 628" data-case-ids="844943" data-case-paths="/pa/156/0628-01">156 Pa. 628</a>, he states <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>that it is there “said in substance that words which in a conveyance to unmarried persons would create a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common, would create where the grantees were husband and wife, and they were so named in the conveyance, a tenancy by the entireties”; and he proceeds to say that “the converse of this proposition is equally true, viz, where the deed would create neither a tenancy in common nor a joint tenancy in unmarried persons it will not create a tenancy by the entireties though the grantees may be described as husband and wife.” In Bedford Lodge v. Lentz, <a href="/pa/194/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="194 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="912414" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0399-01">194 Pa. 399</a>, where in construing a conveyance to a husband and wife it was held that an estate by entireties was not created and the husband took for life only, Mr. Justice Dean (p. 401) said, “The premises of the deed, beyond question, convey to the husband and wife, the fee-simple in the land; and standing alone, it would be held that the husband and wife took the land by entireties. But ......the habendum expressly limits the estate of the husband to one for life, with remainder to the wife ......Evidently the grantor intended the estate of the husband should end with his life for he so says....... All the cases cited by the appellant are on the assumption that the estate is a common law estate by entireties; no note is taken of the effect of the habendum in qualifying the estate of the husband. This....he (the grantor) could do and did do.” Finally, in Rhodes’s Est., <a href="/pa/232/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="232 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="977861" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0489-01">232 Pa. 489</a>, our Brother Potter (p. 493) states, “the intention may be made clear in a deed that the grantees, even though husband and wife, are to take estates in severalty.”</p>
