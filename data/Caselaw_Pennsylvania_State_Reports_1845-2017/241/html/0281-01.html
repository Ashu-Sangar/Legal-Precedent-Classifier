In an action to recover damages for personal injuries, where it appeared that defendant street railway company had entered into a contract with another street railway company, by which for a stipulated sum the latter furnished electric power, employees and some of the cars for transportation of passengers, over a route consisting of defendant’s line- and a small portion of the line of the other company, and that under this contract the latter maintained, operated and controlled defendant’s line, the lower court committed no error in directing a verdict for defendant, it further appearing that plaintiff was injured while a passenger upon a ear belonging not to the defendant, but to the other street railway company, on the latter’s tracks, in the care and custody of its employees, and while riding upon a ticket purchased from it. In such case the defendant railway company could not be held responsible for the damage suffered.</p>

The body of the evidence not having been brought up, every assumption must be made in favor of a state of facts that would sustain the action of the court below; from the evidence submitted, in connection with the plaintiff’s declaration (printed in the paper book of the appellee) and statements of his counsel made at bar in reference to the <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>railway ticket used by the appellant, the material facts in the case, and the question involved, may be stated as follows: Where A (the defendant corporation), an electric street railway, enters into a contract with B, a corporation of similar character, under which, for a stipulated annual sum, B furnishes the electric power, the employees and some of the cars for the transportation of passengers over a route consisting of A’s line and a small portion of B’s own line, and under which B maintains, operates and controls A’s line, is A the proper defendant in a suit by one claiming damages as a passenger, where the plaintiff purchased a ticket from B, issued by B, and bearing B’s name, and at the time of the injury was upon a car belonging to B, on B’s tracks and in the care and custody of B’s employees, if the before-mentioned annual consideration is retained by B out of the total amount of fares received by it from passengers traveling on the cars traversing the aforesaid route, and the surplus over and above the amount retained is paid to A? Upon the facts as they appear before us, we cannot say that the trial judge erred in instructing that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover against the defendant company.</p>
