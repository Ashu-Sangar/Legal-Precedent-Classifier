It follows that a grandchild who had reached the prescribed age was entitled to one-third of the accumulations, and to interest on invested accumulations.</p>

It is not a rule of law determining arbitrarily a certain conclusion from words employed, but merely a rule of construction which will supply a presumptive, conventional intent where the actual intent is not ascertainable. “With the desire to reduce to a minimum the perplexity and uncertainty inseparable from the subject,” says Mitchell, J., in Woelpper’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/126/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="126 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="968893" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0562-01">126 Pa. 562</a>, “courts have established certain more or less artificial and arbitrary canons of construction by which certain forms of expression are presumed to have certain meanings, and in doubtful cases these presumptions are held to be decisive. But all of these canons are subservient to the great rule as to intent, and are made to aid, not to override it. As in all such cases, care is required that tools shall not become fetters, and that the real end shall not be sacrificed to what was intended only as the means of reaching it.” The whole force of the argument in support of this appeal rests on a rigid application and enforcement of the rule of construction which would make the legacy in this case contingent because payable at a future fixed period without antecedent substantive gift. That the language employed by the testator in the present case would not ordinarily import an antecedent gift may be conceded; and we may further concede that it fairly imports the opposite; <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>nevertheless, if it appear from the rest of the will that the testator intended by the language used an antecedent gift, the law will give effect to his intention in this regard. To apply an artificial rule which would defeat such intention would be a gross perversion of the rule making it a fetter instead of an aid. The language of the will for consideration here is as follows:</p>

First, the gift over upon the death of either grandchild before attaining the age when payment was to be made, is dependent on death “without leaving issue him or her surviving.” This is a circumstance so significant to the professional mind as showing an intent that the legacy should be a vested one, that it has become the subject of a general rule of construction thus expressed <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>by Mr. Hawkins in Ms treatise on Wills on page 225:</p>

    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.6",487,[218,758,1151,315]]]'>The significance of this feature of the will in question is not derived from the rule, but the rule derives its significance from the persuasiveness of the feature that grandchildren were to take if leaving issue, although dying under the given age. In Theobald on Wills, page 589, the rule is thus stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.7",487,[219,1085,1151,209]]]'>“A gift over upon the death of members of the class under twenty-one and without issue vests the gift.

    <p id="b487-7" data-blocks='[["BL_487.9",487,[219,1414,1153,198]]]'>The earlier case of Kerlin v. Bull, <a href="/dall/1/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Dall. 175" data-case-ids="12139554,12139752,1408351,1408419" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0175-01,/dall/1/0175-02,/us/1/0180-02,/us/1/0180-01">1 Dall. 175</a>, is still more directly in point. The facts of that case sufficiently appear in the following extract of Chief Justice McKean:</p>
    <blockquote id="b487-8" data-blocks='[["BL_487.10",487,[221,1632,1152,747]]]'>“The absolute property is given to John when he should arrive at age, and the use and profits in the meantime to his mother, for the maintenance and education of all the children. The last devise is a particular interest and no more than a chattel interest. The son John was the principal object of the testator’s bounty, and if he had married, and died before 21 years of age, leaving children, he certainly meant not his estate should go from them. This, therefore, was an immediate gift to John, though he was not to have the possession until he came of age. All the cases support this judgment. Legacies are governed by the rule of the civil and ecclesiastical courts; devises by the intention of the testator.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b487-9" data-blocks='[["BL_487.11",487,[267,2399,1101,45]],["BL_488.1",488,[270,365,1148,427]]]'>Again; the provisions that a moiety “of the income, <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>interest and dividends of their respective shares shall go to and be paid to their mother, Ella W. Paxson, for their education and support during their minority respectively,” evinces an unmistakable purpose to bestow at once a beneficial interest. As indicating an intention that the legacy should be a present vested gift, such provision is allowed to be most persuasive. In Need’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/118/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="118 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="556778" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0215-01">118 Pa. 215</a>, it is said:</p>

This circumstance indicates an intention that the beneficial enjoyment shall begin at once, and payment only of the principal of capital be postponed. When a legacy is given by a direction to pay when the legatee attains a certain age, the direction to pay may import either a gift at a specified age or a present gift with a postponed payment; and if the interest is given in the meantime, it shows that a present gift was intended: Provenchere’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/67/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="67 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1022478" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0463-01">67 Pa. 463</a>.”</blockquote>
