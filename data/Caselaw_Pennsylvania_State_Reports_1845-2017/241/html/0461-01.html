On cross-examination, to the question, “You were not sent out to test the car that day, I understand you asked to have the car go up to your home on a pleasure trip, that is true, is it?” He answered, “That is true.” When asked the question, “You did not test the car that day under the direction of Mr. Dietrick, or anybody connected with the. Matheson Works, he answered, “No,” and in reply to the next question, “You were merely taking a pleasure trip with this other gentleman?” he said, “Yes, sir.” Then on re-direct examination he was asked, “You say you took this trip for testing it and for pleasure?” and replied, “Yes.” Then he was asked, “What do you mean by the pleasure part?” and replied, “Well, I just mean that I used the car as if it was my own that day, only I was running it in at the same time;” after which he explained that the expression, “running it in” meant “loosening it up, making adjustments on it if needed.” This was followed by the question, “For whom were you'doing that work?” to which he replied that he was doing it for the defendant company. On re-cross-examination he said that he and his companion had made arrangements to- go up to Ms home and he had asked Dietrick for the car the day before, that the testing of a car included “running in”; and in response to the question, “In other words, you could not take a car out on a pleasure trip without at <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>the same time giving the car some test?” he said, “Yes, sir.” The question was then put, “Mr. Dietrick consented that you should take the car?” and he replied, “Yes”; then he was asked, “And at that time he did not tell you to take the car out to test it, did he?” and gave answer, “I do not remember he told me in particular, that was understood”; afterwards he plainly said that he did not remember whether or not Mr. Dietrick had told him that he wanted the car tested on that Sunday; but he admitted that at times he worked for the defendant company on Sundays, and he also said that he took automobiles out for testing “every day.”</p>

The vehicle in which the plaintiff was riding was overturned and he was thrown to the ground and injured. He sued for damages and recovered a verdict upon which judgment was entered in the court below. The assignments of error raise the broad question of the sufficiency of the evidence to show that at the time of the accident Reynolds was acting as the defendant’s servant in such <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>a way and to such, an extent as to fix it with liability for his negligence. The plaintiff called Reynolds to the stand and depended upon his testimony to prove that he was acting within the scope of his employment; and for the purposes of the present review the case is reduced to a consideration of the testimony of that witness. On this branch of the casé the issue narrowed to the inquiry, Was the chauffeur at the time of the accident on a pleasure trip and incidentally testing the car for his employers, or was he on a testing tour and by permission of his employers combining therewith an incidental pleasure trip? The verdict comprehends a finding to the effect that the real purpose of the trip was to test the car; therefore, the pivotal point now is, Was the testimony depended upon by the plaintiff sufficient in detail and character to sustain such a finding?</p>
    <p id="b497-3" data-blocks='[["BL_497.4",497,[222,1252,1153,916]]]'>A brief review of all the material evidence given by. Reynolds upon the points before us will be found in the notes of the reporter published in connection herewith; therefrom, inter alia, the following facts helpful to the plaintiff’s case definitely and plainly appear: (a) that Reynolds was employed as the servant of the defendant company to drive its cars; (b) that at the time of the accident his sole duty was to test cars; (c) that he worked for the defendant on Sundays when necessary; (d) that the particular car which he was using at the time of the accident belonged to" the defendant and was being driven by Reynolds with the owner’s knowledge and consent; (e) that the car had- never been out before the day in question; (f) that on that day it was fitted up for testing purposes; (g) that Reynold’s only companion on that day was a fellow-workman who was also a tester in the defendant’s employ.</p>

His statement that “it was understood” standing alone would count for <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>nothing, but in connection with the plainly appearing facts in the case, it has some force, since it is consistent with the inference that the real purpose of the trip was to test the car. But aside from this item of testimony, on the aforementioned facts, without more, a jury would be justified in inferring that at the time of the accident Reynolds was operating the car for the defendant on a testing tour and hi's personal pleasure was merely an incidental feature of the trip; and that being so, the case presents the final question, did the witness in other parts of his testimony destroy its legal efficacy to sustain this inference.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[287,1013,1150,1408]],["BL_499.1",499,[213,386,1154,646]]]'>The plaintiff brought out the facts which warrant the inference that the car was on a testing tour, and on cross-examination counsel for the defendant by a series of leading questions attempted to destroy the foundations of this inference and to show that the chauffeur had the car out primarily for his own pleasure. Although some of the categorical replies to several of these leading questions might apparently justify the belief that the cross-examination had accomplished its purpose, yet when the testimony of the witness is taken as a whole, it is far from clear that this is so. Reynolds did not deny, explain away or retract his testimony given in chief in such a way or to such an extent that one is obliged to say that no reasonable mind desiring solely to reach a just conclusion could draw the inferences contended for by the plaintiff; therefore, it was for the jury to determine what construction they would place upon the statements of the witness, what the net result of his testimony was, what inferences they would draw therefrom, and what conclusion they would reach thereon. In other words, the search for the truth did not develop such a conflict that a finding one way or the other would be a mere guess; it rather presented a condition of evidence, where, by making due allowances for the position of the witness and the form of the questions and answers on cross-examination, it was possible to harmonize ap<a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>parently conflicting statements, and to draw justifiable inferences from the testimony as a whole. Upon this state of the evidence it was for the jury to say how they would find, and the verdict shows that they drew their inferences as contended for by the plaintiff and decided that the main purpose of the trip was to test the car; from this they were justified in concluding that Reynolds was acting for the defendant within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident. All other essential points being duly covered by proper and competent proofs, this finding is sufficient to sustain the verdict and the judgment thereon.</p>

(p. 1576, sec. 7, and p. 1533 sec. 4), “where the facts are in dispute, or more than one inference can be drawn therefrom,” the issue whether or not the servant was acting for the defendant and within the scope of his employment is for the jury; and this in most cases is to be “determined by the jury from the surrounding facts and circumstances.” In Brunner v. The American T. &amp; T. Co., <a href="/pa/151/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="151 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="836667" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0447-01">151 Pa. 447</a>, the plaintiff’s horse was frightened through the explosion of a dynamite cap by an employee of the defendant company, and the defense was that the employee was not acting within the scope of his employment “but for his own amusement.” It was contended by the plaintiff that the man who exploded the cap (Delaney) was doing it for another employee (Livingston), whose duty it was to handle such explosives. At p. 452, we said, “There was no direct evidence in support of this theory, but the learned judge submitted the question to the jury with the instruction that if they should find from the facts before them that the cap was exploded in the presence of Livingston and as a test of the usefulness of the caps ......they would be justified in finding in favor of the plaintiff.” Notwithstanding that the testimony of both of these employees- “was strongly against the theory of the plaintiff” we said at p. 453, “the jury had the witnesses before them, and whether the inference was a fair one from all the testimony that Delaney was acting for and in the stead of Livingston in exploding the caps ......was for them to determine;” adding, “It is true <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>that the direct evidence is against the plaintiff’s theory, but there was a basis......for the inference to rest upon ......; whether it was a sufficient basis was primarily for the jury.” Also see, Guinney v.
