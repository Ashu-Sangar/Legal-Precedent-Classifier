Moore, and at her death to go to her children, Lillian Carroll <em>&amp; </em>Edna Moore.” The estate of testatrix consisted of some real estate and about $23,000.00 of personal estate, most of which was invested in income producing securities. She also had certain personal effects, consisting of jewelry, household goods, horse and buggy, etc. <em>Held, </em>the words “personal property” in the last clause of her will had reference to her personal effects, such as wearing apparel, jewelry, household goods, etc., and all her other property passed by the first clause of the will, being comprehended in the expression “all my property.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b287-11" data-blocks='[["BL_287.10",287,[193,1587,1153,639]]]'>Testatrix was about twenty-five years of age, unmarried and without issue and, in that first part of the will, naturally divided her estate among the three collateral branches of her family. However, giving the Wilson branch a fixed sum and the balance equally between her two aunts and their children: Mrs. Georgia C. Moore being an aunt by marriage and Mrs. L. E. Foote an aunt by blood, and their respective children, to whom the property is finally given, being testatrix’s cousins. Had she died intestate, Mrs. Foote, the daughters of Mrs. Moore and the Wilson cousins, or their mother if living, would have inherited her estate as heirs.</p>

And the $800.00 <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>being in jewelry, household goods, horse, buggy, etc. She kept her securities in a bank vault. The testatrix, an intelligent, but not a college educated lady, drew her own will on one sheet of paper, and apparently at one time. It is earnestly urged that the last clause of the will, viz: “I will all my personal property to my beloved aunt, Georgie O. Moore, and at her death to go to her children, Lillian Carroll &amp; Edna Moore,” revokes the first part of the will as to the entire personal estate. And as to that, so to speak, disinherits Mrs. Foote and her children.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b288-5" data-blocks='[["BL_288.5",288,[273,967,1150,1467]],["BL_289.1",289,[192,374,1153,207]]]'>From a consideration of the whole will, we are clear that the testatrix had no such intent. We think by the words “all my personal property” she meant all the property which she had about her person for her own use, to wit: wearing apparel, jewelry, household goods, horse and buggy, etc., and not the income producing property. Such construction harmonizes the entire will. As the said personal effects, jewelry, etc., produces no income, such construction leaves the bequests in the first part of the will intact. As pointed out by the auditor, it is not probable that the testatrix would give one-half of her personal estate, aside from the $5,000, to Mrs. Moore and her daughters in the first clause; and then give the entire personal estate, including that one-half, to them, in the last clause. Nor is it probable that she would give one-half thereof to Mrs. Foote and her children, and then intentionally take it from them almost by the next stroke of the pen. She would apparently not have much time to change her mind, while writing so brief a will. Had she done so before writing the last clause, she would naturally have re-written the will. Had she intended to dispose of her interest-bearing securities in the last clause, so as to give Mrs. Moore the life use thereof, I think would have been apt to use the same language as in the first clause, that is to have given Mrs. Moore the income thereof for life and then to her daughters. And the fact that, in the last clause, she <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>gives the personal property to Mrs. Moore for life and then to the daughters, tends to strengthen the conclusion that she was not then referring to income producing property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.5",289,[191,593,1152,419]]]'>Of course, the term “personal property” in legal acceptance would usually include everything except real estate; but from the whole will we believe the testatrix intended thereby to include merely such effects as she had for her personal use. And so construed, there is no repugnancy. The rule, that a former clause of a will must give way to a later, is never invoked except as a last resort.</p>

And there is nothing on which to base the suggestion that the word “real” may have been omitted by mistake. “Real property” is not a term that would be most likely to be employed by an inexperienced layman, nor can we assume that the word “real” was accidentally omitted. The fact that $5,000.00 is taken out of the property so bequeathed, and set apart for the Wilson cousins, while no provision is made for the sale of any real estate, tends to negative the contention that the property there mentioned was intended to include real estate only. We fully concur in the conclusions stated in the very able and painstaking report of the auditor, and do not deem it necessary to discuss the case further.</p>
