It was contended however on the part of Mr. Crisman that while the Act of Feb. 17, 1906, does not expressly provide for a case of this kind, it does enact, Section 8, that “primaries shall be conducted in conformity with the laws governing the conduct of general elections”; and that the Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 419 “regulating the election of public officers,” Section 11, does provide for such substitution, in <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>cases where the original candidate has withdrawn.

Vacancies on election boards shall be filled in the manner now provided by law. Before entering upon their duties the election officers and clerks shall be sworn, as is now required by law.</p>

They deliver the ballots to the proper election officer before the day of holding the primary. On the day designated by law the election officers hold and conduct the primary election.

Provision is made in Section 18 for the procuring of other ballots in case the ballots to be furnished to any voting place shall fail for any reason to be delivered, or in case after delivery they shall be destroyed or stolen. Section 20 enacts that at the opening of the polls the seals of the package of ballots for use shall be publicly broken and the package opened by the judge of elections. Section 21 enacts that any person desiring to vote shall give his name and residence to one of the election officers in charge of the ballots, who shall thereupon announce the same in a loud and distinct tone of voice. If the person’s name is found upon the ballot check list by the inspector or clerk in charge thereof, he shall likewise repeat the said name. As soon as a voter is admitted within the rail the election officer having charge of the ballots shall detach a ballot from the stub and give it to the said voter, but shall first fold it <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>so that the words printed on the back and outside as provided in Section 15 of this act shall be the only wording visible and no ballot shall be voted unless folded in the same manner.

It is therefore most apparent that the clause in Section 8, “Primaries shall be conducted in conformity with the laws governing the conduct of general elections in so far as the same are not modified by the provisions of this ■act or are not inconsistent with its terms,” relates solely to the holding of, or the manner of conducting the primaries on election day by the election officers. This language was most aptly chosen by the scrivener in drafting the act. And further, this language cannot reasonably be stretched to sweep in every act and thing connected with or leading up to a primary election, whether it is in any way connected with the holding of the election or not. It can not, in reason, be taken to include an act of the county commissioners in substituting a name on the official ballot which act must of necessity be performed a number of days before the primary election is held.</p>

It was not until the passage of the Uniform Primaries Act of 1906 that the election of such delegates was regulated by statute. There is nothing in the latter act providing for substitution such as is asked for in this proceeding. Neither can it be reasonably contended that the Act of 1906 authorizes such a substitution by reference to the “laws governing the conduct of general elec<a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>tions,” for the reason that this reference relates only to the method and manner of conducting the primary election on the days of its holding, and not to all the provisions of the former law generally.</p>

On undisputed facts the learned president judge dismissed the <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>petition for it, but his two associates, unlearned in the law, filed what they called a dissenting opinion, in which they held that the prayer of the petition should be granted, and they thereupon directed a writ of peremptory mandamus to issue. They were elected as judges unlearned in the law, and, if men of ordinary intelligence, ought to have known that it was never contemplated by the Constitution that they should ever set up their judgment against that of the head of the court on a matter of law. They were never intended for any such purpose, and we have so said in the rare instances of judicial impropriety of which they are guilty. In Syracuse Pit Hole Oil Co. v. Carothers, <a href="/pa/63/0379-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="63 Pa. 379" data-case-ids="1018904" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0379-01">63 Pa. 379</a>, the late Judge Trunkey, of this court, while presiding in a lower court, discharged a rule for a new trial. Subsequently his two lay associates made it absolute. In reversing and setting aside the order granted by the two lay judges, we said: “It was a step in the wrong direction for associates to interfere in a matter of this kind, and it is to be hoped that the example will not be followed. If such a proceeding could be tolerated, litigation would but begin where it ought to end, with the judgment.” Another case to which reference may be made is Glamorgan Iron Co. v. Snyder, <a href="/pa/84/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="84 Pa. 397" data-case-ids="1053574" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0397-01">84 Pa. 397</a>. There the two lay judges undertook to overrule the action of the trial judge on a motion for a new trial. In reversing their action it was appropriately said: “For many purposes the associate judges of the several counties of the Commonwealth have formed a most useful class of public officers. In the absence of the president judge, their services have been almost indispensable where formal judicial action in vacation has been required in the current practice of the courts. Wherever two or more counties have constituted a district, their local knowledge has been found to be an essential aid in adjusting questions relating to the values of property, to appointments of minor officers, to bail, and to the selection of viewers, appraisers and inquests in the Or<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>phans’ Court and Quarter Sessions. In the minor details of the business of the Common Pleas also, president judges have been able to rely safely on their judgment, integrity and business experience. But in the conduct of jury trials they have usually not sought to interfere, and usually their interference has not been invited. The purely legal business of a court of original jurisdiction must be subject to the control of a single judge, if efficiency, promptitude, and official responsibility are worth maintaining. If the deliberately formed purpose of a president judge may be thwarted and overturned by action on the part of his associates which must necessarily be ill-considered and may often be prejudiced, rules of law will be subordinated to individual caprice. The president is the constitutional head of the court, under responsibilities to the community which a court of review can always enforce, and hedged around by duties and obligations for the performance of which no other guaranty is needed than his regard for his own professional reputation. The fact that in Pennsylvania there has been no failure in the due discharge of those duties and obligations, is adequate proof that the exercise of supervisory and appellate jurisdiction by associate judges is, to state the conclusion in the mildest form, entirely superfluous.”</p>
    <p id="b169-3" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[171,1745,1154,371]]]'>As might have been expected, the two associate judges blundered when they undertook to put a construction upon the Act of 1906 different from that put upon it by the president judge. Upon his opinion, refusing the mandamus, the order made by those judges is reversed and the petition is dismissed, the costs here and below to be paid by the relators.</p>
