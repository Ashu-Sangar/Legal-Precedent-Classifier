        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nIn this action of ejectment, the issue was framed Under the provisions of the Act of June 10, 1893, P. L. 415, to try the title to certain real estate situated in Lackawanna County, partly in the City of Scranton and partly in the Borough of Dunmore. The real estate in question belonged to one Vito Girardi prior to July 9,1908, and on that date he conveyed it to the defendant Freda by deed duly executed, acknowledged and delivered, which was recorded on the following day. On the day after the deed was delivered, and on the same day it was recorded, July 10,1908, a judgment for $300 was entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County, by Alexander Popoli against Vito Girardi. Execution was issued oil this judgment against the property conveyed to defendant, and it was condemned and sold by the sheriff as the property of Girardi. It was purchased by Littieri, the plaintiff in this case, for $150, and a sheriff\u2019s deed to him was duly acknowledged and recorded. Plaintiff was a brother-in-law, and was also a creditor of Girardi. The property conveyed was heavily encumbered. Plaintiff alleged that the conveyance to defendant was not a bona fide transaction, but was without consideration and was intended to defraud Girardi\u2019s unsecured creditors, and he averred that the title still remained in Girardi, and that the property was therefore subject to the Popoli judgment under which it was sold. Defendant claimed to have paid a total consideration of $18,000 for the property, including the encumbrances against it, an indebtedness of Girardi to him of $2,750, the sum of $1,700 paid in cash when the deed was delivered and $700 paid in cash subsequently. Defendant maintained that these items constituted a full and fair price for the property, and denied that there was any arrangement by which he was to hold it for Girardi or that the latter retained any interest in it. The trial in the court below resulted in a verdict for defendant, on which judgment was subsequently entered. Plaintiff has appealed.\nFrom the record it appears that Yito Girardi who was the original owner of the property in question, and was also the defendant in the judgment on which the sheriff\u2019s sale was had, testified at the trial that when the deed was delivered to the defendant Freda, the latter paid him $1,700 in cash as part of the consideration. Upon cross-examination plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked the witness what he did with this money, and whether or not he put it in bank. Objections to these questions were sustained by the trial judge on the ground that they were not cross-examination and were irrelevant and immaterial. These rulings are the subject of the first, second and fourth assignments of error. It appears from the record, that when these excluded questions wer\u00e9 asked, the witness had already been subjected to a long cross-examination. The question at issue was, whether or not defendant paid him $1,700 in cash when the deed was delivered. The relevancy of an inquiry as to what he did with the money after he received it, is not- apparent. We are not convinced that there was any abuse of discretion upon the part of the trial judge in sustaining defendant\u2019s objection to these questions. In Quigley v. Thompson, 211 Pa. 107, the present Chief Justice said (p. 109): \u201cWhile the general principles applicable to the subject are clearly defined, it is in practice often difficult to determine the exact limits of proper cross-examination. Its range must of necessity rest largely in the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d That statement applies aptly to the present case, and these assignments are therefore dismissed.\nIn the third assignment of error complaint is made of the exclusion of a question put by plaintiff\u2019s counsel on cross-examination; but the record shows that the question was answered by the witness before the objection was offered, and no motion to strike out the answer was made. In the fifth assignment of error counsel for appellant complain of the admission in evidence of a blank judgment, note book produced by one of the witnesses. In neither of these assignments, the third or the fifth, does it appear that any exception was taken to the ruling of the trial judge of which complaint is made, and reference to the notes of testimony shows' that no exception was taken to either of the rulings in question. These assignments will therefore not be considered.\nIn the sixth and seventh specifications it is alleged that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit counsel for plaintiff to ask the defendant Freda on cross-examination where he obtained the money with which he paid off the liens against the property conveyed to him by Girardi, and whether he had the money on hand at the time, or obtained it by loan. These questions were objected to as immaterial and as not being cross-examination, and the objections were sustained. It would perhaps have been better to have allowed these questions to have been answered. Where there is an allegation of fraud the door should be opened wide to the admission of evidence. But there was practically no dispute as to the fact that Freda paid to Girardi in cash the balance of the purchase money which was due to him at the time the deed was delivered. This appears from the testimony of Freda, Girardi, Mr. Lewis the attorney who had charge of the matter, and Mr. Taylor his partner. The questions which were excluded did not relate to this money paid by defendant to Girardi when the deed was delivered. ^Reference to the notes of testimony shows that-the questions referred to the money used in paying off liens against the property conveyed after the cash payments had been made to Girardi, and after the deed had been delivered. It does not seem to be material where defendant got the money for the latter purpose; that is, for the payment of the various liens against the property, so long as it did not come from Girardi. There was no offer to show this, and defendant was not even asked whether the money which he used for the payment of liens belonged to Girardi or was his own. If such a question had been asked it would have been admissible. The excluded questions came after a long examination and cross-examination in which the subject had been quite fully covered, and we cannot see that the disallowance of these questions amounted to material error. The range of a cross-examination must to a considerable extent be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and unless that discretion has been plainly abused to the injury of the party complaining, it is not ground for reversal. We do not see that there was any such abuse of discretion in this case, or that it is apparent that the appellant was injured. These specifications are therefore not sustained.\nIn the eighth assignment of error complaint is made of the overruling of objections to a question of defendant\u2019s counsel addressed to plaintiff when under cross-examination, as to the amount he paid for a judgment for $133 against Girardi, which he had purchased. The relevancy of this testimony is not apparent, but it does not appear that plaintiff was injured in any way by the answer to the question, and its admission does not therefore amount to reversible error. \u2022\nThe ninth specification alleges error in the admission of the testimony of the witness W. R. Lewis, who was defendant\u2019s attorney in the matter of the settlement with Girardi, and in the conveyance of the properties, as to statements made to Mm by Girardi in the presence of defendant, with reference to the judgments and mortgages on record against him, the amounts due thereon, and as to the amounts for which settlement could be made. Plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the allegation that the conveyance by Girardi to defendant was not made in good faith, and was without consideration, and in fraud of creditors. As the witness Lewis was , present when Girardi and defendant made their bargain, which was verbal only, we think he was entirely competent to testify as to the terms of the contract, and as to what was said by the parties when it was made. In 1 Elliott on Evidence, par. 537, it is said: \u201cDeclarations, which accompany and are a part of the fact or transaction in controversy and tend to illustrate or explain it, such transaction itself being admissible, are also admissible as being so connected as to be a part of such fact or transaction.\u201d In 11 Am. & Eng. Ency. L. (2d Ed.) 523, it is said: \u201cDeclarations or acts accompanying any act or transaction in controversy and tending to explain or illustrate it are received in evidence as part of the res gestse.\u201d Under these principles we think the evidence of Mr. Lewis was properly admitted.\nFurther complaint is made in the tenth assignment that the trial court erred in admitting in evidence a memorandum made by the witness Lewis at the settlement, showing the figures according to which the settlement between Girardi and tbe defendant was made. Tbe paper was admitted in evidence against the objection of counsel for plaintiff. Tbe statement was clearly admissible in connection with tbe testimony of tbe witnesses as showing tbe details of tbe settlement between tbe parties. It corroborates tbe testimony of defendant and of Girardi and of Lewis. It was not offered as being evidence in itself of tbe facts set forth in the paper, but in corroboration of tbe testimony of Mr. Lewis, and as part of tbe transaction between Girardi and tbe defendant. In 9 Am. & Eng. Ency. L. (2d Ed.) 901, it is said: \u201cIt has been stated as a general rule that entries made by private parties, in tbe ordinary course of their business, are admissible in evidence if they are contemporaneous with tbe facts to which they relate, and if they are made by parties having personal knowledge of tbe facts, and are corroborated by their testimony.\u201d Tbe paper here in question falls within this rule, and it was properly admitted for tbe purpose for which it was offered.\nTbe assignments of error from tbe eleventh to tbe fifteenth inclusive are to tbe refusal of tbe first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth points for charge submitted by plaintiff. These points were all refused without being read. Tbe first and third of these points were properly refused, for tbe reason that they made tbe question of fraud depend entirely upon tbe motive of tbe grantor. As counsel for appellee suggest, an affirmance of these points would have been in effect an instruction to tbe jury that if they found that the grantor\u2019s motives were dishonest the deed was\u2019 void, even though tbe grantee acted in perfect good faith. Tbe controlling principle in such a case is stated in Reehling v. Byers, 94 Pa. 316, where it is said (p. 322) : \u201cIn this we must look to tbe motive of tbe creditor, and if that was honest and lawful, tbe intent of bis debtor does not enter into tbe question. As was said by Mr. Justice Coulter, in Scott v. Heilager, 14 Pa. 238, \u2018One man cannot be prejudiced by the fraud of another, of which he has no notice, nor opportunity of receiving notice.\u2019 \u201d The fourth point was properly refused for the reason that it was predicated upon the fact of an insolvent debtor making a conveyance in part payment of his debts, but reserving a benefit himself. In the present case there was nothing to show that the conveyance was not absolute, and there was no reservation of anything to the grantor. The fifth and sixth points were properly refused for the reason that, as suggested by counsel for appellee, they contemplated the rendering of a conditional verdict. It is only in an action of equitable ejectment that a conditional verdict can be rendered. The present action is in no sense an equitable ejectment, for the plaintiff claims under a purely legal title. In McKendry v. McKendry, 131 Pa. 24, Mr. Chief Justice Paxson said (p. 36): \u201cThe action of ejectment is often a substitute for a bill in equity, and we have in our practice what is known as an equitable ejectment. It is used constantly to enforce specific performance of contracts for the sale of real estate, and in some other instances. It is a convenient and plastic remedy, and more speedy than a bill in equity.\u201d In Riel v. Gannon, 161 Pa. 289, Mr. Justice Dean said (p. 293) : \u201cAn equitable ejectment in this State is a substitute for a bill in chancery, to enforce specific performance of a contract for the sale of land.\u201d But in the case at bar the plaintiff is asserting a legal title to the land which he claims to have acquired by his deed from the sheriff. He does not assert an equitable title, nor do the principles governing cases of equitable ejectment apply to this situation. We know of no case in which a suit like the present one has been treated as an equitable ejectment, in which a conditional verdict may properly be rendered.\nThe assignments of error are all overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.\nMr. Justce Stewart dissents and would sustain the assignments of error alleging that counsel were not given sufficient scope in cross-examination.",

In an action of ejectment to recover possession of land alleged to have been conveyed in fraud of creditors, in which one question at issue is whether or not defendant had paid a certain amount in cash at the time of the delivery of the deed, it is not an abuse of discretion for the court to exclude inquiries addressed to the original owner of the property, on cross examination, as to what he did with the money after he received it.\n5. In such a case it is not error for the court to refuse to permit plaintiff to ask the defendant upon cross-examination where he obtained the money with which he paid off certain liens against the property in question and whether he had the money at the time or obtained it by loan, where there is no offer to show that such money came from the grantor and defendant was not even asked whether the money which he used for such payment belonged to the grantor or was his own; and this is particularly true where the excluded questions came after a long examination and cross? examination in which the subject had been fully covered.\n6. In such a case a witness, who was defendant\u2019s attorney in the matter of the settlement and in the conveyance of the properties in question, is competent to testify as to statements made to him by the grantor in the presence of the defendant as showing the. terms of the verbal contract; and the written memorandum made by the witness at the settlement is admissible as corroborative of his testimony and as part of the transaction.\n1.

J., specially presiding.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the case.\nThe plaintiff presented certain points, which with the answers, were as follows:\n\u201cOne who is indebted cannot transfer his property to another for the purpose of defeating his creditors, so if the jury believe that the property .in dispute in this case was transferred to Freda, the defendant, by Girardi, for the purpose of hindering or delaying unsecured creditors from collecting their claims, the transfer would be void, and in such case the verdict should be for the plaintiff in this case.\nAnswer: This point is refused and not read. (11)\nA conveyance intended to hinder and delay creditors is fraudulent as to them, though made upon an adequate consideration; so even if the jury should find that the conveyance to Freda was made upon an adequate consideration, still if it was made for the purpose of hindering, delaying or defrauding the other creditors of the seller, then the conveyance would be void and the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff.\nAnswer: This point is refused and not read. (12)\nWhere an insolvent debtor makes a conveyance in part in payment of his debts, but reserving a benefit' to himself, this conveyance is void as against creditors who do not assent to it; so that even if the jury should find that Girardi was indebted to Freda; that the consideration of the conveyance was in part to pay debts of Girardi, but that there was an arrangement of some kind that Girardi was to have a benefit out of the property, then this conveyance would be void as to other creditors, who did not assent to the arrangement, and in such case the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\nAnswer: This point is refused and not read. (13)\nEven if the jury should find that the conveyance was made by Girardi to Freda in good faith, and without any fraudulent intent to hinder or delay any creditors of Girardi, and should find that there was an agreement whereby Girardi retained an interest in the land, and was to have it subject to the debts intended to be secured by the transfer, then Mr. Littieri, the plaintiff, as purchaser at a sheriff sale would be entitled to the interest of Girardi in the property, as it was at the time it was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale.\nAnswer: This point is refused and not read. (14)\nIf the jury find that under some arrangement between Girardi and Freda, the conveyance was made to Freda in good faith to secure Freda, for a certain indebtedness to himself and to others, and that at the time there was an agreement whereby Girardi was to retain an interest in the land above the amount required to pay all such indebtedness to secure which the transfer was made, then as purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale the plaintiff acquired the interest off Girardi in the land, and would be entitled to a verdict conditioned upon the payment of such sums to Freda as the jury shall find from the evidence would be sufficient to cover all the debt to secure which the transfer was made.\nAnswer: This point is refused and not read.
