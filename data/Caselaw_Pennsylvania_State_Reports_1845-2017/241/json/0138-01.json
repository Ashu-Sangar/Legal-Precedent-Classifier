Capwell, 228 Pa. 268. Even if the demurrer is fairly open to criticism as a \u201cspeaking\u201d one, there is sufficient in it to constitute it a good one, calling for tlie dismissal of the bill. On its face the complainant shows no right to what he prays for.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
