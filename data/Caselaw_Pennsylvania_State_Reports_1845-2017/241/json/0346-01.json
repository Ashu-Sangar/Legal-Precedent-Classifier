        "text": "Per Curiam,\nThe policy on which suit was brought provides that \u201cif a building or any part thereof fall, except as the result of fire, all insurance by this policy on such building or its contents shall immediately cease.\u201d The defendant claimed that the building was overloaded by the plaintiff, that part of the floors and wall fell by reason of the overloading, and as a consequence thereof the fire occurred. The plaintiff contended that the fire preceded and was the cause of the falling of the walls and floors. The only question in the case, therefore, was whether the fall of the floors and wall caused the fire or the fire caused the floors and the wall to fall. In charging the jury the learned judge said, inter alia: \u201cIf the wall fell before there was any fire in the building, then your verdict must be for the defendant; for, upon the falling of the wall, the insurance ceased. But, if the fire started in the building, and when after that, and as a result of the fire, the wall collapsed, then the defendant company is liable for the amount of the loss sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the fire.\u201d\nThe first and second assignments allege error in the exclusion of the testimony offered by the defendant to show that on a number of occasions several months prior to the fire the plaintiff had overloaded the third floor of the building. The offer was accompanied by the admission of defendant\u2019s counsel that they did not propose to show that the overloading had any visible effect on the wall. The testimony was excluded for this reason. It may be, as the learned counsel for the defendant argue, that the testimony was of exceeding importance to their client, but we fail to see its relevancy in view of their admission. If the overloading had no effect on the wall it certainly was not a contributing cause to the fall of the building. If it did affect the wall, it was incumbent on the defendant to show the fact, and failing to do so, the jury could not be permitted to find that such was the effect of the overloading.\nWe see no merit in the third and fourth assignments which allege that in its charge the court laid too much stress on the testimony of the plaintiff and failed to direct the jury\u2019s attention to the evidence of the defendant. The learned judge told the jury that he didn\u2019t pretend to state the testimony of the witnesses with any degree of fullness and did not deem it necessary, as counsel for both parties had done so in their arguments. In addition to the charge proper, the learned judge affirmed all the defendant\u2019s points except the one asking for binding instructions, and concluded the charge by directing the jury to take up and consider the testimony of all the witnesses. We do not think the charge was either inadequate or unfair.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Gunzenhauser v. The Prussian National Insurance Co., Appellant.\nInsurance \u2014 Fire Insurance \u2014 Collapse of building \u2014 Evidence\u2014 Charge of court.\n1. In an action upon a policy of fire insurance, providing \u201cif a building or any part thereof fall, except as the result of fire, all insurance by this policy on such building or its contents shall immediately cease,\u201d the case was necessarily for the jury, where the evidence was conflicting as to whether the fall of the floors and wall caused the fire, or the fire caused the floors and wall to fafi.\n2. In such case it was not error for the court to exclude testimony offered by the defendant to show that on a number of occasions, several months prior to the fire, the plaintiff had overloaded the third floor of the building, where the offer was accompanied by an admission by defendant\u2019s counsel that he did not intend to prove that the overloading had any visible effect on the wall.\n3. Such a ease will not be reversed on the ground that the court below laid too much stress on the testimony of the plaintiff, and too little on the testimony of the defendant, where the court expressly told the jury that he did not pretend to state the testimony of the witnesses with any degree of fullness, and did not deem it necessary, as counsel for both parties had done so in their arguments, and especially where the court had affirmed all of the defendant\u2019s points except the one asking for binding instructions, and concluded his charge by directing the jury to take up and consider the testimony of all the witnesses, and where a consideration of the charge did not indicate that it was inadequate or unfair.\nArgued April 19, 1913.\nAppeal, No. 356, Jan. T., 1912, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Lancaster Co., Jan. T., 1911, No. 44, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Christian Gunzenhauser v.
