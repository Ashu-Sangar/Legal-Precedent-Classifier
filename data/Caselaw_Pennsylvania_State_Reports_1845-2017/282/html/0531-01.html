Robinson, all of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever name, nature or kind, and wheresoever <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>situate, absolutely and in fee simple, investing her with full power to transfer and convey the same or any part thereof.

We have very <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>recently had occasion to give consideration to this question of fees given and their alleged reduction to a less estate in Smith v. Bloomington Coal Co., <a href="/pa/282/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="282 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1088320" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0248-01">282 Pa. 248</a>. There, speaking through the Chief Justice, we said: “The guiding rule in such cases has been stated by us many times, the latest instance being in Deeter’s Est., <a href="/pa/280/0135-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="280 Pa. 135" data-case-ids="1084478" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0135-01">280 Pa. 135</a>, this court there saying at page 141, ‘Where the dominant purpose shown by a devise is to vest a fee, this estate cannot be stripped of its inherent attributes by subsequent words indicating an intent so to do. .......On the other hand.......in finding the controlling intention, all the words used by testator should be taken into account, and if the intent to restrict [in the sense of making a gift of less than a fee] is clearly the dominant one, it must be given effect.’ ” After referring to other cases, the opinion points out that in Long’s Est., <a href="/pa/270/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="270 Pa. 480" data-case-ids="1066009" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0480-01">270 Pa. 480</a>, 485-6, we said that after a testator had used words “sufficient to vest an absolute interest [he] must indicate a fairly clear intention to take away the estate previously given before a divestiture can be upheld.” In the opinion from which we are quoting, this further language most pertinent to the case at bar was used, “In considering the present will as a whole, we are not particularly aided by those parts which make bequests or devises to persons other than testator’s widow; however, when we read the portions dealing with the widow’s interest, we can sufficiently deduce from them that testator’s ‘dominant purpose’ was to give his......estate......absolutely and in fee to his wife, his secondary intent being to control her testamentary disposition of it.” We think the same situation again confronts us, that here testator’s “dominant purpose” was to give, his estate absolutely and in fee to his wife. He did so in so many words. Thereafter in undoubted precatory language he provided as to one-sixth of what “she shall not have transferred or conveyed and may still own and hold title to at the time of her death” that it shall “go to......such religious associations, etc., as shall be proportioned and designated by [his] said wife <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>by will.” The medium of its “going” was the will of his widow. At to the other five-sixths, it also was “to go” to his father and mother for life with remainder to his sisters. But what was to be the method of its “going”? The testator had already sent it to his wife absolutely and in fee, and in the light of this disposition and of the fact that the wife’s will was to be the medium for the passing of one-sixth of the remainder, we think it cannot be said with certainty, considering the collocation of the words in the paragraph, that the five-sixths was not also “to go” to the father, mother and sisters in the same way. That the wife’s will was to make this disposition finds some support in the statement by the testator of his “perfect trust” in her. Once it be assumed that there is doubt as to just how the ultimate vesting of the five-sixths interest in the property at the widow’s death was to be accomplished, whether by her will or that of her husband, and we think there is this doubt, then there is not such a clear intent as would strike down the manifested “dominant purpose” of the testator to vest in his wife the estate which he declared should vest in- her, one absolute and in fee simple. The testator by the language he used authorizing his wife to “transfer and convey” the property which he had devised to her absolutely, necessarily knew that she could put it beyond the reach of any power over it which he might seek to exercise; this circumstance is an added factor aiding the conclusion that what he had in mind was a suggested or precatory control which his “perfect trust” in her led him to believe she would carry out. Then, again, he refers to the property in question as that which his widow might “still own”; in other words, as her property and not as his estate.</p>
