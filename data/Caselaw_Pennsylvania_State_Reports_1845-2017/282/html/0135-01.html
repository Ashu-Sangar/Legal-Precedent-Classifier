To effect his purposes, defendant induced plaintiff to execute two writings, in which the former agreed to convey to the latter a strip of land, adjoining her lot on the north, 5% inches in width, commencing at a point 30 feet in the rear of the front building line of their two properties and running 33 feet westwardly to the rear line of plaintiff’s premises; he also agreed to make certain alterations to plaintiff’s house, namely, to change the location of some doors, windows, drain pipes, and <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>a rain conductor.

      <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>Appellant points to the fact of the execution and recording of the last-mentioned deed, from himself and wife to appellee, as sufficient evidence to show a good consideration; but the court below found that this deed was never delivered to plaintiff. While the execution and recording of a deed is prima facie evidence of delivery, such presumption may be rebutted, and, under the peculiar facts of this case, appellant could not, by executing and recording the deed after the date of notice of rescission from appellee, make such acts equivalent to delivery, in order to show a consideration for the transaction. The evidence is uncontradicted that no deed was ever delivered or tendered to the appellee by the appellant; in fact, the deed in question was offered in evidence by appellant, which indicates it was at all times in his possession. The recording acts are intended for the protection of the grantee, not the grantor, and, in an action of this character, the former may contend that execution and recording were not conclusive of delivery. We have said that, “So long as a deed is within the control of the grantor, [presumptively] there is no delivery”: Sears v. Scranton Trust Co., <a href="/pa/228/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="228 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="969823" data-case-paths="/pa/228/0126-01">228 Pa. 126</a>, 141; see also, Kanawell v.

Where one undertakes to prove a deed, depending on it “as a valid instrument,” and the delivery is denied by substantial evidence, the appellant is under “the necessity of proving more than mere record”: Boardman v.

True, during the examination here of a witness for defendant, the latter’s counsel put the question, “There is another deed, Mr. and Mrs. Queeney to Mrs. Rosina Piper; there is no dispute about that?” and counsel for plaintiff remarked, “No.” But we cannot attach controlling significance to this incident, much less treat it as relieving <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>defendant from the necessity of proving delivery of such deed, since he depended on it to show a consideration moving to plaintiff. From all that appears, plaintiff’s attorney, by his remark, may have meant nothing more than “No, there is no dispute about the existence of such a document.”</p>

Under these circumstances a tender of reconveyance was not a prerequisite to the enforcing of plaintiff’s rights in equity: see Babcock v. Case, <a href="/pa/61/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="61 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="428547" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0427-01">61 Pa. 427</a>, 431, for the controlling principle. Furthermore, counsel for appellee offered at the bar of this court to have his client execute such reconveyance (to remove the blight which defendant, by recording the deed, had placed on his own title) if judicially ordered to do so, and, in view of this offer, the decree appealed from may be modified to direct the execution and delivery of a quitclaim deed by plaintiff to defendant, which is all that is required of her; but, at the same time, it may be that defendant’s garage wall, so far as it encroaches on plaintiff’s lot, should be ordered down, this direction also having been omitted from the decree as formulated by the court below, that tribunal, for some reason, taking the view that the fact of the encroachment, though proved, was “irrelevant,” in the sense of immaterial. This view, expressed in the court’s answer to one of plaintiff’s requests for a finding of fact, may have been due to the failure of plaintiff to incorporate in her bill a distinct prayer for relief against the' effects of the encroachment; but, even in the absence of this prayer (which may be supplied by amendment when the record is returned to the court below, if plaintiff wishes such relief), the fact of the encroachment had a certain materiality in connection with the point of fail<a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>ure of consideration pleaded by plaintiff, as suggested in the next paragraph. Moreover, it was the -duty of the chancellor to answer plaintiff’s request for a finding of fact as to the encroachment, leaving the question of materiality to us, after expressing his view thereon, instead of declining the request as “irrelevant”: Palmer Water Co. v. Lehighton W. S. Co., <a href="/pa/278/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="278 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1080517" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0298-01">278 Pa. 298</a>.</p>
    <p id="b169-5" data-blocks='[["BL_169.5",169,[183,731,1154,919]]]'>At this point it may be well to note that “where one intrudes upon the land of another [by unlawfully building thereon] the latter has the choice of remedies; he may compel a withdrawal of the intruder or he may regard the intrusion as a permanent trespass and recover compensatory damage therefor. Except he has forfeited his right to the former remedy by conduct which would make its enforcement inequitable, he cannot be denied the privilege to pursue it”: Baugh v. Bergdoll, <a href="/pa/227/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="227 Pa. 420" data-case-ids="1008616" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0420-01">227 Pa. 420</a>, 423. Perhaps, considering the absence of specific protest against the instant encroachment, plaintiff’s failure to ask in her bill for the removal of the wall, and in view of her prayer for damages alone, the court below will feel that mandatory injunctive relief should be denied to her at the present time; but, before forming any opinion on this point, we prefer to have it passed on by that tribunal.</p>

Appellant received from the appellee a piece of land 3 feet in width and 30 feet in depth, in consideration for which he was to convey to appellee a strip 5% inches in width and 33 feet deep, of no apparent value to her; immediately on the execution and recording of the deed to him, he proceeded to build,.not only on the 3 feet of land but also on and beyond the 514-ineh strip which was to go to appellee, thereby exercising privileges in the latter entirely inconsistent with her supposed ownership of it, and also unlawfully encroaching on her original lot. Under the circumstances, appellant cannot properly claim that he used the strip in question simply for party-<a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>wall purposes. While it is true that every property-owner in Philadelphia has the statutory right to make a party wall between himself and his neighbor, and may enter on the adjoining land for that purpose, he cannot go beyond the prescribed limits (Western Nat. Bank’s App., <a href="/pa/102/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="102 Pa. 171" data-case-ids="502686" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0171-01">102 Pa. 171</a>, 183); if he does so, or otherwise fails to conform strictly to the rules governing that class of walls, he is a trespasser (Vollmer’s App., <a href="/pa/61/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="61 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="428610" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0118-01">61 Pa. 118</a>, 128; Baugh v.

Morgan, <a href="/pa/218/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="218 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="999518" data-case-paths="/pa/218/0178-01">218 Pa. 178</a>, 183), the wall cannot be looked upon for any purpose. Here, under the evidence, the wall was not a party wall, so the land it occupied must be considered as having been appropriated by defendant to his own use contemporaneously with the recording of the deed to plaintiff, thus depriving the 5%-inch strip of all value to the latter and relieving her of any obligation which might have existed to accept delivery of a deed therefor; hence the failure of consideration represented by the above-mentioned abortive conveyance and plaintiff’s right to rescind, as she did, the unexecuted bargain between her and defendant.</p>

However that may be, we agree with the chancellor, as already indicated, that the consideration relied on by appellant to support the contracts and deed through which he claims, failed prior to the consummation of the mutual transfer of properties provided for in these contracts; and this failure being due to the fault of defendant, no error was <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>committed in decreeing cancellation of the documents in controversy.</p>

    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[194,834,1155,1136]]]'>Rule 44 of this court provides: “When on the trial or hearing in the court below there is offered in evidence a draft or plan which would be of assistance to this court, to enable it to understand readily the dispute between the parties, a copy thereof must be attached to appellant’s brief, or handed up therewith, folded of the same size as the brief. If one was not offered in evidence, but would be of assistance here in the way stated, a simple draft, plan or sketch, made by or for appellant, folded of the size specified, must be attached to or handed up with the brief, marked so as to show it was not part of the evidence.
