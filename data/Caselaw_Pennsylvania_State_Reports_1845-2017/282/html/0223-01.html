    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.6",248,[273,384,1150,480]]]'>Plaintiff filed a mechanic’s lien on defendant’s property. The premises were later sold by the sheriff. Following the sheriff’s sale, appellant, who was a judgment creditor of defendant and who had intervened, moved to have plaintiff’s lien stricken off. The rule was discharged and this appeal followed. After the appeal was taken, but before it was filed in the lower court, the plaintiff-appellee induced the sheriff to pay him the amount of his claim, and he marked the lien satisfied.</p>

    <p id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.8",248,[322,1368,479,43]]]'>The appeal is quashed.</p>
