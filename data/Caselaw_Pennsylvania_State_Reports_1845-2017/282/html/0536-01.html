An effort was made by claimant to show the debtor was unable to pay the debt. Insolvency, to be available to rebut the presumption, must continue during the whole period of the existence of the debt, and it must be shown with the force of a substantive fact: Sheafer v. Woodside, <a href="/pa/257/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="257 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1032383" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0276-01">257 Pa. 276</a>, 283; Griffith’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=14%20W.N.C.%20486" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="14 W.N.C. 486">14 W.

Prior to this time he was conducting a business, and, while thus engaged, was not insolvent. Here, then, is a break in the chain of proof claimant cannot close; during this time the debt might have been paid and there is nothing to show it was not. From the time of the sheriff’s sale until 1919 he was wholly without means, except small earnings and these were scarcely sufficient to keep him, his wife and daughter. His sister died during the last named year, and the debtor became her sole distributee. He received various sums of money, in all about $2,500, from the estate in addition to the ownership of an undivided half interest in a tract of land; the distribution of the proceeds of its sale is the cause of the present contest.
