      <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>We are of opinion that, without regard to whether testator’s widow took a fee or only a life estate, on her death the fee passed to her two daughters, the plaintiffs, either as the sole heirs of their mother or as devisees under their father’s will; for, as we read the will, the fifth item thereof means, if testator’s widow survived him and plaintiffs should die before their mother, at the death of the latter, their several shares should go to their children as substituted devisees, or to the children of Mrs. Hoffeditz if her sister left no issue.

In a case like the present all persons ought to be made parties who, on the face of the will, have such a color or possibility of interest that the title to the property in controversy would not be marketable (in the sense of acceptable to ordinarily prudent purchasers) without their legal status first being judicially determined.

At argument in this court, however, leave was asked and granted to have the guardian of the minors appear by counsel. Since then counsel has appeared and filed a petition to intervene on behalf of Charles Walter, guardian ad litem, wherein he adopts, “as his argument on behalf of the minors,......the argument filed in behalf of the appellants”; this petition having been granted, the case is ripe for determination, but we take occasion to say, as a guide for the future, that the guardian should have appeared in the court below.</p>
