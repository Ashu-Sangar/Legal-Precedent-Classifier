It is proper, in a homicide case, for the Commonwealth to show the murdered man had in his possession, or had just received, a sum of money. As explanatory of the deceased’s movements on this particular morning, and to show opportunity for the conspirators to plan and commit the crime through their knowledge of his former acts, thus furnishing facts on which motive could be predicated, as well as to establish the time, place and circumstances of the crime, evidence as to custom or habit of the deceased to secure money from the bank on Friday and take it to the company offices to pay wages was competent. It shows a series of circumstances which enabled the conspirators to plan the robbery, and, in selecting Emgable as the one to be robbed, the time and place were mere matters of detail. Evidence as to custom or habit, having no direct relation to a crime, involving acts with which defendant has no connection, ordinarily is not admissible; but testimony showing motive, opportunity or circumstances enabling the culprits to later commit the crime is relevant.

This evidence established the fact that an agreement had been reached by those engaged in it, including this defendant, to hold up the paymaster, and for this purpose a gun was to be procured to frighten or to kill if necessary. This gun was subsequently bought and used. It was identified, as well as the place where and the person from whom purchased. Defendant, being tried alone, objected to statements detailing conversation had with the other defendants in his absence relative to the purchase and use of this gun. He admitted his part in the robbery, was in the car outside when the gun was purchased, having contributed five dollars for that purpose, and the gun was identified as the one which was used to kill Emgable. The conversations objected to concerned the purchase of the gun, sawing off a part of the barrel, the identification of the piece sawed off and the gun from which it was sawed. -</p>

The jury was entitled to have a complete picture of the crime, with all attending circumstances. Therefore, when the Commonwealth, in the course of its presentation brought into court for identification the other persons connected and associated with defendant, it was clearly within its right; the district attorney was not limited to merely placing the names of the other defendants on the record.</p>

Murder is usually committed, in the course of a robbery, to suppress evidence as well as to avoid danger. Though the forceable stealing technically may be complete, if the homicide is committed while the actor is engaged in one <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>of the elements incident to the crime, as, for illustration, an escape or flight, the killing is referable to the robbery: Com. v.

The indictment charged the crime was committed in Philadelphia County, so there is no doubt the court which tried the case had jurisdiction of such an offense and the venue was the correct one. There is no such lack of jurisdiction, as laid in the indictment, that constitutes an inherent defect which consent to trial could not cure (see Mills v. Com., <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20626" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="13 Pa. 626">13 Pa. 626</a>; Simmons v. Com., 5 Binney 617; Dougherty v.

In the absence of uncontradicted evidence to the contrary, the conviction is conclusive the crime was committed where it was charged to have been done in the indictment, for the verdict includes such a finding: Com. v. Dubnis, <a href="/pa/197/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="197 Pa. 542" data-case-ids="918642" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0542-01">197 Pa. 542</a>, 547; Com. v.

There is, therefore, no merit in appellant’s contention. Had it affirmatively appeared, either on the face of the indictment (Com. v. Kunzmann, <a href="/pa/41/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="41 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="479986" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0429-01">supra)</a> or after the evidence was in (Simmons v. Com., supra), that the crime had been committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court that tried it or that the court had no power to try a case such as the one for which defendant was indicted (Dougherty v. Com., supra) or to try it at the time in which it was tried (Mills v. Com., <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>supra), the question would be an entirely different one. But where the sole objection is that it does not affirmatively appear the crime was committed in the county in which the defendant is indicted and tried, the verdict of guilty cures such an omission and of its own force includes a finding to that effect. That is the rule laid down in Commonwealth v. Bubnis and Com. v. Kaiser, and it is founded in reason. As said in the latter case (p. 498), “This court recognizes, and always will fully recognize, the importance of preserving the technical rules of evidence and of legal procedure. They are the safeguards which the law has placed around the innocent, and the court will not be indulgent to a disregard of them or even to loose practice where it imperils substantial rights. But on the other hand such safeguards will not be allowed to be perverted into devices to defeat justice, and this court has set its face resolutely against trifling objections that raise no point of any real bearing on the fact of guilt or innocence......‘Subtile distinctions that mark no substantial differences, and that do not affect the merits of a controversy, unless it may be to obscure or defeat them, should not be allowed to thwart justice in the interests of disorder and crime.’ ” As there was in the Bubnis and Kaiser cases, there is here some evidence that the crime was committed in Philadelphia. The photographs showing the place, with the same aggregate combination of streets which were mentioned, would be most improbable in more than one city, and, moreover, it was shown that immediately after the crime was committed defendant and his companions crossed the Schuylkill River on Girard Avenue and that he then left them in West Philadelphia. This identifies Philadelphia as the scene of the crime, since there had not been sufficient time after the killing for them to get there from any other place, and the locus in quo is such the court could take judicial notice of its being in Philadelphia.</p>
