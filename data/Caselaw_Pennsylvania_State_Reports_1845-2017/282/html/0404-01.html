On the other hand, the defense was that the notice of June 24, 1919, was a notice of termination of all contracts as of September 24, 1919, including the tire division advertising, except that plaintiffs were to carry to conclusion the advertising that had been approved and already in process at that time; that any contract for advertising entered into by plaintiffs, or reservations made by them, for the year 1920, were made without authority; that it was the usual and customary practice in advertising business that reservations which had been made on account of the principal before the termination of the contract were to be transferred to the new agent selected by the principal to be completed by such new agency; that, as a matter of fact, defendant had placed its advertising business in the hands of a new agent who had proceeded to take over the work and entered into contracts with the publishers on his own account and on behalf of <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>defendant: that, since January 1, 1920, plaintiffs had not performed any work in connection with defendant’s advertising because the latter refused to permit plaintiffs to act with reference thereto: that; at all events, to be entitled to the full rate of compensation, it would have been necessary for plaintiffs, not only to place the advertising, but also to prepare and supervise the copy and submit the same to defendant for approval; furnish certain services agreed upon through the plaintiffs’ New York office; send copy to the publishers and keep check upon publications to see they were in accordance with the contract and properly inserted in the publication; claim rebates for failure to insert advertisements, and check up and pay bills and rebill them to defendant and keep proper accounts; none of which services were performed by plaintiffs in connection with the advertising for the year 1920.</p>
    <p id="b436-4" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[300,1263,1152,858]]]'>In regard to the question of time of cancellation of the contract relating to the tire division advertising, while the letter of June 24, 1919, was general in its terms and, standing alone, would indicate an intention to terminate all contracts between the parties, it was clearly not so construed by plaintiffs in their acknowledgment of June 27th, referring particularly to the footwear and clothing department, and defendant was thus informed of the construction placed upon the letter by plaintiffs and by it apparently acquiesced in. In addition to this there is oral testimony that defendant did not at the time have under consideration any change in the advertising contract for the tire division and the trial judge properly told the jury that this contract was left in force after the correspondence of June, 1919, up until the letter of December 15, 1919, was written.</p>

Tbe jury returned a verdict for tbe full amount of plaintiffs’ claim, and defendant now contends that tbe measure of damage given in event tbe jury found a mutual rescission of tbe contract was erroneous, and, since tbe verdict may have been based on this theory, there was reversible error in tbe charge.</p>
    <p id="b437-3" data-blocks='[["BL_437.4",437,[182,1414,1153,1019]],["BL_438.1",438,[302,333,1153,1243]]]'>Under tbe verdict as rendered by tbe jury, it is apparent they found there was a breach of contract by defendant and further that plaintiffs bad performed all tbe service they were obliged to render to entitle them to tbe full commissions stipulated in tbe contract. But assuming tbe jury may have concluded there was a cancellation by mutual consent, we find no cause for reversal in tbe measure of damage laid down by tbe trial judge. Under tbe documentary evidence the jury may have concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to full commissions under either view of tbe case, on tbe theory that they performed tbe full services required. Tbe contract merely bound them to “place tbe advertising” as ordered by defendant. While in a subsequent paragraph it provided that, in event of defendant desiring such service, they were also to “prepare advertisements, making engravings, electrotypes, and other cuts,” but for such work extra compensation was provided. Tbe written contract thus seems to indicate tbe commission <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>stipulated should be paid for the service of “placing” the advertising. This left the matter open for explanation by parol evidence. A witness for plaintiffs testified “the function of an advertising agent is primarily to place advertising, that is, reserving space for the publishers and arranging for the cost thereof.” Another witness testified that placing advertising meant “sending orders •to cover the space required to be used.” These definitions are not inconsistent with the written portions of the contract and would be sufficient to justify a finding that when plaintiffs arranged with the publishers for a reservation of space at certain times, and in certain quantities, they had placed the advertising within the meaning of the contract, and earned their commissions. While there is evidence that “placing” advertising included something more than merely making the reservations for space, and particularly required the preparation of the advertising,, checking of publications, billing to client, etc., this conflicting testimony merely raised a question for the jury. The whole subject was fairly and fully presented to the jury by the trial judge and under the facts we see no cause for reversal on this ground.</p>
    <p id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[301,1590,1153,804]],["BL_439.1",439,[196,389,1155,528]]]'>The foregoing discussion also disposes of the second question raised by defendant, to wit, whether a verdict for the full amount claimed was excessive and contrary to the evidence. Defendant contends there was additional service which plaintiffs were bound to furnish and that this service would have entailed expense and accordingly defendant was entitled to a deduction therefor and consequently a verdict for the full amount cannot be sustained. The trial judge left to the jury to determine what service, if any, the plaintiffs would have been required to perform to earn their full commission. While there were other services plaintiffs would have performed had the contract remained in force, there is also evidence that had plaintiffs continued with the work during the year their services would have resulted <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>in additional cost to defendant amounting to from $30,-000 to $50,000, for which plaintiffs would have been entitled as additional compensation. Under this evidence it appears that had plaintiffs been asked to perform further work, the provisions in the contract for additional extra charge would exceed the cost or expense necessarily resulting to them had they been permitted to complete all the work, and the jury could properly find that plaintiffs were entitled to the full amount of their claim.</p>
    <p id="b439-3" data-blocks='[["BL_439.4",439,[188,938,1160,1302]]]'>Defendant further complains of the action of the court in refusing to charge that the letter of December 15, 1919, should be given effect as equivalent to three months’ notice under the contract and that damages must be limited to a period not exceeding three months from December 15, 1919, that is, up to March 15, 1920. However, such instruction would have been erroneous if the jury could properly conclude from the evidence that plaintiffs had performed all the services required of them to earn the full commission on the advertising already placed before that date. As a matter of fact, the claim of plaintiffs is based on services rendered before January 1,1920, and consequently the failure of the court to limit the damages to March 15, 1920, is immaterial. The real question was whether plaintiffs had performed the service required of them to earn' their commission on the advertising placed for the future. There is evidence that advertising space was customarily reserved in the months of November and December for the following year and that a great deal of work is required preliminary to the reservation of space and that the necessity of placing the contracts early in the present case was urgent because of the proposed increase in advertising rates for the year 1920.</p>
    <p id="b439-4" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[187,2252,1153,208]],["BL_440.1",440,[303,336,1150,536]]]'>Defendant offered evidence to show it was customary in the advertising business for the agent, when a contract was cancelled, to turn over all matters to his successor without charge beyond the date of cancellation <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>of the agreement. The trial judge rejected evidence of this custom on the ground that it failed to show the required uniformity to establish a custom, but, on the contrary, whether the alleged custom prevailed, depended on the circumstances of each particular case. In addition to the reason thus given by the trial judge, it is apparent that the parties, by their contract and letters, had expressly provided for the event which occurred by recognizing the right of plaintiff to be paid for services performed.</p>
    <p id="b440-4" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[303,882,1151,1188]]]'>Defendant presented a point requesting the trial judge to charge “that the burden of proof was on plaintiff to show the entire cost of completion of the work for which they claimed commissions, as the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to show what net profits they would have made in completing the contract.” The refusal of this point is assigned for error. The claim of plaintiffs is not for loss of profits on the contract, but for commissions due them under the contract on the theory that the work was actually completed. It was not denied that they made reservations for advertising, as claimed by them, and they produced evidence to show they had fully completed all the service required of them. The jury found, as a fact, that such service was performed. If they perform the service they were entitled to their commission, regardless of the question of profits. If they did not perform in full, they were entitled to their commissions less what it would have cost them to complete performance, and the trial judge so instructed the jury. The affirmance of the point would have tended to confuse rather than enlighten the jury.</p>

    <p id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.7",440,[305,2300,1147,90]]]'>The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
