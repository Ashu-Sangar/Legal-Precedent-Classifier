In support of this contention, which we shall dispose of first, he takes the position that, “in the absence of some qualifying expression,” the word “child” in legislative enactments, as in legal parlance, generally means “only and exclusively a legitimate child” (citing Overseers v. Overseers, <a href="/pa/176/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="176 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="882196" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0116-01">176 Pa. 116</a>, 121, and other cases), and the present child, being illegitimate, does not come within the protection of the statute. He says, further, that the language employed in section 21 of the Wills Act “negatives the thought that an illegitimate child was in contemplation of the legislature,” because the provision in question uses the words “although such child or children be born after the death of their father,” contending that this wording shows the act was to apply only to legitimate children, for, “under both the common law and the statute law, an illegitimate child has no father.” We think it is quite clear, however, that reference to “their father,” in section 21 of the Wills Act, and in prior legislation of similar import (see Walker v. Hall, <a href="/pa/34/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="34 Pa. 483" data-case-ids="417963" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0483-01">34 Pa. 483</a>, for history of the earlier acts), was placed <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>there for the mere purpose of showing the lawmakers intended the provision for after-born children should apply to posthumous children; and, since in general contemplation children are never born after the death of their mother, the legislature evidently thought it unnecessary to mention such a contingency. The words “their father” cannot warrantably be given the significance which appellant claims for them; and in considering the contention that the word “child” always means one born in lawful wedlock and not an illegitimate, we must keep in mind the fact that at the time of the adoption of the Wills Act there was upon the statute books of Pennsylvania the Act of July 10, 1901, P. L. 639, which by section 1 provides in express terms that “illegitimate children shall take and be known by the name of their mother, and the common-law doctrine of nullius filius shall not apply as between the mother and her illegitimate child or children, but the mother and her heirs and her illegitimate child and its heirs shall...... enjoy all the rights and privileges, one to the other, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the said child or children had been born in lawful wedlock.” This section was not repealed by the Wills Act of 1917, and is still in force. Subsequent sections, namely 2, 3 and 4, though formally repealed, were incorporated in the Intestate Act of 1917 as sections 15a, 15b and 15c (P. L. 429, 439); of these, section 4 particularly states the intent of the legislature (see Com. v. Mackey, <a href="/pa/222/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="222 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="959477" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0613-01">222 Pa. 613</a>, 616) “to legitimate an illegitimate child as to its mother and her heirs,” and the effect of the act clearly was to place such a child, so far as its mother and her estate are concerned, in the position of a legitimate. All subsequent legislation, including the Wills Act of 1917, must be understood accordingly, and, there being no express or implied exclusion of illegitimate children from the benefits of the last mentioned statute, it must be construed, in the light of the Act of 1901, as though illegitimates were expressly included as entitled <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>to the benefits of section 21. Moreover, when reading cases involving the construction of wills and the rights of illegitimate children thereunder, decided prior to the Act of 1901, its absence at that time must be kept in mind.</p>
    <p id="AEN" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[292,610,1152,1509]]]'>Appellant’s attempt to place an illegitimate child in the same category with an adopted child so far as the application of section 21 of the Wills Act is concerned, and thereby to exclude the former from its protection (Boyd’s Est., <a href="/pa/270/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="270 Pa. 504" data-case-ids="1066082" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0504-01">270 Pa. 504</a>), lacks force, because the provision in question, in its reference to after-born children, applies to physical birth alone: see McCulloch’s App., <a href="/pa/113/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="113 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="457644" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0247-01">113 Pa. 247</a>, 255. An adoption was not considered in law as tantamount to physical birth (see Boyd’s Est., supra, 507), for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of section 21 of the Wills Act in that regard, until the recent Act of May 20,1921, P. L. 937, which amended the section in question by incorporating, after the phrase “child or children,” the words “either by birth or by adoption.” The prior legislation (Act of June 1, 1911, P. L. 539, and Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 580), giving certain rights of inheritance to adopted persons as if “born the lawful child of the adopting parents,” and “as fully as if......born a lawful child,” could not make an adopted child one physically born to the parent as contemplated by the language of section 21 of the Wills Act, and did not undertake to place it in that category for all purposes, as the Act of 1901 undertook to place illegitimate children of a deceased testatrix in the category of legitimates. The court below correctly determined that the illegitimacy of the child here involved did not deprive him of the protection of the Wills Act.</p>

The statute requires this construction, for it says, “When any person..... .shall make a last will......and afterwards shall......have a <em>child......not provided for in such </em>will......every such person, so far as shall regard the surviving...... child......born after the making of the will, shall be deemed and construed to die intestate.”</p>

The question here, however, is not whether a trust for the child could be proved by evidence outside the will; it is whether Alexander was provided for in the will; and, as to this, there can be no question but that he was not so provided for. On the contrary, the testamentary provision on which appellant relies, whereby the devise is made to him, excludes by its terms, as shown in the first paragraph of this opinion, all other persons, including Alexander, and he is not mentioned in any other part of the will.</p>

The court below properly so determined.</p>
