A cause of action accrues at the moment the party has a legal right to sue. The act speaks definitely, “all actions” shall be prosecuted within three years “from the time the cause of action accrues.” Are these words so “clear, strong and imperative” that no other meaning may be given than that they were intended to operate retroactively? The words “all actions,” comprehensive in meaning, are modified and controlled by the words which follow, — “from the time the cause of action accrues.” When treated in a strict grammatical sense, the words undoubtedly speak prospectively.</p>

If such view were sustained, our own statute of limitation would control, but in states without laws on the subject, the right would be unlimited, and there would be no uniformity of right affecting all persons subject to the act. The Transportation Act did not intend to leave existing rights in this condition. See Rankin v. Rinehart, <a href="/pa-super/66/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="66 Pa.

As the act did not <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>specify a time in the future when it was to be operative, it must be held to have become effective on all causes of action from the date of enactment, giving to causes already accrued the full period fixed by the act (three years), provided, however, they were not barred in less time by the state statute of limitation in effect at the time the cause accrued. As stated in Bowden v. P., W. &amp; B. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/196/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="196 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="916839" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0562-01">196 Pa. 562</a>, 565, “The limitation of so many years..... .from the date when the cause of action accrued is, with reference to causes of action already in being, understood to mean so......many years...... from the date of the enactment, thus putting all causes of action, already accrued and yet to accrue, upon the same footing, and giving the statute a prospective...... operation.” And in Sohn v. Waterson, <a href="/us/84/0596-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="84 U.S. 596" data-case-ids="62470" data-case-paths="/us/84/0596-01">supra,</a> the Supreme Court of the United States said (p. 600), “A third construction is that which was adopted by the court below in this case, and which we regard as much more sound than either of the others. It was substantially adopted by this court in the cases of Ross v. Duval, (<a href="/us/38/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="13 Pet. 45" data-case-ids="3338000" data-case-paths="/us/38/0045-01">13 Peters 45</a>, 62), and Lewis v.

In those cases certain statutes of limitation..... had originally excepted from their operation nonresidents of the state, but this exception had been after-wards <em>repealed; </em>and this court held that the nonresident parties had the full statutory time to bring their actions after the repealing acts were passed, although such actions may have accrued at an earlier period. ‘The question is,’ says C. J. Taney (speaking in the latter of the cases just cited), ‘from what time is this limitation to be calculated? Upon principle, it would seem to be clear that it must commence when the cause of action is first subjected to the operation of the statute, unless the legislature had otherwise provided.’ ” Reaffirmed in Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., supra, 200.</p>

Powder River Live Stock Co., <a href="/f/132/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="132 F. 434" data-case-ids="1895494" data-case-paths="/f/132/0434-01">132 Fed. 434</a>. In other words, though the legislature has fixed a time limit which it deems reasonable, appellant asks the court to hold that as to causes of action already accrued the time thus given is unreasonable in being too long, and, in determining what would be a reasonable time for this suit, the limits in the case just, cited are relied on. To follow appellant’s argument to its logical conclusion, each case would depend on its own particular facts; in some instances the court would determine as a question of law whether the time within the legislative-fixed time was reasonable or not, and in others a jury might decide.</p>
    <p id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.5",393,[193,1571,1151,690]]]'>Whether we consider the statute as acting prospectively only to causes of actions that may hereafter accrue, and apply the common law rule that a reasonable time after the enactment of the statute was allotted to this plaintiff to sue, and that would be the time fixed by the legislative body, or whether we consider the act in the light in which we have already held it to apply, that is, to all actions accrued and to accrue, the result is the same. But if we treat the act as wholly prospective, eliminating the common law rule as to accrued actions, then these actions are without limitation, save as controlled by local state statutes, and plaintiff’s suit is in time.</p>

All that these cases determined <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>was whether the statutory period fixed by the legislature was reasonable or unreasonable. “No one rule as to the length of time which will be deemed reasonable can be laid down for the government of all cases alike. Different circumstances will often require a different rule. What would be reasonable in one class of cases would be entirely unreasonable in another”: McGahey v. Virginia (In re Brown), <a href="/us/135/0662-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="135 U.S. 662" data-case-ids="3543740" data-case-paths="/us/135/0662-01">135 U. S. 662</a>, 701, 707. “The determination of that department [the legislative] should not be interfered with by the courts, unless the time allowed to bring suits upon existing causes of action is, in view of all the circumstances, so short as not to give parties affected by it a reasonable opportunity to protect their rights under the new law”: Wheeler v. Jackson, <a href="/us/137/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="137 U.S. 245" data-case-ids="3547295" data-case-paths="/us/137/0245-01">137 U. S. 245</a>, 256. But it does not follow that because periods of four, six and seven months have been held reasonable in certain cases, that a longer period (three years as fixed by the legislature) is unreasonable. Reasonableness covers a field not marked by sharply defined lines, upon one side or the other of which all specific times must fall. In statutes of limitations the legislative authority determines what the reasonable length of time should be, and the courts only intervene when the time fixed by that body is not sufficient to protect the rights of the parties. It has never been asked, except in the present case, to hold that the time given by the act is unreasonable because it gave too much time.</p>
