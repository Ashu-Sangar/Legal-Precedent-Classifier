It is but reasonble that a plaintiff should <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>not be permitted to withhold from the jury a fact vital to a proper understanding and determination of his case and one which he should disclose (Albrecht v.

A plaintiff is on the other hand entitled to present his case in orderly fashion according to his own plan and a defendant should not be allowed to upset his plan by cross-examination as to matters which, while relevant and helpful to defendant, would be apt, if introduced at that particular time, to confuse the minds of the jury. As to such matters defendant should be compelled to wait until he puts in his defense. On this point, as on others having to do with the range of cross-examination, much must be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge: Littieri v.

The cross-examination of a plaintiff who offers himself as a witness cannot be carried to an extent which would allow the defendant to put in a defense based upon facts of a character different from those which had been testified to in chief, for, as to such defense, he must wait until the plaintiff has rested, at which time he can call him as for cross-examination and question him as to any relevant fact (Malone v. Dougherty, <a href="/pa/79/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="79 Pa. 46" data-case-ids="438422" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0046-01">79 Pa. 46</a>, 51; Boyd v.

This provision of the law is a wise one and aids the administration of justice. The effect of holding that a plaintiff in a case such as this, — where the method of computing the damages is by comparison of the two factors, what the property was worth immediately before the appropriation and what it is worth immediately after and as affected by the taking, — cannot be asked the price he paid for the property in question but a short time before it was alleged to be damaged, would be to negative the statute and the long-established rule of law out of which it grew and to do away with this most salutary practice looking toward the establishment of facts which are within the knowledge of the parties immediately concerned.</p>

There it was held, where the plaintiff was seeking to recover damages from a municipality for personal injuries resulting from a fall on a sidewalk, that it was reversible error to refuse to permit cross-examination of him for the purpose of developing the fact that he had been guilty of contributory negligence. In that proceeding the plaintiff was required to make out a case clear of contributory negligence, here to show as the minuend of his problem of damages the value of his property before the appropriation. We said in that case, “on his direct examination he [plaintiff] could not withhold any evidence, tending to show that he had contributed to the accident by his own lack of care under the circumstances. Whatever, as to this, he failed to disclose, or was not developed on direct examination, it was the right of the defendant to elicit on cross-examination. He could keep nothing back within his own knowl<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>edge that barred his right to recover. If he did so, either voluntarily or by the failure of his counsel to develop it on direct examination, the defendant’s right was to call it forth on cross-examination, not as a matter of defense, but as a part of the plaintiff’s case, for the consideration of the court and jury, relieving the defendant from making any defense.” Plaintiff in the case in hand could not conceal a most material fact, possibly known only to him, what he had so recently paid for the property, and leave the jury in the dark as to this most important circumstance.</p>

We there said, quoting from an earlier case (Davis v. Penna. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/215/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="215 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="948274" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0581-01">215 Pa. 581</a>), “But after a witness has testified in chief......the largest latitude should be allowed on cross-examination......In fact, any and every pertinent question may be put to him on cross-examination which will enable the jury to place a fair estimate on his testimony as to the damages sustained by the plaintiff by the construction of the road through the latter’s premises.” In commenting upon the reason for the exclusion of testimony as to the price paid for other properties, the present Chief Justice, speaking for the court, pointed out (p. 116) : “The objection to the admission of testimony of particular sales is placed upon the theory that it would lead to the investigation of ‘collateral issues as numerous as the sales.’......It is plain that this does not apply to the admission of testimony concerning a single sale of the very property in controversy.” It was further said in that case (pp. 116, 117) : “If a claimant who has expressed an opinion on the value of his own property may be asked concerning sales of other properties in the neighborhood, for the <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>purpose of testing his good faith, the question presents itself, why may he not be asked as to a sale of his own property, provided the sale in question is not too remote from the date of the appropriation. Surely in a case like the present where there is evidence showing prima facie a purchase price of $140,000, and the witness claims a value of $1,056,000, or an increase of over 650 per cent in two years and eight months, such an inquiry is relevant to test his ‘good faith/ if for no other reason, subject of course to his right to prove any relevant explanatory facts.” While it is true we there speak of “a claimant who has expressed an opinion on the value” it is not the fact that he has expressed such opinion which makes the cross-examination proper, as the decision points out, but that, the value of the property at the time of the purchase being one of the main factors in question, it is proper to probe him on the subject of the price he paid, because that price, not too remote from the time of taking, necessarily must be a prime subject for consideration in fixing the value of the property before the appropriation.</p>

While it is true this consideration included the other lot, plaintiff himself testified that it was worth $125,000, making the price which he actually paid for the property in question $1,762,500. We have very recently held in tax assessment cases, where the inquiry is almost precisely the same as in .cases such as the one we are considering, — the fair market value of the property at a given time, — that the sale price of the particular piece of real estate is to be taken into account by the taxing authorities in fixing the assessment: Kaemmerling’s App., <a href="/pa/282/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="282 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="1088359" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0078-01">282 Pa. 78</a>.</p>

In the case at bar the testimony elicited on cross-examination was as to a fact essential to plaintiff’s case, the value of the property before the appropriation, and was not as to a matter strictly of defense.

Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/257/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="257 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1032429" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0456-01">257 Pa. 456</a>; Pittsburgh &amp; Western R. R.

While it is true that the last phrase of the syllabus should more correctly read “without reference to the purpose for which it is being used” we have no doubt that the jury understood thoroughly the true rule in. view of the trial judge’s positive and clear statement thereof in connection with the affirmance of the actual point as presented. Altogether the jury was given to understand that the uses for which the property was to be valued were not to be limited to the one to which it was being put. Instead of limiting the consideration of the use being made of it, the instruction as amplified by the court opened the door to a consideration of any use to which the property might be put which would affect its value. This was plainly stated by the trial judge to the jury following his affirmance of the point.</p>

It is argued that rental value is an element to be considered in fixing market values. While it may be true that the ability to readily rent property at advantageous and profitable figures is an element entering into its market value and one that should be taken into account by witnesses in fixing that value, nevertheless it is somewhat difficult to see how an opinion as to the market value of office space per square foot in a building not yet erected can have any substantial relevancy to the market value, thereby meaning fair selling price, of the land. There necessarily would be so many factors to be taken into account in determining what the net avails would be to the owner from the rents that the result of any determination reached from testimony as to what the rentals might be would be speculative in the extreme. While it was said in Stone v. Delaware, Lackawanna &amp; Western R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/257/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="257 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="1032429" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0456-01">257 Pa. 456</a>, 463, that “the rental value might be a proper element to consider in forming an opinion of the market value of the <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>property under certain conditions,” it will be noted that testimony as to rental value was not admitted in that case. Inquiry in the pending case, however, was not as to what net income would be derived from the building, but, so far at least as one of the witnesses was concerned, the query was “what would be the value of office space in a modern steel and stone constructed building of, say, twenty-stories in height; placed on that lot, — the average value of office space on the upper floors.” It is difficult to say what such an inquiry as this could elicit on the real question in the case, the value of the entire property, and, so far as the inquiry made of another witness is concerned as to “the market value of office space in office buildings in the general vicinity of 15th and Chest- ■ nut streets per square foot,” we are unable to see how any answer which might be made to this could aid the jury in determining the question they had to solve. So far as deciding upon the value of the land was concerned, the effect of gross rentals paid would be of no aid. Net rentals of an entire building might be of some assistance in determining its value from the income-producing standpoint, but to permit a witness to testify as to the market value of office space on the upper. floors of a building on the lot in question, yet to be occupied by tenants, or to the market value of office space of other buildings in the vicinity, would get the jury out into the wildest realms of speculation on the question of the market value of the property. In Lynn v. Dunmore Borough, <a href="/pa-super/80/0590-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="80 Pa. Super. 590" data-case-ids="653464" data-case-paths="/pa-super/80/0590-01">80 Pa. Superior Ct. 590</a>, 593, it was said that the plaintiff could testify as to the rental actually received from the occupants of her property. We are not prepared to say that such testimony is receivable under all circumstances in such a proceeding as this; but, however that may be, the attempt here was not to ■ show rentals received, but the opinions of witnesses as to what they might be in a building such as appellant contemplated erecting.</p>

It is difficult to understand how this could be when the instructions were that the jury should consider only the special advantages, if any, to the plaintiff from the improvement. The affirmance of the point was proper, as the jury was entitled to take into account that there had been a general improvement of the entire street, not merely a widening in front of the plaintiff’s property. This instruction did not give them a license to assess general benefits and advantage to the property in question, as its language expressly negatives the consideration of such general benefits and advantage. Speaking of a somewhat similar situation in Robbins v. Scranton, <a href="/pa/217/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="217 Pa. 577" data-case-ids="953621" data-case-paths="/pa/217/0577-01">217 Pa. 577</a>, at page 584, we said: “When the trial judge excluded the testimony in regard to the widening and grading of Schnell Street, he prevented the jury from considering the situation as it actually existed when the whole scheme of improvements at that point was completed by the city.” We think no adequate or just comprehension of the effect of the improvement on plaintiffs’ property could be arrived at unless account was taken of the fact that Chestnut Street, the main business street of the city for its entire length, between the two rivers, was to be widened.</p>
