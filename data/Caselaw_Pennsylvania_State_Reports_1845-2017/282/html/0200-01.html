To determine whether this case falls within the exceptional class, it is necessary to consider the injuries sustained. Plaintiffs’ car had momentarily halted when it was struck by defendant’s truck with such violence as to crush the side of the car and damage it to the extent of $200 and to throw the wife plaintiff to the floor of the car, inflicting a number of external wounds and bruises, one cut upon the head requiring surgical aid. She was about three months advanced in pregnancy and sustained such internal injuries as caused a miscarriage the same night, which confined her in bed for four weeks; during which time and as a result of the miscarriage an operation known as a curettement was performed upon her. She recovered and is in fairly good health, except at times nervous <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>and hysterical. The miscarriage resulted in a displacement of her uterus, so as to prevent conception. This condition can probably, but not certainly, be corrected by such a surgical operation as would keep the patient in bed for two weeks and more or less disabled for two or three months. Mrs. Potts was about 35 years old when injured and the trial judge instructed the jury that the loss of child-bearing power was an element of damage proper for their consideration. An injured party should take reasonable steps to reduce the damages; if that may be done by a simple and safe surgical operation, a refusal to submit thereto should be considered by the jury in mitigation of damages (Leitzell v. Del., L. &amp; W. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/232/0475-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="232 Pa. 475" data-case-ids="977873" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0475-01">232 Pa. 475</a>); but that is not true where the suggested operation is serious and attended with grave danger: Martin v.

That the loss of fecundity is a proper element of damage in a personal injury case is undoubted (Brown et al. v. Quaker City Cab Co., <a href="/pa/274/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="274 Pa. 289" data-case-ids="1072959" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0289-01">274 Pa. 289</a>; Alabama, etc., R. R.

Many of them would seem to embody the element of punishment in addition to compensation. The trial judge is as much a part of the tribunal created by the law to administer justice as is the jury and in cases of this kind he should be alert to see that sound judgment backs the finding of damages rather than feeling or prejudice. ■ If he fails to bring wise judgment to the determination of this most important question, the court in banc should strike down awards which are more than fairly compensatory. Being of opinion that the findings for both husband and wife in this case were much in excess of what they are fairly entitled to, I dissent from the affirmance of the judgments.</p>
