    <p id="b485-3" data-blocks='[["BL_485.6",485,[174,417,1151,199]]]'>This ease presents some rather unusual features, and, to understand the legal problems involved, it will be necessary to detail at length many of the circumstances connected with the crime.</p>
    <p id="b485-4" data-blocks='[["BL_485.7",485,[170,636,1155,1358]]]'>The defendant, a married man, a short time before the date of the shooting, purchased a restaurant, located on the second floor of a building in Kittanning, Pennsylvania. The dining room occupied the entire front, and in the rear was the kitchen and another room used as a parlor or bedroom. Defendant, during these three weeks, had in his employ a waitress, Elsie Huybreeht, eighteen years old. An intimate relation developed, and, on at least two occasions, they, with others,. attended night parties until late hours. The last one took place the evening before the tragedy. They left it after midnight, and took a taxi for a short drive in the country. On their return they went to the parlor or bedroom for the remainder of the night. At nine o’clock the following morning, defendant was aroused to admit his chef, who went into the kitchen. Gardner returned to the room, where he was again alone with the girl. Soon thereafter shots were heard coming from this room, first one, then, after a very short interval, two others in rapid succession. The sounds alarmed the chef and a tenant on the first floor; on hearing cries for help, they rushed to the bedroom. The door was locked; on being broken open, they* beheld the girl, dressed in an underslip, staggering toward them. She was shot through the body, but entirely conscious.</p>
    <p id="b485-5" data-blocks='[["BL_485.8",485,[169,2006,1151,426]],["BL_486.1",486,[322,341,1148,149]]]'>Defendant, unconscious, shot in the right side of the head, in the region of the temple, was lying flat on a davenport, used as a bed. The right side of his head was buried in a pillow, his right arm extended downward close to the body, the left hanging over the edge of the bed. His body was covered from hips to shoulders. A revolver was found under some clothing about nine inches from his right hand. No powder marks were on <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>his face, though powder marks were on the slip of the girl, and there were powder burns around the wound made by the bullet where it entered her stomach.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[319,503,1152,373]]]'>poth were removed to a hospital; the girl, after an operation, died the next morning; the removal of part of defendant’s skull brought consciousness and life to him. Because of a remark made by the girl when the two men broke into the room, the defendant was arrested and tried for murder. The defense was that the girl did the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[319,888,1152,742]]]'>The ease is appealed on allegations of trial errors, and insufficient evidence to convict on any count. When the chef and the first-floor tenant broke into the room it was impossible to determine from physical objects who was responsible for the shooting, though appellant argues that because of defendant’s position on the bed it was not possible for him to have done the shooting, for the reason that the wound instantly produced unconsciousness, making it impossible for him to have assumed the position in bed as described. This contention in part overlooks the fact that he might have shot the girl while in bed, afterwards shooting himself, though the absence of powder marks on his face is of deep significance.</p>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.7",486,[318,1651,1149,424]]]'>The men who responded to the call for help appeared within three minutes after the outcry; without any suggestion from them, while staggering toward them, clearly conscious, she said, “Help me; Mr. Gardner shot me and himself.” This statement was admitted as part of the res gestae; defendant contends this was error, and also that nowhere was the corpus delicti proven. Thus two principal questions are presented.</p>

Defendant contends that the crime for which he is charged was not committed.</p>
    <p id="b487-3" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[196,592,1156,1195]]]'>To avoid the injustice of a conviction where no crime exists, the law has adopted a rule of caution which holds that the corpus delicti must be proven before a conviction can stand. This is emphasized where the state’s case depends on a confession by defendant. The fact that a crime has been committed by someone must be shown before the confession will be received: Gray v. Com., <a href="/pa/101/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="101 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="500855" data-case-paths="/pa/101/0380-01">101 Pa. 380</a>; Com. v.

The person for whose death a prosecution is instituted may be alive, so evidence that he or she is in fact dead is imperative. As death may have resulted from a cause other than a felonious act, there must be evidence that it occurred under circumstances which point to the commission of a crime. In this manner the corpus delicti is shown. In some states the term corpus delicti includes only the first of the above elements, namely, an injury or loss. But in this and most of the states it covers in addition criminal agency causing the injury or loss: 4 Wigmore, Evidence, 2d ed., sec. 2072, pp. 410, 412; Grant v.

I wish I had killed him.” Another patient heard her repeat that statement, and also heard her say to her mother when asked if defendant was in the hospital, “Yes, he is, he is shot twice, He is shot twice in the head.” Elsie lived with another, girl in a rented room. Between four and five o’clock on Sunday afternoon, the day before the shooting, she came to the room, broke open a savings bank, took from it about thirty dimes, saying to this roommate that she was going to pay her room rent. Her companion remonstrated, telling her the room rent was not due, and in<a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>quired if she was going to leave. She said, “No, I am going to die.” She also told a witness with whom she was acquainted and who was eating in the restaurant the Saturday before the shooting, that she was feeling very blue, and that she didn’t care if she lived or died. And we have the further statement, said to have been made, that if she couldn’t.have the defendant (whom she knew to be married), nobody else was going to have him. Keeping in view these facts, the Commonwealth relied for conviction solely on deceased’s statements, without regard to her counterstatements and conduct in opposition thereto. The court, charging the jury, not only instructed them that if the jury believed these statements were made with the knowledge of impending death they were entitled to the same weight as though given under the sanctity of an oath, but utterly destroyed the usefulness of her counterstatements and conduct. We have not held that dying declarations should be received in evidence as though made under the sanctity of an oath. We said, in Com. v.

Mulferno, <a href="/pa/265/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="265 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1051916" data-case-paths="/pa/265/0247-01">265 Pa. 247</a>, 249, “Dying declarations possess an impressiveness which is sometimes out of all proportion to their evidentiary value and the court and jury may sometimes have their better judgment overridden by the admission of such statements ; having the effect of sweeping away their impartial attitude, and substituting for it the emotional element, as presented by the picture depicted by the dying man; and, it is on this account, courts have imposed a certain strictness on the admission of these declara<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>tions.” And it may well be added that there are cases where it would be necessary for the judge to caution the jury in this light concerning a statement that had been admitted as a dying declaration.</p>
