    <p id="b385-4" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[190,564,1154,1248]]]'>Plaintiff, a sister of the principal defendant’s deceased first husband, filed a bill in equity praying for an injunction to restrain the removal of the latter’s remains from the cemetery lot of his mother (also now deceased), where they had lain for some twenty-eight years. It appears that the deceased husband was buried at the place in question with the consent of defendant and that she subsequently erected a tombstone over his grave; at those times, defendant believed, from conversations had with the then owner of the lot, that either she would be made owner of the quarter where the grave was located, or she would be granted the right of burial there beside her late husband; subsequently, however, when defendant had married again (her second husband, also, has since died), the owner of the lot sent written notice that she would neither convey nor sell to defendant any portion of the premises, nor permit her to be buried there. After this, defendant purchased a lot in the same cemetery and asked permission to remove the body thereto. The cemetery company promised to grant the request; whereupon the present bill was filed to restrain such removal. The court below dismissed the bill and plaintiff has appealed.</p>
