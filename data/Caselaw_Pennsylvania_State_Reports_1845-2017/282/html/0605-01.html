He caused some red lights to be placed in certain parts of it, a red flag, and signs warning that the street was under repair and closed. It was dark at the time of the accident. Plaintiff’s evidence indicates that defendant did not block off the entire street, but that one side of it was open for travel, that the warnings so indicated, and that the open part of the street was used by others to go to a gasoline filling station. The warning signs, so it was testified, were torn and not easily seen and no light was hung on the obstructing rope, which further along was stretched across the entire street. Under this state of facts, we cannot say plaintiff’s decedent was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law in proceeding along that part of the highway which was apparently open to public travel.
