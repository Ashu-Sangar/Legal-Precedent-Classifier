If the decree of the court below is sustained, the widow will receive much more from the estate of the father than her husband directed she should have, under the power of appointment vested in him.

The only possible answer is “interests in the real and personal estate of the deceased spouse,” for otherwise there is nothing to which “interests” can apply. It follows that the stipulation “as he or she would have been entitled to had the testator died intestate,” qualifies the entire preceding clause, and not merely a part of it, and this accords with our conclusion when construing earlier cognate statutes containing similar provisions.</p>

This is no slight consideration in itself; for if we assume that a doubt exists as -to the meaning of the act (although we do not find one),- the rule applies that “The true way to arrive at a sound construction of a doubtful statute, is to consider the old law, the mischief, the remedy, and the true reason of the remedy; and ...... the safest way is to interpret statutes as near as may be to the common law, and by the course it observed in cases of its own, before the act”: Com. v. Burrell, <a href="/pa/7/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="7 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="957770" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0034-01">7 Pa. 34</a>.</p>

By section 1 of the Act of May 4, 1855, P. L. 430, it is provided that “any surviving husband may, against her [his wife’s] will, elect to take such share and interest in her real and personal estate as she can, when surviving, elect to take against his will in his estates, or otherwise to take only her real estate as tenant by the curtesy.” The words “such share and interest in her real and personal estate,” so far as <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>they there affect a husband, are precisely the same as “such interests in the real and personal estate of the deceased spouse,” in the section of the Wills Act now under consideration. What was meant by the above-quoted language of the former statute, was decided in Huddy’s Est., <a href="/pa/236/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="236 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="986708" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0276-01">236 Pa. 276</a>, 282, where we said: “The Act of May 4,1855, P. L. 430, section 1, provides that a surviving husband may elect to take against his deceased wife’s will ‘such share and interest in her real and personal estate as she can, when surviving, elect to take against his will in his estate.’ Such an election, affects the distribution of the ‘real and personal estate’ of the deceased wife, the husband taking his share of her property as though there was no will; but it in nowise affects the distribution of property thereby directly or.indirectly disposed of in the exercise of a power of appointment, for such property is not and never was the ‘real and personal estate’ of the wife.” True, in that case there was no blending of testatrix’ own estate with the estate over which she had a power of appointment, but, in determining the meaning of the above language in the Act of 1855, as we were doing in that quotation, this is a matter of no moment. In Shoch’s Est. (No. 1), <a href="/pa/271/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="271 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="295706" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0158-01">271 Pa. 158</a>, 164, we reasserted the conclusion quoted. There also testator died before, but the rule stated was reannounced after the passage of the Act of 1917. With this meaning given to the words in the Act of 1855, the Act of 1917 was passed, and hence it must be presumed that the legislature intended the construction given by this court, in the case first cited, to aPPly to the same language in the Act of 1917: Hedrick v. Harrisburg, <a href="/pa/278/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="278 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1080627" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0274-01">278 Pa. 274</a>; Bingaman’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="281 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1087015" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0497-01">281 Pa. 497</a>.</p>

Happily no such <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>illogical conclusion was reached in either case. In neither of them was the Act of 1917 under consideration, nor were the prior statutes relating to a widow’s election; they both raised the question as to whether or not an inheritance tax was collectible, and, if so, at what rate. To determine this, the only statute construed was the Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521 (which was in effect when the powers of appointment were exercised in these two estates), and it charged the tax upon property “when the transfer is by will or by the intestate laws of this Commonwealth from any person dying seized or possessed of the property.” A construction of this statute is, of course, of no value in determining the question now before us; and hence it is of no consequence that, in each of those estates, the donee, in exercising a similar general power of appointment, did so in substantially the same way as in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[275,1313,1155,1085]],["BL_449.1",449,[189,360,1152,592]]]'>What we said in McCord’s Estate, which does have a bearing on the present issue, is that by the blending of the two estates, they became “as one estate, from which debts and legacies were payable.” This rule did not disturb the order of distribution specified in the will of the donee. On the contrary, it required his order of distribution to be carried out in every respect. In the instant case, however, appellee seeks to change it entirely, so far as concerns the one-third she desires to have as against those to whom it was appointed. True, we also said in that case that the “power of appointment by will being unlimited, she [Miss McCord] could transfer the trust fund to her own estate and did so in unmistakable language, making it a part thereof for all purposes”; that is, for all purposes of distribution under her will, not for purposes of distribution in antagonism thereto. If so much stress had not been laid by the court below on the words “for all purposes,” it probably would not have fallen into the error it did. “It is a maxim not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are <a id="p425" href="#p425" data-label="425" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*425</a>to be taken in connection with the ease in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, bnt ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision.” Thus wisely spoke the Supreme Court of the United States, in an opinion by Chief Justice Marshall, in Cohens v. Virginia, <a href="/us/19/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="6 Wheat. 264" data-case-ids="11730243" data-case-paths="/us/19/0264-01">6 Wheaton 264</a>, 399; and twice recently, in referring to that case, we have followed and approved this conclusion: O’Malley v.
