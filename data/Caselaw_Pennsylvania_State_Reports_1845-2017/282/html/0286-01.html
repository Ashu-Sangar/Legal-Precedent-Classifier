    <p id="b312-9" data-blocks='[["BL_312.15",312,[284,1364,1151,534]]]'>On February 5,1923, a servant of defendant delivered a load of coal at 26 South Seventh Street, Philadelphia, by shooting it down a coal hole in the sidewalk. Immediately thereafter, plaintiff, while passing along this walk, stepped on the lid over the coal hole, which tilted causing her to fall and sustain serious injury. This suit by her based on the averment that the accident resulted from the negligent manner in which defendant’s servant replaced the lid in question, resulted in a verdict and judgment in her favor and defendant has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b312-10" data-blocks='[["BL_312.16",312,[284,1909,1150,478]],["BL_313.1",313,[181,356,1151,919]]]'>The lid was round in shape, twelve inches in diameter, and when in place was flush with the walk, rested on a ledge or shoulder three-eighths of an inch wide and could not be moved by stepping upon it, although not fastened underneath. It had been in the same position for some years and has since so remained. The evidence warranted a finding that the movement of the lid resulted from its improper replacement, caused by leaving particles of fine coal and coal , dust in the flange, thereby <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>keeping the lid from its normal position. The accident happened in less than one minute after defendant’s servant had left the place, and the evidence of his failure to safely replace the lid, which he had removed, justified the jury’s finding that defendant was negligent. See Powell v. Wilhelm, <a href="/pa-super/49/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="49 Pa. Super. 268" data-case-ids="425759" data-case-paths="/pa-super/49/0268-01">49 Pa. Superior Ct. 268</a>. It appearing that the lid was firm when in place, both before and after the accident, the fact that it tilted on this occasion is a circumstance corroborating the evidence that it had not been properly replaced. See Strohm v. Haverstick, <a href="/pa-super/44/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="44 Pa. Super. 166" data-case-ids="417845" data-case-paths="/pa-super/44/0166-01">44 Pa.

Following the accident she ceased keeping boarders and her daughter left her usual employment, where she earned $107 a month, and for five months cared for the mother. Since which timé a servant has been employed and must be in the future, at an expense including her board, of about $16 a week, to look after plaintiff and do the work which, but for the accident, the latter could have done.
