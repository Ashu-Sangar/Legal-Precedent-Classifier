As applied to tbe valuation of real estate in a proceeding like tbe one at bar, if tbe evidence shows recent bona fide sales of tbe tracts under consideration, or of tracts similarly situated in tbe neighborhood and <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>of like quality, the general selling price thus established would be the market value within the meaning of the law, that is, if all the conditions are the same...... If, however, there have been no recent sales of the lands under consideration, or of other lands of like quality similarly situated, or no general asking or selling price in the neighborhood is shown, an assessor must of necessity use his best judgment in determining what he believes the land would sell for at a bona fide sale after due notice......[In such case] the market value may be established by the testimony of persons acquainted with the property, and whose knowledge and experience qualify them to form an intelligent judgment as to its proper valuation”: P. &amp; R.

The court below proceeded on the theory, stated both at the trial and in the opinion filed, that actual sales of coal in Schuylkill County were so few in number as to form no basis for an opinion of the market value of the land in dispute, and therefore held the witnesses produced to give estimates as to its worth could not express their opinions. Those called were mining engineers, acquainted with the property, the vein of coal upon it, and the surrounding workings. Such testimony was the best available (P. &amp; R. C. &amp; I. Co. v. Northumberland Co. Comrs., supra, p. 468), and should have been received. Two of the three rejected, Lewis and Auman, knew of the sale of one tract similarly situated, and carrying the <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>same vein of coal, though located some miles distant, and a third, Dolan, was acquainted with the general selling price of coal lands in this field. All were properly qualified as to experience and knowledge of the property in question, and the refusal to permit them to give their views as to its value was error, which requires a reversal.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[301,648,1155,1679]],["BL_101.1",101,[171,349,1153,97]]]'>The Williamson tract had been upon the market for many years, and several options were given to prospective purchasers at the price of $55,000. On two occasions it had been put up at public sale after due advertisement, with the statement that the land would be transferred to any one bidding this amount. Testimony to prove these facts was rejected by the court below, and complaint is made of these rulings. Ordinarily, offers to buy or sell property are objectionable as evidence of actual worth, since the receipt of such proof would lead to collateral inquiries as to the circumstances under which the tenders were made. Examination as to such facts has been held, however, to be proper to show that a value testified to by a plaintiff is excessive, in an action to recover damages for land taken (Rea v. Pittsburgh R. R. Co., supra, p. 119), and it has been said in a sister state that “the market price of a marketable commddity may be determined as well by offers to sell, made by dealers in the ordinary course of business, as by actual sales; and statements of dealers in answer to inquiries as to price are competent evidence”: Harrison v. Glover, <a href="/ny/72/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="72 N.Y. 451" data-case-ids="532865" data-case-paths="/ny/72/0451-01">72 N. Y. 451</a>. In the present case, the question to be solved was the determination of the amount which the land would bring at an honest sale. The efforts to dispose of it for $55,000, both privately and publicly, furnished some indication of its market value, upon which the tax assessment must necessarily be based. The holding price of other lands similarly situated may be the basis of an estimate of worth. With like reason that of the property in question should be taken into consideration. The evidence proposed should have been <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>received and weighed with the other facts in reaching a just conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b101-3" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[168,459,1154,1620]]]'>The eleventh assignment of error must also be sustained. Experts were called to the aid of the board of revision, and their estimates and calculations, as appears by the answer filed, were used as a basis in determining the valuation. At the hearing before it, the right to inquire as to the methods followed in making up the assessment was denied, on advice of counsel. When the trial was had before the common pleas, one of these experts, Monroe, was called by appellant as a witness, and asked to explain his manner of arriving at the result adopted by the board. Permission to so examine was refused on the ground that it was in effect a cross-examination to “attack his veracity,” and would tend to impeach the witness by the party calling him. With this conclusion we cannot agree. It was proper to elicit from the only one who knew, except his associate expert, the considerations which entered into the making up of the estimates. The fact that this might be followed by the testimony of other witnesses, contradicting the statements he might make, or the conclusions drawn therefrom, did not render the examination incompetent. “It is true, as a general rule, a party cannot be permitted to impeach the veracity of his own witness, yet he may disprove the facts to which his witness has testified”: P. R. R. Co. v. Fortney, <a href="/pa/90/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="90 Pa. 323" data-case-ids="1065634" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0323-01">90 Pa. 323</a>, 328. “The mere fact of calling a witness does not mean that the party thereby admits as true everything the witness may say, and he is not estopped from proving the facts to be otherwise by other evidence”: Henry on Trial Evidence, 434. The objection should have been overruled.</p>
