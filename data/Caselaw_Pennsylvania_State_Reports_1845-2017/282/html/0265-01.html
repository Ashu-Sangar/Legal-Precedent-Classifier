A pier is used in connection with the plant where the finished and unfinished material is handled, under the general supervision of defendant’s employees. Stevedores are obtained under contract with firms which make a business of supplying this character of labor, and the actual movements of material to and from the dock are carried on by them. On the day of the accident, which gave rise to the present litigation, Loveland &amp; Co. furnished, under agreement, men for this work, being paid the amount of the wages earned by their employees, plus ten per cent. One of the men sent upon the wharf by Kennedy, the acting foreman for Loveland &amp; Co., was the plaintiff, Mc-Grath. He was told to work upon the top of a large stack of bags filled with sugar, his duty being to put them in a swing which carried them forward, ultimately being loaded by others on a ship anchored in the river. While so engaged, plaintiff contended he was directed by Davey, an assistant foreman of the defendant, to change his position, and continue his labor on the floor, handling the sugar from the side of the stack. Soon after beginning work there, the bags became loosened and fell, causing him serious injury. An action to recover damages was brought, and a verdict for the plaintiff, reduced by the court to $14,000, was rendered. Prom the judgment entered thereon defendant has appealed.</p>

Defendant, a refiner of sugar, controlled the wharf where the raw product was received, and from which the manufactured material was removed, but had no part, at any time, in the actual handling of it on the pier, or loading and unloading in the river. This service was always performed by the employees of a stevedoring firm, in this case Loveland &amp; Company. The facts disclosed would not justify a finding that the labor performed was within the line of the “regular business” of the defendant, and hence did not come within the sections of the act above referred to. Nor is the situation altered by article I, section 105, which qualifies the previous provision in directing that the term “contractor,” as there used, shall not include one engaged in “an independent business, other than that of supplying laborers and assistants, in which he serves persons other than the employer in whose service the accident occurs.”</p>

Morton, <a href="/pa/275/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="275 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1075675" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0562-01">275 Pa. 562</a>; Swartz v.

Stewart Co., supra. There is no need to discuss the question of the admissibility of this agreement under the pleadings, as has been done by counsel in their briefs. It was offered, but we are not convinced that, even if properly received, it had <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>the effect insisted upon by defendant. The contract merely provided for the delivery of raw product to the sugar company, which latter was to manufacture, refine and hold, subject to the call of the purchaser. No obligation to assist in transportation to or from the vessel of Atkins &amp; Oo. was imposed. The actual stevedoring service cannot be said to have been furnished as the result of a subcontract. The first five assignments relate to the refusal of the learned court below to give binding instructions to the effect that McGrath’s claim against the sugar company, if any, was under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, or complain of the failure to submit this question to the jury. The relation of the parties, and the legal effect thereof, was, under the circumstances appearing, a matter for the court: Eckert v. Merchants Shipbuilding Corp., <a href="/pa/280/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="280 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1084474" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0340-01">280 Pa. 340</a>.

The court instructed the jury if it found there was proof of lack of due care in either respect, causing the accident, no contributory negligence appearing, a recovery could be had. In this we see no error. It is insisted that the direction given by Davey to the employees to work from the floor instead of the top, where they had been stationed by Loveland’s foreman, cannot impose responsibility on the defendant, since McGrath was under the control of his independent employer. It is well settled that the original contractor is liable for injury to an employee of the latter, where caused by the failure to keep the premises, when the work is to be performed, in proper condition (Newingham v. J. C. Blair Co., <a href="/pa/232/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="232 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="977863" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0511-01">232 Pa. 511</a>; Craig v.

This is also true where the harm is caused by the interference of the defendant, or his agents, with the manner of carrying out the work by the employees of the independent contractor, when it amounts to an assumption of control and direction of their labor: Pender v. Raggs, <a href="/pa/178/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="178 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="885517" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0337-01">178 Pa. 337</a>. If then the plaintiff was placed in the position of danger, resulting in injury, by the defendant company, or one acting for it, recovery may be had for the loss ensuing. He had been put on top of the pile by the foreman of the independent contractor, and was ordered therefrom by Davey, who was an assistant upon the pier, apparently in charge of operations there. The direction given to McGrath was in furtherance of the business of the sugar company, as it was desired to store new bags of raw sugar above. Davey’s act was consistent with a general supervision of the work on the dock, a duty which, some testimony showed, was performed by him. There was evidence from which the jury could find, in the absence of any to the contrary, that he had implied power to exercise such control as attempted, and in so doing acted within the scope of his authority: Guinney v. Hand, <a href="/pa/153/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="153 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="840264" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0404-01">153 Pa. 404</a>; Dunne v. P. R. R.

In confirmation of the contention that the employee had authority, the jury was permitted to consider a statement made after the accident by Haggerty,— a dock boss over Davey, but himself subject to a superintendent, — as an apparent admission of the latter’s power to control the operations. The former was not present when the sugar fell on the plaintiff, but came about two minutes later, from his office, some seventy or eighty feet <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>distant. McGrath had, in the meantime, been placed upon a bench, and sufficient time had elapsed for a bystander to go some distance to secure water and return. Upon being told that Davey had directed the men to come from the top of the stack, it is claimed he replied, with an oath: “He ought to have had better sense than to put a gang of men to work on the floor with a pile as high as that, to take down sugar.” The learned court inadvertently added, that he stated, “the men should go back to the top of the stack,” which might be some indication that the employees of the sugar company were exercising control over those of the independent contractor, the question in dispute, and for this reason objectionable. The jury was allowed to consider the declaration of Haggerty as showing Davey was acting within his authority, on behalf of the defendant, when he gave orders directing the employees of Loveland &amp; Go. The statement was not submitted as indicating negligence in giving improper orders, and could not have been considered for this purpose, as will be hereafter noticed, but only as showing the dominion of the assistant foreman. We are of the opinion that no such interpretation can be fairly drawn from the words used.</p>

Superior Ct. 83</a>), if acting within the line of his employment: 22 C. J. 377; 2 C. J. 942. It will be noticed here, that Haggerty was in charge of the dock, under a superintendent, and Davey was the assistant of the former. It may well be doubted whether any relation between declarant and the sugar company was established which would make binding his statements as to the powers of other employees, if at<a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>tempted (22 C.

The learned court permitted its consideration to show that Davey was authorized to act for the defendant in controlling the movements of Loveland &amp; Company’s employees. The fact that the witness believed the accident was the result of a negligent order, given by an assistant foreman of the defendant, at work on the dock, did not indicate the latter was acting within the scope of his authority in giving such a direction, but rather that the person who gave it, — whoever he might be, or whatever his position, — was lacking in good judgment.
