Gardner died intestate May 16, 1896, and his wife, Sarah Gardner, died testate April 1, 1922, leaving her real estate to her children, including Mrs. Gates, to whom, prior to the institution of the present suit, her cotenants conveyed their shares, thus vesting in her the whole of the mother’s real property. She claims the <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>property in controversy on the theory that defendant, acting as agent for Sarah Gardner, his sister, purchased it at the sheriff’s sale and held the legal title thereto in trust for her. On the other hand, defendant contends that he bought the farm for himself, and was at all times willing, while his sister lived, to transfer it to her upon the settlement of certain accounts between them, but that he was under no legal obligation to do so; in short, defendant, claiming to be owner in fee, denies that plaintiff has any right, title or interest in the property.</p>

Hence the verdict, though a general one, must be viewed as comprehending conclusions of fact that the property was bought in by defendant, representing Sarah Gardner, under an agreement that the purchase money was paid on her account, to be refunded to him subsequently; and these conclusions sustain the plaintiff’s case.</p>

L. 279, provides that “when a decision appears of record, an exception is not necessary”; but, construing this act, we have repeatedly decided that it applies only to final orders or rulings in the nature thereof: Com. v.

Originally, the office of an exception was to bring the matter questioned formally on the record, in order that it might subsequently be incorporated in a bill of exceptions, for use on review; because, in those times, stenographic records were not kept. To-day, however the purpose of an exception is to give formal notice that the exceptant does not acquiesce in the ruling of the court and intends again to claim the benefit of the objection or request which the court has overruled or denied; hence the rule that the exception must appear in the assignment, which, as said in Foley v. P. R. T. Co., supra, at p. 172, “is in effect merely the application of the principle that appellate courts will not review matters not called to the attention of the trial court, unless the alleged errors are basic and <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>fundamental.” We there add that “the upholding of this principle is essential to the proper and orderly administration of the law.” All of this is noted to emphasize the importance of complying with the rule of court. Here, by examining the record, we find that exceptions were in fact taken, and, had they appeared as required, we might have felt called on to discuss several of the assignments which complain of trial error; as it is, however, we simply state that, after looking at all of them, we discover no faults requiring reversal of the judgment.</p>

The principal points argued under this assignment have been passed upon, but it may be noted that the order which defendant quotes therein, as disposing of his motion for judgment, appears to dispose only of his rule for a new trial. The Act of April 22, 1905, regulating practice on such motions, provides that, if the court below does not grant a new trial, it shall be its duty “to enter such judgment as should have been entered upon the evidence”; it further provides that, “from the judgment thus entered either party may appeal.” Since, subsequent to the motion for judgment n. o. v., a judgment was in fact entered for plaintiff, we shall treat the assignment under consideration as though it showed an order disposing formally of defendant’s motion for judgment n. o. v., and as complaining of the final judgment; on that theory we have reviewed the case and shall dismiss the motion to quash the appeal.</p>
