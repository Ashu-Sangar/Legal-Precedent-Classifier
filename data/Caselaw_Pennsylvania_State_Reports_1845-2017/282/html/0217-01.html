On August 28, 1923, defendants moved to open the decree, and testimony was taken on a rule for that purpose. By depositions, defendants endeavored to sustain defenses which should have been made before decree entered; but, after consideration of the grounds taken, the court below refused to open the decree. It is only necessary to say that we are not convinced of an abuse of discretion.</p>
