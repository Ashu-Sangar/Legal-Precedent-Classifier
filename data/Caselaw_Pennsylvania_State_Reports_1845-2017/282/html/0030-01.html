L. 259), which followed next after the Act of 1855, did not expressly, or by implication, repeal its provisions, — reenacted, as noticed, in 1895, supra. It did declare that, where the disposition was void for uncertainty, or because the object was not ascertainable, had ceased to exist, or the fund was directed to he held in unlawful perpetuity, the “property shall go to the heirs at law and next of kin of the decedent.” These exceptions were, however, later limited by the Act of May 9,1889, P. L. 173, which provided that there should be no failure for want of a trustee, by reason of the objects ceasing, being given in perpetuity, or in excess of the annual value limited by law, and where the disposition depends upon the exercise of discretion of a last trustee. The contention of the appellant is that a devise or bequest for charitable uses must still he held to he void if the object of the trust is uncertain, or is not ascertainable, in which cases the next of kin are entitled to the property in question, notwithstanding this act and that of 1895, which followed.

Likewise, the failure of the testator to formulate and set forth practical plans for carrying out his purpose is insufficient to defeat the use ^Barnwell’s Est., supra), nor does the fact that the carrying out of the purpose is made dependent on contributions by others for a like purpose have this effect: Daly’s Est., <a href="/pa/208/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="208 Pa. 58" data-case-ids="998110" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0058-01">208 Pa. 58</a>.

In such case, the court will administer the fund, varying the manner of distribution where the general purpose appears, and a literal compliance with the terms of the trust has become impossible or impracticable. Then the court will direct the balance to be appropriated in such way as will accomplish the intention of the donor or testator as nearly as possible under the cy pres doctrine : 11 C.

They are not the “objects of the trust,” but merely the medium through which the purpose of the decedent may be carried out (McCully’s Est., supra), and the fact that confidence in their integrity is shown by the words used in the will (Dulles’s Est., supra), does not indicate that the testator desired the ones designated, and those only, to have the right to carry out <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>his clearly expressed intent: Kimberly’s Est. (No. 1), supra. It has been held that where the trustee or trustees appointed to execute a charitable trust are invested with personal discretionary power as to its execution, and they die, or refuse to serve, the bequest will fail. An examination of the cases referred to will show the decisions usually rest on a finding that the object of the trust is too indefinite to be enforced. (See note, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20A.L.R.%20339" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="5 A.L.R. 339">5 A. L. R. 339</a>.) The mere power of selection given does not, however, create such uncertainty, as we have already noticed, and there is nothing in the present writing which limits the exercise of the authority conferred.</p>

In the first portion he indicates his reason for appointing Scott and Patton as trustees to name those who should share, by reason of their knowledge of his wishes, but he follows this suggestion, as already stated, with a positive declaration that the selection should be left “generally to the good discretion of my executors.” It cannot, therefore, be successfully contended that the power thus created is purely personal. The class of charities which the testator desired to assist is shown clearly by the specific bequests which appear in the will; and the suggestion, in the residuary clause, of one only, which might be included if deemed wise, is significant. His preferences, thus made evident, were followed by the appointed trustee as to the uses doubtless in the mind of the decedent. It will also be noted that the testator gave discretionary power to those named, not as individuals, but as executors, and presumably he knew that some one would be substituted by the court, as the law directed, if those chosen should die before exercising their judgment in making appointments. Though the right to select was given, so long as those designated were capable of acting, the fact is not sufficient, when these failed to exercise the power conferred, to defeat the clearly ex<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>pressed purpose of Thompson to devote the fund to charities, and not to die intestate: Anderson’s Est., supra; DeSilver’s Est., supra; Hunter’s Est., supra.</p>
