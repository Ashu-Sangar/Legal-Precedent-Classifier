He also claimed $5,006.39 additional for alleged extra work; this was partially compromised by defendant consenting to pay $407.93 in settlement of items aggregating $1,208.31. The written agreement in regard to this adjustment, which was dictated in defendant’s presence, specified that “The items not included in this settlement, and which are left open for future adjustment or litigation, without prejudice to the rights of either party with respect thereto, are” as detailed in the paper; they amounted to $3,798.08. Defendant left the conference before the agreement was written, but asked that it be sent to him for execution. Later he returned it unsigned, and refused to pay the $407.93; plaintiff then sued in the municipal court to recover this amount; defendant denied liability and set up a counterclaim for $408, because of alleged defective work in the same operation. The case was heard and decided without a jury; the court, in a written opinion, held that defendant had agreed as alleged, but did not consider the counterclaim at all, in effect determining, under the rule of Hennis v. Page, <a href="/whart/3/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Whart. 275" data-case-ids="1833464" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0275-01">3 Wharton 275</a>, and Mutual Trust Co. v.

Judgment was entered for plaintiff, for the full amount claimed in that suit, and it was paid by defendant.</p>

Susquehanna Mutual Fire Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/125/0427-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="125 Pa. 427" data-case-ids="563995" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0427-01">125 Pa. 427</a>, 441); whether or not it was adjudicated is a matter of law for the court: Goodhart v. Bishop, <a href="/pa/142/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="142 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="976600" data-case-paths="/pa/142/0416-01">142 Pa. 416</a>. If in the municipal court there had been simply a general verdict for plaintiff, we might presume the counterclaim was considered and disallowed; but no such presumption can arise where the record shows it was not. Besides, were we to consider the matter as if the counterclaim had been adjudicated, it would not affect the issue here; the alleged defective work there pleaded was not the same as that included in the present suit, nor, indeed, in the same houses. Neither law nor logic compels us to say that an adjudication that the work in a few houses was well done, conclusively determines that it was properly performed in others also.</p>

Moreover, as already stated, the defects here alleged were in other houses than those referred to in the pleadings in the municipal court; indeed most, if not all of these defects had not appeared when that case was tried; hence they could not have been part of a general claim which was attempted to be subdivided. “Causes of action which are distinct and independent, although growing out of the same contract, transaction, or state of facts, may be <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>sued upon separately, and [even] the recovery of judgment for one of such causes of action will not bar subsequent actions upon the others”: 23 Cyc. 1189 Morrison v.
