Ridge Street, extending through the Borough of West Easton in a northerly and southerly direction, is crossed at grade, and practically at right angles, by a track of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, defendant. At about seven o’clock on the morning of July 10, 1921, the plaintiff, who resided south of the track, came to the crossing on her way to church, and observing an engine and tender (herein called “the train”) approaching the crossing from the west, stopped at a point on the east sidewalk near a signal post, about ten feet south of the track. As the train approached the crossing, a southbound taxicab (herein called “the cab”) in Ridge Street came upon the track and was struck by the train and thrown against the signal post, which fell and injured plaintiff. The jury sustained the contention that the accident resulted from the negligent operation of the train, and, from judgments entered on verdicts for plaintiffs, defendant has appealed.</p>

There was, <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>as frequently occurs in such cases, a sharp conflict in the evidence. The whistling post for eastbound trains approaching this crossing was located some six hundred feet west of Ridge Street, and there was a bridge approximately twelve hundred feet further west. The, testimony of the engineer, fireman and conductor was that the bell was ringing automatically for over a mile before reaching the crossing, also that the regulation whistle was blown at the post and again as an alarm signal some two hundred feet from the crossing. There is some other evidence to the effect that a whistle was blown. The driver of the cab testified positively that no crossing signal was given and plaintiff testified that the whistle was blown up by the bridge and that no other signal was given of the train’s approach to the crossing. These two witnesses were about to cross the track and, according to the evidence, listened for signals, hence, their testimony cannot be treated as negative, nor disregarded because of the number of opposing witnesses: Cubitt v.

The cab driver, however, estimated the speed at forty miles an hour. It cannot be said as matter of law he was incompetent to express an opinion, for he had been driving automobiles and watching speedometers for six years, and saw the train approaching for one hundred and fifty feet and also as it passed after the collision. His esti<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>mate finds some support in the conductor’s statement on cross-examination that he did not know how fast the train was going, had no way of judging the speed and that it could have been going from thirty to thirty-five miles an hour; also that passing over the crossing at thirty miles an hour would be an excessive rate of speed; which is undoubtedly true, as Ridge Street was an important thoroughfare in a built-up section of the borough, not protected by gate or watchman. The question of signals and speed were properly submitted to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b67-3" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[185,875,1155,1521]],["BL_68.1",68,[311,328,1151,688]]]'>It is very earnestly urged for appellant that the accident resulted from the sole negligence of the cab driver in going upon the track in the path of the approaching train, apparently in an effort to beat it across. The driver, however, testified that he stopped to look and listen about thirty feet from the track, where his view to the west was obstructed by a bank, and that when he got where he could see in that direction the head of his cab was within five feet of the first rail; then, fearing he could not stop in time as the street was wet and he was going down grade, he speeded up in an unsuccessful effort to get across ahead of the train. The claim that he stopped also finds support in other testimony. The evidence for defendant put the driver’s conduct in a less favorable light, but the question of his negligence is not controlling in the instant case. The jury found defendant guilty of negligence and there is evidence to support that finding; hence the fact that the cab driver was also negligent is no defense. At most his negligence helped to bring about the result, and one injured by the concurrent negligence of two has a right of action against either: O’Malley v. Phila. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/248/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="248 Pa. 292" data-case-ids="1011498" data-case-paths="/pa/248/0292-01">248 Pa. 292</a>; Thomas v. Southern Pa.

This principle is illustrated in the case of a passenger on a street car, who may sue either when injured at <em>a </em>railroad grade crossing by the concurrent negligence of the two companies. See Downey v. Railroad et al., <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a><a href="/pa/161/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="161 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="854246" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0588-01">161 Pa. 588</a>. Of course if the negligence of the cab driver was the sole efficient cause of the accident defendant although negligent would not be liable; but had the train moved at moderate speed the cab might have crossed in safety, or, had timely warning been given, the cab driver might have known of the train’s approach before he came to the crossing. It cannot, therefore, be affirmed that defendant’s negligence was not a concurring cause of the accident. See Wheelock v. Erie R. R. Co., <a href="/pa-super/61/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="61 Pa. Super. 145" data-case-ids="453567" data-case-paths="/pa-super/61/0145-01">61 Pa. Superior Ct. 145</a>.
