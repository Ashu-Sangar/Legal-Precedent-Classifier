Where testator lehves \u201ceverything to each of brother Dan\u2019s children and Phil, share and share,\u201d and it appears that Dan and Phil, are brothers of decedent, the gift will he construed as giving to Dan\u2019s six children and Phil, each a one-seventh interest in the estate, and not as giving to Dan^s children one-half and to Phil, the other half.\n2. The word \u201cand\u201d links the children of Dan with Phil., and the word \u201ceach\u201d is used to describe the interest of every one who takes under the will, with the same effect as if each child of Dan had been separately named and then Phil, had been named.\nArgued January 6, 1925.\nAppeal, No. 189, Jan. T., 1925, by Philip Donohoe, a devisee, from decree of O. C. PMla. Co., Jan. T., 1924, No. 289, awarding partition, in estate of Michael I. Donohoe.\nBefore Moschzisker, C.
