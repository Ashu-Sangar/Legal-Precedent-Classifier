        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Frazer,\nBy contract in writing, dated January 22, 1923, defendants agreed to sell to plaintiffs the premises No. 4618 Mansion Avenue, 21st Ward, Philadelphia, for the sum of $4,500, $100 being paid at the time' of signing the agreement and the balance to be paid at settlement, to be made within 90 days. The day following the signing of the agreement, defendants concluded the price for which they had agreed to sell the property was inadequate and notified the real estate broker, through whom the contract was negotiated, of their refusal to carry out the agreement and tendered to him the $100 paid by the purchasers, which he declined to receive. On defendants\u2019 failure to complete the transaction at the time arranged for settlement, plaintiffs filed this bill for specific performance of the contract. Defendants\u2019 answer averred the real estate broker \u201cfalsely and fraudulently misrepresented to defendants that the sum of $4,500, the price mentioned in the agreement of sale, was a full price for the premises\u201d while, as a matter of fact, $6,000 was a fair value for the property. At the trial defendants testified the amount they were to receive was not the fair value of the property and for that reason they declined to- carry out the agreement, but would however be satisfied to sell for an additional sum of $500. The only evidence tending to establish the charge of misrepresentation and fraud on the part of the real estate broker is found in the testimony of defendants themselves, one of whom, the wife, stated the broker brought the agreement to their house and that she first refused to sign, the broker \u201ctalked it up big,\u201d saying that $4,500 was big money for the house\u201d and that this \u201csounded big money\u201d to her husband, the other defendant, \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t investigate to see what the property was worth,\u201d whereupon the wit-' ness \u201cgot disgusted and signed to get rid of him,\u201d realizing, however, she had \u201cmade a mistake\u201d as soon as she had placed her name on the paper. The other witness testified the broker informed his wife and himself they were \u201cgetting good value for their property and may not get it again.\u201d The contract had been signed by plaintiffs before being brought to defendants by the broker.\n\u2022 Defendants called as witness in their behalf a real estate agent who testified the price stipulated in the agreement was less than the actual value of the property, which in his opinion was $6,000; the court below, however, later, without objection on defendants\u2019 part, struck from the record the testimony of this witness and found as a fact that defendants failed to prove inadequacy of consideration and further that such fact, if proved, would not have been a good defense, inasmuch as there was insufficient testimony to establish fraud, but concluded, nevertheless, that plaintiffs were not entitled to specific performance because of their failure to prove delivery of the agreement of sale to plaintiffs before revocation of the agent\u2019s authority, and directed a decree dismissing the bill. On exception filed, this decree was reversed under the authority of Allen v. Mowry, 278 Pa. 64, holding that physical delivery of a contract for the sale of land is not necessary to make it -a sufficient memorandum in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds., x A decree for specific performance was thereupon entered, from which defendants appealed.\nAppellants contend the real estate broker was acting solely on behalf of plaintiffs. If so, delivery was complete at the time the agreement was signed and placed in his hands.- As a matter of fact, it apppears he was being paid for his services by defendants,.and the court found he was actually defendants\u2019 agent in making sale of the premises. In that event plaintiffs cannot be held responsible for a fraud practiced on defendants by their own agent. Furthermore, the court found, and properly so, that the evidence offered failed to show fraud perpetrated on defendants and it also found defendants failed to prove inadequacy of consideration, and that the alleged insufficiency in price was not a valid defense. We concur in this conclusion. Inadequacy of consideration is not ground for refusing to decree specific performance of a contract to convey real estate, unless there is evidence of fraud or unfairness in the transaction sufficient to make it inequitable to compel performance: Harris v. Tyson, 24 Pa. 347, 360; Graham v. Pancoast, 30 Pa. 89, 97; Cummings\u2019s App., 67 Pa. 404; Bowers v. Bennethum, 133 Pa. 306; Jackson\u2019s Est., 203 Pa. 33. \u201cInadequacy of price, improvidence, surprise, and mere hardship, none of these, nor all combined, furnish an adequate reason for a judicial rescission of a contract. For such action something more is demanded, \u2014 such as fraud, mistake or illegality\u201d: Frey\u2019s Est., 223 Pa. 61, 65. Although relief in equity is a matter of grace only and not of right, and rests in the discretion of the court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all the circumstances of the cas\u00e9, it does not follow that a decree for specific performance must be entered in all cases where the agreement is legally sound and the price adequate, but if the transaction be inequitable or unjust in itself or rendered so by matters subsequently occurring, specific performance may be denied and the parties turned over to their remedy in damages (Rennyson v. Rozell, 106 Pa. 407, 412); and, while no rule applicable to all cases can be announced, it may be said that specific relief will be granted if apparent that, in view of all the circumstances, it will subserve the ends of justice, and will be withheld where, on a like view, it appears hardship or injustice will jesult to either of the parties: Rennyson v. Rozell, supra; Spotts v. Eisenhauer, 31 Pa. Superior Ct. 89, 93. We find nothing in the circumstances of this case indicating either that the contract was procured by fraud or misrepresentation or that it was so improvident that, a chancellor ought not to enforce it according to its terms, and we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the court below.\nThe decree is affirmed at costs of appellants.",
