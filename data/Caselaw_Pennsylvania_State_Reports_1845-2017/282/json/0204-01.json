Where a corporation makes and signs a promissory note to the order of \u201courselves\u201d and endorses and signs on the back of it a printed form of assignment, guaranty and warrant to confess judgment, and an individual signs after such endorsement, such individual has a right to an issue to determine the fact as to whether or not he endorsed the note with the intention of being personally bound by the provisions of the warrant of attorney.\n2. Where in such case the court below has refused to strike off a judgment entered under the warrant against the individual endorser, the Supreme Court, on the suggestion that there was such a disputed question of fact not determined in the court below, will remand the ease with directions that the lower court, if it finds that the question of fact raised by the appellant is disputable, award an issue, with further directions that the existing judgment be sustained or stricken off as the event of such issue shall justify the lien to remain in the meantime.\nPetition for award of issue and answer thereto.
