B. E. Goodman. Subsequently, plaintiff, as trustee in bankruptcy of the Hub Stores, a copartnership, claimed the goods and instituted an action of replevin to recover them.

B. E. Goodman, ......The affidavit of defense raises a question of fact [as to ownership], and it is the opinion of the court that plaintiff should be put to proof to sustain his claim of title to the goods in possession of defendant in the name of J.
