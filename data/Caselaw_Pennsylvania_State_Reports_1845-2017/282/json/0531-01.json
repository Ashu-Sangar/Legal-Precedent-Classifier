        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Schaffer,\nA number of questions are raised on this appeal; it is conceded, however, by all parties to the litigation, that one of them is controlling, if determined in the way we think it must be, and we shall therefore deal only with it.\nStephen F. Robinson died testate, leaving to survive him his widow, Jennie B- Robinson (whose executor and devisees are the appellants), his father, mother, five sisters, and no children. His will in its parts material to our consideration was thus phrased: \u201cItem. I give, devise and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Jennie B. Robinson, all of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever name, nature or kind, and wheresoever situate, absolutely and in fee simple, investing her with full power to transfer and convey the same or any part thereof. Item. Whatever of the real, personal or mixed estate passing to my said wife by virtue thereof that she shall not have transferred or conveyed and may still own and hold title to at the time of her death, I hereby limit and dispose of the same as follows: One-sixth (1-6) of such remainder I direct shall go to and be distributed among such religious associations, churches and institutions of learning as shall be proportioned and designated by my said wife by will, the same being dedicated as a memorial to our son, J. Stewart Robinson, deceased; and the other five-sixths (5-6) of the said remainder of my estate existing at the death of my said wife, to go and belong to my father, J. C. Robinson, and mother, Martha Robinson, and the survivor of them, for use only during their lives and the life of the survivor of them, with remainder at the death of said survivor to my five sisters' [naming them] share and share alike in fee simple forever. Lastly, I nominate, constitute and appoint my said wife, Jennie B. Robinson, in whom I have perfect trust, sole executrix hereof.\u201d\nFollowing the death of Jennie B. Robinson, letters of administration d. b. n. c. t. a. were granted on the estate of Stephen F. Robinson to Benjamin B. Mitchell, who cited the executor and the beneficiaries under Jennie B. Robinson\u2019s will, to show cause why the property, real and personal, in her hands at the time of her death should not be turned over to the estate of Stephen F. Robinson, and the court below so decreed. If Jennie B. Robinson took but a life estate under her husband\u2019s will, the court was right; if she took a fee, it was wrong. What she did take is therefore the controlling question, and, if it was a fee, the only one.\nUnder the first quoted paragraph of the will, she took an estate in fee by the express words used by the testator, \u201call of my estate......absolutely and in fee simple.\u201d Was this fee simple gift cut down to a life estate by the subsequent language used? We have very recently had occasion to give consideration to this question of fees given and their alleged reduction to a less estate in Smith v. Bloomington Coal Co., 282 Pa. 248. There, speaking through the Chief Justice, we said: \u201cThe guiding rule in such cases has been stated by us many times, the latest instance being in Deeter\u2019s Est., 280 Pa. 135, this court there saying at page 141, \u2018Where the dominant purpose shown by a devise is to vest a fee, this estate cannot be stripped of its inherent attributes by subsequent words indicating an intent so to do. .......On the other hand.......in finding the controlling intention, all the words used by testator should be taken into account, and if the intent to restrict [in the sense of making a gift of less than a fee] is clearly the dominant one, it must be given effect.\u2019 \u201d After referring to other cases, the opinion points out that in Long\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 480, 485-6, we said that after a testator had used words \u201csufficient to vest an absolute interest [he] must indicate a fairly clear intention to take away the estate previously given before a divestiture can be upheld.\u201d In the opinion from which we are quoting, this further language most pertinent to the case at bar was used, \u201cIn considering the present will as a whole, we are not particularly aided by those parts which make bequests or devises to persons other than testator\u2019s widow; however, when we read the portions dealing with the widow\u2019s interest, we can sufficiently deduce from them that testator\u2019s \u2018dominant purpose\u2019 was to give his......estate......absolutely and in fee to his wife, his secondary intent being to control her testamentary disposition of it.\u201d We think the same situation again confronts us, that here testator\u2019s \u201cdominant purpose\u201d was to give, his estate absolutely and in fee to his wife. He did so in so many words. Thereafter in undoubted precatory language he provided as to one-sixth of what \u201cshe shall not have transferred or conveyed and may still own and hold title to at the time of her death\u201d that it shall \u201cgo to......such religious associations, etc., as shall be proportioned and designated by [his] said wife by will.\u201d The medium of its \u201cgoing\u201d was the will of his widow. At to the other five-sixths, it also was \u201cto go\u201d to his father and mother for life with remainder to his sisters. But what was to be the method of its \u201cgoing\u201d? The testator had already sent it to his wife absolutely and in fee, and in the light of this disposition and of the fact that the wife\u2019s will was to be the medium for the passing of one-sixth of the remainder, we think it cannot be said with certainty, considering the collocation of the words in the paragraph, that the five-sixths was not also \u201cto go\u201d to the father, mother and sisters in the same way. That the wife\u2019s will was to make this disposition finds some support in the statement by the testator of his \u201cperfect trust\u201d in her. Once it be assumed that there is doubt as to just how the ultimate vesting of the five-sixths interest in the property at the widow\u2019s death was to be accomplished, whether by her will or that of her husband, and we think there is this doubt, then there is not such a clear intent as would strike down the manifested \u201cdominant purpose\u201d of the testator to vest in his wife the estate which he declared should vest in- her, one absolute and in fee simple. The testator by the language he used authorizing his wife to \u201ctransfer and convey\u201d the property which he had devised to her absolutely, necessarily knew that she could put it beyond the reach of any power over it which he might seek to exercise; this circumstance is an added factor aiding the conclusion that what he had in mind was a suggested or precatory control which his \u201cperfect trust\u201d in her led him to believe she would carry out. Then, again, he refers to the property in question as that which his widow might \u201cstill own\u201d; in other words, as her property and not as his estate.\nIn Evans v. Smith, 166 Pa. 625, the will was very similar to the one we are considering. There the testator directed, \u201cI give and bequeath unto my wife all my estate both personal, real and mixed in fee simple to own, use, enjoy and dispose of the same as she may deem proper and right, the same as I might or could do if living......I further hereby order and direct that whatever real estate that may not be sold or disposed of by my said wife in her lifetime that the same shall as soon as conveniently be done after her death, sold and converted into money......I give and bequeath to my three children......the residue of my said estate after the death of my said wife, and after the bequest to my said grandson......to be divided into three shares.\u201d It was held that the widow took an estate in fee simple in testator\u2019s lands.\nHaving reached the conclusion that Jennie B. Robinson, under her husband\u2019s will, took a fee simple estate in all his property, it follows that the appellees have no interest in it and the court erred in awarding it to them.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed, with direction to dismiss the proceedings brought against appellants ; costs to be paid by appellees.",

Where the dominant purpose of a testator shown by a devise is to vest a fee, this estate cannot be stripped of its inherent attributes by subsequent words indicating an intent so to do.\n2. Where the dominant purpose is to give a wife the fee, such purpose cannot be defeated by a secondary intent to control her disposition of it.\n3. Where testator gives and devises his estate to his wife \u201cabsolutely and in fee simple\u201d with power \u201cto transfer and convey the same,\u201d and in a subsequent clause directs that as to \u201cwhat she may still own\u201d at her death, one-sixth thereof \u201cshall go\u201d to religious institutions designated by the wife\u2019s will, and the other five-sixths \u201cto go\u201d to testator\u2019s own relations specifying them, and further appoints his wife sole executrix, in whom he stated he has \u201cperfect trust,\u201d the wife takes an estate in fee which is not cut down to a life estate by the later provisions.\n4. In light of the fee left to the widow and that the wife\u2019s will was to be the medium of passing one-sixth of the remainder, it cannot be said with certainty, considering the collocation of the words, the five-sixths was not also to go in the same way.\n5. In such case, as there is doubt as to how the interest in the-five-sixths was to be vested at the widow\u2019s death, whether by her will or that of her husband, there is not such a clear intent as will strike down the manifest dominant purpose to vest in the wife a fee simple estate.\n6. The provision authorizing the wife to \u201ctransfer and convey\u201d the property given to her absolutely, indicates that testator knew that she could put it beyond the reach of any power over it which he might seek to exercise, and this circumstance is a factor aiding the conclusion that what he had in mind was a suggested or precatory control which his \u201cperfect trust\u201d in her led him to believe she would carry out.\n7.
