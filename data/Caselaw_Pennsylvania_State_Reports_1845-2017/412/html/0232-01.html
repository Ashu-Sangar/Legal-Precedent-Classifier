The matter was referred to an auditor. Being of the opinion that the residuary legatees had “an immediate right of possession of the remainder interest if the prior estates were presently terminated”, that the “unlawful accumulations represented] a part of the estate that is no longer affected by the life estates” and that, as to the accumulated income, the trust had terminated, the auditor concluded that the balance of the accumulated income should be distributed to the residuary legatees.</p>

In <em>Maris’s Estate </em>the widow by the terms <em>of the </em>will was given during her life the “net income” absolutely; she thereby became entitled to <em>all </em>the income arising from the corpus of the trust and became vested with an equitable life interest in the income-producing corpus which, upon the death of the testator, took effect in immediate possession; under such circumstances, the widow became entitled to distribution of any income unlawfully accumulated. By way of contrast, the life beneficiaries in the case at bar acquired an interest in the net income only to the extent of the specific amounts of income provided for them and they totally lack any interest in any surplus income over and above the specified amounts; the interest of the residuary legatees in the corpus and the accumulat<a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>ed income,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> even though such interest be considered vested,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> takes effect in possession and enjoyment only upon the happening of a future event, i.e., the death of all the life beneficiaries and the arrival at age 21 of the youngest grandchild.

      <em> </em>supra, is illustrative of a situation where the residuary legatees lacked an interest taking effect in possession and the provision offending against the accumulation provision of the Act was contained in the residuary clause and the residuary legatees were held barred from receiving distribution of the released income. The instant factual situation is clearly within the second part of the rule. In the phraseology of that part of the rule, the accumulation relates “to an interest not vested in possession” and “the residuary estate itself [is] the subject of the [accumulation] provisions”, therefore “the income goes under the intestate laws to the next of kin.”</p>
