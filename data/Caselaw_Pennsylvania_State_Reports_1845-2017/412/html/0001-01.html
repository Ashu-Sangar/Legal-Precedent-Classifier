On this key factual issue, two women who were driving on the highway corroborated the police officer’s testimony. At this point in the trial, appellant’s counsel requested the trial judge to issue a subpoena duces tecum to compel the E.B.I. to turn over statements given to it by <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>the two women.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Upon being questioned as to the purpose of this production, counsel replied that the statements given to the F.B.I. did not include “any observation of who struck the first blow” and thus could be used to impeach the testimony of the two women.

In the Jencks case the defendant was charged with perjury for falsely swearing in a non-Communist affidavit which he filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The principal witnesses against him were two informers, Ford and Matusow, hired by the F.B.I. They testified that they had sent reports to the F.B.I. concerning matters to which they were testifying at the trial. The trial court refused the defendant’s motion to direct the F.B.I. to produce these reports for inspection. The Supreme Court reversed the defendant’s conviction, declaring (pp. 668-669) that ‘the petitioner was entitled to an order directing the Government to pro<a id="p7" href="#p7" data-label="7" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*7</a>duce for inspection all reports of Matusow and Ford in its possession, written and, when orally made, as recorded by tbe F.B.I., touching the events and activities as to which they testified at the trial . . . Justice requires no less.’ The Supreme Court further held (page 666) that <em>‘the petitioner was not required to lay a preliminary foundation of inconsistency, because a sufficient foundation was established by the testimony of Matusow and Ford that their reports were of the events and activities related in their </em>testimony.’</p>
    <p id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[194,877,1157,751]]]'>“The present appellant is just as much entitled to fair procedure as was the defendant in the Jencks case. A disbarment proceeding is every bit as serious as a criminal trial and often far more so; the penalty of disbarment is certainly harsher than a fine or short imprisonment. <em>Nor is the rule of the Jenchs case peculiar to federal criminal prosecutions; it is a requirement of due process of law. </em>The appellant has a <em>constitutional right </em>to the production of the reports of the witnesses against him, touching the events and activities to which they testified, and to inspect so much of such reports as is relevant to the issue.

S. 367</a>, in connection with the proposition that appellant’s rights were not trespassed upon, since he had the district attorney’s statements. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that a denial of a request for a document was harmless error, because the defense already had the information. The harmless error referred to was the refusal of the trial court to order the government to turn over to the defense a letter written to the F.B.I. by the witness. The letter indicated that the witness did not trust her memory of the events to which she would testify and she would have to refresh her recollection by rereading her original statement made some three years earlier. The court held that in this instance the <em>very same </em>information as contained in the letter, which should have been turned over, was within the knowledge of the defense and hence, refusal of production of the letter, while error, was harmless. The situation here is different. Here there is a report which might contain things other than contained in the District Attorney’s reports referred to by the majority. In <em>Rosenberg, </em>there is no question that only one piece of information is involved in the letter and the defense had that information. The entire holding of the court on the question is contained in the final paragraph of the <em>Rosenberg </em>opinion as follows: <em>“An appellate court should not confidently guess what defendants attorney might have found useful for impeachment purposes in withheld documents to which the defense is entitled. </em>However, <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>■when the <em>very same </em>information was possessed by defendant’s counsel as would have been available were error not committed, it would offend common sense and the fair administration of justice to order a new trial.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

The record indicates that the defense made three applications for subpoena duces tecum. 1.) A subpoena was issued without leave of court, in violation of the local rules, and was properly quashed. 2.) An application was made to the court for a subpoena before any witnesses had testified. At that time, the F.B.I. representative was in court in response to the subpoena issued without leave of court. He testified that the material sought was confidential and the trial judge refused the application for subpoena and quashed the subpoena previously issued. 3.) Defendant applied to the court for a subpoena after the witnesses had testified. This application was also refused and forms the basis of the dispute.</p>
    <p id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[209,1536,1149,802]]]'>Defendant was clearly not entitled to a subpoena without leave of court and the one which issued was properly quashed, irrespective of the position of the F.B.I. with regard to the confidential nature of the records. Under the holding in <em>Jencks v.

The application for subpoena made at the beginning of the trial was, therefore, properly refused, again irrespective of the position of the F.B.I. on the confidential nature of the documents. It was only after the witnesses testified that defendant had a right to a subpoena and at that time his request was denied.</p>
