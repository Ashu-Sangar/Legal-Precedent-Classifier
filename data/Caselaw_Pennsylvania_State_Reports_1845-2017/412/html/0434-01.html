He had succeeded in traversing almost the entire roadway Avhen he was struck by an automobile operated by the defendant. At the time of contact, the plaintiff was <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>completely beyond the traffic area of the street, and bad reached a point two or three feet from the curb-line, in an open area adjacent to the curb reserved for parallel parking. The defendant’s automobile was backing into the parking space. No horn or warning signal was sounded.</p>
    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[233,667,1157,531]]]'>In defining the responsibilities of the parties involved, the trial judge treated the case as if it were one wherein a pedestrian was hit by a forward moving automobile in between intersections. He charged, inter alia, “A pedestrian who crosses a street between intersections is held to a higher degree of care than one who crosses on a crosswalk at a street intersection, and <em>by the same token the driver of am, automobile is held to a correspondingly lesser degree of care.” </em>(Emphasis supplied).</p>
