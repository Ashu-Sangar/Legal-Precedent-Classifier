However, on more careful examination of the report and the opinion, such so-called findings and conclusions can readily be reconciled. It is obvious that what the master and the court meant by their so-called “findings” was that each claimant had presented <em>some </em>evidence of kinship to the decedent which was not contradicted of record and which tended to establish such kinship but such evidence, both qualitatively and quantitatively, fell short of the standard of proof required to sus<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>tain each claimant’s burden.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Under the circumstances, in no sense can the so-called “findings” of the master and the court be considered “findings of fact” in the sense that such a term is generally employed and understood.</p>

The Act of 1948, supra, deals with <em>copies </em>of foreign documents of record or on file in a public office of a foreign country and is entirely inapplicable to the instant documents which are not and do not purport to be <em>copies </em>of any such records. The Act of 1876, supra, provides that the official acts and exemplifications of foreign notaries in accordance with the laws of their respective countries, authenticated by the local American consul, “shall be prima facie evidence of the matters therein set forth”; applied to the instant factual situation such Act would command the recognition of the power of attorney and the “survival” certificates only to the extent that they set forth that <em>a person purporting to be the sister Flora </em>appeared before the appropriate officials and executed the documents but in nowise compels recognition that <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>

D. &amp; C. 2d 701</a>, 709, 710, Judge Bolgek of the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County, dealing with a similar situation, stated: “In conjunction with the Pennsylvania Act of 1876, the reference to the prima facie standing of ‘matters therein set forth’ refers solely to the matters set forth by the notary, and not to those of the affiants. There is no evidence that the notary had any authority to certify more than the fact of execution by the affiants. We cite the language of Judge Shanaman in Scott v. Penn Title Insurance Company, 49 Berks 35, 39: ‘The essence of the notarial certificate is that the document has been executed, and that the notary knows that he is confronted by the signer, and that the signer is asserting the fact of his execution’.” In the case at bar, while the power of attorney and the “survival” certificate were admissible, their admissibility was limited to show that a person purporting to be the sister Flora appeared and executed the instant documents but not to prove that the affiant was in fact the sister Flora or to show the present existence of the sister Flora.</p>

The right of confrontation of witnesses is most important in our jurisprudence; it affords the opposite party the opportunity to test by cross-examination the reliability of the evidence given and enables the court, through its opportunity to see and observe the witness, to better test the credi<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>bility of the witness.

In the instant case, neither condition was established and the balance of the estate could not and should not have been awarded under the provisions of this statute.</p>
