    <p id="b662-8" data-blocks='[["BL_662.11",662,[233,997,1157,633]]]'>Appellants seek a zoning variance for a parcel of land at the northwest corner of 17th and Berryhill Streets in Harrisburg. This parcel consists of a large dwelling facing 17th Street, five contiguous vacant lots, each sixteen feet wide, and another residence fronting on Berryhill Street. The property is situated in an area designated in the zoning ordinance (approved October 3, 1950) as R-5, the least restrictive residential classification. Permission was sought to use the real estate for the erection and operation of a gasoline service station, a purpose not authorized by the ordinance classification for this zone.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[192,438,1151,751]]]'>The following circumstances detailed in the opinion of the court below are fully supported by the evidence and are pertinent to this determination: “There have been no changes of the type and character of the zoned area in which the premises in question are located since the enactment of the zoning ordinance referred to above. Diagonally across the intersection of 17th Street and Berryhill Street, in an area zoned for heavy industry, there was erected, since the enactment of the ordinance, a large brick building used by the Megs Corporation for the manufacturing of macaroni products. The building was erected on land upon which there was formerly a lumber yard, surrounded by a high board fence.</p>
    <p id="b663-5" data-blocks='[["BL_663.5",663,[195,1201,1148,737]]]'>“There is presently erected on the premises, for which the variance is sought, a large three story brick dwelling house. Several undeveloped lots adjoin the building. The building is in a very poor state of repairs. The premises were a part of an estate of a decedent who died February 10, 1957 and have not been occupied since that date. Continual and concerted efforts have been made by the heirs of the decedent to dispose of the property. Their efforts in this respect, however, have been in vain until on or about March 8, 1961, when an agreement of sale was entered into with the California Oil Company for a total sum of $35,000. The agreement was contingent upon the procurement of a variance.”</p>

It is contended also that the board failed to give proper consideration to the physical characteristics of the property and the unnecessary, “unique <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>or peculiar” hardship imposed by the zoning classification, as well as the poor state of repair of the dwellings and “the unsuccessful efforts for oyer a five year period to acquire a purchaser.” It is further argued that the zoning classification, as applied to the property in question, “is inappropriate because the characteristics, size, location, etc., of the property in relation to the surrounding properties is radically different.” It is asserted that because of “such things as present traffic conditions, the mixed character of the neighborhood, physical condition of the properties in relation to other properties, etc.,” the parcel in question “should be considered unique and the surrounding neighborhood would not be adversely affected if a variance had been granted.”</p>

The board here correctly applied these principles to the factual circumstances before it. We agree with the conclusions reached by the court below: “The only substantial hardship proved in this case is that unless the variance is granted, the appellants will not be able to sell the premises in question for the purpose of erecting thereon a gas station for a purchase price of |35,000. This circumstance, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said in Pincus v. Power, <a href="/pa/376/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="376 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="1246158" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0175-01">376 Pa. 175</a>, 181 (1954), does not constitute an unnecessary hardship.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Ever since Bomgardner et al. came into posession of these properties they have unsuccessfully tried to sell them.

It is raw material in the hands of the invisible architect who shapes it according to the needs of the environment and the best interests of all of the inhabitants in the area.</p>

However, where a man’s land, instead of being used so that it provides him with habitation, recreation and comfort, or income, sprouts only rocks of debt, frustration and despair, because of a local restriction which, in its application in this particular instance, does not benefit the community, we are confronted with a question as to whether the property owner in question is not being deprived of the reasonable fair use of his property without due process of law. The history, location and condition of the property in this case makes out a hardship special and peculiar to it, meeting the criteria of the adjudicated cases in this field.</p>
