However, the words contained in the policy must be given a reasonable and normal interpretation. There does not seem to be any ambiguity in the State Farm policy in that the policy states under the <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>paragraph referring to the “insured” that the word “insured” includes the named insured.

There are, however, decisions in other jurisdictions which rule on the point of law. In the case of <em>Pearson v. Johnson, </em><a href="/minn/215/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="215 Minn. 480" data-case-ids="256759" data-case-paths="/minn/215/0480-01">215 Minn. 480</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20N.W.2d%20357" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 N.W.2d 357">10 N.W. 2d 357</a> (1943), an identical factual situation was presented and the Minnesota court ruled that the exclusionary language in the policy applied. The policy considered in <em>Pearson </em>was identical with the policy at bar and the court said on page 358: “The word ‘insured’ is defined by the policy itself to include for the purposes named at all times the named insured Pearson. That the policy gives it broader application so as' to include persons driving with the named insured’s consent cannot be said to wipe out the exemptions incorporated into the policy to prevent the insured, that is, the named insured and his family from recovering for their own injuries. The policy is essentially a liability and not an accident policy. It is a contract between Pearson and the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, by the terms of which the latter agrees to protect the former against liability incurred at the suit of anyone outside his own family or household. Mrs. Pearson is a member of the named insured’s household and family and as such is expressly excluded from coverage. The policy provisions creating additional assureds cannot change the essential contract between Pearson and his insurance company. Certainly they cannot be read so as to nullify the express exclusions of the policy.” See also <em>Kirk v. State Farm, </em><a href="/tenn/200/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="200 Tenn. 37" data-case-ids="8529007" data-case-paths="/tenn/200/0037-01">200 Tenn. 37</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=289%20S.W.2d%20558" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="289 S.W.2d 558">289 S.W. 2d 558</a> (1955).</p>

The policyholder, his wife and daughters brought an action against the railroad company. The defendant joined the policyholder as an additional defendant in his wife’s case. A verdict ivas returned against both the railroad company and the policyholder. The railroad paid the verdict and then sought to collect one-half of the judgment from the State Farm Insurance Company. The State Farm refused to pay because of the exclusion clause. This court held that the exclusion clause applied and the Railroad could not recover.</p>
