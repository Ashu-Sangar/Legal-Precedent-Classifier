Although appellees’ witness was an expert on real estate valuation generally, but not on zoning, he was not, as appellant contends, rendered unqualified to testify as to the trends in the area, the best use of the land, and the basis on which he arrived at his valuation. See <em>Gilleland v. N. Y. State Natural Gas Corp., </em><a href="/pa/399/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="399 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="1290567" data-case-paths="/pa/399/0181-01">399 Pa. 181</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=159%20A.2d%20673" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="159 A.2d 673">159 A. 2d 673</a> (1960).

It must be evaluated under the restrictions of the existing zoning and consideration given to the impact upon market value of the likelihood of a change in zoning.” Based on this caveat, the Commonwealth further argues that the value given by appellees’ witness was a value as if rezoning had actually occurred. A careful examination of the testimony of appellees’ expert, both on preliminary examination and before the jury, indicates that his valuation was based on existing zoning together with a likelihood of change, and not on an accomplished change of classification. As stated by the court below: “. . . [I]t appears clear that he was con<a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>sidering the likelihood of the zoning being changed from residential uses to either <em>commercial uses or institutional uses. </em>In considering the likelihood of a future change in zoning to one of two classifications, he could not know to which classification the change would be. He could not place a value on the property as if it had already been rezoned to a classification unknown to him at the time he made the appraisal.”</p>
    <p id="b81-3" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[212,780,1150,578]]]'>The second major contention advanced by the Commonwealth is that the trial court erroneously permitted a prejudicial change of theory in the presentation of appellees’ case. Before the board of view, appellees’ expert witness testified that the damage sustained by the taking was $36,000, based on residential use of the property. In the complaint which perfected the appeal to the court of common pleas, damages of $36,000 were estimated. However, at trial, the valuation by appellees’ witness was $72,000, based upon possible commercial or institutional use.</p>

The reasoning is fallacious. The defendant was not obliged to present his whole case to the viewers. He may not have then known how it would affect the land; and it is not alone <em>his </em>estimate which controls, but also that of his witnesses.” (Italics supplied.) <em>Orange Home v.

    <p id="b82-4" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[211,456,1158,968]]]'>Third, the Commonwealth argues that the award of $40,000 (plus detention) was excessive, since the viewers’ total award was $12,745.37, and the appeal from the board of- view claimed damages of only $36,-000. The verdict was not unjustified by the evidence presented to the jury. The difference between the award of the. board and the verdict is not so great as to warrant a reduction in amount or a new trial, and the disparity between the two figures is explained by the additional testimony presented at trial. See <em>Vaughan v.

Moreover, this contention ignores the clear language of the complaint to the court of common pleas, which recites: “5. The plaintiffs <em>estimate </em>the real value of the property . ... [to be] $36,000.00.” (Emphasis supplied.) The figure was, as the quoted language indicates, merely an estimate, not a limitation on the possible award.</p>

The general rule is that an owner of property involved in condemnation may be cross-examined as to purchase price provided the purchase date is not too remote. The admissibility of such evidence is for the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Frontage, Inc. v.

So also in <em>Kelly v.

      <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>case, supra, the interval was less than two years. On the other hand, this Court has held that no abuse of discretion was committed by refusing to allow cross-examination as to purchase price paid nine years prior to condemnation. <em>Young v.

    <p id="b83-3" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[211,828,1151,697]]]'>The final contention raised by the Commonwealth is that the trial court erroneously admitted testimony prejudicial to its cause. On being questioned about the use to which the condemned property and an adjacent piece of land were being put, appellees’ valuation expert replied that they were being held for commercial use. The court properly struck the reference to commercial use, with appropriate instructions, and allowed the testimony that the properties were being “held” to stand. This meant nothing more than that the properties were not then being put to active use. Inquiry concerning present use is material, and the answer allowed was proper.</p>
    <p id="b83-4" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[208,1540,1152,807]],["BL_84.1",84,[184,324,1153,254]]]'>On the same issue, one appellee testified that the land was being held for commercial purposes.

This testimony was obviously objectionable since the late owner had died over three years prior to the trial, and the testimony offered was hearsay. The <em>Cleary </em>case is not controlling in the existing factual situation. Determination of the relevancy of such testimony is largely a matter of judicial discretion. See 1 Jones on Evidence §198 (5th ed. 1958). There was neither abuse of discretion nor <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>a showing of prejudice against the Commonwealth.

However, no other zoning changes had been made along Route 22 in Churchill Borough. Aside from the change secured by Westinghouse, the Churchill Borough authorities refused to rezone the property of an adjoining owner from residential to commercial in 1957.</p>

From this meager evidence, appellee’s expert witness on <em>value </em>— who was admittedly not an expert on zoning — was permitted to conclude that it was reasonably likely the area in question would be zoned commercial in the near future. It should also be noted that the evidence discloses that appellant had not made application for a zoning change.</p>
    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[196,818,1154,697]]]'>The burden of proving the likelihood of a change in zoning is upon the party asserting such probability and, because of the uncertainties inherent in such change, that burden is not easily satisfied. Thus, in the absence of a well-defined trend of zoning changes in a particular area, it would be pure surmise for a judge or jury to attempt to predict how the members of a borough council or zoning board will vote. It is common knowledge that the various factors which affect the votes of individual zoning board members, compounded by the vagaries which affect the vote of the collective body, defy any type of prediction based upon <em>reasonable probability.</em>

    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[193,1535,1151,424]]]'>Keeping in mind the high standard of proof mentioned above, I find that the evidence presented by appellee did not permit more than a remote speculation on the possibility of a future zoning change, and this is especially true, where, as in this case, appellant had not taken any steps to secure such change.
