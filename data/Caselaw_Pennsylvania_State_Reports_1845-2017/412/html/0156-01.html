    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[196,420,1150,1021]]]'>For many years subsequent to the death of her husband, the decedent continued the operation of a general store in Stoney Run, Berks County, wherein her son, Hosfeld, was employed. On November 14, 1958, while ill in a hospital, decedent executed a bill of sale which was witnessed by her minister and Mrs. Herber and which purported to convey to Hosfeld for $7,500 the store business. This bill of sale recited the sale by decedent to Hosfeld of: (a) “The entire inventory, furniture, fixtures, business assets and goodwill as a going concern of the general store business” including “all book accounts and accounts receivable, outstanding contracts, and all assets and property of any kind or nature whatsoever belonging or appertaining to said business”; (b) a certain described truck; (c) 22 shares of the capital stock of Lehigh Wholesale Grocery Company. Hosfeld now claims that the Hamburg account was included among the assets of the general store transferred to him by this bill of sale.</p>

Hosfeld, the decedent, even though the consideration for the contract is only $7,500.00 whereas the bank account deposit at the time of its withdrawal by [Hosfeld] was $11,591.91. The intention of the parties to this contract must be ascertained not only from the actual words contained in the agreement or bill of sale but all the surrounding circumstances. Applying the rule of construction known as ejusdem generis, we find that it was the intent of the parties that the words ‘all <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>book accounts and accounts receivable, outstanding contracts, and all assets and property of any kind or nature whatsoever’ are limited to book accounts, contracts, and assets ‘belonging or appertaining to said business’ and do not include other property or assets of the vendor, Sallie R. Hosfeld, the decedent. We are the more persuaded of the correctness of this interpretation when the disparity between the consideration for the contract and the amount of the bank deposit are recalled. Accordingly, we conclude that [Hosfeld] did not purchase the bank account of the decedent in the Hamburg Savings &amp; Trust Company. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b220-4" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[221,995,1155,250]]]'>Insofar as the decree of the court below finds that the Hamburg account was at the time of death decedent’s sole property and that the executor should be surcharged in the amount of the balance of said account, the decree is affirmed.</p>

Hosfeld or Mrs. Effie Herber” with an initial deposit therein of $5,246.55. On June 30,1958 there was an additional deposit of $1,318.04. In connection with this account there was no signature card. Subsequent to decedent’s death, Hosfeld withdrew the entire balance of $6,679.88 from the account.</p>

    <p id="b221-4" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[194,507,1154,1662]]]'>An examination of this record reveals an error in the court’s findings: the insufficiency of the evidence as to the initial or original ownership of the moneys deposited in this account. With one exception, the record is silent in proof that the money originally deposited in this account was decedent’s money and, by the same token, there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the money deposited was that of Hosfeld. There was evidence that the decedent had requested Mrs. Herber to “check on it [the bank account] to see if he [Hosfeld] put it in the bank like he had told her”, and that “the |5,000 came from the Walter Wessner sheriff’s sale”. Appellee also urges that “Paragraph 6(a) of the Statement of Fact filed by the Objector to the Account” reveals that the initial deposit in this account represented the “proceeds of Sheriff’s Sale as of No. 2 April Term, 1958, E.D. payment having been made by the Sheriff of Berks County to Sallie R. Hosfeld, Judgment Lien Creditor, in full of Judgment to No. 161 August Term, 1954, J.D.” Such a “Statement of Fact” does not appear on the record presented to us. In <em>Commonwealth v.

The difficulty we encounter in the case at bar lies in the fact that our research of this record reveals only a scintilla of evidentiary support for the findings of the court that decedent received from a sheriff’s sale proceeding money which allegedly she caused to be deposited in this account when it was opened. Upon such basis a finding of initial or original ownership by decedent of the money which went into this account cannot be sustained. Whether the moneys deposited in this account were deposited by decedent, by Hosfeld or by Mrs. Herber is simply a matter of conjecture. It is essential before any conclusion can be reached as to the existence or nonexistence of a gift inter vivos that the identity of the donor, if there be a donor, be established by proof as to the original ownership of the moneys in this account.</p>
