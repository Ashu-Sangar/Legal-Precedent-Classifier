    <p id="b224-7" data-blocks='[["BL_224.10",224,[222,1018,1158,1126]]]'>Acting under Rule 3117, Pa. R.C.P., Rosenbaum notified Max Forman of the taking on June 6, 1962 of his oral depositions for the purpose of discovery of his assets in aid of execution on the judgment. At the time of such oral depositions, Max Forman admitted he had served as secretary-treasurer of Crown Wallpaper Co., a corporation, for more than 15 years, that he had made no gifts nor transferred any property to his wife and that he had no assets except three suits and an insurance policy. He was asked and refused to answer the following questions: (a) whether his wife was a stockholder in Crown Wallpaper Company; (b) whether his wife owned any real estate; (c) the name of his wife’s employer; (d) the identity of the stockholders of Crown Wallpaper Company; (e) to produce the joint income tax returns of himself and his wife. The basis for Max Forman’s refusal to answer these questions and produce the returns was the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, §5(e), 28 PS §317, as amended, which provides, in substance, that one spouse is incompetent to testify against the other.</p>
