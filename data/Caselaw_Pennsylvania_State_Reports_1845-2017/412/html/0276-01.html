The defendant was charged with operating his motor vehicle at the rate of seventy miles per hour on Route 22 in Hanover Township, Northampton County. An information was filed against the defendant with a justice of the peace in Hanover Township, by officers of the Pennsylvania State Police. The defendant-appellant waived the hearing before the justice of the peace and the matter was heard de novo by the Court of Quarter Sessions of North<a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>ampton County. After presentation of the Commonwealth’s evidence the appellant moved for a judgment of not guilty because the Commonwealth had failed to prove that official warning signs had been erected on the highway, indicating that radar was in operation, as provided by the 1961 Amendment to The Vehicle Code (Act of April 28, 1961, P. L. 108, §2, 75 P.S. §1002). The court below took judicial notice of the existence of official warning signs on Route 22.</p>
