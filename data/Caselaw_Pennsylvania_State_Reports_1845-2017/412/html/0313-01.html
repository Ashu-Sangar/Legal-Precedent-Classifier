He was walking on a sidewalk on the grounds surrounding Zembo Temple. He was en route to an automobile in the Zembo Temple parking lot. He alleges in his complaint that he proceeded down a flight of four steps and stepped on a slippery spot of ice, undulating and uneven in texture, with ridges and holes, sloppy with water and covering an irregular crumbling and broken portion of the sidewalk beneath.</p>

So reading, we find that during the day and the evening of January 20, there was freezing rain, sleet and snow. The two days previous, there was freezing weather and no precipitation. The plaintiff was preceded by two friends with whom he was in company and there were many people walking on the sidewalk ahead of them. A friend of the plaintiff, Mr. Tarr, testified: “Well, I couldn’t say whether I had taken three or four or five steps, but it was a very short time after we had reached the bottom of the steps there that you could feel with your feet that there was some sort of ice or something on it. We sort of slowed up.” He then turned and saw the plaintiff fall. Continuing to describe the condition, Mr. Tarr said: “Well, it felt when we got to the bottom of the steps, you could feel that in that first few feet from the steps that there were — seemed to be ridges and like holes which were very sloppy— they were holding water. I also noticed that when I knelt down beside Mr. Puskarich after he fell.” Mr. Carnicelli, a friend called as a witness, testified: “It was rough, it was icy, and the footing was very bad. Kiddingly I told — I was slipping and what not, and I told Mr. Puskarich just kiddingly, I said, ‘Watch that you don’t fall, you might put a hole in the concrete,’ because he was a big man.” He then saw Mr. Puskarich fall as he turned around to him. Mr. Puskarich described his fall as: “Only thing I remember I stepped <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>
      <em>some ice </em>or <em>some </em>stuff. Only thing I remember.” Walter Mehaffie, assistant superintendent of Zembo Temple, was called as a witness by the plaintiff and testified: “Q. Prior to January 20, 1959, had you had any difficulty with water drainage and seepage and cracked concrete in that area? A. Not to my knowledge. Q. Not to your knowledge? A. Not cracked concrete, no. Q. What condition of the concrete? A. You asked cracked concrete and I said not to my knowledge. Q. What was the condition? A. The only condition I ever noticed there was that the surface, the top surface of the concrete had become broken, and from time to time we replaced it.”</p>

Counsel agreed to the introduction of three photographs showing the sidewalk, which had been taken at a distance great enough to show the area of the sidewalk involved but not close enough for any detailed observation. The excluded photographs consist of two groups. One group of eleven pictures taken shortly after May 5, 1959, which showed a surface crumbling. The other group consisted of three photographs, taken January 27, 1962, which showed a new surface on that portion of the sidewalk referred to and shown by the other rejected pictures. None of the pictures showed the condition as it existed on the night of January 20, 1959. The appellant’s contention is that these photographs, disclosing the sidewalk’s surface to be irregular and crumbling in the area in which he fell, were proper exhibits from which the appellant and his witnesses could have established the continuing disintegration of the sidewalk surface and, of course, the photographs taken in January, 1962, showed repairs having been made to the area where the accident occurred. Appellant urges that with the proper instructions to the jury the excluded photographs were properly admissi<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>ble, relying on the authority of <em>Nyce v.

There, Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Bell said, at page 111: “Plaintiff contends that the Court erred by admitting photographs of the 7th and Cedar Streets intersection when they were taken two years after the accident and in the daytime. The Court admitted the photographs with this clear and specific limitation: ‘The exhibits will be received solely for the purpose of showing the permanent physical aspects at the intersection of 7th and Cedar and for no other purpose. The jury will understand that when these pictures get into your hands you will understand that they are here for the sole purpose of showing the permanent conditions at that corner. The streets seem to be wet in these pictures . . . and the evidence shows that that condition did not exist on January 19, 1951, and of course these pictures cannot show the visibility on January 19, 1951. They can show geometrically perhaps what could be seen, but not actually what was visible on account of the light at that particular time; for that limited purpose the exhibits will be received.’</p>

The trial judge sustained defendant’s objection, for the reason that the witness — not being adversely interested — did not come within the provisions of the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, §7, as amended by the Act of March 30, 1911, P. L. 35, §1, 28 P.S. §381. This section of the Act, as amended, was before the court in <em>Dinger v.

His contention is that the evidence established that the walking surface conditions on the roadways, sidewalks, and parking areas, immediately adjacent to Zembo Temple at the time of the accident, were such as to present an issue for jury determination. There was not sufficient evidence in the instant ease to submit a factual issue for the determination of a jury. The rec<a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>ord reveals a total lack of notice, either actual or constructive, as to the condition of the sidewalk prior to the accident.
