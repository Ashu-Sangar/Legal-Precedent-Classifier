Twenty-four hours later, after signing a petition asking court to appoint counsel to represent him, he again visited the murder scene with the police and described in detail the events of the unfortunate killing.

Under all of the circumstances disclosed by the record, this was not necessarily in itself unreasonable or too prolonged. There was no overpowering of the will. He was fed regularly and given reasonable opportunities to rest and sleep. Toilet and similar facilities were available at all times. No objections were voiced during his confinement as to his treatment. On January 20th, at his request, he was given the opportunity of talking privately with a minister for extended periods of time. On the same day, he was visited by his mother and wife, who consulted with him in the absence of police officers. It <em>was subsequent </em>to these occurrences that he evidenced a desire and willingness to clear his conscience and tell of his involvement. At the time, he was calm and composed. Under all of these circumstances, whether or not his statements were freely given was for the jury to determine. See, <em>Commonwealth v.

Implicit in the verdict of the jury is the conclusion that they were unanimously convinced that the confession was freely given. Of course, the defendant now accuses the police of brutality and other atrocities, but one would be hard put to believe these assertions in view of the strong testimony to the contrary. In this connection, also, it must be significantly noted that the defendant is a mature person, a high school graduate possessing an unusually high I.Q., and one who is no stranger to police techniques and custodial procedures.</p>
