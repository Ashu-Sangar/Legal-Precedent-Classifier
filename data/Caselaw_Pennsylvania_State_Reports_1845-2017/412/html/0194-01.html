Upon entering the dimly lit <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>hallway of the house, a fight occurred between Powell and Raymond, during which Powell was shot and fatally wounded.

Likewise, Bright visited the defendant, at the instance of the prosecuting officers, for the purpose of gaining information to help secure a conviction in the present case. By the same token, the defendant never requested the presence of his attorney, who had previously warned him not to talk. There was no request that he be summoned. If Raymond <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>desired to talk in tlie absence of Ms lawyer, it was not tlie obligation of the Commonwealth to gag him or act as his guardian.
