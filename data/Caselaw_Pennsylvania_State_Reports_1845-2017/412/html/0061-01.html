It is alleged that during the primary and general elections of 1961, the Republican Alliance collected and disbursed large sums of money in the promotion of its program and failed to publicly account therefor as required by law. An order is sought compelling the defendant to file an account in the proper office as required by the Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, §1608, 25 P.S. §3228.</p>

It prescribes how such accounts may be challenged and audited. It specifically designates the court of quarter sessions as the tribunal having jurisdiction of such proceedings. The present action is bottomed upon a violation of the Code, as the court below correctly recognized.

      <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>Lastly, it is claimed that jurisdiction should be asserted on the grounds of public policy. Again, we must disagree. The enunciation of matters of public policy is fundamentally within the power of the legislature. See, <em>Knecht v. Saint Mary’s Hospital, </em><a href="/pa/392/0075-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="392 Pa. 75" data-case-ids="8844984" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0075-01">392 Pa. 75</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=140%20A.2d%2030" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="140 A.2d 30">140 A. 2d 30</a> (1958). While the courts may in a proper case, in the absence of a legislative pronouncement, determine what is against public policy, as stated in <em>Mamlin v. Genoe, </em><a href="/pa/340/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="340 Pa. 320" data-case-ids="1203320" data-case-paths="/pa/340/0320-01">340 Pa. 320</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20A.2d%20407" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="17 A.2d 407">17 A. 2d 407</a> (1941) at 325: “It is only when a given policy is so obviously for or against the public health, safety, morals or welfare that there is a virtual unanimity of opinion in regard to it, that a court may constitute itself the voice of the community in so declaring.” See also, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. McCreary v.

This is not such a case. More importantly, the legislature has spoken and provided the remedy for resolving such matters and specifically designated the tribunal for such determination. If it intended to give jurisdictional power to a court of equity, such could easily have been expressed. As stated recently by this Court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Fox v. Swing, </em>supra, at 246, “It is not for us to legislate or by interpretation to add to legislation matters which the legislature saw fit not to include.”</p>

Section 1608 states that the account shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commonwealth when state-wide officers are involved, and with the county board of elections when the election involves other offices. Once the account is filed, section 1611 permits five electors to petition the court of quarter sessions of the county wherein the account is filed for an audit of such account. An appeal from the audit must be taken to the Superior Court.</p>
    <p id="b126-6" data-blocks='[["BL_126.7",126,[220,1378,1157,912]]]'>An examination of this statutory scheme demonstrates that the majority has failed to distinguish between the <em>filing </em>of an account and the <em>audit </em>of that account once it is filed. With regard to judicial supervision of the audit, the legislature has carefully designated the court which shall audit the account, the proper venue for such audit, and the procedure on appeal. With regard to judicial supervision over the filing of the account, however, the Code is significantly silent. Under these circumstances, the power to compel the performance of this statutory duty rests with the equity court below under the Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, §13, 17 P.S. §282, which empowers the courts of common pleas of Philadelphia County to act as courts of chancery for the “prevention ... of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals.”</p>
