    <p id="b228-4" data-blocks='[["BL_228.7",228,[219,443,1154,263]]]'>This appeal challenges the propriety of the action of the court below in refusing to permit the withdrawal of the entry of a general appearance by counsel for an additional corporate defendant which seeks to attack the court’s jurisdiction over its person.</p>
    <p id="b228-5" data-blocks='[["BL_228.8",228,[216,715,1157,1173]]]'>The use-plaintiff, Maryland Casualty Company, in the name of C. E. Williams Company (Williams) instituted an assumpsit action against Henry B. Pan-coast Company (Pancoast) alleging that Williams had purchased from Pancoast a certain “relief valve” for use in the construction of a public school, that this valve was impliedly warranted by Pancoast to be suitable for its intended use, that it was not suitable for such use and that, by reason of such unsuitability, certain damages from water occurred in the boiler room of a school constructed by Williams. Three months thereafter, Pancoast joined Watts Regulator Company (Watts) as an additional defendant, and, sometime thereafter, Pancoast filed and served a complaint against Watts alleging that the “relief valve” had been manufactured and sold by Watts to Pancoast, that, if the valve was defective as alleged by Williams, it was due to Watts’ negligence, that Watts breached its warranty to Pancoast, that Watts was solely liable to Williams and that, in order to protect its right of contribution against Watts, Pancoast joined Watts as an additional defendant.</p>
    <p id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.9",228,[215,1907,1154,152]]]'>On November 9, 1961 — 17 days after service on Watts of Pancoast’s complaint — Watts, by its counsel, entered a general appearance.</p>

Pancoast answered these objections.</p>
    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[210,551,1151,639]]]'>On October 5, 1962, a petition was presented to the court by Watts through its counsel wherein it was alleged that the entry of a general appearance had been <em>inadvertently </em>filed by Watts’ counsel and that such entry of appearance was filed contrary to counsel’s intention, without his knowledge and “before it was possible to stop such filing.” Upon a rule granted and answer filed, the matter was heard before Judge McClan aghan of Court of Common Pleas No. 1 of Philadelphia County who refused to permit the withdrawal of the general appearance. From that order this appeal was taken.</p>
