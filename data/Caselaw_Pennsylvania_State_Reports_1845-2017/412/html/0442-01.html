      <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>The complaint and cause of action against Goodman was based upon the allegations that he was a silent partner in the agency, or at least that the plaintiff was led to believe that this was so, and was induced into entering the contract of employment by statements of Goodman to that effect. In other words, that Goodman was estopped from denying that he was a partner in the company as far as the plaintiff, Lazarus, was concerned.</p>
    <p id="b504-4" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[232,828,1153,97]]]'>From the evidence, the jury could have found the following facts:</p>
    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[229,936,1157,476]]]'>Lazarus, assistant manager of a Pittsburgh health and accident insurance agency, hired Harris and Hirsch to work for that company. Subsequently, Harris and Hirsch resigned these positions and organized their own agency. They were aided and advised in this project by Goodman, the father-in-law of Hirsch. It was Goodman who contacted the home office of a national company to negotiate a contract on behalf of the new agency.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[225,1424,1157,854]]]'>Subsequently, Harris and Hirsch approached Lazarus and asked him to work for the new agency. These parties had many conferences, but no decisions could be reached until Goodman was consulted. Finally, Lazarus was invited to confer with Goodman. A meeting was arranged in late April or early May of 1958, with the plaintiff and all three defendants present. Lazarus was offered the position of manager of the agency’s office in Virginia at a salary of $250 per week, and expenses up to $35 per week, and one-third of the profits. Goodman took an active part in the discussions. When Lazarus expressed concern over the financial responsibility of the agency, Goodman said that he was a silent partner and backing the company one hundred per cent. Following this, Lazarus agreed to take the position.</p>
    <p id="b505-3" data-blocks='[["BL_505.3",505,[186,333,1148,262]]]'>
      <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>Two or three weeks later, an attorney, who had represented Goodman for several years, reduced the agreement to writing. It was executed by the plaintiff, by Harris and by Hirscli, on May 16, 1958. Goodman did not sign the contract, nor was he mentioned therein.</p>
    <p id="b505-4" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[188,605,1146,206]]]'>Lazarus accepted the new position, resigned from his old job, and moved his family to Virginia, as a result of Goodman’s assurance that he was a partner in the company.</p>
    <p id="b505-5" data-blocks='[["BL_505.5",505,[186,821,1149,424]]]'>Under these facts, it is clear that the question of Goodman’s status in the company, as far as the plaintiff was concerned, was for the jury. If they are true, we have: (1) A representation by Goodman that he was a partner; (2) A reliance upon that representation by Lazarus; (3) A change in position by Lazarus in reliance upon Goodman’s representation. These are the essentials of a partnership by estoppel.</p>
    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.6",505,[184,1264,1151,475]]]'>The Uniform Partnership Act of March 26, 1915, P. L. 18, §16, 59 P.S. §38, states that: “(1) When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents himself, or consents to another representing him to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership..., he is liable to any such person to whom such representation has been made, who has, on the faith of such representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership; ....</p>

This occurs when one holds himself out, or knowingly permits himself to be held out, as a partner in a particular firm. He is thereby rendered liable upon contracts made by his apparent partners for the firm to third persons who knew of and <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>acted in reliance upon such representations, or holding out. Estoppel is based upon the principle that if a man holds himself out, either actively or passively, or permits himself to be held out as a member of a partnership, and so induces third parties to deal with the firm and extend credit upon the belief that the party estopped was a member thereof, and upon credit of this party, when otherwise they would not have so dealt, he should not then be allowed to deny his apparent connection with the partnership, and so escape liability, . . . . [T]he parties are liable to one induced thereby to give credit, the ground of such liability not being under direct representations between the parties, but upon the principles of general policy to prevent fraud.”</p>
