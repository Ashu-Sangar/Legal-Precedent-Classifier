These certificates, dated August 2, 1954, bore interest at 1% per annum from the date of issue and were payable at maturity on March 22, 1955 and were not to be “subject to call for redemption prior to maturity”. It was provided that such unregistered certificates would “be accepted at par plus accrued interest to maturity in payment of income and profits taxes due March 15, 1955”. On original subscription, the taxpayer purchased $20,000,000 of these certificates and, thereafter, on the open market, an additional $22,000,000. On March 7 and 8, 1955, the taxpayer delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Bank) certificates aggregating $42,000,000 face value and received from the Bank certain receipts. These receipts, addressed to the Director of Internal Revenue at Albany, N. Y. (Director), recited that Treasury Certificates of Indebtedness aggregating $42,266,959.12 ($42,000,000 principal and $266,959.12 interest) were held by the Bank “for redemption and application of the proceeds in payment of taxes due” on March 15, 1955 from the taxpayer.

In its initial opinion (p. 56a), the court below characterized this transaction as “a temporary investment of money set aside for taxes and for the actual use of payment of tax”. In its later opinion (p. 71a), the court stated: “. . . the securities were not ‘investments’ in any sense of the word for the [taxpayer] did not put its money into these certificates with the intention of securing income or profit” but for the purpose of paying its income taxes with them. In and of itself it is relatively unimportant what <em>label </em>we attach to the type of transaction whereby the taxpayer put its funds into these certificates. However, the taxpayer urges that the transaction was an <em>investment </em>by it which falls squarely within <em>Koppers, </em>supra, wherein the Court said (p. 533) : “Lastly, proceeds from all securities in which the corporation <em>invests </em>are included in the gross receipts fraction . . . .” (Emphasis supplied). In <em>Koppers, </em>the Court’s reference was to <em>investments </em>in the usual and ordinary sense of that term, i.e., where a corporation, for the purpose of an enhancement of the value of its principal and/or for an increase in the yield of income from such principal, purchases securities; inherent in such venture is a calculated risk of the principal and its dominant purpose is clearly the production of profit or income for general corporate purposes. In the case at bar, when the taxpayer purchased these certificates, it did, in a sense, <em>invest </em>such funds (cf: <em>Arbuckle’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/324/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="324 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="1171307" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0501-01">324 Pa. 501</a>, 510, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20758" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="188 A. 758">188 A. 758</a>) but its investment was of a totally <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>different kind and character from the ordinary and usual investment. The corporate funds which the taxpayer utilized had been earmarked for the payment of its federal income and profits taxes which would fall due on March 15, 1955. In the placement of its funds in these securities, the taxpayer’s dominant purpose was the preservation, not the enhancement, of the principal and the payment of taxes, not the production of income for corporate purposes. The attractive feature of such securities to the taxpayer lay in the fact that such securities served its dominant purpose and at the same time provided a small yield of income. The placement by the taxpayer of its funds in these securities involved no risk of principal and was in the nature of a deposit by the taxpayer of its tax-earmarked funds and for the use of such funds, while on such quasi-deposit, the government paid interest until such time as the taxes became actually due and payable.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">7</a> Even if such transaction be considered an <em>investment </em>of funds, it was not the type of <em>investment </em>contemplated by this Court in <em>Koppers.</em>

In the case at bar, the underlying purpose of the purchase of the certificates was not the production of corporate profit or income but the payment of corporate tax obligations. In effect, by the purchase of these certificates, the taxpayer prepaid its federal taxes and the government paid the taxpayer for the use of its money in the interim period between the date of purchase and the date the taxes were due.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">8</a> Nothing in the transaction reveals the “employment” of taxpayer’s funds for corporate profit or income; on the contrary, the transaction, a prepayment of taxes, constituted an expenditure of funds.
