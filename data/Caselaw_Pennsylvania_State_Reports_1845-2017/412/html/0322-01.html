Rosenfeld, a medical doctor, and J. Orville Van Horn and Jane W. Van Horn, individually and trading as Anglecott Sanatorium. Doctor Rosenfeld was charged with malpractice in causing infection of Mrs. Levin’s liver and in failing to properly diagnose and treat her. The Van Horns were accused of negligence in not providing Mrs. Levin with proper care and neglecting to report to Doctor Rosenfeld as well as administering drugs to her not authorized by the doctor and otherwise acting contrary to the doctor’s orders.</p>

    <p id="b384-9" data-blocks='[["BL_384.11",384,[219,1705,1153,633]]]'>Mrs. Levin had been a patient of Doctor Rosenfeld for about 16 years prior to January 18, 1957. She had suffered many serious illnesses including surgeries during this time. The events relevant to the instant matter, and for which appellants make claims, began on December 24, 1956, when Mrs. Levin called on Doctor Rosenfeld complaining that her knees were stiff and painful. After examination the Doctor administered injections of hydrocortisone into each knee joint cavity and she was given other medication to be taken orally. Subsequently, her condition worsened to the extent that she was unable to walk or stand. .</p>

The appearance of the extracted fluid did not indicate the presence of infection. HoAvever, it Avas decided because of Mrs. Levin’s condition that it Avould be advisable to have her in a nursing home. The next day, January 4, 1957, she Avas admitted to the Anglecott Sanatorium under the care of Doctor Rosenfeld. Her condition did not improve and Mr. Levin became alarmed and had his Avife transferred to Jefferson Hospital on January 19, 1957. Doctor Rosenfeld did not attend Mrs. Levin thereafter. She remained a patient in Jefferson Hospital until April 6, 1957. Later, on tivo occasions, Mrs. LeAÚn Avas a patient in Jefferson Hospital.</p>

Van Horn, as a registered nurse, should have recognized signs of over-medication and should have stopped further administration of drugs to Mrs. Levin.</p>

Plaintiffs, in their action against Doctor Rosenfeld, charged him Avith malpractice in negligently introducing a staphylococcus infection into Mrs. Levin’s knees and failing to employ the usual and accepted standards of the medical profession in diagnosing her condition after he Avas placed on notice of the likelihood of infections, and in over-medicating Mrs. Levin in an effort to cure her.</p>

      <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>There was evidence that the infection of the knees developed after Mrs. Levin was hospitalized and that she was not infected at the time of her admission. Much expert medical testimony was submitted to the jury which is not relevant here. Subsequent to Mrs. Levin’s admission to the hospital in January, 1957, Mr. Levin called Doctor Rosenfeld on the telephone. Mr. Levin told Doctor Rosenfeld in narrative form<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> his wife’s condition at the time of transfer from Anglecott to Jefferson Hospital and the information given to Mr. Levin by three attending physicians who examined hér immediately upon admittance. He related in detail the subsequent events, including tests made and the treatment given and the response of Mrs. Levin to the medical treatment, as he had been informed by the physicians in attendance. Mr. Levin told Doctor Rosenfeld that in the opinion of certain physicians at Jefferson Hospital, there was no justification for Mrs. Levin having received cortisone injections and that these injections introduced the staphylococcus infection into her knees and she had been over-medicated in an attempt to cure. After relating the medical report Mr. Levin went on to say “The attending physicians as I’ve said before all agree that my wife’s illness was induced by her physician and on several occasions they asked me who our physician was. I told them that I would rather not discuss it.</p>

There is also an indication that my wife will probably have to spend from three to four weeks longer at the hospital before she can come home and will have to have <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>treatments after she gets home. My wife did not have to be ill like this and no amount of money will ever repay for her suffering.

    <p id="b387-4" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[205,609,1154,1728]]]'>The trial judge would not permit this evidence. Appellants contend these statements made by Mr. Levin were not offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter contained in the statements but rather as evidence of an admission based upon Doctor Rosenfeld’s silence in response thereto. The appellants were attempting to prove an admission by silence. The trial judge ruled correctly in rejecting this evidence. <em>Smith v. American Stores </em>Company, <a href="/pa-super/156/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="156 Pa. Super. 375" data-case-ids="1058323" data-case-paths="/pa-super/156/0375-01">156 Pa.

Com. v. Vallone, <a href="/pa/347/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="347 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1217339" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0419-01">347 Pa. 419</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20889" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="32 A.2d 889">32 A. 2d 889</a>.

In that case a defendant had been introduced as ‘one of the bosses’ of a gambling house and failed to deny it.

    <p id="b388-5" data-blocks='[["BL_388.4",388,[218,871,1155,1120]]]'>Appellants attempted to offer in evidence Doctor Rosenfeld’s check payable to cash in the amount of two hundred dollars, which was dated June 27, 1957 and uncashed, and the envelope in which it was mailed to Mr. Levin, together with two letters to Doctor Rosenfeld from Mr. Levin. The letter of April 1957 told of Mrs. Levin’s release from the hospital and transfer to a Rehabilitation Center. It described her condition and related the therapy to be given Mrs. Levin. Mr. Levin said he paid all the hospital bills but had not received the attending physicians’ statements. In the letter of May 1957, Mr. Levin said he had taken his wife home. He described her condition and the necessary arrangements made for her and the nursing and medical care which she would require while at home. The letter set forth in detail the expenses paid and those incurred but not paid, and the money Mr. Levin borrowed. The letter went on to say that when the final statements were received he would call the Doctor to have his insurance representative call on Mr. Levin.</p>

      <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>The trial judge rejected the appellants’ offer on the ground that it was self-serving. It was self-serving and properly rejected. An attempt then was made by appellants to introduce this evidence by deleting portions of the letter and phone conversation that were objectionable. The trial judge considered the letters, check and prior phone call related and denied the admission of any part. Indeed, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to delete the objectionable portions when the proffered evidence consisted of nearly all objectionable matter. If, as appellants contend, the only purpose was to show a continuing demand or a prior demand, it was a simple thing to do, if done in a proper manner. The mere fact of the demand alone could have been stated. A similar situation — legally if not factually — arose in <em>Emmons v. McCreery, </em><a href="/pa/307/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="307 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="1138167" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0062-01">307 Pa. 62</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20722" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="160 A. 722">160 A. 722</a> (1932). The plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant demanding payment of his supposed loss and therein set forth a complete cause of action for the loss. The Court said (p. 66) : “This is a novel way to seek to sustain a cause of action. If such a letter is admissible without qualifications, a suitor could have his attorney send in letter form to his adversary a statement of facts, true or untrue, setting forth a complete claim, and, on receipt of an answer, have the letter admitted in evidence as substantive proof of the claim, or, in case of failure to reply, also admit the letter.

Nursing Home records as to signs of over-medication. The judge based his ruling on the absence of the averment in the amended complaint, alleging a failure to note over-medication as an averment of negligence. There was an averment charging the defendants with failure to give proper, timely and adequate nursing care and attention. This general allegation in the circumstances of the instant case was insufficient to permit evidence of the specific negligence of failure to notice any manifestation of over-medication. The trial judge properly excluded evidence of over-medication in the absence of an affirmative allegation of such.</p>
