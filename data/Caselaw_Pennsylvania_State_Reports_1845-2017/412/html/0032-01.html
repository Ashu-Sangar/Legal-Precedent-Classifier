Taylor, President of Bulletin Company and General Manager of The Bulletin, and Earl Selby, who is City Editor of The Evening and Sunday Bulletin, which are newspapers of widespread general circulation. The subpoena to appear before the Grand Jury arose out of the Grand Jury’s investigation of John J. Fitzpatrick, and statements made by him concerning alleged solicitation, bribery, corruption and crime. The subpoena directed Taylor and Selby to bring with them (a) “All tape recordings, written statements, Memoranda of interviews, conversations, conferences had with John J. Fitzpatrick”; and (b) “All copies of statements given by John J. Fitzpatrick to the District Attorney<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">*</a> on February 20, 1962, portions of which appeared in the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin on December 30, 1962;” and (a) “all tape recordings of conferences, interviews, discussions, interrogations or conversations with John Fitzpatrick”; (b) “all memorandum, notes, reports and other documents of or pertaining to conferences, interviews, discussions, interrogations or conversations with John Fitzpatrick”; (c) “all memorandum, notes, reports and other documents of or pertaining to investigations conducted as a result of information furnished by John Fitzpatrick”; (d) “all records of expenses incurred directly or indirectly in gathering information from, or conducting conferences, investigations, discussions, interrogations or conversations with John Fitzpatrick”; (e) “all documents of or pertaining to the examination of John Fitzpatrick by polygraph, examiners, physicians, psychologists or other experts”; and (f) “any and all other documents of or pertaining to John Fitzpatrick”.</p>

The article consisted primarily of questions put to, and answers made by John J. Fitzpatrick, a former Democratic ward leader and a former Sergeant at Arms of City Council, on February 20, 1962, during one of the four times he was interrogated by the District Attorney’s office. The article stated, inter alia, that the District Attorney had refused to make transcripts of these interrogations public, but that The Bulletin now had access to them. Near the close of the article it was stated that the interrogations ended with the Assistant District Attorney saying he would go over the record for further questions. The article then added: “However, much of the subsequent questioning dealt with what John Fitzpatrick had told Bulletin reporters.” This last sentence is particularly important in the consideration of one of the questions involved, as will hereinafter more fully appear.</p>

Thereupon the Assistant District Attorney brought these witnesses before Judge Gold, Taylor on January 21, 1963 and Selby on January 22, 1963. On these occasions both witnesses for the above reasons again respectfully refused to answer certain questions propounded by the Assistant District Attorney and allowed by the Court, which questions in their opinion and in the opinion of their counsel were privileged and should not be disclosed.

Judge Kelley further held (1) that appellants were <em>not </em>required to produce an alleged copy of statements made by John Fitzpatrick to the District Attorney’s office on February 20, 1962 and set forth in part in The Bulletin on December 30, 1962, since, inter alia, the result might be to disclose the identity of the transmitter of the alleged copy to The Bulletin; (2) that appellants were <em>not </em>required to produce memoranda, notes, reports and other documents of or pertaining to investigations conducted by The Bulletin as a result of information furnished by John Fitzpatrick, since such investigations, made on leads furnished by Fitzpatrick, would doubtless encompass confidential interviews with other persons who would give information only if their identity were kept secret; (3) that appellants were <em>not </em>required to produce the results of alleged polygraph (lie-detector) tests given to Fitzpatrick, since, inter alia, this would reveal the identity of the experts who conducted such tests; but (4) that appellants <em>were </em>required to produce documents and tape recordings allegedly evidencing that John J.

The common and approved meaning or usage of the words “source of information” includes documents as well as personal informants. Statutory Construction Act, May 28, 1937, P.

Nevertheless, independent newspapers are today the principal watch-dogs and protectors of honest, as well as good, Government. They are, more than anyone else, the principal guardians of the general welfare of the Community and, with few exceptions, they serve their City, State or Nation with high principles, zeal and fearlessness.

Judge Kelley based his ruling principally if not solely on his conclusion that the Bulletin had waived the privilege created by the Act of 1937 by publishing in its aforesaid article on December 30, 1962, the single sentence hereinabove quoted: “However, much of the subsequent questioning dealt with what John Fitzpatrick had told Bulletin reporters.” This obviously gave Fitzpatrick as the leading source, but the identity of many other persons may have been revealed in the questions and/or the answers.</p>

In 1937, our legislature modified this body of law by providing that “no person . . . employed by any newspaper of general circulation . . . shall be required to disclose the <em>source of any information </em>procured or obtained by such per<a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>son. . . .” (Emphasis supplied). The purpose of this statute is to encourage the flow of news from persons who might otherwise fear the unfavorable publicity or retribution resulting from the revelation of their name as the source of the news story. This purpose is accomplished by permitting the newsman to conceal the name of the informant. In other words, <em>it is the name of the informant and not the information itself which is protected. </em>Once the name of the informant is revealed, the purpose and protection of the Act is terminated.</p>

The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, Atlanta Constitution, and St. Louis Post Dispatch, have all prospered and served their communities in the highest tradition, without any privilege to conceal sources of <em>information </em>— let <em>alone </em>the information itself — and some slight authority can be found to say that they do so even better than the Bulletin.</p>

The majority finally concludes that only the newsman can decide whether or not to waive the privilege. Hence, according to the majority, the privilege is considerably broader than the lawyer-client, physician-patient, and priest-penitent privileges, all of which may be waived by the communicant. This “liberal” construction of the Act of 1937 results in a complete distortion of the legislative purpose of encouraging the flow of news; newsmen now have a license to prevent news from ever reaching the public — including that’which would expose corruption in government — although the informant’s identity is disclosed and he himself desires that the information be made public.</p>
