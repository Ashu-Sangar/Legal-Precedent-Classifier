Subsequently he was stationed in Alabama, and later in Greenland. During the latter tour of duty, defendant’s wife and two children lived with his parents in New Jersey. Because this arrangement proved incompatible, defendant returned to the United States on emergency leave in order to move his family to their own quarters. On his wife’s insistence, defendant was forced first to secure a “compassionate transfer” back to the States, and subsequently to resign from the Army in July of 1960, by.which time he had attained the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. Defendant was a hard worker, earned a substantial salary and bore a very good reputation among his neighbors.</p>

Allegedly this contributed to her mental disorder which was later diagnosed as a schizoid personality type. In 1959 she underwent psychiatric treatment at the mental hygiene clinic in Aberdeen, Maryland. She complained of nervousness and told the examining doctor “I feel like hurting my children.” This sentiment sometimes took the form of sadistic “discipline” toward their very young children. Nevertheless, upon her discharge from the clinic, the doctors considered her much improved. With this background we come to the immediate events of the crime.</p>

On the evening of January 16, 1962, defendant returned home and told his wife that he had been temporarily assigned to teach at a school in Chambersburg, which would necessitate his absence from home four xdghts out of seven for a ten week period. A violent and protracted argument ensued at the dinner table and continued until four o’clock in the morning.</p>

I became angry axxd more angry especially what she was saying about my kids and myself, and sometime between 3 and <em>4 </em>o’clock ixx the morning I remembered the gun on the window sill over my head.

He started to think about the children, “seeing my older son’s feet what happened to them. I could see the bruises on him and Michael’s chin was split open, four stitches. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to help my boys. Sometime in there she said something in there, she called me some kind of name. I kept thinking of this. <em>During this time I either thought or felt </em>— I <em>thought of the gun, just thought of the gun. </em>I am not sure whether I felt my hand move toward the gun — I saw my hand move, the next thing— the only thing I can recollect after that is right after <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>the shots or right during the shots I saw the gun in my hand just pointed at my wife’s head. She was still lying on her back — I mean her side. I could smell the gunpowder and I could hear something — it sounded like running water. I didn’t know what it was at first, didn’t realize what I’d done at first. Then I smelled it. I smelled blood before. . . .” “Q. At the time you shot her, Donald, were you fully aware and intend to do what you did? A. I don’t know positively. All I remember hearing was two shots and feeling myself go cold all of a sudden.”</p>

He tried to clean up as well as he could. That night he took his wife’s body, wrapped in a blanket with a rug over it to a desolate place near a trash dump. He then took the children to his parents’ home in Magnolia, New Jersey. He was arrested the nest Monday in Chambersburg where he had gone to his teaching assignment.</p>

However, even if we believe all of defendant’s statements and testimony, there is no doubt that this killing constituted murder in the first degree. Defendant first urges that there was insufficient time for premeditation in the light of his good reputation. This is based on an isolated and oft repeated statement in <em>Commonwealth v. Drum, </em><a href="/pa/58/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="58 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1013212" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0009-01">58 Pa. 9</a>, 16, that “ bio time is too short for a wicked man to frame in his mind his scheme of murder.’ ” Defendant argues that, conversely, a long time is necessary to find premeditation in a “good man.” We find no merit in defendant’s analogy or contention. As Chief Justice Maxey appropriately and correctly said in <em>Commonwealth v. Earnest, </em><a href="/pa/342/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="342 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1206883" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0544-01">342 Pa. 544</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.2d%2038" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="21 A.2d 38">21 A. 2d 38</a> (pages 549-550) : “Whether the intention to kill and the killing, that is, the premeditation and the fatal act, were within a brief space of time or a long space of time is immaterial if the killing was in fact intentional, wilful, deliberate and premeditated. ... As Justice Agnew said in Com. v. Drum: “The law fixes up<a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>on no length of time as necessary to form the intention to kill, but leaves the existence of a fully formed intent as a fact to be determined by the jury, from all the facts and circumstances in the evidence.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b594-4" data-blocks='[["BL_594.4",594,[244,556,1154,425]]]'>Defendant further contends that the time and place of the crime, the enormous difficulty of removing and concealing the body, and the obvious lack of an escape plan, militate against and make a finding of premeditation legally impossible. This is a “jury argument”; it is clear as crystal that such circumstances do not negate premeditation. This contention of defendant is likewise clearly devoid of merit.</p>
    <p id="b594-5" data-blocks='[["BL_594.5",594,[235,990,1162,1236]]]'>Defendant’s most earnestly pressed contention is that the <em>psychiatrist’s opinion </em>of what <em>defendanfs state of mind must have been and was at the time of the crime, </em>clearly establishes not only the lack but also the legal impossibility of premeditation. Dr. Davis, a psychiatrist of the Allegheny County Behavior Clinic, testified that defendant was “for a number of years . . . passively going along with a situation which he . . . [was] not controlling and he . . . [was] not making any decisions, and finally a decision . . . [was] forced on him .... He had left the military to take this assignment, and he was averaging about nine thousand a year; he had a good job. He knew that if he didn’t accept this teaching assignment in all probability he would be dismissed from the Government service, and at his age and his special training he didn’t know whether he would be able to find employment. More critical to that was the fact that at this point, as we understand it, his wife issued an ultimatum that if he went and gave this training course she would leave him .... He was so dependent upon her he didn’t want her to leave. He couldn’t make up his mind what to do. He was trapped. . . .”</p>

Onr feeling was that if this gun had fallen to the floor he wouldn’t have been able to pick it up and consummate that homicide. And I think if he had to load the gun he wouldn’t have done it.

Thirdly, a psychiatrist’s opinion of a defendant’s impulse or lack of intent or state of mind is, in this class of case, entitled to very little weight, and this is especially so when defendant’s own actions, or his testimony or confession, or the facts themselves, belie the opinion.</p>
