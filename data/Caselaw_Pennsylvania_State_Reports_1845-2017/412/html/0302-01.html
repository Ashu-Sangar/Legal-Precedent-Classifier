It was granted a certificate of public convenience by the Ohio authorities and began business as a public utility on March 25, 1957. The present Laurel Company is the result of merger of the two companies. The Ohio corporation became a parent company through acquisition of the shares of the Pennsylvania corporation. This acquisition was approved on October 1, 1957, by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, and on October 7, 1957, the parent company was granted permission to do business in Pennsylvania. The merger of the two companies was begun in July, 1959, and became effective January 1, 1960, following approval on November 23, 1959, by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. The Commission’s certificate of public convenience authorized Laurel Pipe Line Company, a foreign public utility, to engage in transporting, storing and distributing petroleum and petroleum products by means of pipelines and appurtenances for the public, extending generally westward from a point near Philadelphia to the vicinity of Pittsburgh, and then northwesterly to the Pennsylvania-Ohio border.</p>

Its Booth station in Delaware County receives shipments of products from tank farms of its shippers in the Philadelphia and New Jersey area, which shipments are then moved westward to various take-off stations along the route.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> From Booth station to Mechanics-burg, the pipeline is 24 inches in diameter.

At this station (called Aliquippa) are fourteen tanks, several buildings and other facilities. No deliveries are made at Independence and no products are there received for shipment.

In other words, by the time shipments of specific products reach Aliquippa, they may be in smaller than 25,000 barrels because of diversions into previous take-off terminals, which may have been scheduled at the very last minute.</p>
      <p id="b371-5" data-blocks='[["BL_371.2",371,[195,975,1150,448]]]'>“In addition to the cancellation problem, the temporary diversion to allow more urgently needed products to go into the line at Aliquippa, and minimum barrel requirements, there are further reasons for the working tankage at Aliquippa. ... In order to keep the pipeline full, products can be pumped out of Aliquippa during only a fraction of the operating hours. Of course, due to scheduling requirements east of Aliquippa, batches may be coming into Aliquippa while schedule west of Aliquippa does not warrant shipments out of Aliquippa. Therefore, incoming batches will be diverted into temporary tankage at Aliquippa.</p>
      <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.3",371,[191,1439,1152,731]]]'>“The present usage of the fourteen tanks presently being operated at Aliquippa (it should be noted at this point that Laurel owns sufficient real estate at its Aliquippa Station for the erection of further tankage as and if required by the future business of additional shippers) is necessary to preserve the brand identity of products presently transported by Laurel and they are not permanently assigned to any one product brand or shipper. In fact, if, in the near future, additional shippers should make use of Laurel pipeline facilities, their individual products could also be accommodated with the present physical capacity of the Aliquippa Station. The products transmitted through Laurel pipeline are always the property of the shipper. However, it should be reemphasized that no shipper has any authority over the scheduling or re-scheduling of any of its products nor over its retention temporarily in tankage at Booth Station or Aliquippa Station according to the judgment of the Laurel scheduler.”</p>

The need for new business is emphasized and underscored by the extremely low volume of business which Laurel presently enjoys and which is more costly and burdensome than as if Laurel were able to secure a larger throughput volume.”</p>
