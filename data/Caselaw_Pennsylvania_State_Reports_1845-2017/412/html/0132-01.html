In reaching that conclusion, the court relied in large measure upon <em>Commonwealth v. Donovan, </em>76 Dauph. 191. In <em>Donovan </em>(p. 192), the court said that . . prior to the adoption of the [Act] this taxpayer’s activities would not be manufacturing as that term has been defined . . . under other tax statutes. . . . The cases hold that a ‘new and different’ product must emerge or the activity is something less than manufacture.” With that summary of the law prior to the Act we are in accord. However, in the statutes which antedated the Act and out of the construction of which evolved this judicial definition of “manufacture” or “manufacturing”, generally there was no definition of “manufae<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>ture” and the courts resorted to the popular conception of the meaning of that term.

It was the duty of the court to apply that definition of “manufacture” which the legislature set forth in the instant Act and not to substitute therefor judicial definitions of that term under prior tax statutes.</p>

Where the legislature, in a later statute, uses the same language as used in a prior statute which has been construed by the courts, there is a presumption that the language thus repeated is to be interpreted in the same manner such language had been previously interpreted when the court passed on the earlier statute: <em>Jones and Laughlin Tax Assessment Case, </em><a href="/pa/405/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="405 Pa. 421" data-case-ids="1303596" data-case-paths="/pa/405/0421-01">405 Pa. 421</a>, 432-3, <a href="/citations/?q=175%20A.2d%20856" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="175 A.2d 856">175 A. 2d 856</a>; <em>Parisi v.

We have long held that, <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>where a statute contains its own definition, the meaning of the terms as defined at common law or as constructed under prior statutes is not controlling: <em>Blauner’s, Inc. v.

By specifically defining “manufacture”, the legislature indicated its intent that “manufacture” be construed in accordance with the statutory language and that the construction of such word was not to be controlled by prior judicial construction of such word under prior tax statutes. By way of example, the Act provides that the finished product be “different” from that form in which it was acquired whereas under prior judicial construction the finished product had to be both <em>“new and </em>different”.</p>
