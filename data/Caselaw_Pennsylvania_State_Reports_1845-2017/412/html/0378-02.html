Pease, Jr. (Pease), entered into a written contract with the School District of Millcreek Township, Erie County (District) under the terms of which the District employed Pease as a professional employee at a stated salary, and, in accordance with his duties under the contract, he taught in McDowell High School. During the school years 1958-1959 and 1960-1961, Pease had been employed by the District as a teacher of history and problems of democracy and during the school year 1959-1960 he had taught in Alaska. It is conceded that, as a classroom teacher in his qualified subjects, Pease always earned completely satisfactory ratings. Pease entered upon his teaching duties and continued to serve the District in that capacity until December 21, 1961 at which time he was dismissed, effective December 31, 1961, by the Board of school directors of the District (Board) on the grounds of incompetence, persistent negligence and persistent and wilful violation of the school laws.

On September 5, 1961 — at the opening of the school year— Pease learned for the first time that, in addition to his classroom duties, he had been assigned to act as the sponsor of a boys’ bowling club for the school year. The bowling sessions — which took place at a privately operated bowling alley located approximately one and one-half miles from the McDowell High School — oc<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>curred after school hours one day each week during the twenty-six week school term, each session lasting approximately two and one-half hours.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> The school did not bear any costs whatsoever of such bowling, each boy paying his own transportation to the alley as well as the cost of his individual bowling. There were no intramural nor intersclxolastic bowling teams and the boys in the bowling club did not compete intramurally or in ter scholastically. It was not intended that the sponsor teach, coach or instruct in bowling but simply that the sponsor be in attendance at the alley while the bowling took place to maintain, if necessary, discipline among the boys. Even though the formation of the bowling club had received Board sanction, nevertheless, it was simply a voluntary association of boys who desired to bowl.</p>
    <p id="b443-3" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[191,1203,1149,584]]]'>Upon notification of his assignment to this extracurricular activity, Pease notified both the high school principal and the superintendent of schools in the District that he would not accept the assignment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The matter was referred to the Board which, after attempts to compromise the matter, finally, by resolution, formally assigned Pease to sponsor the boys’ bowling. Upon Pease’s refusal to accept the assignment, the Board preferred written charges against him and, after hearings, dismissed him. As stated above, on appeal, the Superintendent reinstated him.</p>

These con<a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>elusions were: (1) that the <em>type </em>of assignment was within the contemplation of the parties at the time Pease was employed; (2) that, even though the bowling activity had not formally been adopted by the Board, such <em>formal </em>approval was not required under the Public School Code; (3) that, even though the Board had made no rules or regulations regarding the <em>manner of supervision </em>by the sponsor of the bowling activity, the absence of such rules and regulations did not affect the propriety of this assignment; (4) the assignment to supervise the bowling activity was within the scope of Pease’s duties as a teacher; (5) that the assignment was not of an unprofessional nature. The only area of disagreement between the Board and the Superintendent is to be found in two conclusions of the latter: (1) that the Board failed to adopt reasonable rules and regulations as to the <em>manner of assignment </em>of teachers to extracurricular duties so that such assignment would be fairly and impartially made; (2) that, under the instant factual situation, Pease’s assignment was not reasonably made. The Superintendent’s final conclusion was that, for these reasons, Pease “was under no contractual obligation to accept this assignment and thus the charge of incompetency on this basis cannot be sustained.”</p>

All of his duties are taken into consideration in his contract for employment in the annual salary. All of this is, of course, subject to the test of reasonableness. . . . What is reasonable must necessarily depend upon the facts of the situation and the teachers are protected in that regard by the appropriate administrative and judicial procedure. Supervising the students and being present to protect their welfare at school athletic and social activities, conducted under the name and auspices of the school, is within the scope of the contract and such assignments are proper so long as they are distributed impartially, they are reasonable in number and hours of duty and each teacher has his share of such duty.”</p>

There is no varsity bowling team nor is there competition between home rooms or other subdivisions of the school on an intramural basis. In this respect, bowling by the McDowell students differs but little from other activities of students having a common desire to swim, learn magic, or to do any one of a thousand things which interest high school children. Coaching, instructing or guiding at the bowling alleys are not required of the professional employe, and the only possible excuse for the schools’ interest after hours is super<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>vision. But, schools have no duty to supervise students in theii* play after school and off school premises when such play is not genuinely connected with the school program. If the rule were otherwise, a professional employee could be required to act as lifeguard over a group of students desiring merely to disport themselves on the beach, or he could be required to sit idly by in a private home or other place while students play chess, bridge, or construct models of aircraft, merely to see to it that the participants behave themselves. Such supervisory chores might make some contribution toward fostering recreation and incidentally make some contribution to the physical, moral, or mental development of the children, but they would not be properly related to the program of the school no matter how long continued and no matter what school sanction was obtained. Supervision of after-school, off-the-premises play must fall either upon the family or a social agency created for the purpose whenever the sole activity is recreation and fun unrelated to education. Concededly, generalities in these matters are impermissible, for each case must stand on its own facts. There are circumstances under which school supervision off the school premises after hours is indicated and proper, and there are circumstances under which it is improper. The facts of this case bring the matter within the latter group.” With these statements we are in accord.</p>

On the other hand, the record indicates an attitude on Pease’s part which, while it falls short of the stated grounds for dismissal under the Public School Code, we cannot condone or approve. What we now decide is that the activity to which Pease was assigned was not so related to the school program as to justify the Board’s action, under Section 511(c) of the Public School Code, in making this assignment; in short, the Board exceeded its authority on the facts as presented.</p>
