Appellee, Louis Izzi, was a passenger in the truck. Initially, Izzi sued P.T.C.; P.T.C. joined Douthart as additional defendant. Douthart also sued P.T.C. By stipulation of counsel the cases were consolidated for trial. Although the exact verdict which was rendered is challenged, we are satisfied that the jury returned two verdicts against P.T.C., one of $58,423.75 in favor of Izzi, and one of $1,000 in favor of Douthart. In each case, P.T.C.’s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, and, alternatively, for a new trial, was denied ; and from the judgment entered on each verdict P.T.C. took an appeal.</p>

Approximately thirty-five feet behind the trolley, Douthart’s pickup truck was also proceeding south on Oxford Avenue at a speed of between 10 and 25 miles per hour. According to Douthart, at a point between Kenwyn Street and Dyre Street, both of the.poles atop the trackless trolley became disconnected from the overhead wires (power lines) with which such poles are normally in contact and began to swing wildly back and forth and up and down. Douthart immediately started to pull his truck to the left so it would not be right behind the trackless trolley. He testified that shortly thereafter “I felt a jar, a crash, and I saw a big light of fire in the reflection of the mirror coming in the side of the door.” Douthart immediately “jammed on” his brakes, and as a result both he and his passenger Izzi were thrown violently about in the truck, and both received bodily injuries.</p>
    <p id="b622-6" data-blocks='[["BL_622.6",622,[224,1624,1155,631]]]'>The “big light of fire” referred to by Douthart resulted from the fact that one of the swinging poles on the top of the trackless trolley came into contact Avith and severed a guy wire — an overhead wire which stretched betAveen poles on either side of the street and extended from curb to curb. The severed guy wire whiplashed across the power lines, causing a short circuit or an arcing which produced the flash. The “crash” referred to by Douthart Avas the noise made when the small porcelain knob of an insulator which had been attached to the guy wire fell and apparently struck the left-hand rear side of Douthart’s truck.</p>

There was no warning device inside the trolley which would inform the operator of the poles’ position but the operator testified that lie could tell whether the pole was off “by the noise of the poles.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">*</a> The trackless trolley went approximately 100 feet from the time the poles became disconnected until one of them hit the guy wire, and it then went another 80 feet before it was stopped. The Douthart truck stopped at a point to the left of the trackless trolley, with the rear of the truck a few feet to the rear and to the left of the trolley.

    <p id="b623-3" data-blocks='[["BL_623.4",623,[177,1091,1150,747]]]'>There are two types or kinds of trolleys in Philadelphia — the standard or old trolley car and the modern or trackless trolley. For many decades, streetcars have been in use on the streets of Philadelphia. The standard or old type of trolley had an overhead pole which, by means of a small grooved metal wheel on the end of the pole, made contact with an overhead electric wire. Such overhead wire was usually extended down the center of a street. With this standard type of trolley it was by no means an uncommon event for the metal wheel on the pole to become disconnected from the overhead power line and for the pole thereafter to strike the overhead power line. When that happened, it usually produced an electric flash.</p>

The doctrine should be applied only where <em>all </em>of the following elements are present: (a) where the thing which caused the accident is under the exclusive control of or was made or manufactured by the defendant; <em>and </em>(b) the accident or injury would ordinarily not happen if the defendant exercised due care, or made or manufactured the article with due care; <em>and </em>(c) where the evidence of the cause of the injury or accident is not equally available to both parties, but is exclusively accessible to and within the possession of the defendant; <em>and </em>(d) the accident itself is very unusual or exceptional and the likelihood of harm to plaintiff or one of his class could reasonably have been foreseen and prevented by the exercise of due care; <em>and </em>(e) the general principles of negligence have not theretofore been applied to such facts.</p>

Superior Ct., supra, the judgment of the lower <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>Court was reversed and judgment was entered in favor of defendant non obstante veredicto. In that case, plaintiff was standing on a street corner and was injured by tbe fall of a trolley pole from a passing streetcar. She heard a noise — obviously the breaking of the pole — and the pole fell upon and injured her. Plaintiff alleged negligence in operation and control of defendant’s streetcar, and the pole must have been defective because it fell and a proper inspection would have disclosed its defect. The Superior Court rejected (a) the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and (b) the exclusive control doctrine and held that the burden of proof was upon the plaintiff to establish that some specific negligence of defendant caused the breaking of the pole and her subsequent injury.</p>

On the contrary the burden is on the plaintiff to establish negligence on the part of defendant by affirmative proof.”</p>

It appears that the accident resulted from the fact that the trolley wheel slipped from the overhead wire, and caught in a crotch of the supporting wires, which lifted: <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>the pole from its socket, so that it afterwards fell to the ground, striking the plaintiff.

Even more important, a trackless trolley car is not legally different from a standard trolley car, and <em>a myriad cases </em>involving standard trolleys have held that where injuries resulted from facts and circumstances such as or similar to those here present, (1) the company was not an insurer and (2) a plaintiff, in order to recover, must prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the company was negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries.</p>

Since the exclusive control doctrine is inapplicable, this was basic error which necessitates a new trial, unless defendant is entitled to a judgment non obstante veredicto. We must therefore determine whether under the above mentioned facts and circumstances, together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, plaintiff has established by a fair preponderance of the evidence that P.T.C. was negligent and that its negligence was the proximate cause of the accident.</p>
