    <p id="b540-7" data-blocks='[["BL_540.9",540,[237,933,1154,309]]]'>On November 30, 1958, sixty-four acres of land located in the Eastwick section of Philadelphia, were condemned by the Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia (Authority). The record title owner as of the date of the condemnation was the defendant-appellee, Elias H. Stein.</p>
    <p id="b540-8" data-blocks='[["BL_540.10",540,[237,1259,1154,425]]]'>On June 4, 1959, the plaintiff-appellant, Harold Stevenson, filed a petition for a declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that he was the legal owner of the land at the date of condemnation by virtue of his having held continuous adverse possession thereof for a period of more than twenty-one years. He also asked that certain unsatisfied mortgages be declared discharged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b540-9" data-blocks='[["BL_540.11",540,[237,1695,1153,197]]]'>By agreement, the issue was tried before a judge without a jury. The trial consumed twenty-four trial days and the testimony covers more than 4500 pages of the record.</p>

Exceptions to the findings, conclusions and decree were dismissed by the court en banc. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[192,552,1150,913]]]'>The first question for decision is the availability of the action of declaratory judgment in a case of this nature. Even though the granting of such a petition is a matter that lies within the judicial discretion of the court, and even though both parties join in asking such a judgment, the availability question must be determined on appeal: <em>Stofflet and Tillotson v.

So too, such a judgment should not be granted where a more appropriate remedy is available: <em>McWilliams v. McCabe, </em>supra; <em>Ridley Park Shopping Center, Inc. v.

The litigation can in no way affect that title, nor is there any suggestion that any of the parties have any rights in the land superior to those of the Authority. Hence, no title to real estate is involved nor is the validity of the mortgages as encumbrances on the title in issue. The only controversy to be determined is who is entitled to the condemnation award which the Authority must pay. Under such circumstances, it is obvious that an action to quiet title is not “an appropriate <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>remedy.” Nor does any other conventional remedy present a vehicle for resolving the dispute.</p>

Of course, the burden of proving this adverse possession was upon the plaintiff by credible, clear and definitive proof: <em>Hood v.

Several witnesses corroborated this testimony in essential part.</p>

Some testified that the plaintiff did not personally reside on the land or use any portion thereof until the year 1952; some stated that the plaintiff resided at another distinct address between 1939 and 1946; others testified that no member of the plaintiffs family resided on or used the land prior to 1952, except a daughter and her husband, who lived thereon from about 1938 to 1946, and cultivated <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>a small portion thereof. Voting, probation and hospital records were offered in evidence to establish that the plaintiff resided elsewhere than claimed daring several years of the period involved. Testimony was offered to show that, during the period in question, a gun club was a lessee of the land from the recorded title owner and used the land extensively.</p>
    <p id="b543-4" data-blocks='[["BL_543.4",543,[189,720,1147,255]]]'>It is patently obvious, therefore, that the determinative issue was purely factual<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and that the truth was for the lower court.

With the exception of one witness, counsel did not suggest or state during the trial that he was surprised by the testimony of the witnesses, or that he was unable to adequately conduct his cross-examination.
