Superior Ct., supra, the Court well said (pp. 13, 14) : “The objections summarized under paragraph (d) above, to the effect that ‘the warrant of attorney does not authorize the entry,of judgment in favor of the lessor’s assigns’ and therefore the present appellee cannot enforce the warrant of attorney contained in the original lease, raise the question of the effect of the merger and consolidation of two or more corporations under the Act of May 3, 1909, P. L. 408, as amended <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>by the Act of April 29, 1915, P. L. 205, upon the rights of action and property of each of the merged corporations. We agree with the court below that the present appellee is not in the position of an ordinary assignee of a lease as, for instance, was the plaintiff in the case of Curry v. Bacharach Quality Shops, Inc., supra. Even if it can be said in any proper sense of the word that the rights of action and property of the constituent corporations are assigned to the consolidated company resulting from the merger, <em>such an assignment would be by operation of law. </em>A more accurate description of the transfer would be to say that the consolidated corporation succeeds to the rights of action and property of the constituent companies. The language of the act is that ‘all the estate and property, real and personal, and rights of action of each of said corporations, shall be deemed and taken to be transferred to and vested in the said new corporation, without any further act or deed.’ ”</p>
