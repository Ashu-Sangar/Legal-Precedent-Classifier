At trial Nixon testified as to certain admissions, allegedly, made to him by Wilson concerning the murder while Wilson and Nixon were cellmates in a Las Vegas jail. In corroboration of this testimony, the court admitted into evidence certain consonant statements, allegedly, made by Nixon to federal investigators as well as evidence that Nixon displayed to a federal agent a $400 money order which, allegedly, Wilson had procured from Mrs. Ellsworth, wife of one of Wilson’s co-conspirators, and which was given to Nixon to secure bail so that, on his release, Nixon could go to Florida and arrange an alibi defense for Wilson in connection with the crime for which Wilson was then held. Wilson now contends that “the trial court permitted the admission [into evidence] of deliberately fabricated testimony” of Nixon. As background for the evaluation of this charge, we refer to that which we said in <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em>supra (pp. 604, 605) : “The trial judge stated: <em>‘If the guilt or innocence of </em>[Wilson] <em>were to be determined alone upon the uncorroborated testimony of [Nixon] I should be directing you [the jury] to return a verdict of not guilty.’ </em>It is hard to envisage a more fair, outspoken and favorable comment for the defense than this expression of the trial judge’s opinion concerning Nixon’s testimony. Furthermore, the trial court told the jury that Nixon was a ‘convicted felon, presently serving a sentence in a Georgia Prison,’ that the examination ‘has brought out a number of offenses for which he was convicted and the <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>number of escapes from prisons and penitentiaries. All in all, it is the story of one whose life has been badly misspent.’ Nixon’s testimony was characterized by the trial judge as ‘tainted, corrupt and entitled to little weight’ and the jury was warned to scrutinize such testimony ‘with the greatest care.’ ” In addition, the trial judge warned the jury that acceptance of Nixon’s testimony “ ‘ would depend on what corroborative evidence the jury might find.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b173-3" data-blocks='[["BL_173.4",173,[207,834,1149,477]]]'>From an examination of the trial record, it is clear beyond question that the trial court portrayed Nixon to the jury in the worst possible light and that the jury was informed of Nixon’s bad character, his testimonial unreliability and past misdeeds. Under such circumstances, Wilson’s rights, in connection with Nixon’s testimony, were fully protected. Even without Nixon’s evidence, Wilson’s guilt was thoroughly established by other evidence.</p>

The facts as presented did not so prove. As the evidence developed, it appeared that DeMoss and Thomas had arrested Wilson as a result of which Wilson was convicted and sentenced to a two year term for <em>burglary </em>but that, when Ellsworth was arrested and convicted of burglary in Oklahoma, <em>only DeMoss </em>could have been aware of that fact since by that time Thomas had left the Tulsa police force. The district attorney corrected this misstatement, he did not repeat it and, in further assurance that the jury was not misled, the following excerpt from the record is to be noted: “The Court :... You [the jury] will recall that the Commonwealth in <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>its opening address told you that it would offer evidence to prove that [Wilson] has suffered a conviction for robbery. The Commonwealth later corrected that to mean burglary and not robbery. The Commonwealth has offered evidence of the conviction of [Wilson] for burglary in the second degree. It has produced the testimony of the former county attorney of Payne County ... to the effect that he prosecuted the case, that the arresting officers were [DeMoss] and [Thomas], that [Wilson] was the man now on trial and that he was convicted of the crime of robbery and that he was sentenced for a term of two years. Mr. Blanc [District Attorney] : If your Honor please, you used the term robbery. You made the same mistake I did. The Court: I mean burglary. You are hereby instructed that this conviction cannot and must not be considered by you as bearing on the question of [Wilson’s] guilt.”</p>

The evidence proved that Wilson had been arrested by two of Ms alleged co-conspirators and that, as a result of that arrest, he was convicted and received a jail sentence and the so-called “misstatement” was at least <em>substantially </em>true as to Wilson, Thomas and DeMoss.

In this third situation, the courts in a vast majority of the states, including Pennsylvania, in reliance upon Wolf, in criminal trials followed the non-exclusionary rule which, as <em>Wolf </em>clearly indicated, was not then constitutionally inhibited.

In excluding illegally obtained evidence, the purpose is not to exclude such evidence because it is testimonially untrustworthy or lacking in reliability but to discourage police officials from conduct in violation of the Constitution. As Chief Justice Weintraub said in <em>State v. Smith, </em>supra, 181 A. 2d pp. 762, 763: “Nor is it a decisive difference [in solving the problem of the retroactive application of decisional law in criminal matters] that Mapp deals with a constitutional guaranty rather than a principle of lesser stature. . . . We are not dealing with a denial of a right which bears upon the truth of a conviction, as for example, the right to counsel or to appellate review, [citing cases]. Rather the subject is evidence, the probative force of which is constant whether it is seized with or without warrant. The heroin was heroin, and defendant’s connection with it was the same, with or without official compliance with the law of search and seizure. In short, the fairness of the trial itself and the truth of the verdict are not involved. The constitutional injury lies elsewhere. . . .” “This purpose of the new rule to deter police, <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>which seems from the Mapp opinion to be its main purpose, is not meaningfully served by the general application of the rule to past trials.
