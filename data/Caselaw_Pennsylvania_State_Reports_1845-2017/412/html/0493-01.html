Most of the papers merely repeat the language of section 6. Appellee, in an attempt to meet this objection, relies upon the following language contained in the affidavit of the complaining witness: “. . . on or about May 1, 1961, the complaining witness contacted the defendant about the fact that he had not paid the current billings and <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>invoices, and was assured that circumstances beyond the control of the defendant had caused the delay in forwarding said sums, but that payment would be made in full.
