The thrust of the complaint is an attack upon the conduct of both the Unions and the Employer in the negotiations and the incidents which led to and resulted in the formulation of the new seniority provisions in the 1959 agreement and a challenge to the bona fides of the Employer and Union vis<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>a-vis the Employees. In effect, the complaint seeks a rescission of the seniority provisions in the 1959 collective bargaining agreement<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> allegedly brought about by improper conduct on the part of the Unions and the Employer and the reinstatement of the pertinent seniority provisions of the 1957 collective bargaining agreement. However, no <em>violation </em>of the collective bargaining agreement between the Unions and the Employer is averred and, absent such an averment, the instant case is clearly not within the class of actions contemplated by Section 301, supra, and the rationale of <em>Evening News Association, </em>supra.</p>

The <em>Garmon </em>rule commands the exclusion of this action from the jurisdiction of the state courts and the court below properly dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
