The corner portion of lot which extended 32 feet on Market Street and about 48 feet on Second Street was used for parking and was vacant ground, except for two cinder block structures, or sheds. The remaining part of the parcel contained a restaurant, an “L” shaped building, which abutted the east and south sides of the lot. The building had a frontage of 24 feet on Market Street and 27 feet on Second Street, and was known as 134-136 Market Street and 5-7 Second Street. The vacant lot was numbered 138-140 Market Street. The building had been used as a restaurant and the two concrete block sheds were built on the lot adjacent to the building. One had been used as a coal bin for the building and the other housed a conveyor which was accessible through an opening in the wall and was used to carry dirty dishes to the basement of the restaurant building.</p>

Horn and Hardart wanted to sell the parcel as a unit and Poulos and Young agreed to purchase the entire property for $60,000. Poulos was interested in the corner piece of land only, as he <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>wanted to erect a diner on the corner. Young and Poulos agreed to a division of the property and Horn and liar dart, by deed dated January 12, 1961, conveyed the restaurant building and the ground it occupied to Albert A. Young and Elizabeth Young, his wife, and the remaining part of the parcel, including the cinder block sheds, was conveyed to James Poulos and Yera Poulos, his wife, in accordance with the agreement of Poulos and Young, each paying one-half of the $60,000 purchase price.</p>

Poulos has plans to occupy this area and, in fact, the entire area of his parcel of land, by the diner he intends to erect.

The installation of this conveyor was a convenience and the record in this case discloses that it would be necessary to remove about two tables in the restaurant, or the space that eight people might occupy, if the conveyor were moved to within the building. The approximate cost of such work of removal and installation within the building would be $4,000.</p>

The chancellor would not permit the introduction of this agreement into evidence as it was not recorded and Young’s successor in title had no notice of it. The chancellor based his ruling on the familiar rule that an agreement for the sale of property is merged in the deed conveying the land. This ruling was error since the purpose of the introduction of the agreement dividing the land, was to show the intent of the parties at the time of the severance of the land. Here there was a definite determination to deal with the property in a precise manner. The relevant portion of the agreement (dated September, 1960) provides that: “A survey shall be obtained of all of the property herein described and it is the understanding of the parties that Lot 138 Market Street is fifty-six (56') feet in depth and that Lot 140 Market Street is approximately forty (40') feet in depth. The parties are not certain of these measurements which are approximate and in any event, POULOS’ lots are to run from the Market Street frontage to the permanent wall of No. 7 South Second Street. The east boundary of the Poulos lot is the permanent wall of the building at 136 Market <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>Street. The deeds shall he prepared on the basis of the survey and any costs in connection therewith shall be borne equally by the parties. The lots being deeded to POULOS shall not include the walls of the buildings retained by YOUNG on Market Street and Second Street, but POULOS shall have the right to build up to said walls and use the same as party walls in any construction which POULOS may later undertake upon his lots. The shed or sheds on part of Lots designated as 138 and 140 Market Street are on ground to be taken hereunder by POULOS and are not considered part of the buildings on the Second Street property or the Market Street property to be retained by YOUNG.”</p>

Here there is no need to imply the intention of the parties from the circumstances surrounding the severance of the property, since the parties themselves, through the division agreement, dealt specifically with the sheds and the boundary line of the property. The chancellor, by refusing to receive the agreement in evidence, disregarded the express intention of the parties which was determinative of this action. Since there was no basis for granting the preliminary injunction on the ground of an implied easement, it is evident that no grounds existed for the grant of the injunction. There was, in fact, legal error. We said in <em>Coffin v.
