The issuance of the building permit by the Board of Adjustment was pursuant to the valid ordinance and constituted a proper exercise of the powers and duties of the Board. The court below quite correctly refused to hold the ordinance invalid and to disturb the action of the Board. We, too, find no merit in the attack upon the ordinance and upon the board\u2019s order. The ruling below must, therefore, be affirmed.",
