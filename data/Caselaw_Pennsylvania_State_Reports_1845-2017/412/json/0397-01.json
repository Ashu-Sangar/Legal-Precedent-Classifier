The method employed in making the controversial computation was within the scope of its powers and duties as defined by statute, and in strict conformance with the method employed in determining the market value of taxable real property in each of the school districts throughout the Commonwealth.\nOrder affirmed.\nUnder the Act of June 27, 1947, P. L. 1046, \u00a712, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a74656.12, the board certifies this information to the Superintendent of Public Instruction of the Commonwealth to be used in the ascertainment of state school subsidies.",
