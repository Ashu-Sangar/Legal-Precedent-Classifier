We have fully and carefully examined the reasons it gave for so doing together with the entire record to determine whether such action was justified, keeping in mind the great weight to which the original findings of the chancellor are entitled. We conclude that the action of the court en banc was justified.\nDecree affirmed with costs to appellants.",
