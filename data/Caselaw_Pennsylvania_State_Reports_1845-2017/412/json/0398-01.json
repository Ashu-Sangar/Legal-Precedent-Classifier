        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nAlberti was incarcerated in Allegheny County following a verdict of the Coroner\u2019s Jury that he be held to await the action of the Grand Jury on a charge of murder. He thereupon filed in the Common Pleas Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, asking that he be admitted to bail. At the hearing upon this petition the Commonwealth offered in evidence the record of the proceedings before the Coroner. Upon consideration of such record the Court admitted the relator to bail, and from that Order the District Attorney has appealed.\nEach party relies upon \u00a714 of Article I, of the Constitution of our Commonwealth, which pertinently provides: \u201cAll prisoners shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, unless for capital offenses when the proof is evident or presumption great; . . . .\u201d\n. This case raises several very important questions. There are no appellate decisions construing this Constitutional provision but it has been considered in the county court cases found in the footnote. A \u201ccapital offense\u201d within the meaning of the Constitution means a crime of such a character that the penalty or sentence of death may be imposed even though the crime is punishable by death or life imprisonment, or by a lesser sentence. 8 Am. Jur. 2d, Bail and Recognizance, \u00a730, p. 801; 8 C.J.S., Bail, \u00a734, p. 66; Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, 1957 Ed., \u00a71811, p. 652; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 4th Ed., p. 263, Capital Case or Crime. In other words, a capital offense is a crime for which the death penalty may, but need not be inflicted. Lee v. State, 31 Ala. App. 91, 13 So. 2d 583, 587. We are likewise convinced that the words in Section 14 \u201cwhen the proof is evident or presumption great\u201d mean that if the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence which is presented at the bail hearing, together with all reasonable inferenees therefrom, is sufficient in law to sustain a verdict of murder in the first degree, bail should be refused. It follows that in the absence of such evidence, the prisoner is entitled to bail.\nThe practice followed in the present case and in a number of lower Court cases of deciding this very important question on the basis of the testimony presented at a coroner\u2019s inquest is condemned and is no longer to be followed. In application for bail in a homicide case, a decision should be made on the basis of the testimony which is presented by the Commonwealth at that hearing, and, of course, under the pertinent tests hereinabove set forth.\nThe case is remanded to the lower Court for the taking of testimony and an Order based thereon.\nCommonwealth ex rel. Chauncey and, Nixon v. Keeper of the Prison, 2 Ashm. 227, 234 (Philadelphia County, 1838); Commonwealth v. Lemley, 10 P. L. J. 122 (Greene County, 1862) ; Commonwealth ex rel. v. Manley, 60 Pa.

D. & C. 253 (Lawrence County, 1945).\nSee particularly the opinion of President Judge Kino in Commonwealth ex rel. Chauncey and Nixon v. Keeper of the Prison, 2 Ashm., supra, 227, 234.",
