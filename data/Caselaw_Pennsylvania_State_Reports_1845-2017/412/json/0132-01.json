        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Benjamin E. Jones,\nThese appeals present one issue: the taxability, under the \u201cSelective Sales and Use Tax Act\u201d of 1956 (Act), of machinery sold to, or used by, persons who purchase mixed unsorted scrap and, by the use of such machinery, sort, cut, bale and compress such scrap into forms suitable for sale to various steel mills.\nSitkin\u2019s Junk Co., Inc., and Sitkin\u2019s Metal Trading, Inc. (taxpayers) are engaged in the scrap business in the course of which they purchase from homes, farms, industries and other sources scrap which is mixed and unsorted. Upon receipt of such scrap, the taxpayers remove therefrom the unusable and unsalable portions and the \u201cmetallic scrap remaining is sorted, sometimes cut into convenient lengths, sometimes baled, and in any event then sold to various steel mills.\u201d As purchased, the mixed unsorted scrap has little, if any, commercial value; after handling and preparation by the taxpayers, such scrap becomes an article highly useful in the production of steel. In the handling and preparation of such scrap, the taxpayers employ certain machinery \u2014 alligator shears, hydraulic presses, acetylene torches, etc. \u2014 and the Commonwealth herein seeks to sustain the validity of taxes levied under the Act upon the sale to, or the use by, the taxpayers of such machinery. The taxpayers claim that, by reason of the nature of their business, they are within the so-called manufacturing exclusions of the Act.\nAfter the Commonwealth had assessed taxes against the taxpayers for the period from March 7 to November 30, 1956 and after the taxpayers had unsuceessfully exhausted their administrative remedies under the Act, appeals were taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. After a hearing at which certain facts were stipulated and oral testimony received, that court directed the entry of judgments for the amount of the taxes against the taxpayers. Prom the entry of such judgments these appeals were taken.\nSection 201(a) (72 PS \u00a73403-201) imposes a tax on \u201ceach separate sale at retail\u201d of tangible personal property, the purchaser to pay the tax to the vendor for transmission to the Commonwealth. Section 201-(b) (72 PS \u00a73403-201) of the Act imposes, inter alia, a tax \u201cupon the use ... of tangible personal property purchased at retail\u201d, the tax to be paid to the Commonwealth by the persons who make such use.\nThe Act (Section 2(j), 72 PS \u00a73403-2), in defining a \u201cSale at Retail\u201d of tangible personal property upon which the tax is imposed under Section 201(a), specifically excludes a transfer of tangible personal property either for the purpose of resale or of \u201cmachinery and equipment ... to be used ... in any of the operations of \u2014 (a) The manufacture of personal property . . .\u201d and the Act (Section 2(n), 72 PS \u00a73403-2), in defining \u201cUse\u201d of tangible personal property, specifically excludes the \u201c \u2018Use\u2019 ... of tangible personal property ... in any of the operations of \u2014 (i) The manufacture of personal property: . . . .\u201d\nWhether the instant taxes be imposed upon a theory of a \u201cSale at Retail\u201d or a \u201cUse\u201d, the real crux of the problem is whether taxpayers\u2019 machinery is employed in the \u201cmanufacture of personal property\u201d as that phrase is defined in the Act.\nThe Act defines \u2018Manufacture\u201d as: \u201c[t]he performance of manufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing or other operations, engaged in as a business, which place any personal property in a form, composition or character different from that in which it is acquired whether for sale or use by the manufacturer, and shall include but not be limited to \u2014 (1) Every operation commencing with the first production stage and ending with the completion of personal property having the physical qualities . . . which it has when transferred by the manufacturer to another; ....\u201d: Sections 2(c), 2(c)(1). Our inquiry is whether the modus operandi of taxpayers in the handling of the scrap from the time of its acquisition until it assumes a form available for sale to the various steel mills constitutes a \u201cmanufacture of personal property\u201d within the statutory definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d.\nThe court below held that the taxpayers\u2019 operations did not constitute a \u201cmanufacture of personal property\u201d under the Act and that the sale to, and the use by, the taxpayers of the machinery was taxable. In reaching that conclusion, the court relied in large measure upon Commonwealth v. Donovan, 76 Dauph. 191. In Donovan (p. 192), the court said that . . prior to the adoption of the [Act] this taxpayer\u2019s activities would not be manufacturing as that term has been defined . . . under other tax statutes. . . . The cases hold that a \u2018new and different\u2019 product must emerge or the activity is something less than manufacture.\u201d With that summary of the law prior to the Act we are in accord. However, in the statutes which antedated the Act and out of the construction of which evolved this judicial definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d or \u201cmanufacturing\u201d, generally there was no definition of \u201cmanufaeture\u201d and the courts resorted to the popular conception of the meaning of that term. In the Act now under construction the legislature has seen fit to define at some length the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d.\nIn Donovan (p. 198), the court further said: \u201c[t]here is little doubt that the legislature in adopting the definition of manufacturing [in the instant Act] intended only to describe the process of manufacturing and not to enlarge it beyond the definition that had been developed by over 100 years of careful judicial review.\u201d Upon this rationale, the court below applied to the construction of \u201cmanufacture\u201d under this Act judicial definitions of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d under prior tax statutes; in this respect the court erred. It was the duty of the court to apply that definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d which the legislature set forth in the instant Act and not to substitute therefor judicial definitions of that term under prior tax statutes.\nWhen this Act was passed the legislature presumably was fully aware of the construction placed upon \u201cmanufacture\u201d by the courts under the prior statutes. Where the legislature, in a later statute, uses the same language as used in a prior statute which has been construed by the courts, there is a presumption that the language thus repeated is to be interpreted in the same manner such language had been previously interpreted when the court passed on the earlier statute: Jones and Laughlin Tax Assessment Case, 405 Pa. 421, 432-3, 175 A. 2d 856; Parisi v. Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment, 393 Pa. 458, 462, 143 A. 2d 360. Had the legislature intended that \u201cmanufacture\u201d or \u201cmanufacturing\u201d be given under the Act the same construction previously given all that was necessary in the new statute was to use the words \u201cmanufacture\u201d or \u201cmanufacturing\u201d. Instead, the legislature drafted a somewhat lengthy definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d, twice amended since its enactment. We have long held that, where a statute contains its own definition, the meaning of the terms as defined at common law or as constructed under prior statutes is not controlling: Blauner\u2019s, Inc. v. Philadelphia, 330 Pa. 342, 349, 198 A. 889; Kohn v. Philadelphia, 151 Pa. Superior Ct. 635, 642, 30 A. 2d 672. By specifically defining \u201cmanufacture\u201d, the legislature indicated its intent that \u201cmanufacture\u201d be construed in accordance with the statutory language and that the construction of such word was not to be controlled by prior judicial construction of such word under prior tax statutes. By way of example, the Act provides that the finished product be \u201cdifferent\u201d from that form in which it was acquired whereas under prior judicial construction the finished product had to be both \u201cnew and different\u201d.\nFurthermore, \u201c. . . we have repeatedly said that in the construction of a statute \u2018that presumably every word, sentence or provision therein is intended for some purpose, and accordingly must be given effect.\u2019 [citing cases]\u201d: Commonwealth v. McHugh, 406 Pa. 566, 569, 178 A. 2d 556; Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a751, 46 PS \u00a7551. Considering all the language contained in the statutory definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d, we are convinced that prior judicial authority is not controlling in the definition of that word under this Act.\nIn its definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d, the Act (Section 2(c)) emphasizes two criteria, i.e., the type of the activity and the result of that activity. To constitute \u201cmanufacture\u201d, first, the type of the activity must fall into one or more categories, i.e., \u201cmanufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing or other operations\u201d and second, as a result of one or more types of the prescribed activities, the personal property must be placed \u201cin a form, composition or character different from that in which [such personal property]\u201d was acquired, (Emphasis supplied). In the case at bar, it is undisputed that the taxpayers do not \u201cfabricate\u201d or \u201ccompound\u201d the scrap nor is there any merit in their contention that they \u201cprocess\u201d such scrap. To come within the orbit of exclusion from the imposition of these taxes the taxpayers\u2019 activities must fall within the category of \u201cmanufacturing\u201d or \u201cother operations\u201d if the latter words have a meaning apart from the other words in the definition.\nIt may be argued that the words \u201cother operations\u201d, under the application of the ejusdem generis rule, must be construed as general words which are restricted in their meaning to that which is included in the preceding particular words: Statutory Construction Act, supra, \u00a733. However, that rule yields if the result of its application is to arrive at a conclusion \u201cinconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature:\u201d Statutory Construction Act, supra, \u00a731. Our examination of this Act would indicate that the legislature intended that \u201cother operations\u201d include and embrace other types of activities not covered by the words \u201cmanufacturing, fabricating, compounding, processing\u201d.\nAn \u201coperation\u201d is an \u201caction\u201d or \u201cactivity\u201d and is the \u201caction of making or producing something\u201d: The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol. VII, p. 145. In Donovan, supra (p. 192), the Court said: \u201c. . . And as the definition of \u2018manufacture\u2019 was further developed by the cases we find that the end result of the process has become the important element. The cases hold that a \u2018new and different\u2019 product must emerge or the activity is something less than manufacture.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Taking into consideration that the Act now prescribes that the finished product be \u201cdifferent\u201d rather than \u201cnew and different\u201d as was decided in Norris Brothers v. Commonwealth, 27 Pa. 494, yet the rule enunciated in Norris certainly indicates that the end result is an, if not the, important element in determining whether \u201cmanufacture\u201d has taken place and furnishes a guide in deciding whether the taxpayers\u2019 activities fall within the term \u201cmanufacture\u201d.\nUsing the machinery sought to be taxed, the taxpayers convert the scrap which they acquire into lots or forms to suit the needs of their steel mill and other metal processing customers. The court below described that which the taxpayers do: \u201cSome of this scrap, such as old railroad track, needs only to be cut to a convenient size; some must be sorted into ferrous and non-ferrous classifications and perhaps cut to size; some must be classified according to chemical analysis to determine the amount of sulphur or phosphorous or the like contained in it; and some, such as junked automobiles, must go through a process where unwanted non-metallic parts are removed or destroyed by burning and the metal remaining compressed into a bale approximately 5 feet by 21 inches by 21 inches.\u201d\nOur analysis of the provisions of this Act and the taxpayers\u2019 activities convinces us that these activities do fall within the statutory definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d, i.e., \u201cother operations\u201d and within the activities excluded from the operation of this tax statute. The court below took the position that the scrap subjected to the taxpayers\u2019 activities remained scrap even when such activities had been completed. That may well be. However, such scrap, after and as a result of the handling and activities of the taxpayers, was in \u201ca form, composition and character\u201d different from that scrap which had been acquired by the taxpayers. Posed in another fashion, would the Commonwealth assert that a farmer who purchased machinery to drain marsh land was subject to tax on such machinery because, after its operation upon the land, land remained where there was land before and that it was not, therefore, used directly in a farming operation? We think not. In the one case there is a different category of land while in the case at bar there is a different category of scrap; as a result of both operations that which was useless has been rendered useful and, in each instance, something different has been produced.\nWhile it is true that \u00a7602, 72 PS \u00a73403-602, provides that \u201c[e]very sale of tangible personal property or [certain prescribed] services shall be presumed to be at retail and to be subject to the tax imposed\u201d, the effect of that section is not to alter the rules of statutory construction but to place upon the alleged taxpayers the burden of proving that the transaction sought to be taxed is either not within the orbit of the Act or that it is exempted from the operation of the Act under \u00a7203. This burden has been amply met by the instant taxpayers.\nThe court below considered the definition of what is not a sale at retail as an exemption from taxation to be strictly construed. With that we cannot agree. The true exemptions in the Act are set forth in \u00a7203. The definitions of what are and what are not sales at retail are not exemptions save in the sense that what is not specifically taxed by a taxing statute is exempt from its operation. It is only when the taxpayer or his property is within the general language of the statute imposing the tax that provisions relied upon to establish an exemption are to be strictly construed: Shillington Bank Case, 331 Pa. 540, 1 A. 2d 677. In Scranton v. O\u2019Malley Mfg. Co., 341 Pa. 200, 205, 19 A. 2d 269, we said: \u201cWhile it is the duty of every citizen to bear his just share in supporting the government, he cannot be compelled to do so except in a way provided by a statute.\u201d See also: Murray v. Philadelphia, 364 Pa. 157, 164, 71 A. 2d 280.\nThe difference in the scrap when acquired and the scrap after handling by taxpayers is sufficient to bring the taxpayers\u2019 activities within the operation of the manufacturing exclusion of the Act. The machinery in question is used directly in such activities and the sale thereof to, and the use thereof by, the taxpayers are not taxable transactions within the purview of the Act.\nJudgments reversed.\nAct of March 6, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1228, as amended, 72 PS \u00a73403-1 et seq.\nFindings of fact by the court below.\nThis \u201cuse\u201d tax is not payable if the person has paid the tax under \u00a7201 (a) or has paid the tax under \u00a7201(b) to the vendor with respect to such use.\nUnder \u00a72(e) (iv), the \u201cUse\u201d of tangible personal property in the \u201cProcessing\u201d of personal property is likewise specifically excluded from imposition of the tax. While taxpayer's rely in part on this provision, in our view, such \u201cProcessing\u201d provision does not apply to the instant fact situation under the definition in subclause (c.l) of \u00a72.\nSection 2(c) (1) was added to the Act by the Act of April 5, 1957 which had as one of its stated titulary purposes the \u201cchanging and clarifying of certain definitions\u201d. This Section provides: \u201cEvery operation commencing with the first production stage and ending with the completion of personal property having the physical qualities . . . which it has when transferred by the manufacturer to another\u201d and is included under the general definition of \u201cmanufacture\u201d. (Emphasis supplied).\nIt seems undisputed that, if the steel mills or metal processing customers of taxpayers did to their own scrap exactly the same thing the taxpayers do, such activities on the part of the steel mills or other metal processors would be considered within the exclusionary activities of the Act.\nSection 2(3) (7) b) and \u00a72(n) (4) (c) (ii), 72 PS \u00a73403-2.",
