        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Bell,\nDefendant appeals from a judgment entered for plaintiff in an action of trespass for personal injuries. Defendant asks for judgment non obstante veredicto or alternatively a new trial.\nThe jury could have found the following facts: A very large and heavy box (the box was 6 feet high and 2y2 feet wide), containing a bicycle, was left standing on the floor beside an aisle in defendant\u2019s store. The box fell on plaintiff\u2019s head and shoulder causing very severe injuries. There was no evidence as to whether the box was resting on its own weight or was leaning against the nearby wall, or was fastened or secured in any way, or exactly what caused the box to fall. However, the testimony disclosed that the defendant said \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place\u201d; and after the accident, ordered it removed.\nWhile neither res ipsa loquitur nor the exclusive control doctrine applies, we believe that the totality of the aforesaid facts and circumstances amount to evidence of negligence which, though very slight, was sufficient to take the case to the jury. The case is, on its facts, distinguishable from Stewart v. Morow, 403 Pa. 459, 170 A. 2d 338, where a small mirror, which rested on a mantelpiece in defendant\u2019s home, suddenly fell and injured plaintiff (a maid) while she was performing her household cleaning duties. The Court in that case correctly stated (1) that neither res ipsa loquitur nor the exclusive control doctrine applied; and (2) that there was not sufficient evidence of negligence to take the case to the jury.\nThe difference in the size and potentially dangerous condition of this huge box by the aisle of the store, and the small mirror on a mantel in the Stewart home, together with the other facts and circumstances above mentioned are sufficient to distinguish the Stewart case from the instant case.\nDefendant asks for a new trial because of an alleged error in the Court\u2019s charge on \u201cpresent worth,\u201d in which charge the Judge included an \u201cexample\u201d to aid the jury. An \u201cexample\u201d charge is proper if it is given by way of illustration or example and the Court makes clear to the jury that the example is illustrative only and that it is solely for the jury to decide what the verdict should be and for whom: Littman v. Bell Telephone Co., 315 Pa. 370, 172 Atl. 687; Reed v. American Dyewood Co., 231 Pa. 431, 80 Atl. 873. In Littman v. Bell Telephone Co., supra, the Court said (page 378) : \u201cConcrete illustrations may be used by the trial judge in explaining \u2018present worth.\u2019 \u201d Furthermore, we find no basic or reversible error in the charge.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones dissents and would enter judgment n.o.v.",
