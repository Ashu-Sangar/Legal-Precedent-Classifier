The Second National Bank, to be reported in 27 P. F. Smith 96.\nAs to the second point, the alleged fraudulent representation of the cashier and one of the directors of the bank,' the affidavit is clearly insufficient. All that is alleged is that when asked as to the financial condition of Garfield, these officers replied that they considered said Garfield perfectly good financially and th\u00e1t defendant would be safe in endorsing for him. How can such a declaration, not made in the course of their duties as officers or agents of the bank, even admitting it to have been wilfully false, affect their principal? It would be subversive of every well-settled principle which regulates the relation of principal and agent and the responsibility of the principal for the acts and declarations of his agent.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Mapes et al. versus Second National Bank of Titusville.\n1. In .a suit by a bank against endorsers of a note discounted for the accommodation of the drawer, the affidavit of defence was that \u201c at and before the time that defendants endorsed the note,\u201d they inquired of the cashier and one of the directors of the bank whether it would be safe for them to endorse, and that these officers informed them that they considered the drawer perfectly good, and they would be safe in endorsing ; that the officers knew the representations to be false, and that they made them to deceive defendants, who would not have endorsed but for the representations. Held to be insufficient.\n2. Such declarations, although wilfully false, made by the officers, not in the course of their duties as officers, or agents of the bank, could not affect the bank.\n3. 0\u2019IIare v.

Mapes and T. T. Mapes,\" partners as Mapes Brothers.\nThe cause of action was the following notes, which had been discounted and were held by the plaintiffs; the notes were discounted for Garfield\u2019s accommodation :\u2014\n\u201c $1200.

Garfield.\u201d\n(Endorsed)\n\u201c Mapes Bros.\u201d\nThe defendants filed an affidavit of defence, averring:\u2014\n\u201c 1. That Garfield was a borrower from the'plaintiff to an amount exceeding one-tenth of their capital in violation of the National Currency Act of June 3d 1864, and therefore the plaintiff\u2019s claim could not be recovered.\n\u201c 2. That at and before the time that defendants endorsed the first of said notes for the benefit and accommodation of said Garfield as before mentioned, which they were by him requested to do, they took the precaution before doing so to inquire of the cashier of plaintiff\u2019s bank and of one of the directors thereof, as to the financial condition of said Garfield, and whether or not it would be safe for them (defendants) to endorse for him, and were informed by said cashier and director that they considered said Garfield perfectly good financially, and that the defendants would be safe in endorsing for him: that when said representations were made by said bank officers they (the said officers of plaintiff\u2019s bank) knew they were false, and that said Garfield was then very largely indebted to said bank for borrowed money, and was insolvent and unsafe, and that it would not be safe for defendants to endorse for him, and that said false representations were made, and said large indebtedness and insolvency of said Garfield were concealed by said bank officers, in bad faith, to benefit said bank and injure and deceive defendants; and that defendants, relying on said representations, endorsed both said notes, and would not have endorsed either of them had it not been for said false and fraudulent representations made by the officers of plaintiff\u2019s bank, as above stated; that defendants went to plaintiff\u2019s bank to make said inquiries before endorsing said paper, for the reason that they knew that said notes, if endorsed by them would be negotiated in said bank, as said Garfield did all, or nearly all, his banking business in said bank, and its officers had a more full and intimate knowledge of his affairs than any other banking institution or individual known to defendants.\u201d\nJudgment was entered August 7th 1874, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and the damages liquidated at $2371.62.\nThe defendants took a writ of error and assigned for error, the entering of judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nNeill Neill and B.
