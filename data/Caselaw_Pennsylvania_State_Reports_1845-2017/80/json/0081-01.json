        "text": "Mr. Justice Gordon\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nWe have held in the case of Horner v. Watson, 29 P. F. Smith 251, decided at the present term, approving Jones v. Wagner, 10 Id. 429, that of natural right the surface land is entitled to support from the strata below, and that, when one owning the whole fee, grants the minerals, reserving the surface to himself, his grantee is entitled only to so much of the minerals as he can get without injury to the superincumbent soil, and that the plea of a custom to the contrary could not be entertained, because such a custom would be unreasonable, and hence wanting in an element essential to its validity. To the opinion in that case we refer for the reasoning intended to sustain that conclusion. It is admitted, however, that, as a man may do what he pleases with his own, he may, by grant, part with the right of surface support, and, it is contended, that such is the purport of the deed of Thomas Chadwick and wife to Coleman, Hailman & Co. That part of the aforesaid deed, which is supposed to release such right, reads thus: \u201cAnd all the privileges necessary for the convenient working, running and transportation of said coal, and deposition of excavated matter, and also all rights and privileges incident or usually appertenant to the working and using of coal mines.\u201d But we cannot perceive that this grant in any way compromises the grantor\u2019s right of surface support. If, indeed, the destruction of the super-incumbent estate be one of the privileges necessarily incident and appertenant to coal mining, then the said indenture does convey the right contended for. As, however, we have just determined that such destruction of the surface is in no way incidental to such mining, we must necessarily refuse our assent to the construction contended for. It is in effect but another form of a plea of a general custom or usage permissive of the removal of all subjacent support. For it is argued, that when the vendor used the words \u201c all rights and privileges incident or usually appertenant to the working and using of coal mines,\u201d he did so in view of such custom, as above referred to, and that his covenant must be interpreted accordingly. The answer to all this is, that as no such custom could have existed, because of its unreasonableness, it could not have entered into the contract of the parties. Support is part and parcel of the reserved estate; it is of common right, and hence must pass, if at all, by express grant, and is not to be defeated by mere implication arising from language that does not import such an effect.\nWe think the whole question is determined in the negativing of the custom contended for, and hence the judgment of the District Court must be sustained.\nWe also affirm the same judgment in the writ of error brought by James M. Chadwick.\nSo far as we can judge from the record presented to us, the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s springs was occasioned by the ordinary operation of mining, and would have occurred though no part of the surface had been broken. Mining must interfere more or less with those subterranean streams and percolations of water which appear upon the surface as springs; to say that the owner of the substrata shall be accountable in damage for their disturbance, is to say that he shall have no use whatever of his minerals, for, without interfering to some extent with such waters, mining is impossible.\nJudgment affirmed.\nWilliams and Meucur, JJ., dissented.",

The loss of springs to the owner of the surface by reason of the ordinary working of the mines, does not render the owner of the minerals liable for damages.\n6. Horner v. Watson, 29 P. F. Smith 251; Jones v. Wagner, 16 P. F. Smith 429, adhered to.\nNovember 11th 1875.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Siiarswood, Williams, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Woodward, JJ.\nWrits of error to the District Court of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1874, No. 221 and 236.\nThis was an action on the case commenced April 19th 1872, by James M. Chadwick against William Coleman, Frank Rahm, John S. Slagle and William Yarnum, partners, trading as Coleman, Rahm & Co.\nThe plaintiff declared that he was the owner of a tract of sixteen acres of land in Penn township, Allegheny county, on which he with his family resided; that the defendants were possessed of a coal mine underlying the said tract of land; that it was their duty in working the mine to leave sufficient pillars, ribs, supports, &c., so as to prevent the superincumbent surface of the said tract from falling in, or to have set up sufficient posts to support and protect the surface and prevent it from falling in; that the defendants mined the coal in so unskilful, negligent and careless a manner as to cause the surface of the tract overlying the mine \u201c to cave in, crack, break and thereby destroy the buildings, orchards, springs of water, &c., and diverted the springs and streams of water from their natural channel, &c., so that the plaintiff was not only disturbed in his possession, use, &e., of the tract, but injured in his occupation as farmer and fruit-raiser.\u201d\nThe second count averred that the defendants took away the coal, without leaving proper ribs and supports or putting up the necessary posts for support; that in consequence the surface fell down, making cracks in plaintiff\u2019s land, and injuring his dwelling-house, his fences, fruit trees, &c., and diverting' the springs from their natural channel.\nThe tract of land, surface and minerals beneath, on the 4th of October 1853, belonged to Thomas Chadwick, who, on that day, conveyed to the firm of Coleman, Hailman & Co., \u201call the bituminous and fossil coal within and underlying\u201d the tract in question ; \u201c containing an area of coal of 40 acres and 145 perches, with the privilege of entering on and occupying so much of the overlying land as might be necessary for opening mines, adits, drains, &c., and for constructing ways, roads, &c., and all the privileges necessary for the convenient working, transportation, &c., of the coal, &c., and \u201call rights and privileges incident or usually appertenant to the working and using of coal mines.\u201d The rights of the grantees under the foregoing conveyance were after-wards vested in the defendants. After the death of Thomas Chadwick, by proceedings in partition of his estate, the plaintiff, as one of his sons and devisees, became the owner of the part of the tract, the injury to which part is complained of in this suit.\nThe cause was tried February 4th 1874, before Kirkpatrick, J.\nThe plaintiff proved the mining of coal by defendants under his property; that by reason of their mining the surface had sunk in a great many places; that about three acres of his land had been damaged; he testified particularly as to the injury done to his land and the extent of it. He testified also that there were three springs of water on his property, which were then dried up; there had been plenty of water until the ground began to fall in; the water went over the surface; he supposed it went into the pit.\nOn cross-examination, he testified that the. coal was very near the surface.\nFrom the plaintiff\u2019s evidence in chief and on cross-examination of his witnesses, it appeared that the \u201cribs\u201d of the mine were drawn, that the coal in some places approached within ten or twelve feet of the surface, that it would be a difficult matter to put proper supports in the mine to hold the roof up ; if they had driven narrow entries and left pillars standing it would not have caved in ; but to take out coal it would be almost impossible to put up pillars to sustain that light covering, unless they had \u201c logged it\u201d over on the top, the expense of which would be more than the coal was worth; if very narrow rooms had been taken, and the ribs not drawn, it would have sustained itself.\nThere was much evidence as to the fact and cause of the injury; to its extent and the amount of damage sustained by the plaintiff.\nThe evidence was that when coal is taken out it destroys springs; that no way was known by which coal could be taken out without interfering with springs ; whenever the rock breaks it will cause the springs to disappear before the breaks appear on the surface; if the vein of the spring is broken 200 yards from its mouth it will dry the spring up ; sometimes cutting a clay vein will spoil a spring; if the spring comes out above the coal, coal cannot be mined and the spring preserved ; the best springs come from clay veins; leaving pillars in the mine would not preserve the spring; entries in mines cannot be driven without cutting clay veins.\nIn the course of the trial the defendants made the following offers of evidence, which were rejected by the court, and several bills of exception sealed:\u2014\n1. That at the date of the conveyance from Thomas Chadwick to William Coleman et ah, it was, and for many years previously had been, the universally approved, established and customary course and practice of mining coal in the vicinity of the plaintiff\u2019s land, and in this bituminous coal region \u2014 as well when the coal and surface were owned separately, as when owned together \u2014 to mine and remove all the coal without leaving ribs or pillars of coal or other supports for the surface, to be followed by evidence that the defendants mined their coal from under the plaintiff\u2019s surface according to the said course and practice of mining, and with care and skill, and without any negligence in the operation of mining.\n2. That from the character of the coal vein in plaintiff\u2019s land and the vicinity, and generally throughout the bituminous coal region of Western Pennsylvania, and from the sitiuation of said coal vein in respect to the surface and the nature of the overlying soil, it is impossible to work the coal or carry on mining operations therein without disturbing the surface and causing a subsidence thereof, and that it is impracticable to support the surface and prevent its subsidence by means of coal pillars or ribs or artificial props; that at the date of the conveyance from Thomas Chadwick to Ooleman et al., it was and for many years previously, to wit: from the time when bituminous coal was first extensively mined in this region, it has been and still is the universally approved, established and customary course and practice of mining coal in the vicinity of the plaintiff\u2019s land and throughout this bituminous coal region \u2014 as well when the coal and surface were owned separately as when owned together \u2014 to mine and remove all the coal without leaving ribs or pillars or other supports for the surface; that said course and practice of mining is better for the surface owner than to attempt to keep up the surface by means of coal pillars, or ribs or props, because the surface where all the coal is removed settles evenly, whereas if coal ribs or pillars or props are left, it will eventually break and settle unevenly; and that the defendants mined their coal from under the plaintiff\u2019s surface according to said course and practice of mining, and with care and skill, and without any negligence in the operation of mining.\n3. That from the nature of the coal vein under the plaintiff\u2019s surface, and its nearness to the surface, and the character of the overlying soil, it was not possible to carry on mining operations in the coal in the plaintiff\u2019s land, without disturbing the surface and causing the subsidence complained of in this case, and that it was not practicable to support the surface and prevent said subsidence and alleged injuries by means of coal pillars or ribs, or by artificial props; and that the defendants mined their coal from under the plaintiff\u2019s surface with the utmost care and skill, and without any negligence in the operation of mining.\nThe following are points of the plaintiff, which were affirmed:\u2014\n1. If the jury believe, from the evidence in this case, that the defendant or their employees mined, dug and carried away the coal and slack underlying plaintiff\u2019s property, without leaving or putting up proper and sufficient pillars, posts or supports for said surface property, by reason whereof plaintiffs property caved, sunk and fell in, and was thereby damaged, the verdict should be for the plaintiff, in such an amount as is warranted by the evidence.\n2. If the jury believe, from the evidence in this case, that the defendants or their employees dug, mined and carried away the coal underlying the plaintiff\u2019s property; and took, dug and removed the coal pillars, stumps and ribs under said property, without putting up sufficient pillars and supports to keep said surface in its natural state, level and position, thereby causing the surface of said property to crack, sink, cave and fall in, causing damage to the same, the verdict should be for the plaintiff, in such an amount as is warranted by the evidence.\n4. If by the deed from Thomas Chadwick to Coleman, Hail-man & Co., from which company and their vendees, the defendants, by divers mesne conveyances, obtained said coal; and if, after the death of Thomas Chadwick, his heirs made an amicable partition of the surface estate to and among themselves, said James M. Chadwick taking, and now owning and possessing, a distinct part or portion thereof, said coal estate and the superincumbent land owned and in possession of said James M. Chadwick, the plaintiff, became thereby two separate and distinct estates; and if the defendants or their employees mined, dug, and carried away the said coal underlying the surface property of said James M. Chadwick, without leaving ribs, stumps or supports, or putting up proper and sufficient pillars or supports to keep said surface intact, by means whereof said surface of James M. Chadwick cracked, sunk, caved and fell in, causing damage to the same, then the verdict should be for the plaintiff.\nThe following are defendants\u2019 points, which were refused:\u2014\n1. Upon all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the defendants.\n2. Under the conveyance in evidence from Thomas Chadwick and wife to William Coleman and others, the grantees in said deed and those acting under them had the right to mine and take out the coal thereby conveyed, according to the established, approved and customary course and practice of mining bituminous coal at the time of the said conveyance, without liability to the owner of the surface for consequential damages, provided said coal was mined and taken out with proper care and skill, and without any negligence in the operation of mining ands taking out the coal.\nThe court charged :\u2014\n\u201cWe have no extended general charge to deliver. The points presented by the counsel cover all the questions in this case, and we will not comment on the facts. Our opinion is that the plaintiff has a right to recover. We regard this as settled by the decision of the Supreme Court in Jones v. Wagner, 16 P. F. Smith 429. ...\n... \u201c We have prepared a form of special verdict, which you will adopt, filling up the amounts which we have left blank. * * *\nWe take this course in order that we may consider the question of the right of the plaintiff to recover for loss of springs before the court in banc, and mould the judgment as we may decide that question.\u201d\nThe jury returned the following verdict:\u2014\n\u201c We find for the plaintiff in the sum of $1700, this amount including all damages of every kind, as claimed by him, and in assessing this amount we incorporate an amount of $1000, which we find and award for his losses of springs, and -if the court in banc should be of opinion that he is not entitled to recover this item, then this amount to be deducted from the above verdict of $1700, and judgment to he entered for the plaintiff in the sum of $700, non obstante veredicto; otherwise the verdict to be for the plaintiff in amount as above rendered.\u201d\nJuly 11th 1874, it was \u201c ordered that judgment be entered upon the verdict for the plaintiff upon the questions of law reserved non obstante veredicto, in an amount and to the extent of $700, being the amount found by the jury for loss and prejudice to the plaintiff\u2019s land, exclusive of loss of springs, with interest,\u201d &c.\nEach party took a writ of error.\nThe plaintiff assigned for error the entering of judgment for $700, and not for $1700, the amount found by the jury.\nThe defendants assigned for error:\u2014\nI, 2, 8. The rejection of their offers of evidence.\n5. Affirming the plaintiff\u2019s first point.\n6. Affirming the plaintiff\u2019s second point.\n7. Affirming the plaintiff\u2019s fourth point.\n8. Refusing defendants\u2019 first point.\n9. Refusing defandants\u2019 second point.\n10. Charging that plaintiff had a right to recover.\nJ.
