But I do not so regard it. Aside from the question above stated, Mrs. Ash has lost the control of her property by engrafting upon the trust a provision which limits her enjoyment of the property tó a life estate, with remainder over, upon failure to appoint, to her children and husband. The effect of this is to break the course of descent, and the remaindermen take as purchasers by description, and not as heirs. The rule laid down is that, when an estate for life only is given, followed by a general power of appointment, and on failure to appoint, to children or to special heirs, the power to appoint will not enlarge the estate of the <em>cestui que trust </em>to a fee, and on a failure to appoint, the children or special donees in remainder, take by purchase from the donor, and not by way of limitation as heirs to the <em>cestui que trust: </em>Dodson <em>v. </em>Ball, 10 P.

    <p id="b501-8" data-blocks='[["BL_501.13",501,[129,835,1160,1032]]]'>This is a case of an active trust for the.natural life of Ellen M. Harland, now Mrs. Ash. The <em>corpus </em>of her estate is, by her deed, vested in the trustees who were to take possession, receive, hold, invest in their own names, and control the estate, to enable them to carry out the trusts declared, the chief one of which is, to hold the estate for her natural life, and to pay over to her, whether covert or sole, the net interest, income and dividends thereof, and in such way that the estate should not be answerable for, or liable to, any charge, encumbrance, assignment, or anticipation by her, whether sole or covert, and that the trust should continue, whether sole or covert, and should not fall at the death of any future husband, with remainder to the use of her living <em>child or children, as tenants-in-common. </em>The duties are clearly active, and essential to support the trust, and the trust is similar to that in Earp’s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith 269, and Ashhurst’s Appeal, 27 Id. 464. It is not a trust for coverture merely, but one created to bind the hands of Ellen M. Harland herself, and take the control of her estate out of her own hands for life, in order to secure it against loss or improvidence. A trust for an estate in fee or absolutely for <em>coverture merely, </em>may fail, or may not take effect at all. But in this ease the trust is clearly for life with remainder to living children in equal shares, and not to the heirs general or issue of Ellen M. Harland. The life estate and remainders do not coalesce. The trust, therefore, cannot be declared to have failed.</p>
