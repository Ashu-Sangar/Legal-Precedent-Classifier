They offered evidence to show that R. T. Barber, the immediate endorser of plaintiff, was a member of this firm, and that he had transferred the note to the plaintiff after maturity, and after the insolvency of the firm. This evidence the court rejected for the reason that the holder of overdue commercial paper takes it affected by those defences that are connected with the note itself, and not antagonistic claims or set-offs that are wholly independent of the note in suit. Nor can a presumption of payment of the note by the defendants arise, for it was admitted that Barber, one of the defendants, was a partner, and had the possession of the note after maturity; the ordinary presumption of payment arising from such possession is now defeated by proof that the firm did not pay it, but that <em>he paid it with his own funds. </em>Indeed, the defendants admit that it has not been paid, but undertake to set up an equity, <em>de hors </em>the note.
