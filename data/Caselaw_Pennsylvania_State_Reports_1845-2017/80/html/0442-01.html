Relying upon that information and the letter of Rooke, the plaintiff and Shriner did sell and convey their estates and interests to Thomas Beaver jointly, for the sum of $26,000 or thereabout, by their deed, dated April 1st 1864.</p>

The statements of the value of his estate and interest in the firm, made to him through Wolfe, by the defendants, or some of them, as well as the statement contained in the letter of Rooke, were false and fraudulent, and made for the purpose of inducing him to sell his estate and interest in the firm for less than it was really worth; Thomas Beaver did not purchase for himself, but he was interposed to purchase for James S. Marsh, Peter Beaver and Levi Rooke, and, after the purchase, Thomas Beaver actually did convey and transfer it to them. Defendants, at the time of said sale, well knew that the estates and interests were worth more than about $26,000, and for that reason they, or some of them, paid or agreed to pay the estate of Frederick Marsh, deceased, the sum of about $10,000 over and above the amount paid plaintiff, although the interest of the estate of Frederick Marsh, deceased, was no greater than plaintiff’s.</p>

Levi Rooke was admitted as a partner on the 21st of December 1855, having purchased an interest from Thomas Beaver and Peter Beaver. Morris and Rooke, under the agreement of 21st of December 1855, were “ to give their attention to the business of the firm in all its details (including the blowing of the furnace).” The company during all the time had a bookkeeper employed to take charge of the books and accounts, which were open to inspection of all the partners. <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>The plaintiff’s share would have been one-tenth and one-half of a tenth.</p>

(of which plaintiff was a member to the extent of one-fifth), received from the Furnace company and used pig iron to the amount of $79,077.33, which is charged in the furnance books against Geddes, Marsh &amp; Co. Defendants denied that any account or statement was asked from them, or either of them, and refused. The books and papers connected with the Furnace company were always open for inspection and examination by any of the firm.

What the furnace was earning on the 1st of April 1864 was as well known to plaintiff as defendants. Defendants denied that the furnace made $100,000, or anything like that sum, up to April 1864. The real estate and fixtures, on or about the 1st of April 1864, would not have sold for more than one-half their cost. There was no concealment by defendants, or either of them, of the value of the property or accounts from plaintiff. Defendants denied that they, or either of them, made, or caused to be made, any false statements in regard to the furnace property or income. Thomas Beaver purchased the interest of plaintiff and Shriner, and agreed to convey the same to Peter Beaver, Rooke and James S. Marsh, upon certain conditions contained in a statement dated April 2d 1864. The whole transaction was fair and bonfi fide. Defendants denied that they knew the interest of Geddes &amp; Shriner to be worth more than $26,000. There was no agreement, at the time of the purchase of the interest of Geddes and Shriner, to purchase the interest of Frederick Marsh’s estate at any price; that interest was not purchased until considerable time afterwards, the conditions which will appear by article of agreement, dated June 1864. James S. Marsh states that the plaintiff expressly required that <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>James S.

Marsh stated'that Shriner offered him $500 if he would get Thomas Beaver to pay him some $2000 more than Samuel Geddes got, as he had done more in the concern and spent more time than Gnddes. Marsh advised Shriner not to sell, stating to him that he believed from indications that the future prospects of the furnace making money appeared favorable. Shriner insisted upon selling; and then Marsh went to see Thomas Beaver, and by explaining the circumstances in regard to services performed by Shriner, induced him to pay Shriner about $2000 more. Marsh declined taking the $500 offered him by Shriner. The whole arrangement about the $2000 was at the instance and request of Shriner. Neither Thomas Beaver nor Peter Beaver, nor any of the defendants, were indebted to plaintiff for any part of the $2000.</p>

The respective interests then were as follows, viz.: Geddes, Marsh &amp; Co., fifty per cent; Thomas Beaver, twenty per cent.; Peter Beaver, fifteen per cent.; C. E. Morris, ten per cent.; L.

The firm of Beaver, Geddes, Marsh &amp; Co., on the 1st of January 1863, consisted of Peter Beaver, representing $13,000, being five-twentieths; J. S.

From some time in 1859 till 1863 they were not able to control their finances. Thomas Beaver, who was interested in the furnace almost from the period of its inception, went out of the concern in April 1863, and states that it was not making money up to that date. The fact of his selling his interest at all, and especially his parting with it for fifty cents on the dollar, indicates that he did not consider the business a paying one. Samuel Geddes also, some four or five years prior to his selling his interest, was desirous of so doing, and had proposed to Jonathan Wolfe to endeavor to effect a sale of the same.</p>

During that year some money was made, and during the first three months of 1864 the sum of $16,449.67 was made by the furnace, and in the same year, after the purchase of the Geddes and Shriner interests, the price of iron continued to advance so much, that no additional capital was called in from the remaining partners to pay the purchase-money of the interests so bought.</p>

Several months prior to the 1st of April 1864, most probably about the last of January or first of February, * * * Peter Beaver called upon Jonathan Wolfe and stated that they would purchase the Geddes and Shriner interests in Union Furnace, provided they could be had at a low price, but that they did not desire this for themselves, but for Thomas Beaver; that they felt that it was greatly to their interest that Thomas Beaver should have an interest iri the furnace, in view of their getting their coal at a greater advantage, and also in disposing of their iron.</p>

Before going to see Mr. Wolfe, Peter Beaver had talked the matter over with some of his partners. He states that it is altogether likely he had a conversation with Dr. Rooke and James S. Marsh, and has a positive recollection that he and Dr. Rooke had talked together in the office at the furnace as to what they would agree to give for the interests of Geddes and Shriner. On the 1st of March 1864, there was a conversation in the office at the furnace, and the amount of $26,000 was fixed as that which they would be willing to give for these interests. At that time and place there were present Peter Beaver, Dr. Levi Rooke and the bookkeeper. The matter was also talked over with Thomas Beaver. He states that he purchased at his brother-Peter’s request, and says that he has no doubt but that James S. Marsh, Dr. Rooke and his brother Peter were present with him at times when negotiations were entered into, * * * and with this interview negotiations commenced, which finally terminated in the sale of the Geddes and Shriner interests. There is nothing to indicate that either Mr. Geddes or Mr. Shriner knew that they were selling to their co-partners, but the whole testimony goes to show that they thought they were dealing exclusively with Thomas Beaver. The price first offered was in the neighborhood of $23,000. This was not agreed to by Mr. Geddes, who wanted more, and named, as Mr. Wolfe states, some $26,000 or $28,000. After considerable negotiation, the interests were conveyed to Thomas Beaver for the consideration named in the deeds, amounting to $25,775.51, which sum included Mr. Geddes’s store bill 'at the furnace of $2503.03, and the store bill of Mr. Shriner, amounting to $272.48. Besides this amount, there was paid to Joseph W. Shriner, privately, an extra $2000 ; the aggregate amount thus paid for the interest being $27,775.51. Mr. Geddes considered the interest as worth all he asked -for it, which was some thousand of dollars above what Mr. Beaver offered. Upon being advised by Mr, Wolfe not to sell unless he got his price, he stated that he would not sell if it were not for the unpleasant relations that existed between himself and the other members of the firm, and that the iron business was looking up at this time, and afforded him an opportunity of becoming disconnected in business from the other members of the firm, and if he should fail in accomplishing this object at this time, there might not another opportunity arise soon to sell. Mr. Geddes insisted also in Mr. Shriner’s interest being sold with his. The reason for this was, that all the funds in Union Furnace under the name of Geddes, Marsh &amp; Co., belonged to Geddes &amp; Marsh, and that as Joseph W. Shriner owed the foundry company of Geddes &amp; Marsh, by the sale of his inter<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>est in the furnace, this debt would be cancelled, and Mr. Geddes would get the money arising from the sale. This would come to Mr. Geddes, for the latter also insisted that the interest of Frederick Marsh, deceased, which was exactly equal to that of Mr. Shriner, and who was equally indebted to Geddes &amp; Marsh, should be taken by James S. Marsh, and thus the latter would be assuming Frederick Marsh’s indebtedness. This contemplated sale was not favorably looked upon by Mr. Shriner, who stated to Mr. Wolfe that they had run the furnace when it was a dragging business, and now when it was making money, he did not feel like being put out of it.</p>

Mr. Shriner went down several times and asked for a balance sheet. <em>* * </em>*'This he did not get, as it was stated that they were too busy, and also that the sickness of the bookkeeper prevented the making of one out. Mr. Shriner was in the habit of going to the furnace, from time to time, as long as he was interested in it, and he appears to have asked repeatedly for a ‘balance sheet.’ Mr. Geddes did not visit the furnace during several years prior to the sale, the principal reason being the fact of unpleasant relations existing between him and some of his co-partners. He did not go down to the furnace pending these negotiations. He gives as -his reasons why any examinations of the books were omitted that they were kept by double entry, which he did not understand; also, that he expected a yearly balance sheet, and further, the unpleasant relations above referred to. Dr. Rooke resided at and was the principal man attending to the furnace, and with him, as also with the bookkeeper, Mr. Geddes was on good terms. Mr. Geddes did not therefore go to the furnace or ask to examine the books. No objection was made to his examining them, but he preferred to ask for a balance sheet through Mr. Shriner, and on the 10th of February 1864, he addressed a letter to Dr. Rooke, in which he requested him to furnish a balance sheet of the business at the furnace; To this letter Dr. Rooke replied by the letter of February 11th 1864. * * * From Dr. Rooke’s own testimony this statement did not give a full exhibit of all the property of the Furnace company, real and personal. Mr. Geddes says that he was governed by this letter in making the sale. Dr. Rooke asserts that at the time he made this statement, the idea of buying the interests had not entered his mind, that he was not the bookkeeper and had no charge of the books, and that he found at that time that the books were not posted up, and that there were a good many unsettled accounts which could not be got at. * * * Mr. Geddes states that he knew of a store there, of horses, mules, wagons, carts, boats, &amp;c. (none of which were included in Dr. Rooke’s statement), but he did not know their number or value. <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>This statement was however received by Mr. Geddes, and whatever weight he gave it Mr. Shriner says, that he was not fully satisfied with it, and went down again on the 7th day of March 1864, to see if they had a statement. At that time, he states that Dr. Rooke asked him if he had seen the statement sent to Mr. Geddes; also, stating that they were very busy and had not time to make out a regular balance sheet, but that the statement to Mr. Geddes could be relied upon. Mr. Shriner then tells Dr. Rooke that he had seen it, but that it was not satisfactory to him, that he would never sell out on such a showing as that unless he was forced to, and that at the same time'1, it was not his wish to sell out at present on any terms. At the interview March 1st 1864 Peter Beaver and Dr. Rooke named either $26,000 or $26,000 as the price they would be willing to give for the Geddes and Shriner interests, and it was understood that if Mr. Kremer could succeed in purchasing them for less he was to have the difference. They separated with that understanding, and Kremer started to see Mr. Shriner. He had a conversation with him the same day at Mr. Sbriner’s own house, and was led to think, from the talk, that he could buy the interests for $24,000. He so reported to Peter Beaver, and. * * * he had nothing further to do with it. Mr. Kremer afterwards wished an interest in the furnace. This, it appears, was agreed to be given him by some, but refused by others. In June 1864, he stated to Dr. Rooke that the partners could afiFord to give him an extra $1000 ; that he could have made that much if Mr. Peter Beaver had not interfered with his buying the Geddes and Shriner interests. The $1000 was paid him. Mr. Kremer states he received the money and Dr. Rooke says he acceded to the request made by Mr. Kremer, that he would pay $250 of the $1000.</p>

Mr. Wolfe says he recollects making it his business to see Mr. Shriner about this sale, and may have made use of arguments to induce him to sell. Mr. Geddes told Wolfe that Shriner must sell, so he could get clear of his interest. Mr. Shriner regarded the prospects for the iron business as flattering, but stated to James S. Marsh that if he did not sell when the business was good, he could not sell at all. He also says that, from what Mr. Wolfe told him, he was afraid the furnace might be put up at a forced sale and be sacrificed. Mr. Shriner * * * considered that he ought to have better terms than Mr. Geddes, from the fact that he had worked at the furnace, took an interest in it, and helped it <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>along, while Mr. Geddes had done nothing, and wanted Mr. Marsh to interest himself in getting him an allowance that would make him whole; he thought an additional $2000 to him would make him whole. * * * Mr. Marsh * * * went down to the furnace and saw Dr. Rooke and Peter Beaver, and laid the matter before them.

The amount paid for the interests, including the $2000 paid extra to Mr. Shriner, was $27,785. There is <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>nothing here which would show that gross inadequacy of price which calls for relief; and when we consider the estimated value of these interests as they found the subject-matter of negotiation about February 1st 1864, we cannot fairly look at the matter from our present standpoint, but must put ourselves in the position of the parties as they stood at that date. The question is, ‘whether, under the circumstances existing at the time, there was any misleading, or any designed withholding of a more full disclosure for the purpose of bringing about a bargain unfair and unequal, in which the advantage was to be on one side.’ The iron business had not been a successful one, but at the period of these negotiations it was looking úp, and that fact was known to all the co-partners. It was also known to all of them that the business was a fluctuating one; sometimes prosperous, sometimes depressed. The amount of capital-required was large and the risks great, and no one able to look into the future and say what the result might be. Taking into consideration all of the existing circumstances, including the business abilities of all the co-partners, and the means of information which they had at hand, the master is unable to find that the statements, as made by the defendants, or any of them, through Jonathan Wolfe, were false and fraudulent, and made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiffs to sell their interests in the firm for less than the same were really worth. * * * It was Mr. Shriner who requested this matter to be kept from the knowledge of Mr. Geddes, for the reason that otherwise Mr. Geddes would have obtained the money; he is further led to the conclusion, that if there is any fraud growing out of these facts or contained in them, the injury is one inflicted by Mr. Shriner upon Mr. Geddes, rather than by the defendants upon the plaintiffs. And as to its preventing a full and free communication between Mr. Geddes and Mr. Shriner, the master finds that this transaction was one entered into very late in the progress of negotiations, at its very winding up, on or about the 28th of March 1864. Whereas, for some two months at least previously, there was ample scope for communication between these parties, and as far as time was essential, there was a sufficient period in which to have gained a full and complete knowledge of their respective interests. * * *</p>

Shriner, the appellant in Shriner’s Appeal, argued with this case, were part-owners of the Union Furnace. The furnace was erected in 1853, and from that time down to the 1st of April 1864 was operated and owned by firms of which Geddes and Shriner were members. On the 1st of April <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>1864 a sale was made by Geddes and Shriner of their interest in said furnace to Thomas Beaver, for the sum of $25,775.51. Shriner was paid $2000 extra; so that the whole amount of the purchase-money was $27,775.51. Six years, lacking a few days, after this sale, Geddes and Shriner respectively filed their bills in equity against their late co-partners, alleging, inter alia, that they had discovered, since the sale that the furnace was in a prosperous condition on the 1st day of April 1864, and making large profits; that it had made before that time about $100,000, the amount originally invested, which was profit; that the real estate and fixtures had greatly enhanced in value; all of which was unknown to and concealed from them. They also alleged that Thomas Beaver did not purchase for himself, but for the defendants, James S. Marsh, Peter Beaver and Levi Hooke, which fact was unknown to Geddes and Shriner at the time, and was' studiously concealed from them; that they were led to believe by the assertions of their co-partners, or some of them, that no profits had been realized or money made by the firm; and that the furnace was not worth the original investment and interest. They therefore prayed relief, the object of the bills respectively being to set aside the sale of the Union Furnace, and that the deeds-executed to Thomas Beaver might be declared fraudulent and void as an absolute conveyance. The master found against the plaintiffs upon the question of fraud, and dismissed their bills. The court below sustained the finding of the master and dismissed the exceptions. An appeal to this court was entered by the plaintiff in each case. In Geddes’s Appeal there are six assignments of error, which will be considered in their order.</p>
    <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[150,1615,1162,646]]]'>The first, second and third assignments are to the finding of the facts by the master. I have examined the voluminous testimony in the case with great care, and am unable to say that the master’s finding of the facts is not fully sustained. If, as stated in the first assignment, the testimony was equally balanced, it cannot be said that his finding is necessarily erroneous. With a single witness on a side, and an assertion of a fact by the one and a denial by the other, the master may nevertheless find the fact. He may believe the one witness and discredit the other. This occurs almost daily in trials'by jury. Applying to each witness the tests which the law’recognises, the master, who was also examiner, may be able to say which speaks the truth, or which is mistaken. The mere manner of the witness may indicate this. But in such case we have no such test, and must accept the finding of the master. With us it would be the merest guess.</p>
    <p id="b459-7" data-blocks='[["BL_459.7",459,[150,2263,1161,170]],["BL_460.1",460,[289,410,1167,517]]]'>The second assignment refers to a number of distinct questions of fact, the most important of which are the concealment from the plaintiff that Thomas Beaver purchased for the defendants, partners in the firm with plaintiff, and that plaintiff’s interest in the <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>furnace was purchased for several thousand dollars less than it was worth. In regard to the first it is sufficient to say that the master, in his report upon the exceptions, finds the fact to be that it was concealed from the plaintiff that Beaver was buying for the other partners. Of this finding the plaintiff cannot complain. It is in his favor for whatever it is worth. The second ground of objection is not sustained by the evidence. The other matters referred to in this assignment are of minor importance. It was no fraud upon Geddes that Shriner received $2000, or any other sum more than he did, provided he (Geddes) received the value of his interest. A man has no legal right to complain that another has received a higher price fo$ property of similar value.</p>
    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.6",460,[282,924,1170,1505]],["BL_461.1",461,[121,415,1166,261]]]'>The third assignment alleges error in ruling that the interpo sition of Thomas Beaver to purchase for defendants was not in itself such an undue concealment as avoided the transaction at the option of the complainant. It is not too much to say that very much of the atmosphere of fraud which has been ingeniously thrown around this case is due to the circumstance of the admitted concealment of the fact that Thomas Beaver was not buying for himself, but for the other partners of the firm. That such a concealment was not a fraud per <em>se, </em>as is assumed in this assignment of error, is easily demonstrated. Of what importance was it to the plaintiff who the purchaser was, provided he obtained his price, or the value of his interest ? It is a very common thing in real estate, and perhaps other transactions, for the purchaser to conceal his name from the vendor, and negotiate through or in the name of another party. The reasons for this are obvious, and such course of dealing has never been held to be fraudulent. It is true there might be a case in which such concealment might be some evidence of fraud. But it would only be so in its relation to other facts, as to which it formed a connecting link in a chain of evidence to establish a fraud, where a fraud in fact had been committed. In this case we have the fact in proof that the relations between the plaintiff and his partners were not of the most amicable kind. This circumstance may have induced the latter to conceal their real purpose. It is said that if the plaintiff had known who the actual purchasers were, it would have put him upon his guard, and perhaps induced him to demand a higher price for his interest. This, if true, raises no equity. The argument, to be worth anything, must go the extent of supposing that the plaintiff would have used the information for the purpose of exacting a greater price than his interest was worth. For if he got its value, how was he injured ? It is possible the defendants had this in view in withholding the information from him. They had a right to, buy upon as good terms as they could, provided they did no wrong to the plaintiff. It is difficult to see why the fact that Thomas Beaver desired to purchase the plaintiff’s interest was not equally as sig<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>nificant as a purchase direct by the defendants. Mr. Beaver had gone out of the firm only the year before. He had sold out at a heavy sacrifice. He was reputed to be a wealthy and shrewd iron master. That such a person desired to come back into the firm would seem quite as suggestive of rising values as that the other partners desired to buy.</p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.6",461,[121,675,1166,259]]]'>The fourth assignment raises the really important question in this cause. Was there such a fraud in this transaction as would avoid the sale ? He who alleges fraud must prove it. And the proof must be clear and satisfactory to induce a court of equity, after the expiration of nearly six years, to avoid a contract which was deliberately made, and has been fully executed.</p>
    <p id="b461-7" data-blocks='[["BL_461.7",461,[119,933,1167,1329]]]'>This furnace was established in 1853. It had made no money prior to 1863. During that year Thomas Beaver sold out his interest at a sacrifice of about one-balf. Some years before the plaintiff had tried to sell to Peter Beaver, but without success. There is no class of real property more difficult to dispose of than an undivided interest in an iron furnace. The iron business is one in which fortunes are sometimes made rapidly, and as suddenly disappear. It is eminently precarious, subject to frequent and violent fluctuations. At the close of ten years of dull times the plaintiff had on hand as unsaleable a piece of property as could be found in the state; yet at the time he sold the tide had turned. He knew this, and was advised not to sell, but very naturally reasoned that if he did not do so when the business was improving he could not sell at all. In 1863 the firm made some money, so that on January 1st 1864 there was a balance in favor of the furnace of $12,000. Up to April 1st 1864 there was made the further sum of $16,499.67. On that day the value of the Geddes and Shriner interests, as found by the master, was $33,833.37. This included interest, which had never been earned, on the investment. The amount paid for these interests was $27,785. We cannot say that this was an inadequate price. We have no reason to suppose any one else would have given more. There is no evidence that any other purchaser could have been obtained who would have given as much. That the business was prosperous, enabling the parties to make large profits, and to pay for the shares out of the profits, is not to the purpose. We are not to judge this transaction by the light of subsequent events. It was consummated in the face of an uncertain future. The ebb and flow of the business tide in that future was concealed from human vision. Had the defendants been stranded amid its breakers, this bill probably would not have been filed.</p>

It is unnecessary to go over the allegations of concealment and misrepresentation in detail. In the absence of inadequacy of consideration they are not especially significant. <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>Much importance was attached, however, to the letter of Levi Rooke, of February 11th 1864, inasmuch as it is alleged that it grossly misrepresented the value of the property, and induced the plaintiff to sell. It is sufficient to say, in regard to it, that it does not profess to be full and accurate. It refers to the sickness of the bookkeeper, and his consequent inability to make out a balance sheet. It closes with’a request to Mr. Geddes, to come down and see for himself as soon as the bookkeeper got better. Surely if Mr. Geddes was deceived by this letter it was his own fault. He was selling his own property. He .had the fullest access to the books. Those books were his books; they belonged to the firm of which he was a member. No one ever denied him access to them, and it is not even alleged that they contained any false entries. It is not to the purpose that he did not understand them. He could have obtained the services of an expert in case he failed to obtain the information from the bookkeeper. He had the me'ans of information, and it was his duty to have availed himself thereof. He cannot charge any one else with the consequences, whatever they may be, of his own neglect. The remark of Mr. Justice Woodward, in Rockafellow <em>v. </em>Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20319" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Wright 319">5 Wright 319</a>, is applicable here: “ But there is neither fraud nor mistake, in the legal sense of those terms, when the buyer of an article, which he finds in market, has a full opportunity to examine it, and when the means of information, relative to facts and circumstances affecting the value of the commodity, are equally accessible to both parties.”</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.6",462,[309,1493,1163,474]]]'>It is to be remembered that the parties are not before us upon a bill seeking specific performance. The contract was fully executed several years ago. We are now asked to undo all this, and remit the parties to their position before the sale. A court of equity should move with cautious and reluctant steps upon such a path as this, for it is a very narrow one. Nothing but fraud or palpable mistake is ground for rescinding an executed contract: <em>Rockafellow v. </em>Baker, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20319" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 Wright 319">5 Wright 319</a>; Graham v.
