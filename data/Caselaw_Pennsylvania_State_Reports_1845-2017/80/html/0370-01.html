Purd. 167, pl. 22, enacted that a borough corporation should have power, “to survey, lay out, enact and ordain such roads, streets, &amp;c., as they may deem necessary,” &amp;c. Sect. 1 of the Act of 1856, 1 Br. Purd. 174, pl. 94, enacts, that wherever the burgesses and town council of a borough shall open, &amp;e., any street, they may apply to the Court of Quarter Sessions for the appointment of seven freeholders of such borough who shall assess the damages to parties injured by the opening of the road.</p>

It begins and ends within the borough limits. The street proposed to be opened by these proceedings is one of the streets of the borough, laid down upon its adopted plan as sixty feet wide. The case is ruled by Somerset and Stoystown Road, 24 P. F. Smith 61. We do not think the Act of April 12th 1869, affects the point decided in this case. While boroughs are named in the Act of 1869, it only means that where boroughs intend to open streets therein, the borough authorities must proceed under this act, and not the Act of 1836. It does not take from boroughs the authority conferred by the General Borough Law, nor does it repeal it. The exceptions are sustained and report set aside.”</p>

Being wholly within the borough, the Court of Quarter Sessions had not jurisdiction, as is well shown in the case of the Somerset and Stoystown Road, 24 P. F. Smith 61. The Act of April 12th 1869, does not rejoeal the General Borough Law of 3d óf April 1851, and the supplement of April 22d 1856, as regards the point in controversy, viz., jurisdiction. It is an act intended to regulate the proceedings of the viewers under any order made by proper authority, but not to change or confer jurisdiction over the subject of public roads, streets and alleys. We see no error in the record.</p>
