He averred that Nathan Smith, by deed of January 11th 1836, became entitled to two-twelfths of the trust estate; that in the following year be purchased from Smith one-twelfth and sold it in 1854. In March 1841, Smith sold him one-twelfth for $700, its full value, which he paid ; that until the 22d of January 1855, when the land was converted into stock, he publicly exercised all the rights of ownership -over the interest, paid the proportion of taxes from 1841 to 1855, and that Smith from 1841 until his death never claimed or exercised any rights of ownership; from 1841 to 1855 the title to the land was in the trustees, and Newbold held for himself without question from Smith or any one; that after the conversion, W. M. Spencer and Newbold held the one-twelfth in trust for Newbold as the owner, and as such he was elected a director in 1855 and so continued for a number of years; his claim of such ownership was known to the directors, but he was unable to produce his written title ; “ he did receive such title from Smith at the time he made the purchase, but had lost or mislaid it.” He had not then the proofs of his purchase and title, he averred he was ready to produce them in evidence. On the conveyance of the land, the directors ordered 38,500 shares to be transferred to the owners of eleven-twelfths of the interest and 3500 shares to a trustee for the owner of the remaining twelfth; Newbold claimed the 3500 shares ;' he averred thatthey belonged to Howard Spencer who was entitled to the 583 shares and the dividends. Smith died insolvent, largely indebted to Newbold, who, at the time of the conveyance to the company, held a judgment against him, w’hich would have been a lien on any interest Smith might have had in the land ; Newbold, relying on his purchase, did not levy on this interest. Howard Spencer was a director and secretary and treasurer of the company; he knew of Newbold’s claim of the one-twelfth, his payment of taxes, &amp;c. In 1868 Newbold sold this interest to Howard Spencer, who requested him to obtain quit-claim deeds from the widow and heirs of Smith; Howard Spencer authorized Newbold to pay $3000 for that purpose. After interviews with plaintiff an agreement under seal was made by her with Howard Spencer, by which she agreed to release <em>“ </em>her dower, right, title and interest in any tracts of land in the townships of Foster, Dennison, Hazle or Butler in Luzerne county, owned or claimed by the said Nathan Smith,” &amp;c., and covenanted to use her best endeavors to procure from her son and grandson, heirs of Smith, <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>a quit-claim deed to Howard Spencer for their right in those lands, Howard Spencer to pay $3000 on the delivery of her release and the quit-claim deeds. Plaintiff then knew that her husband owned lands and admitted in her bill that she had joined in conveying to Newbold one-twelfth interest in them. Newbold told plaintiff that he had delivered to Howard Spencer a quit-claim for his own interest; he read the agreement to plaintiff before she signed it, and also the deeds to be executed by his heirs, which she agreed to forward to them; he furnished her envelopes for the deeds ; she wrote to her son and grandson enclosing them, gave them to New-bold to mail, which he did; the deeds were returned to plaintiff, and her release of dower was delivered to Newbold about March 18th 1869, when he paid her $1500, which by her direction he gave to John Sparhawk, her agent, in April 1869; the other deed was delivered to Newbold ; he then gave her Howard Spencer’s check for $1500.</p>

Spencer whom she had known; he told her he was speaking of one of his sons, who had coal-lands in Luzerne county, which her husband and Newbold had once owned; that disputes had arisen about the title; Spencer wished to purchase outstanding claims ; the lands were near Hazleton, Luzerne county, and had no connection with the Wurtz lands. She replied she knew her husband had owned lands there, but thought he had sold them all; Newbold said her husband had told him so before his death; Howard Spencer wished to purchase from him (Newbold) and Smith’s heirs any possible right that might be in them; he wished only quit-claim deeds without any warranty, and would pay for such deeds something worth while ; the lands were valuable; if it settled the title, Spencer could well afford it; no sum was named; she expressed willingness to do anything she could; he particularly explained to her that her only interest was her dower in the land ; Spencer particularly wished quit-claim deeds from the heirs; she told him. who they were and shortly afterwards gave him a written statement of them ; he after-wards told her that Spencer would pay $3000 for her release of <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>dower and the quit-claim of the heirs; he told her the largest part of the money would belong to the heirs ; and he hoped they would be liberal to her ; she said they would; he asked her to advise with her business friends; she said since the death of Charles Wurtz, she had no one to consult but her sonin San Francisco; Newbold told her that her son was the one to consult; he was a lawyer, conversant with his father’s affairs, there was ample time to do it, the business could not be concluded without his sanction. On the 1st of February she executed the agreement with Spencer and received the counterpart executed by him; said she would write to her son and grandson ; Newbold told her Spencer had written to her son. When he gave her Spencer’s cheek for the first $1500 she requested him to hand it to Mr. Sparhawk to invest for her apd to say nothing to him about the transaction; he enclosed the check to Sparhawk; the second $1500 were paid her by Spencer’s check and she requested him to giveit also to Mr. Sparhawk to beinvested; he enclosed it to Sparhawk. Smith’s trunks had been sent to New-bold’s office at her request; he told her in March that he had examined them, and found nothing of value in them, but that Smith’s books showed clearly that he had sold all his interest in the lands. At the time of the sale to Spencer and for many years before, New-bold believed that this one-twelfth belonged to him; he did not know until after the transaction was closed, when he saw for the first time a brief of title prepared by Mr. Patrick by direction of the president of the company; that the title stood on the records of Luzerne county in the name of Nathan Smith — it had been suggested that it might be in Smith, but there had been much confusion in the title of many of the shares for a number of years — when in 1868 he agreed to sell to Spencer both were ignorant how the title stood ; during the negotiation with plaintiff they at one time thought it might be in the heirs of John Troubat or George H. Thomson. Newbold believing in equity that it belonged to him made a sacrificing sale to Spencer to get his aid in clearing up disputes by purchasing interfering claims; the allegation that New-bold concealed his purpose from her was “false and unfounded,” she had ample time to consult her friends between the last of January and the 26th of March when the deeds were delivered.</p>

    <p id="b330-10" data-blocks='[["BL_330.10",330,[296,1756,1162,206]]]'>Although the fact of purchase is stoutly denied, yet we do' not see sufficient evidence to reverse this finding. We therefore assume it to be correct. But the master further found that Nathan Smith did not execute any deed or instrument of writing conveying the same.</p>
    <p id="b330-11" data-blocks='[["BL_330.11",330,[297,1971,1160,216]]]'>This finding of fact is alleged for error inasmuch as in Newbold's answer he distinctly avers he had received a wi'itten title from Nathan Smith for the share in dispute ; that the answer was distinctly responsive to the bill, and it had not been contradicted by any witness of the plaintiff in the bill.</p>
    <p id="b330-12" data-blocks='[["BL_330.12",330,[297,2186,1164,258]],["BL_331.1",331,[134,404,1168,167]]]'>If the case rested on the bill and on the answer of Newbold alone, or if his subsequent testimony had not contradicted his answer, there would be great force in this defence so far as it applied to himself. The answer, however, would not have availed Spencer, who had no knowledge of the alleged purchase, except what he received from Newbold and answered on information and belief only. Be<a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>sides, in the deed from Newbold to Spencer of the 1st of February 1869, conveying this one-twelfth share to the latter,- it is distinctly averred, “whereas the said Nathan Smith died without executing to me a deed for the said one-twelfth share or interest.”</p>
    <p id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.6",331,[136,578,1167,479]]]'>It is a significant fact that this deed bears the same date as the contract between Spencer and Mrs. Smith, which by a more general description included the same share. Thus it clearly appears that Spencer accepted a conveyance from Newbold of the land in question under an express declaration, that Nathan Smith had never executed a deed for said premises. As further evidencing the knowledge of the parties to the conveyance, and fully to protect Newbold, he therein declared “nothing herein contained shall be construed so as to render me liable to make good the title to the premises hereby granted, but only to transfer to the said Howard Spencer all my right, title and interest therein.”</p>
    <p id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[139,1056,1163,390]]]'>On testifying before the examiner, April 18th 1872, Newbold said, “ I believe he made me a deed for it; I had searched for tha¿t deed for years ; I have never been able to find it.” On a further examination, May 29th 1872, he answered: “ I do not know that I ever had a deed, I am strongly impressed that I had.” Then to the question, “who wrote the deed which you say you are impressed you had for the share in dispute ?” he answered, “I don’t know that any deed was ever written, and of course can’t say who wrote it; I have no recollection on the subject.”</p>
    <p id="b331-8" data-blocks='[["BL_331.8",331,[138,1447,1165,475]]]'>Thus, as a witness, he frittered away on this point all certainty in his answer as a party. If, when subjected to the test of an examination, he could not swear that he ever had a deed; nor that he had ever seen one, nor that one was ever written, and that he had no recollection on the subject of a deed, it is very clear the master was correct in finding the evidence insufficient to prove the execution and delivery of a deed. We- may concede the correctness of the remark made by Chancellor Green in Brown <em>v. </em>Buckley, 1 McCarter (N. J.) 295, as to the general effect of the answer; yet here Newbold, the witness, substantially impeached and overthrew the answer of Newbold the party.</p>
    <p id="b331-9" data-blocks='[["BL_331.9",331,[138,1923,1164,432]]]'>The positive declaration made in his deed, under seal, some two years before his answer, harmonized with his solemn oath, made nearly two years after his answer. When a party is permitted to testify, and does testify in conflict with his answer, it will not do to hold that his testimony shall be disregarded and his answer stand wholly unimpeached. Precisely how far the rule should be modified, now that a party may be a witness in his own behalf, it is not necessary at'present to indicate. We see no reason to dissent from the conclusion of the master, that no deed was ever executed by Nathan Smith for the share in question.</p>
    <p id="b331-10" data-blocks='[["BL_331.10",331,[140,2355,1161,86]],["BL_332.1",332,[296,419,1169,641]]]'>Nor do we discover any error in his conclusion that no such exclusive possession was taken by Newbold in pursuance of the <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>contract as to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds. As trustee before the sale he paid the taxes on the land. They were unseated and no one was in actual possession. He merely continued to pay the taxes as before. No change of possession was taken in consequence of his purchase. Payment of the purchase-money alone is insufficient to take the case out of the statute. At most, however, this was a purchase by one tenant in common of the interest of his co-tenant. There can be no valid parol sale of lands among tenants in common in possession, as there cannot be any such delivery of possession as will take the case out of the statute: Workman <em>v. </em>Guthrie, 5 Casey 495; Chadwick <em>v. </em>Felt, 11 Id. 305; Hill <em>v. </em>Meyers, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wright%20170" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Wright 170">7 Wright 170</a>; McCormick’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 54. Nor was there any such actual, hostile, continued and exclusive possession in Newbold, as to give him title under the Statute of Limitations.</p>
    <p id="b332-6" data-blocks='[["BL_332.6",332,[292,1068,1168,563]]]'>It therefore follows that at the time of his purchase from Mrs. Smith he had no right to this share which he could enforce at law or in equity against the heirs of Nathan Smith. 'He held the share as land in trust for them, until the sale to the company. Thenceforth he held the stock and proceeds thereof in like manner. Primá facie the purchase of a trustee from his <em>cestui que trust </em>cannot stand. To sustain it the trustee must have acted in entire good faith. He must show that he made to the <em>cestui que trust </em>the fullest disclosures of all he knew in regard to the subject-matter, and that the’ price he paid was adequate: Coles <em>v. </em>Trecothick, 9 Vesey 234; Randall <em>v. </em>Errington, 10 Id. 423; Greenfield’s Estate, 2 Harris 489; Diller <em>v. </em>Brubaker, 2 P. F. Smith 498; Wistar’s Appeal, 4 Id. 60; Parshall’s Appeal, 15 Id. 224.</p>
    <p id="b332-7" data-blocks='[["BL_332.7",332,[288,1630,1168,561]]]'>A reference to the evidence shows that Newbold did not inform Mrs. Smith that he had ever held this property in trust for her late husband; nor that he had purchased it from Mr. Smith; nor that he and William M. Spencer had conveyed it to the Black Creek Improvement Company, and had received in payment therefor, stock of large value; nor that coal mines were being worked on the land, and that a cash dividend had been declared on the stock. It is true he did say to her that Mr. Spencer had some valuable coal interests in lands which he (Newbold) and Mr. Smith had formerly owned, and he was desirous of removing some doubts about his title; that he wanted to get quit claim deeds from her and from the heirs of her husband, and her release of dower, for which he would pay something.</p>
    <p id="b332-8" data-blocks='[["BL_332.8",332,[288,2189,1161,262]],["BL_333.1",333,[123,427,1171,686]]]'>He then withheld the substantial facts, which would have shown that she and the heirs of her late husband had a clear right to the property and its great value. His whole language was manifestly intended to convey, and did convey to Mrs. Smith, the idea that their interest was small and of uncertain value. At this time she was past eighty-six years of age.' The vigor and strength of her <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>mind were impaired. She possessed limited means; hence the persuasive kindness of Newbold to pay her money so soon, was well calculated to prevent suspicion, and cause her to refrain from making inquiries of others. She was thus induced to procure for Spencer the title of the heirs, and transfer her own and all, for not more than one-seventh of .its value. Spencer knew by the quit-claim deed which he received from Newbold, that Smith had executed no deed for the lands. In making the contract with Mrs. Smith, Newbold acted for both Spencer and himself. Each had full knowledge. Both were interested in the stock issued for this share. Spencer therefore stands on no higher ground than his agent and co-partner. Substantially the same concealments and suggestions procured the deeds from the heirs. Manifestly such a purchase cannot be sustained in equity. It is unnecessary to discuss all the collateral questions in detail. We see no error in the conclusion of the master nor in the decree of the court.</p>
    <p id="b333-6" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[124,1123,1167,86]]]'>Decree affirmed, and the appeal of each party is dismissed at the cost of the appellant therein.</p>
