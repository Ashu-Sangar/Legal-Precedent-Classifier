It was a very wise and salutary restriction upon the power of increasing the city debt. It is true that every contract which the city councils may make or may authorize to be made will generally eventuate in a debt. But surely it was not intended to enact that every such contract should be accompanied by such an appropriation. It is said, however, that there must either be an appropriation from moneys raised by taxation or from income actually in the treasury, or by a loan under the restrictions provided by the law. It is maintained then, that the appropriation in the ordinance in question, “ to be taken from a loan to be hereafter created,” is unlawful and renders the whole ordinance invalid. The contention is plausible ; but the fallacy lies in infecting the contract made by the ordinance with the vice of the appropriation. We may admit that the appropriation is invalid. Future councils may neglect or refuse to create the loan, or not recognise this appropriation as a binding claim upon it. But there is nothing in the Consolidation Act, or any of its supplements, which requires that there should be an actual appropriation contemporaneous with á contract made by the authority of councils, and not by the head of a department. “ No contract,” says the Act of 1855, “shall be made by the head of any department for work or materials for the city, unless for objects authorized by councils.” “ No debt or contract,” says the Act of 1858, “ hereafter incurred or made shall be binding upon the city of Philadelphia unless authorized by law or ordinance, and an appropriation sufficient to pay the same be previously made'by councils.” All these acts are to be construed together, and in that view it seems evident that these provisions were intended to prohibit any officer or head of department from incurring any debt or making any contract with<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>out previous authority of law or ordinance, and without an appropriation.</p>
    <p id="b471-6" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[121,496,1160,431]]]'>That it cannot apply to the acts of the councils, to contracts directly authorized or made by ordinance, is evident from this consideration alone: that there must then be two ordinances: 1st. An ordinance authorizing councils to enter into the contract and making the appropriation; and 2d. An ordinance making or ratifying the contract. The legislature must certainly have considered that emergencies might arise requiring the immediate expenditure of large sums of money, either to restore what had been swept away by some destructive element, or to ward off some great impending calamity.</p>
    <p id="b471-7" data-blocks='[["BL_471.7",471,[121,927,1160,552]]]'>It did not mean that the hands of the councils should be tied in such cases until there was an amount of money in the treasury arising from income or taxation sufficient to meet it. Whoever makes a contract with the city upon the faith of a promise that it shall be paid out of a future loan runs the risk that the loan may never be legally authorized; that the money may never be obtained upon it, since it is clear that it could not be enforced by any proceeding in law or equity. That is no reason why a court of equity should interpose and stop the work. The consequences of such a defect of power in the city as that contended for by the appellants, might indeed be of the most serious character, and would of itself be a sufficient reason why a court of equity should not interfere.</p>
