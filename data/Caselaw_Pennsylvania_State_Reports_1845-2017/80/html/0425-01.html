He denied that plaintiffs had no other way to relieve the road from water. He denied that the water which collected on the highway for thirty years before making the turnpike had been carried off through his property. He averred that there was no right to turn the water on his property, and that he never had more than a fair share of the water until the plaintiffs turned it on him as above stated.

    <p class="summary" id="b426-7" data-blocks='[["BL_426.7",426,[295,1014,1161,1409]]]'>He reported: that in pursuance of their charter, the plaintiffs had laid their turnpike on a public highway called the “ Swamp Road,” under which had been a culvert for nearly thirty years, opposite defendant’s lot, to carry the water running on the north-easterly side of the road to the opposite side, on which there were then no houses; the land was used for farming, and the water falling on the road was carried on the land in three places, one being where the defendant’s lot was, one above and one below, draining the road for a quarter of a mile. There was little difference in the fall between the places of the two lower drains. When the turnpike was located through Gilbertsville, no change was made in the culvert. The land was divided then into lots and a number of houses erected on the south-westerly side, and until within a few years the water was carried off as -theretofore. A house was built near where the upper drain was, and the drain was shut up; one was built near the lower drain, which was also closed. This drain, before it was closed, had received most of the water ; the water after that, all ran through the defendant’s lot. He then closed the drain through him, and water either stood in front of his house, or, when sufficiently high, ran down the road and upon other grounds. The location of the turnpike over the old highway vacated it, and remitted the owners of the land to their original rights so far as to relieve them from the authority of the supervisors to make and maintain drains. The charter did not confer these rights on the plaintiffs. They had only the right which the superior owner had for the discharge of waters naturally falling upon the inferior; and if the three drains were natural outlets, the plaintiffs had no right to make such obstruction as to cause the flow through defendant’s land alone. The improvements along the road were allowed by the plaintiffs without their objection to change the course of drainage. They could not complain of the defendant’s obstruction, without affording him means to relieve himself from the water which should not run on his lot.</p>

Whether this was caused by the unlawful acts of others by throwing the ■waters into a channel along the turnpike to his premises, or by the act of the company, his right to protect his property from this unusual flow was the same.
