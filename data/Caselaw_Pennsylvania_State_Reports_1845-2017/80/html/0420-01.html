It is further agreed, that the son is to furnish the father, so long as the latter remains on the farm, with hay and pasture needed, and twenty bushels of <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>wheat, twenty bushels of corn, ten of oats, apples, cider and wood and potato patch. Of the money, $1000 to be paid on demand, and $500 in two years, without interest; and then this clause occurs : ‘The heirs of Benjamin Hummel are each to have a farm, and the said Henry Hummel, by paying $1500, will be entitled to an equal share of all the property which may be left after said Benjamin Hummel and his wife Catharine Hummel’s decease, provided each of the other heirs have a farm as above mentioned.” It is contended that this amounts to a contract between the father and son; that the latter shall be allowed an equal share in his father’s estate upon the decease of the latter; and this action is brought to recover damages for the breach of the agreement upon two grounds, First, That old Mr. Hummel in his lifetime gave to certain of his children lands to the exclusion of Henry ; and Second, Because the father, by will, left his estate to others, and Henry’s heirs (he having died before his father) got nothing, or but little. It is far from clear that this amounts to a covenant on the part of the father to make his son Henry an equal distributee of the residue of his estate, after each of his heirs had received a farm; but it looks more as if Henry feared that he would be charged with this farm at an advancement, and that he should not be; the clause was inserted to show that he was a purchaser for full value, and that this arrangement between him and his father was not to be considered on the final distribution of the latter’s estate. But whether this be the true interpretation or not, it seems clear to us th^t there can be no recovery for the lands the father conveyed in his lifetime to his other children ; for at most Henry was to have an equal share of what was left at the death of his father and mother. This did not preclude the father from disposing of his property as he chose during life. But were we to assume that the writing has the force and effect claimed for it, we are of the opinion that in either view its enforcement is exclusively in the Orphans’ Court having control of the personal representatives of Benjamin Hummel, the father; because, if the legal effect of the covenant is to make the sale of 136 acres a matter of bargain and sale, that is the court having jurisdiction of advancements; and if, in fact, the agreement is a covenant to make Henry a distributee, that is the court having power to distribute, and to permit him to participate as a distributee. The Court of Common Pleas can do neither, nor can it measure the damages in a common-law action, for it knows not the value of the dead father’s estate, nor can a jury settle the estate so as to determine the value thereof. The Orphans’ Court is competent to deal with any question of fact that it encounters in the course of distribution, either by an auditor or an issue, so that there is no difficulty on that score. It is well settled, that the Orphans’ Court <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>alone has jurisdiction to recovera distributee’s share of a decedent’s estate.”</p>

The payment of the sum of $1500 was not the consideration of such a covenant as is alleged, but was the condition on which equality of distribution was to depend.
