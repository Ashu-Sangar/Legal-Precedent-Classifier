The Junction Railroad Company was incorporated to construct a road from a point on the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad to a.point on the Philadelphia, AVilmington and Baltimore Railroad. The line traversed ground of these roads and of the Pennsylvania Railroad, that of the last company being the central part of the line and used as their “ yard.” The road was promoted by the three companies; they owned the stock, their presidents were officers in the Junction company, which constructed all the line except the portion through the “ yard,” this was constructed by the Pennsylvania company, under the direction of Thomson, their president, who was also president of the Junction company. No measures had been taken to condemn the land through the “ yard,” for the Junction company. They by bill asked for a decree that they were entitled to the “ exclusive ownership, possession and use” of that portion .through the “yard.” <em>Held, </em>that they were not entitled to such-decree.</p>

Some time after the line of the Junction Railroad, except as aforesaid, had been completed, complainants learned that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company claimed that the section of the said railroad extending from Haverford street to Market street, had been constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and for their own use ; that it belonged exclusively to them, and that the Junction Railroad Company had no interest in it; that it was partly the Pennsylvania Railroad proper and partly the Delaware Extension of that railroad — the latter being the name given to the railroad constructed on the location of the Junction Railroad from Haverford street to Market street. This claim led to a protracted negotiation in which complainants failed to' induce the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to recognise any right of the Junction Railroad Company in the said road; the Pennsylvania Railroad Company refused, and still did refuse, to permit the Junction Railroad Company to run locomotives on or over the said section of road, or to complete the construction of the Junction Railroad between its present connection with the Pennsylvania Railroad east of Thirty-fifth street and Haverford street. The Junction Railroad Company had spent over $870,000 in the construction of their road; the road was constructed in the most substantial manner, with every appliance of a first-class railroad; it was intended for the interchange of passengers and freight between <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>the great railroads converging towards the city of Philadelphia, on the west side of the Schuylkill river, and to relieve the streets of the city on the east side of the river from the passage of cars between the said railroads; the capital and credit of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, and the Pennsylvania Railroad Company were jointly contributed towards the construction of the road, with the expectation that each of them should have an equal share in its management and control; the attempt of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to appropriate the middle section of the said road, would prevent the Junction Railroad Company from carrying on the business of a transporting company at all, to a great extent defeat the objects for which the said railroad was constructed, and give to one corporation the absolute control of the interchange and delivery of the freight, mails and passengers brought to the Junction Railroad by the several roads with which it is connected. The most expensive work on the line of the Junction Railroad is a tunnel under Market and Chestnut streets; the approach ■ to this ■ tunnel through a deep cut, is completely occupied by the tracks of the railroad passing into and through it; and if the Junction Railroad Company are compelled to relinquish the section of their railroad north of the tunnel, they cannot possibly select a new location on which they can build a railroad leading into the tunnel.</p>

It was proposed and understood that each company of the three projecting the road should be paid a fair compensation for the land taken from each; but, in the harmonious spirit and somewhat informal action which then prevailed, the matter was left unattended to, and the ‘ fair compensation’ for any portion of such land was never estimated. * * * The compensation may be waived entirely, or, if not entirely, at least so far as security, or payment in advance, is concerned. It follows, then, that the company defendant cannot properly claim that the Junction Railroad Company has not acquired the disputed roadway because it has not paid what are commonly called the road damages. * * * The fact, however, that the matter of compensation was considered, and either neglected or waived, takes all force out of this argument, as urged on behalf of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. If this right to such compensation still exists, that company has its appropriate remedy to recover it. The right to use <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>and occupy the ground, nevertheless, would not be postponed to its payment, if the principles of law applicable to such cases have been correctly stated. For this reason, and because of the part borne by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in the projecting and organization of the Junction Railroad Company, and in the selection of a location for its road, as well as because the data for arriving at any conclusion as to the amount which might be due for the ground occupied, are not before the masters, they think that a decree should not be withheld until that amount can be determined.</p>

The first indication of Mr. Thomson’s change of plan as to the line of the road, of which the date can he fixed, is found in the letter from him, as president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, to Mr. Wilson, under date of May 12th 1862. As the masters understand this communication, it evidently and necessarily implies that, down to its date, the intention had been that the part of the road in controversy should be not only a part of the line of the Junction Railroad, but that it should be constructed by the Junction Railroad Company. Else, why should he say that, ‘under the new location ’ (which was not of this part of the road, but of that above Haverford street) ‘ of the Junction Railroad,’ that ‘ portion of it between Market and Haverford streets, on the old location, will, in consequence of so material a portion of the Pennsylvania Railroad being used above Haverford street, be constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company?’ This means that, in Mr. Thomson’s thought and purpose, there was to be a change in the constructing party, and that change could, in the nature of the case, only have been <em>from </em>the Junction Railroad Company. It is evident, however, from this letter alone, that Mr. Thomson even then considered that it was ‘ a portion of’ the Junction Railroad which was to be built by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. A reference, also, to the letter from Mr. Thomson to Mr. W. H. Wilson, written on the same day, will show that he, Mr. Thomson, at that time proposed only that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company should <em>build </em>that ‘ portion of’ the Junction Railroad which ran through the grounds of that company, and thereby again showed that he then considered the road to be built to be separate and different from the Pennsylvania Railroad. The masters think that the only interpretation which can fairly and reasonably be put upon these communications, and upon the others connected with them, is that 'Mr. Thomson, for some reason not disclosed, but, apparently, for the sake of convenience, ‘in consequence of its’ (the Junction Railroad) ‘passing entirely through the grounds of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company,’ thought it better that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company should build, and therefore pay for, the part of the road in question, leaving the repayment of the amount thus expended for future settlement.

The relation between the three companies making up the latter was, to a certain extent, fiduciary, and it could not be terminated by a mere notice. From its very nature it was continuing in its character. And whether this be so or not, it is plain that neither the letter to Mr. Smith nor the conversation between Messrs. Thomson, Smith and Felton, were such as would alter any of the rights of the parties then existing. Mr. Smith and Mr. Felton were but two of several directors, and neither, nor both of them, could, by their silence or consent, extinguish rights and interests of such a character and so intimately connected with the very purpose of their corporation. Moreover, these gentlemen seem, from Mr. Thomson’s own testimony, to have repudiated promptly any suggestion that looked like the control, of this part of the road by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. It is plain, from their testimony, that they did not understand any such claim to be set up as that now pressed. In the most liberal application of legal principles, therefore, such a notice could not bind the Junction Railroad Company. Even if, however, it should be conceded that notice was given by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to the Junction Railroad Company of their alleged claim just considered, in the terms of Mr. Thomson’s letter to Mr. Smith and of his conversation with Messrs.

The contention relates to an alleged abandonment of the location. It may be said, generally, that there is nc evidence of any express abandonment, or of any intention on the part of the Junction Railroad Company to abandon it. Mr. John A. Wilson gave as his reason for thinking the location had been given up, that the board of directors <em>accepted </em>the revised line of the board of surveyors, which delineated a route for the Junction Railroad, from Belmont to the crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad, near Haverford street, as distinctly as the old location. * * * This change was made, not at the instance of the Junction Railroad Company, but by order of the board of surveyors. How the <em>acceptance </em>of the new location could be construed to be an <em>abandonment </em>of it, is not very clear. It would seem to be directly the reverse. * * * The location is satisfactorily accounted for by the question, which seems to have arisen in 1862, as to whether or not an exchange of tracks could be made with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company at that point by the fact that a rock-cutting was necessary for that portion of the road, which cutting was not finished until 1866, and also by the great anxiety which existed ‘ after the work on the Junction Railroad had been begun,’ to secure a through line from Belmont to the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, which was actually secured in November 1868, by means of the Juntion Railroad from Belmont to Lipp’s brewery, and thence by other railroads then built to the.

The ownership of said track is now claimed by the Junction Railroad Company, it being alleged that the latter company have legally acquired the right of way over said property. If such right of way exists it must have been acquired in one of three ways, viz.: First, by the exercise of the right of eminent domain under powers contained in their charter; second, by express grant from the Pennsylvania Railroad Company ; or, third, by such acts of permission or acquiescence on the part of the appellants in its use by the Junction Railroad Company, appellees, from which a grant of the right of way .may be presumed, and which, in equity, would estop the appellants from denying the existence of such right.</p>

No notice was ever given to the appellants that their property would be so taken. No payment was ever-made or tendered of the damages, nor was any security ever given or offered therefor, as required by law. It is not alleged that there was any express grant from the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for this right of way. If such right exists at all, it must be upon the ground of equitable estoppel The error of the argument upon this point consists in treating the late J. Edgar Thomson as the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. At the period when the Junction Railroad was constructed, Mr. Thomson was the president of both the Pennsylvania and the Junction companies. His acts or declarations as president of the latter company could no more bind the former company than the acts or declarations of a stranger. As president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company he was its chief executive officer and general agent in the matter of operating its lines under the powers contained in its charter. He could not, as such agent, lawfully give away a dollar of the company’s property, an inch of its track, or the least of its franchises. What he could not pass by his direct act, he certainly could not pass by way of estoppel. To concede that any such power exists in the president of a corporation, by virtue of his office, would be as disastrous in its results as unsound in point of law. No authority is needed for so self-evident a proposition. As a director and the president of the Junction Railroad Company, Mr. Thomson was merely the representative of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to the amount of the stock held by it in the Junction company.</p>

Erom this they argue that the section of the road in dispute, even if constructed by the Pennsylvania company, was, nevertheless, a portion of the continuous line of the former company ; that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company must be held to have constructed it merely as a matter of convenience to themselves, and that the road itself must be deemed and taken as a portion of the Junction road, subject, perhaps, to a liability to make compensation therefor; that to hold that the Pennsylvania company constructed it at their own expense, for the purpose of claiming the ownership thereof, would be to accuse Mr. Thomson of an act of deception amounting to bad faith. But it appears clearly in the case that on May 12th 1862, Mr. Thomson, as president of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, distinctly notified the chief engineer of the Junction road, in writing, that “ under the new location of the Junction Railroad, that portion of it between Market and Haverford streets, in the old location, will, in consequence of so <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>material a portion of the Pennsylvania Railroad being used above Haverford street, be constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. This is also advisable in consequence of its passing entirely through the grounds of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.” Mr. Thomson also testified that shortly prior to- the date of the above letter, in an interview with Mr. Felton, the president of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and Mr. Smith, the president of the Reading Railroad, both of whom were directors of the Junction road, he communicated to them the fact that the portion of the Junction road referred to was being constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.,</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[163,876,1165,779]]]'>Mr. Felton and Mr. Smith differ from Mr. Thomson in their recollection of this interview, but Mr. Thomson is strongly corroborated by his letter to Mr. Smith, dated May 13th 1862, and produced from the archives of the Reading Railroad Company. These facts would seem to establish appellants’ allegation that, before a blow had been struck or a spade put-in the ground, in the construction of the Junction road, Mr. Thomson gave full notice that the section referred to would be made by the Pennsylvania, company. This takes the sting out of the allegation of bad faith. This section of the track having been constructed over and upon the ground of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company by that company, and at their own expense, upon notice to the Junction Railroad Company, it would require a much stronger case of equitable estoppel than is here presented to take from the former company its property, lawfully acquired. We do not deem it necessary to extend this opinion by a discussion of the various acts relied upon by the appellees to work an estoppel. The case does not need elaboration. It is too plain.</p>
    <p id="b291-6" data-blocks='[["BL_291.7",291,[160,1656,1167,735]]]'>It is conceded that the portion of track from Haverford street to a point east of Thirty-fifth street was constructed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.

They do claim, however, in this proceeding, the right to construct this portion of the road upon the location adopted by the board of surveyors and approved by the hoard of directors of the J unction Railroad Company. It appears, however, that this was a mere paper location, no location having been made upon the ground. There was evidence of its abandonment; that the city board of surveyors had surveyed a revised or different-line, which revised line has been accepted by the board of directors of the Junction,'road. Mr. John A. Wilson, the engineer of the latter road, says in his testimony, that this location had been abandoned.' In addition, we have the fact that the location referred to is now occupied by six tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
