But it is the duty of those floating the barges to use care and caution, and in the night-time to have proper signal lights, “ one or more good white lights,” as required by the Act of Congress, so placed as to give due notice to an approaching steamer. The lights should be of a character to be seen distinctly, to give the approaching steamer fair notice of the location and size of the floating craft, and should be elevated in time to enable the steamer, without haste or confusion, but deliberately, to choose its course, in order to avoid collision.</p>

Even if you believe that the mate might have avoided the collision if he had seen the light a few moments sooner, that of itself is not sufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover. His skirts must be clear of all negligence on his part. It was his duty to put up such lights and in such manner and time — not merely to make it possible for the steamer to avoid a collision — but to give the officers .of the steamer ample time to determine their course and act deliberately in all they did. It was not sufficient, to bring out his lights when he saw and apprehended danger — only some three minutes before the collision.

    <p class="summary" id="b113-10" data-blocks='[["BL_113.10",113,[117,1195,1160,609]]]'>“ When the order of court was made, reducing the verdict from $2106.24 to $1500, it was the understanding of the court, that, if the plaintiff filed a stipulation accepting that sum, it would be satisfactory to defendants, and end the case. But after the stipulation was filed and judgment entered for the $1500, the defendants sued out their writ of error. If we had supposed the defendants would not accept that order of the court as a finality, or intended to take a writ of error, we should not have interfered with the verdict, and should have refused absolutely to grant a new trial. If the plaintiff must follow the case to the Supreme Court and be subject to further delay and further litigation bn the legal questions, he ought to have the chance of getting the whole amount of the verdict. The question of damage was fairly submitted to the jury, and the amount they gave was not beyond the plaintiff’s evidence.</p>

It is therefore now ordered, to wit, June 28th 1875, that the plaintiff have leave to withdraw his stipulation consenting to take $1500; that the order of court of February 25th 1875, be hereby revoked; that the new trial be refused, and that judgment be entered on the verdict for the amount thereof.” * * *</p>

J. Grace, whilst navigating the Ohio river. It was alleged that this loss happened through the negligence of the defendants’ •employees who had charge of their boat. This was the issue; it was one of fact, and any evidence which tended to establish negli<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>gence, on part of those navigating the steamer, or their incompetency in the discharge of the duties which devolved upon them, and which would tend, though remotely, to produce the catastrophe complained of, was relevant and pertinent to the issue trying. The plaintiff’s barges were floating down the river, propelled by the current, and directed only by oars. The steamboat was ascending, driven by steam, and fully under the control of its pilot; hence, it was bound, by every law of navigation, to keep clear of the barges. Obviously, then, a collision happening, under such circumstances, the boat would be prima, facie in fault. It follows, that the plaintiff might have rested upon showing the collision and loss, with the additional evidence, made necessary by the fact that the accident happened at night, that the precaution required by the Act of Congress, as well as by common prudence, to wit, the exhibition of such light or lights as were necessary to warn the steamer of the position of the barges, had been complied with. If, however, the plaintiff chose to go a step further and show that the boat was improperly manned, he might without error do so. It was at best but anticipating the defence by introducing, out of order, his rebutting evidence. It was certainly competent for the defendants to attempt to show, as they did, that the pilot was careful and skilful, for, thereby, the probabilities of negligence would be greatly reduced, but in such case it would not be controverted that the plaintiff might rebut by proving the incompetency of that officer. Independently of this, the plaintiff was not bound to rest his case upon the presumption of carelessness arising from circumstances, but might prove positive negligence, and we certainly think that proof of want of skill, in so important an officer as the pilot, wa.s at least one step in that direction. We, therefore, refuse to sustain the first and second assignments of error. The sixth, seventh and eighth relate to one point, to wit, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff in not carrying upon his barges, during the night, one or more fixed lights. This question was properly submitted to the jury. The learned judge who tried the case says: “ His (the plaintiff’s) skirts must be clear of all negligence on his part. It was his duty to put up such lights, and in such manner and time— not merely to make it <em>possible </em>for the steamer to avoid a collision— but, to give the officers ample time to determine their course, and act deliberately in all they did. It was not sufficient to bring out his lights when he saw and apprehended danger — only some three minutes before the collision. They should have been out before that; before any danger was seen or apprehended.” We cannot see how the defendants could require a direction more favorable. The duty of the plaintiff was to show a light when it would avail the pilot and créw of the steamboat to avoid a collision with the barges, and that that duty was neglected during the remainder of <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>the night, when the steamer was not in sight, was of no importance whatever to the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.6",116,[292,477,1166,1064]]]'>The fourth assignment must be sustained. The fact of the suicide of the pilot, within twenty-four hours, or at any other time, aftei’ the accident, was so clearly not evidence that argument upon this point is not necessary. The only usé that could be made of such testimony would be to damage the defendants’ case by raising a presumption of negligence in the pilot, from his own appalling and atrocious act, for which the defendants were not in the slightest degree responsible. This matter should not have appeared in the case. So, the declarations of Marshall, unless made before or at the time of the collision and “so connected with it as to make then part of the <em>res gestee," </em>ought not to have been admitted. As was said by Mr. Justice Agnew in Fawcett <em>v. </em>Bigley, 9 P. F. Smith 411: “The narrative of an agent of a past occurrence cannot be received as proof, against the principal, of the existence of such occurrence.” The offer, in the case cited, was to prove the declarations of the defendant’s agent within one hour after the accident, but it was rejected, and, as we have seen, that rejection was sustained by this court. We find, therefore, that the nearness of the subsequent declarations of an agent to the accident, does not qualify them as evidence unless such declarations are so immediately connected with it as necessarily to form part of its history. The ninth assignment is not sustained. The court well answer the point in saying, that the breaking of the bell-rope would not be evidence of negligence unless it, in some degree, contributed to the accident.</p>
