Bank lane was on the top of the bluff; along some places it was so narrow that a horse could not travel; a man could walk along it; there was a path and a fence some places. At a low. stage of water there was a slough only 3 or 4 feet wide ; it was back water and would run up of that width as far as School street; at a 6 feet stage of water, the water would just go through; there was always some water when the river was the lowest; at a 5 or 6 feet stage of water, between the island and the main shore, the water would be 30 or 40 feet wide; the higher the water the wider it would be. At the time of the trial the pavement of South avenue came out to the slough; the pavement is just in front of the fences of the lot holders. At the corner of School street there had been filling out about 200 feet each way. A survey was made on behalf of the plaintiffs ; by it the north line of South avenue would come inside, over Bank lane; there was a little interference by the line of South avenue with Bank lane, the most would be 10 or 15 feet; South avenue lies towards the river more. The edge of South avenue at the bank of the river is a steep descent; its width is not, filled out, 60 feet; at the upper end it is filled out into low ground, and then it runs into a kind of a wet place or swale, where there had been land at one time; the south line of the patent goes beyond the high- and low-water lines as established by the commissioner; about 10 acres of the channel of the river, beyond the low-water line of the commissioners, is included within the patent lines. When there were 5 or 6 feet of water in the river, the whole of the island would be submerged. By a sudden fall in the river, the water between the island and the main land would be left in ponds, between which there would be wide spaces, so that the place of the channel could be walked over easily; the deepest water was at the head of Kill-<a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>buck island; in ordinary stages of water there was a channel; boats would go through ; when the river was well up the space between the river and the end óf the lots was quite narrow, there was just a pathway around the fences of the lots. The bank was low where Bank lane came down to School street. Between the island and Bank lane there was a slough; at the point where that lane came down to the river at the top of the island, it was wider and got narrower as it went down. The slough was formed by the water coming in at the head of the island, and the drainage from a little run from the hill; it was never dry.</p>

The declared intention of the act was to perfect the title to an <em>island. </em>The boundaries embrace more; they describe, not an island, but a part, apparently of main land, or at least bound the <em>island </em>its entire length on one side by the main land — Bank lane. These boundaries include the inner channel of the river, and a portion of the river-bed beyond the island. Perhaps the act in this respect is unconstitutional, because that part of it is not embraced in the title.

My instructions are that you are to bound the island on the north, and at its head and foot by what was low-water mark of the island of 1806.

The recitals in the act, I consider of very little consequence in the decision of the reserved question. Kill-buck never followed up his application, nor obtained any valid title. Whatever claim he had was forfeited by not getting a warrant of survey, and paying for the island, as required by the Act of 27th January 1806.

Such an act would be inconsistent with the character and dignity of a sovereign state. In 1849, as decided in Reed’s case, the island had ceased to exist, and there was no law authorizing the foundation to be taken up as an island. * * * If there were no intervening rights, the Act of 1873 would give a good title to plaintiffs without reference to Killbuck’s title.

It was not a <em>reliction </em>nor an <em>avulsion. </em>It did not, therefore, fall within any of the recognised common law rights of riparian owners. And if the Act of 1858 did not extend these rights, or in some other way give them a title, they have none.</p>

If the plaintiffs exhibited a valid title, and the city of Allegheny showed none in itself or its citizens, the municipal power of the city over its highways, or its possession of the rights of the state between the lines of high and low water, were no defence to a recovery. The title to Killbuck or Smoky island was therefore the only question. There was no title to this island in any one before the passage of the Act of 28th April 1873. Killbuck, the original claimant, had none, and his assigns were in no better condition. Unless the state had granted a title to the lot owners, or to the city of Allegheny, there was nothing in her way to prevent the passage of the Act of 1873. The fact that the island had been washed away, prevented a grant of the stony or sandy bottom on which it had rested under the ordinary land laws of the state or usages of the Land Office: Allegheny City <em>v. </em>Reed, 12 Harris 39; Poor <em>et al. v. </em>McClure, 27 P.

The verdict was rendered accordingly, limiting the plaintiff’s recovery to the natural low-water line of the island on the north side, that is, on the side next to the main land. If there were any error in this instruction, upon which we give no opinion, it was one of which the city can not complain. The question of discrepancy between the title of the Act of 1873 and its body, is therefore not before us. The Act is good to the extent of the recovery: Dorsey’s Appeal, 22 P. F.

There was no title in the owners of the lots bounded by Bank lane. These lots were laid out by the state on her own property (the reserve .tract), and were made to bound on streets and lanes, and on each other, just as the other lots of the town were. Bank lane was laid out upon the north bank of the river following its windings, and its northern line was made the southern boundary of these lots. They did not cross Bank lane to the river. If the doctrine of Paul <em>v. </em>Carver, 2 Casey 222, as to boundaries by the thread of a highway, were applicable to such a case as this, it would extend the title of the lot owners only to the middle of the highway, and not across it. Their interest on the south side was not a title to the soil, but an easement in common with all others in the use of the street, a use necessarily bounded by the water line, for the land highway could extend ho further. At that line the water highway began, and the public right in it was such only as could be claimed by 'all citizens, in the use of the stream for navigation and other purposes. The verdict of the jury having established the natural low-water line of the island on its north side, necessarily established as a fact the existence of a channel between the north side low-water line of the island and the main land opposite to it, upon which Bank lane was laid out. On no principle of law or of legal inference could the title of the lot owners bounded by the north side of Bank lane cross this water channel. It is obvious, therefore, they had no title to oppose to the recovery of the plaintiffs below as bounded by the verdict. It is conceded upon the facts of the case, that it is not one of accretion to the land highway (Bank lane), either by alluvion or by reliction. Bank lane was widened by deposits made by the owners of lots or others, and has been extended still further by the act of the city, and a new name given to it of South avenue, and its width laid out at sixty feet. But these are not to be likened to an accretion by gradual deposits of sand or alluvium, or to an enlargement by a dereliction of the waters .of the stream.

They apply to <em>all </em>the lands within the high-water lines, and the rivers along the three rivers within the prescribed limits, viz.: from a line crossing the Allegheny river at the northeast line of the borough of Sharpsburgh; from a line crossing the Monongahela river, opposite the mouth of Four Mile run; and from a line crossing the Ohio opposite to the mouth of Wood’s run, and around the shores of all the islands in the rivers aforesaid, and within the limits aforesaid. To assume an intention to grant the land itself between the high-water lines and the rivers within these limits would violate the vested rights of all the owners of the lands bounded by these rivers, within the prescribed limits. Such.clearly was not the intent of the legislature, and we cannot assume one intent for this locality at the island and a different intent for all other places. But the legislature carefully guarded its own meaning by vesting in the several corporations only the <em>riparian </em>rights of the state, viz.: such as pertain to the banks of the rivers. They were limited also to the space between the high-water lines and the <em>rivers. </em>Hence they did not include the channels, beds or bars of the streams. By no possibility, therefore, can the Act of 1858 be construed to be a grant to the city of Allegheny of the bed of the channel between the former island a,nd Bank lane or South avenue, or of the sand or gravel banks left by the washing away of the island. Bank lane, or South avenue, not being increased by natural alluvium, or by the falling away of the waters, its increased width divested the state of no right of soil.</p>

It was not the purpose of the commissioners to transfer titles, but to mark the boundaries of <em>riparian </em>rights, so as to make them certain and permanent in their extent. So it was not the intention of the framers of the Act of 1858 to pass titles to lands, or to ascertain boundaries between individuals; but it was their purpose to regulate the right of navigation along the shores of these rivers by establishing high- and low-water lines, which <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>would definitely ascertain and fix the extent to which the right could be exercised; and the extent to which the owners of the land could exercise their own rights under the law of the state. The purpose of the act is so clearly seen upon its face, and is so conclusively shown in the cases of Wainwright <em>v. </em>McCullough, 13 P. F. Smith 66; Zug <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 20 <a href="/us/69/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Wall. 97" data-case-ids="8299922" data-case-paths="/us/69/0097-01">Id. 138</a>; Poor <em>et al. v. </em>McClure, 27 <a href="/us/69/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Wall. 97" data-case-ids="8299922" data-case-paths="/us/69/0097-01">Id. 214</a>, and in the opinion of Judge White in this case, it cannot admit of further discussion. The extension of the low-water line of the northern shore of the river over a part of the former site of the island, did not pass the title of the state to the intermediate channel, or to the bars and sand or gravel banks within the lines, or to the soil of Bank lane, to any one else, and certainly not to the owners of the lots bounded by the northern line of Bank lane. The state herself being the owner of the land or soil before the establishment of the low-water line of the commissioners, to her alone could any benefit accrue. If it could be conceded for a moment that the act operated on the title at all, she was the owner certainly of the southern half of Bank lane, conceding, for the sake of argument, the doctrines of Paul <em>v. </em>Carver to apply to this case. Being the owner of the soil beneath the southern half of the highway (certainly to this extent), and of the intermediate channel and beds and bars of the river, clearly the same title remained to her after the fixing of the commissioners’ line, and she could grant it away by special act to others, subject only to the public easement in the highway, and to the right of navigation upon the river. There was no question of public easement or right of navigation involved in the trial below, so that the title of the state being vested in the plaintiffs by the special Act of 1873, they were entitled to recover the land included in the verdict, leaving the question of public easement, if any exists, to be determined when it shall arise.</p>
