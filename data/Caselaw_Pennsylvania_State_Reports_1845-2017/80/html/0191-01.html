Defendants had to bear their own expenses, and even pay costs, whether found guilty or not guilty. It frequently happened that defendants were detained, on account of fees alleged to be due to the jailor after their acquittal. The prosecutor was not liable to pay costs in any case, for the prosecution was in the name of the Crown. When the case was ended, an innocent defendant could seek redress by action for malicious prosecution. This is the law brought to the colony of Pennsylvania, and is in force to this day where it has not been supplied by legislation. A jury cannot make <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>the county or a prosecutor pay costs except by virtue of a statute. A defendant must pay costs and the jailor’s charges, unless relieved by statute. This cruel rule of the common law as to defendants has been corrected both in England and in Pennsylvania in all cases of conviction or acquittal of a defendant. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[112,626,1164,1159]]]'>“ The question now is whether a defendant who has been convicted and sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution on one bill of indictment is liable to pay the costs which accrued on former bills of indictment for the same offence and which were quashed by the court. In my opinion, when a bill is quashed or judgment arrested, that puts an end to that prosecution, and, although a new bill may be sent up, founded upon the original information, it is a new and distinct prosecution. * * * That defendants were liable at common law, whether convicted or acquitted, seems to be settled, and for such eases the statutes of 1797, 1804 and 1860 make ample provision. But in cases where the bill is quashed or the judgment arrested, and thus an end put to the prosecution, no provision is made by statute in Pennsylvania, nor have we been referred to any authorities to show that the defendant was liable for costs in such cases at common law. I think the common law made no provision for costs in such eases, and that if the defendant succeeded in arresting the judgment, or quashing the bill, he got clear of the costs: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Tilghman, 4 S. &amp; R. 127. * * * Even in the case of acquittal, if the petit jury does not find that the defendant is to pay the costs, it may well be doubted whether he is obliged to pay them, although they are not put upon either the county or the prosecutor. The Acts of Assembly have worked a radical change in the law. It does not make any difference that the bill of indictment found at November Sessions 1873 was quashed at the instance of the defendant. It is enough to say that it was quashed, and it is presumed to have been done for legal reasons.</p>
