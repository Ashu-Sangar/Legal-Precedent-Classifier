The presumption would rather be that he placed his name to them as surety in the expectation that Mrs. Summers would meet them at maturity. Her signing with him negatived the idea of his intention to advance to her the amount of the notes. Mrs. Summers failed to meet the notes, and we have already seen the estate of the decedent must discharge them.</p>

This placed her under a disqualification to contract. Her notes were not voidable, but absolutely <em>void. </em>They gave the holder no right of a claim against her, although the testator as her security was bound. If the latter had paid the notes in his lifetime, his equity to proceed <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>against her would not have been superior to that of the holders or payees of the notes. We have seen that the holders of this paper had no right of action against her, and it follows from this that her surety could have none even if he paid the money. * * * These notes then, so far as Mrs. Summers was concerned, were simply void, and this is true even if the notes had been given for the purchase-money of real estate. In that event the property conveyed might have been liable for the payment of the debt, but neither the creditor nor the surety could have gone beyond it and imposed a personal liability upon Mrs. Summers. The learned counsel admit this, but contend- that whilst this obligation is void at law it is good in equity, and that’ the Orphans’ Court being a court of equity, and the exceptors claiming as distributees in it, must do equity before they can participate in the distribution. It does seem contrary to equity and every principle of justice that these grandchildren should be permitted to take a full share of the estate without accounting for the money the estate was obliged to pay on the obligations given by their mother. The vice in the argument lies here. The contract of Mrs, Summers to pay these notes was void ; the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist between her and tbe holders of these notes, and therefore could not arise between herself and the surety upon his paying the notes for her. No equity can spring out of a void contract. The law consists of general rules for the government of all alike, and we are not at liberty to set them aside because they work injustice in particular cases or because the relation of parent and child exists between the parties.</p>

The payment of this money then did not create the relationship of debtor and creditor between Mrs. Summers and her father, the testator. Without this there could be no defalcation against her, and as a sequence, not against her children. ‘A debt is but a set-off in equity against the share of the distributee.’ It must, therefore, be one which is subsisting and recoverable at the time of the father’s death in order to constitute an available defalcation to a distributive share: Hughes’s Appeal, 7 P. F. Smith 181. We hold, then, that the relation of debtor and creditor did not exist between the testator and Mrs. Summers, and that her children ought not to be charged with the amount óf these notes, but that the same must first be deducted from the general fund, and the balance distributed among the heirs.” * * *</p>
