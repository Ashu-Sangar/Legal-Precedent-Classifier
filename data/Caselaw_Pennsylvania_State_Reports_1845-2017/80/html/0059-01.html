The plaintiff owned a mill and dam on his own land on a stream ; the defendants, on their own land, higher up the stream, erected a “ splash dam ;” by letting out the water in large quantities logs were carried down and injured the plaintiff’s dam ; and the retaining of the water in defendants’ dam for considerable times, and the flooding of plaintiff’s wheels when let out, interfered with working his mill. <em>Held, </em>as the improvements were not on plaintiff’s land the act did not apply, and the plaintiff’s remedy was by a common-law action.</p>

The mill property is the mill itself; that is, the buildings and machinery, the ground appertenant thereto, and necessary to its use and enjoyment as a mill, the mill-dam, the head-race, and the tail-race, these including what is known as a mill property. The mill property, therefore, lies partly in Clearfield county and partly in Cambria county. In any fair view of the evidence in this case, and under the Act of Assembly making provision for such case, the plaintiff, we hold, has properly instituted this suit in Cambria county, and so far as the evidence in this case is concerned, his suit is shown to have been instituted in this county, where the realty alleged to have been damaged is partly situated. If there was any dispute as to the location of the property in the evidence, that would be a question for your determination, but the defendants themselves, by one of their witnesses, prove that the line cuts the mill-dam a few feet above the breast, leaving the larger portion in Cambria county ; therefore the mill property is partly in both counties. * * *</p>

To develop the resources of a neighborhood, make that valuable which before was valueless, by constructing improvements and furnishing facilities for reaching market, is at all times commendable. The plaintiff could have no reason to complain of the defendants for merely doing this much, and they, under the right from Mellons, had a right so to do. The plaintiff, Somerville, had also the right to use the water of the creek in prosecuting his business. Both owned or had possession of land adjoining the stream.</p>

If by retaining the water in the splash dam, the water of the stream was sensibly diminished, so as to cut off the supply necessary to run the plaintiff's mill; or if, after collecting water, in the dam, it was discharged in such unusually large volume or quantity as to be destructive to his property, or to dam up by back-water his tail-race, and thus stop his mill, this would be an unreasonable or unlawful use of the water, for which the defendants would be answer<a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>able in damages to the plaintiff, because it would deprive him of a reasonable use of it, and he being the lower landowner has a right also to the reasonable use of the water, without being deprived of that use by the act of the upper landowner.

He would have the right to the reasonable use of a reasonable quantity for his purpose — running a gristmill ; and he would have a right to that reasonable quantity, notwithstanding all of it, or a large portion of it, was necessary to and was taken by the upper landowner. If the quantity used by the plaintiff below at his grist-mill was a resonable quantity, did the defendants, by the construction of the splash dam and the use to which it was put, seriously interfere with the use made of the water by Somerville at his mill, or did they deprive him of-that to which he had the right to claim by reason of his ownership of the land on the bank of that stream; or at other times did they turn the water on his property in such large quantities as to back it up in his tail-race and stop his mill and destroy his dam ? * * *</p>

Dig. 1268), as that opinion, as we view the matter, in nowise affects the case. The damage complained of by the plaintiff below arose from the unlawful use by the defendants of their dam, which, it was conceded, was erected for a lawful purpose. None of the plaintiff’s land was taken or used by the defendants. Their improvements were upon territory to which the plaintiff had no claim; nor is it alleged that they assumed a permanent control of that part of Chest creek flowing over his land. Had they so done, a very different question would have been raised. The complaint of the plaintiff was that the defendants so used their dam as sometimes to cut off the water from his mill, at other times to flood out his wheels, and that, upon one occasion, they precipitated so great a mass of water and logs upon his improvements as seriously to injure them by sweeping away a large part of his dam. If this were so, and the jury have so found, they were acting extra the Act of Assembly, and could not justify themselves under its provisions.</p>

They could thereby neither unreasonably diminish the power of the plaintiff by retaining the water, nor flood his land by casting an unusual quantity of water upon it. The statute neither did nor could confer such powers, as those claimed by the defendants, upon private persons. Only corporations organized for public purposes can be clothed with such privileges; to such and such only may the legislature grant the Commonwealth’s right of eminent domain.</p>
