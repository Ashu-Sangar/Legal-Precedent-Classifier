The $2500 was to be paid in any event, irrespective of the profit or loss of the concern. Why the agreement was made by William Raiguel alone and not by the firm, did <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>not appear, nor is it material.

Wentworth was to be that much less than $2500; as would have been naturally inserted had such been the intention of the parties. If he was a partner, the most natural and simple course would have been for him to unite in the <em>articles; he </em>might have been a salaried partner, or had a proportion of the profits, or been compensated by a combination of the two modes.

In fact, prior to March 7th 1855, two months after the <em>new </em>co-partnership’ was formed, it would seem as if he had continued under the old arrangement tacitly ; the only apparent change in the members of the firm of Raiguel &amp; Co., No. 1, which had been formed January 1st 1853, being the withdrawal of George Eckert as a partner upon the termination of the period limited by the articles; and it appears from the books, that Mr. Eckert even remained in the employ of the new firm. But on the 7th March 1855, a new agreement was made between J. L. Wentworth, William Raiguel and Eben Wentworth. This agreement was reduced to writing, executed and signed by the parties thereto, May 3d 1856, nearly fourteen months after it was made, and when there had been ample time for reflection and consideration of all the details ; when all doubts or questions, if any ever existed, as to the status or relations of John L.

Wentworth should be, in fact, a partner of Nos. 1 and 2, by reason of the agreements entered into between him and William Raiguel, the latter, it must be supposed, would have taken care to guard the rights and interests of his firm. But the very first article of the new agreement as reduced to writing in May 1856, more than three years after the agreement of December 31st 1852, had been made, is as follows: ‘ The said J. L.

L. Wentworth for his said services $2500 for <em>each </em>of said years. The third article is more clear than the corresponding provision of the agreement of December 31st 1852. By this article, William Raiguel promises and agrees to and with Eben Wentworth, that if the $2500 shall not equal eight per cent, of the net profits of said firm during each of said years, ‘ he, the said William Raiguel, will pay to said Eben Wentworth such other sumas with the said sum of $2500, shall equal the said eight per cent, of said profits after the business is settled up and the losses and expenses having been deducted for said years, which sum the said Eben Wentworth hereby agrees to accept in part payment of the sum of $11,499.34, now due to him by the said J- L.

As the interest was not such a chattel, in the opinion of the District Court as to be within the meaning of the Sheriff’s Interpleader Act; so neither is it such a chattel as to be within the reason of the rule which forbids as against creditors, transfer of ownership without change of possession open, notorious and manifest.

The credits from time to time on the cash-book of No. 3, were given to No. 2, as a firm, and so much of the indebtedness of that firm, not the indebtedness of the individual partners therein, to No. 3, was thereby from time to time settled and discharged. It was treated and credited as cash and was in effect so much cash appropriated <em>in solido </em>by the partners in No. 3, who were partners in No. 2 from No. 3, to the cancellation or payment of so much of the indebtedness of No. 2, as a firm to No. 3. * * * With the distribution or crediting or appropriation of this amount amongst the partners of No. 2, after that firm had received it, Wentworth, who was not a partner in that firm,'could not interfere and had nothing to do.

The other two exceptions <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>were grounded upon the objection that the master had reported an account of the plaintiff with the firm of Raiguel &amp; Co., No. 3, of which firm alone he was found to be a member, had recommended a decree in his favor, against the other members of that firm, and had not made a final settlement of the partnership, by ascertaining the balances due by and to each partner separately. I saw then nothing on the face of the report which ought to vary the rules which seem to be well settled in regard to partnership accounts generally. It was accordingly referred back to the master to reconsider and report as to these matters.</p>

Wentworth’s interest in No. 3.” He has also found, that this indebtedness of the firm of Raiguel &amp; Co., No. 3, to John L. Went-worth, arose entirely from misappropriation by the other members of the firm, who were members of the firm No. 2, of the assets of No. 3, to the payment of the debts of No. 2. He hence draws the conclusion, that the members of No. 2, who are members of No. 3, are liable to the plaintiff <em>in solido. </em>It would follow that justice could be done in no other way, than by a decree against the defendants <em>in solido, </em>and until one or more of these defendants pay this amount, thei’e can be no decree as between themselves, settling their respective contributory shares. That must be left to a subsequent proceeding.</p>

They very much affect the view to be taken of the case. To simplify the matter; if the assets of a firm of A., B. &amp; C., are applied to pay the debts of a former firm of A. <em>&amp; </em>B., without the consent of C., it would seem that, as A. &amp; B. would be liable to answer <em>in solido </em>to the firm of A., B. &amp; C., A. &amp; B. must in equity be held <em>in solido </em>to O. for his share of such debts. Prior to the Act of April 14th 1838, Pamph. L. 457, the firm of A., B. &amp; O. could not have maintained an action at law against the firm of A. &amp; B. The appropriate remedy of C. would have been a bill to account. If, as the master reports, all other accounts between the members of the firm of A., B. &amp; O. have been settled, except what grows out of this misappropriation of the assets of A., B. &amp; C. to the injury of 0., I see no objection to such a decree as will do justice between the parties. I observe that the bill distinctly avers the fact of the misappropriation. It follows, that until either A. or B. pay this debt for which they are jointly and severally liable, what they respectively owe each other, cannot be ascertained and settled. The Act of 1838, which gave the remedy at law, did not take away the previously existing remedy in equity.</p>

    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.9",257,[142,505,1175,1647]]]'>The fourth clause of the decree at Nisi Prius was in these words: “ That the defendants, William Raiguel, Samuel Moore, William G. Skillman, James M. Whitby, Benjamin Bentley, Edward A. Adams and Henry P. Atkinson, do pay to the said plaintiffs, Catharine H. Wentworth and George J. Wentworth, executors of Eben Wentworth, deceased, from time to time as collected, 9-^ per cent, of the proceeds of the assets of the firm of Raiguel &amp; Co., No. 8, mentioned in the bill, which remained uncollected on the 30th of November 1871, and that the said defendants, Edward A. Adams and Henry P. Atkinson, pay their own costs.” It is objected by the appellants that Adams and Atkinson were erroneously included in this clause of the decree. As they had not been partners in the firms of Raiguel &amp; Co., Nos. 1 and 2, they were not held accountable for any part of the sum of $23,747.31, which the master found to be due and payable to the plaintiffs. That sum was charged upon those of the defendants w'ho had composed those firms. John L. Wentworth, like Adams and Atkinson, was a partner in firm No. 3, and his profits had been absorbed in providing for debtor balances due from firms Nos. 1 and 2. These balances were found by the master not to have been caused by a “ deficiency of assets for the payment of the debts of either of those firms, but that any deficiency of funds for the payment of the indebtedness of No. 1 to No. 2, and of No. 2 to No. 3, arose from over-drafts of the partners in the respective firms.” For that liability Adams and Atkinson were held not to be responsible. But as to the uncollected assets their position is different. The master has reported the indebtedness of No. 1 to No. 2, and of No. 2 to No. 3, to have been settled and discharged on the 30th day of September 1865. The claim of the plaintiffs on the uncollected assets is simply for the partner’s share of John L. Went-worth in earned but undivided profits. As all the partners other-than Wentworth are to participate in the division, all of them are liable for his proportion of all the partnership funds. It is said that, like Wentworth, they were creditor partners in No. 3. Even if the fact were so, that would raise a question between them and the members of firms Nos. 1 and 2; but the credits on the hooks off the firms on the 30th of September 1865, would indicate that their indebtedness-to No. 3 was fully paid.</p>

So far as it decides the liability of the defendants, it is unobjectionable. But it peremptorily directs the payment to the plaintiffs of a percentage on unascertained' sums to be recovered out of assets wholly undescribed. At the utmost the declaration of the liability of the defendants would only be the foundation of a future proceeding. If the attention of the <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>judge had been drawn to it at Nisi Prius, the decree would have been modified there.
