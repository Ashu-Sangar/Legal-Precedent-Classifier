When I got there Frederick’s desire was that Squire should write his will. Squire asked Frederick how he <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>wanted his will written. Frederick said he wanted to leave one-fourth part of his estate to The American Tract Society, one-fourth part to Missionary Society of the Evangelical Association, one-fourth part to The Orphans’ Institute of the Evangelical Association at Flat Rock, Ohio, and the other fourth <em>part1 </em>where it would do the most good.’ Squire Super told him in case he should not live thirty days it would be all of no avail. He lay then sick and wished to have something done, and a proposal was made: it was said to him that he could dispose of his property to a particular person, unconditionally, and if that man would do it, then he could put it to these places where he wanted it; but that would be entirely at his option; he could do it or not. It was explained to Frederick ; I explained to him ; Squire Super explained it to him, and Dr. Schultz explained it to him I think. In the first place he could not understand it right; afterwards I think there was nothing about it he did not understand; and after he understood it he wished it to be made so; and the next was to find a man to whom it should be bequeathed. I proposed Reuben Yeakle, so far as I remember, as the man. Frederick then agreed to Reuben Yeakle. Reuben Yeakle was considered to be an honest man, and it was for this reason he was taken, and because he was acquainted with these societies mentioned.”</p>

I do not think if there had been no fear that Frederick would die inside of thirty days after signing his will that Reuben Yeakle would have been picked out as his legatee. * * * Frederick said in his well days how he wanted his property disposed of; and as I understand the law, it was only intended to apply to invalids, who were weak in understanding and overpersuaded. Frederick, before he was sick, had told me how he wanted his property disposed'of, and it was the same as he told Squire Super on his death bed. The object was to carry out the wish of Frederick in that way. There was a chance to carry it out in that way if the legatee was willing. Reuben Yeakle was selected because it was thought he would agree to it. If it had been thought by Frederick Schultz that Reuben Yeakle would not carry out that wish, I guess he would not have been named as legatee.

I went over with him to Frederick’s house. Frederick Schultz, when I went to his house, was sick in bed. Edward Schultz and Jonas Schultz were there. I think the sister passed through the room once or twice while we were there. I went to the bed. Frederick I think extended his hand to me. I then mentioned I had come to write his will. He then said Edward could tell me what he wanted written. I replied, that would not do; it was his will I was to write and that I must have my directions from him. He then said he wished to give one-fourth to the Missionary Society. I don’t know whether he said the Missionary Society of my church or whether he said of 4 The Evangelical Association;’ as I knew him to be a member of the latter association, I understood him to mean that association. That is a religious society. One-fourth to 4 The Orphans’ Home’ of the same society. One-fourth to 4 The American Tract Society.’ That is also a religious society. The other fourth he wished the executor to appropriate to some good object. I told him that would not do, if he should die within thirty days from the time of making his will. I think Frederick asked why he could not do with his own what he pleased. I told him that he expected to die within thirty days and then the law would not permit such a bequest. I am sure Frederick asked this question while I was there. I told him he could leave it to any individual he pleased, but it must be unconditional. I then left the bed-side and left him and Edward Schultz talking together. I don’t know how the name of Reuben Yeakle was introduced, but it was introduced. It was not introduced by me. It was introduced in a conversation between Frederick and Edward Schultz; heard the name mentioned. I then again commenced conversing with Frederick and explained to him why he could not do as he pleased, on account of the Act of Assembly prohibiting such gifts in case death took place within thirty days, and then remarked that if he chose to give this property to Reuben Yeakle without conditions, I supposed he had a right to do so. I had cautioned him before, he <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>could make no conditions in explanation.

I can speak my own object; I was not acquainted at that time with Reuben Yeakle, but as his name was mentioned in the course of the conversation, I supposed he was a person in whom Frederick had confidence. And as Frederick had remarked to me, he wished his money placed where it would do the most good, I supposed Reuben Yeakle would make as good use of it as anybody else. I knew Reuben Yeakle personally, but did not know his relation to the church. I supposed from the fact of Frederick naming him that he was a person who might use it for the purpose of those societies, or might not; it was mere supposition ; there was nothing said.” * * * Also, Reuben Yeakle, who testified: “ I live in Cleveland, Ohio. * * * I am bishop of the Evangelical Association. The territory of the entire church, wherever it is, is in my jurisdiction. I knew Frederick Schultz in his lifetime. I understand he was a member of the church over which I preside as bishop. I saw him at a camp-meeting I think in 1872, near Pennshurg, in Montgomery county, which was the last time I saw him previous to his death. I did not have any conversation with him then; simply greetings as we met each other. I did never converse with him as to the disposition he should make of his worldly affairs at his death. He and I were not intimate friends ; we had a slight acquaintance from meeting each other only a few times. I am somewhat related to him, which I cannot explain — a distant relationship. I have seen him in my lifetime I may say three or four times. I have lived in Cleveland, Ohio, fifteen years. I was first apprised of Frederick Schultz’s will pretty soon after his death; can’t say how many days or weeks. I think Philip Super first wrote to me informing me of his death and about the will. * * * The substance of the letter was, that Mr. Schultz had made such a will as he did make. I don’t think he gave me the phraseology of the will, but informed me that he made me the legatee under the will. I don’t think he informed me of Frederick Schultz’s wish as to the disposition I should make of it. * * * I got another letter soon after-wards from Edward Schultz. * * * That letter contained the same information as Super’s. I think it was more definite with regard to Schultz’s wish. As near as I remember, it was that Frederick Schultz desired to apply his estate to benevolent or rather religious purposes. He mentioned the American Tract Society, the Missionary Society of the Evangelical Association, the Orphans’ Institute of the Evangelical Association at Flat Rock, Ohio. I think that is all that was specified. He said this was <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>Frederick’s wish as expressed to him some time before his death. I think I replied to that letter. I think I requested another letter from Edward Schultz. I think I got a reply to it. Edward Schultz wrote to me pretty soon after Frederick’s decease and I think I replied promptly. The letter which I wrote to Edward contained allusions to the will of Frederick Schultz, as I had an interest in it after the information I had received. I could not tell definitely what I asked in that letter, hut I wanted fuller explanations ; that I remember. I received a reply to this letter. The second letter from Edward Schultz contained about the same matters as the first letter, excepting I think this was in addition that one-fourth of his estate should be paid to the American Tract Society, one-fouth to the Missionary Society of the Evangelical Association, one-fourth to the Orphans’ Institution of the Evangelical Association of Flat Rock, Ohio; the other one-fourth was left undecided, but to be applied to religious purposes. I think I wrote a reply to this second letter of Edward Schultz’s. * * * All the societies named excepting the American Tract Society belong to the religious organization of which I am bishop. These societies have their own organization, officers and board of managers. I have no special official connection with them only as they belong to the. church over which I, as bishop, have general supervision.” * * *</p>

I, as bishop, have no control over the church property. I, as bishop, have no control over the property of these associations which have been named. The title is in no respect in me of any of the property belonging to the societies. * * * I have not seen the will, but if it gives me the absolute right to the property, without condition, I should consider that I had the legal right to do with the property as I pleased.

Edward Schultz was only the friend and relative of the testator, and assisted him in disposing of his property, so that he might have a chance of gratifying his wishes in giving his property for charitable purposes. Edward Schultz and the testator were both perfectly aware that the property could not be bequeathed by the will in trust for a charity, and they also well knew that if it was to be given to any one it must be given to him absolutely unfettered by any trust or condition, and that if the legatee should afterwards appropriate it to charitable purposes it would be only by his own voluntary act; and that the legatee could not be compelled to do so by any legal or equitable power of the court. With this knowledge the testator made the bequest and it does not matter who suggested the name of Yeakle; the bequest was made to him by the testator with a perfect knowledge that Yeakle could, if he saw fit, appropriate the property to his own use, but with the hope that he would use it for charitable purposes. * * *</p>

They undoubtedly throw a clear and strong light upon the question presented upon this record. They establish two positions: 1. That if an absolute estate is devised, but upon a secret trust assented to by the devisee, either expressly or impliedly, by knowledge and silence before the death of the testator, a court of equity will fasten a trust on him on the ground of fraud, and consequently the Statute of Mortmain will avoid the devise if the trust is in favor of a charity. But 2. If the devisee have no part in the devise, and no .knowledge of it until after the death of the testator, there is no ground upon which equity can fasten such a trust on him, even though, after it comes to his knowledge, he should express an intention of conforming to the wishes of the testator. .The latter proposition applies directly to the case now before us. Reuben Yeakle, the legatee named in the will, was not present when the instrument was executed. He had no communication with the testator, directly or indirectly, upon the subject. The testator had long intended to leave his estate for charitable purposes. On his death-bed he sent for a scrivener, and expressed to him his wish to have his property so disposed of after his death. He was informed that if he should die within thirty days, such a disposition would be ineffectual, but that he might make an absolute bequest to some individual, upon the confidence and belief that when he should be informed of his wishes, he would, of his own accord, carry them out. This plan was.adopted, and upon the suggéstion of one of the bystanders, Reuben Yeakle, the bishop of the church to which the decedent belonged, was chosen by him. It is clear, not only from the evidence, but from the verdipt of the jury in the issue of <em>devisavit vel non, </em>that no undue influence was exercised to procure the will. It was the testator’s own free and voluntary act, and he was told “that he could dispose of his property to a particular person unconditionally, and if that man would do it, then he could put it to those places where he wanted it; but that would be <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>entirely at his option; he could do it or not.” Eeuben Yeakle was not informed of the will until some time after the death of the testator. When informed of it he declared his intention to appropriate the money as the testator wished it to be. He said, when examined as a witness before the auditor: “I have not seen the will, but if it gives me the absolute right to the property without condition, I should consider that I had the legal right to do with thle property as I pleased. I draw a distinction in this case between the legal and moral right.”</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.6",406,[302,817,1163,551]]]'>We are unshackled by authority upon this question. The English precedents upon the construction of their Statute of Mortmain are not binding upon this court, and with us the question is an entirely new one. By <em>the 11th </em>section of the Act of Assembly of April 26th 1855, Pamph. L. 832, it is provided, <em>“ </em>that no estate, real or personal, shall hereafter be bequeathed, devised or conveyed to any body politic, or to any person, in trust for religious or charitable uses, except the same be done by deed or will, attested by two credible and at the time disinterested witnesses, at least one calendar month before the death of the testator or alienor, and all dispositions of property contrary hereto shall be void, and go to the residuary legatee or devisee next of kin or heirs according to law.”</p>
    <p id="b406-7" data-blocks='[["BL_406.7",406,[303,1376,1164,775]]]'>It seems very clear that the bequest in the will of Frederick Schultz to Eeuben Yeakle is not within the words of the statute. There is nothing in the circumstances to fasten a trust upon him. The statute out of the way, the charities intended to be benefited would have had no claim, legal or equitable, to enforce payment by him to them. He would, in the eye of the law, be guilty of no fraud, legal or equitable, either against them or the testator, if he should, even at this day, change his intentions and apply the money to some other use. Being the absolute owner, under the will, the declaration of his intention would not be binding upon him. It is not, therefore, in the words of the statute, a bequest “ to a body politic or to any person in trust for religious or charitable uses.” Had Eeuben Yeakle been present when the will was executed, or the objects of the bequest been communicated to him before the testator’s death, and he had held his peace, there would have been some ground for fastening a trust upon him <em>ex maleficio, </em>as in Hoge <em>v. </em>Hoge, <a href="/watts/1/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Watts 163" data-case-ids="1838024" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0163-01">1 Watts 163</a>.

They urge the maxim, <em>omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitwr et mandato csquiparatur. </em>It is a very ingenious contention, but unfortunately for the appellants, there is nothing in the evidence <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>upon whicb it can be built. Edward Schultz did not undertake for Reuben Yeakle; he gave the testator no assurance that he would accept and carry out his intentions when made known to him. He says : “ I proposed Reuben Yeakle, so far as I remember, for the man. Frederick then agreed to Reuben Yeakle. Reuben Yeakle was considered to be an honest man, and it was for this reason he was taken, and because he was acquainted with these societies mentioned.” “ As far as I can recollect, I said, that through Yeakle his desire could be carried out in the distribution of his property.” “ The object was to carry out the wish of Frederick in that way. There was a chance to carry it out in that way if the legatee was willing, and Reuben Yeakle was selected because it was thought he would agree to it.” There is nothing in all this which indicates any promise or assurance by Edward Schultz to the testator that Reuben Yeakle would accept the bequest in trust for the charities. There was the mere expression of an opinion, concurred in by the testator, that when the legatee came to understand the object and purpose of the bequest to him, as an honest man he would carry out the intention of the testator.</p>
    <p id="b407-6" data-blocks='[["BL_407.6",407,[134,1278,1163,432]]]'>It is urged, however, that this whole plan is nothing but a contrivance to evade the statute. No doubt such was the intention of the testator. It is said that it is a fraud upon the law, and that the bequest ought therefore to be declared void. But that overlooks the fact that the absolute property in the subject of this bequest has vested in the legatee, and that he is entirely innocent of any complicity in the fraud of the testator. If the statute is practically repealed by this construction it is evident that it must be for the legislature to devise and apply a remedy, not the judiciary, whose province is <em>not jus dare </em>but yiis <em>dieere.</em>
