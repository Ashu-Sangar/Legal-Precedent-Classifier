All that is alleged is that when asked as to the financial condition of Garfield, these officers replied that they considered said Garfield perfectly good financially and thát defendant would be safe in endorsing for him. How can such a declaration, not made in the course of their duties as officers or agents of the bank, even admitting it to have been wilfully false, affect their principal? It would be subversive of every well-settled principle which regulates the relation of principal and agent and the responsibility of the principal for the acts and declarations of his agent.</p>
