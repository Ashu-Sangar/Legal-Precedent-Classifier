      <em>“ </em>The question presented in this case is, so far as I am aware, <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>one of the first impression.It is, whether one co-executor can, without the knowledge and assent of the other, release a demand arising from a deposit made in the names of both, and agree to look solely to the fund in the hands of the assignee, to whom the debtor has transferred his property for the benefit of his creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[316,612,1161,1242]]]'>“ The inclination of the court, in the first instance, was in favor of the validity of the defence, but an attentive examination of the authorities has led to an opposite result. It is well settled, in general, that the acts of one co-executor bind the others, by reason of the confidence reposed in them individually, in consequence of which each has full power over the assets: Beltzhoover <em>v. </em>Darragh, 16 S. &amp; R. 327, 329. This is an exception to the rule that when a trust or authority is delegated for mere private purposes, the concurrence of all who, are intrusted with the power is requisite to its due execution: Sinclair <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Cowen 533, 583; and distinguishes executors from trustees, who are regarded by equity as forming one collective trustee, and must, therefore, execute the duties of the office in their joint capacity: Vandever’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 405" data-case-ids="483398" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0405-01">8 W. &amp; S. 405</a>, 409. Hence, a payment to one executor, or a release from him, extinguishes the debt, although he misapplies the money and no part of it comes to the use of the estate: Herbert <em>v. </em>Pigott, 2 C. &amp; M. 384. Eor a like reason one may, where the circumstances require it, take part and release the residue, or accept goods or securities in satisfaction: Smith <em>v. </em>Everett, 27 Beavan 446; Gilman <em>v. </em>Healy, <a href="/me/55/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="55 Me. 120" data-case-ids="4229227" data-case-paths="/me/55/0120-01">55 Maine 120</a>; and it will make no difference if the case be free from fraud, that the compromise is effected without the knowledge of the co-executor, or that it is against his wishes: Murray <em>v. </em>Blatchford, <a href="/wend/1/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Wend. 583" data-case-ids="2003381" data-case-paths="/wend/1/0583-01">1 Wend. 583</a>; Herbert <em>v. </em>Pigott, 2 C. &amp; M. 384. It results from this principle that one of several co-executors is not answerable for the acts or defaults of his companions, unless he was negligent or had notice of some fact or circumstance rendering it a duty to interfere: Townly <em>v. </em>Sherborne, 1 Bridgman 39.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b482-8" data-blocks='[["BL_482.7",482,[317,1852,1159,602]],["BL_483.1",483,[117,400,1166,477]]]'>“It is at the same time equally well established that executors may join in the administration of the assets; and such is often the better course as affording an additional guaranty to the creditors and legatees. Under these circumstances each is responsible for the safe-keeping of the fund, and cannot allege the neglect or misconduct of another, as an excuse for a loss which would not have occurred if he had been diligent: Mendes <em>v. </em>Guedalla, 2 J. &amp; H. 259. Ordinarily, an executor is not liable for nonfeasance; hut if he enters on the execution of any part of the trust he cannot stop short, and must do all that is requisite to conduct the business to a successful termination. An executor who unites in the collection of a debt cannot get rid of his responsibility by leaving the proceeds in the custody of his associate, and should, on the contrary, take such measures as will prevent the fund from being <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>used without his knowledge. The place of safe-keeping must consequently be one where both can exercise a control or supervision. The authorities accordingly agree that money which has been received by a co-executor should be deposited to the joint account; and if this precaution is not observed,, and a loss ensues through the fraud of him who is intrusted with the fund, a chancellor will visit the consequences on both. See Clough <em>v. </em>Bond, 3 Mylne &amp; Craig 490; Langford <em>v. </em>Gascoyne, 11 Vesey 333. Under these circumstances they are still executors, but executors charged with a fiduciary obligation, which renders them virtually trustees as it regards the assets which they have received and hold in common.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b483-6" data-blocks='[["BL_483.6",483,[108,876,1175,1251]]]'>“ The existence of such an obligation implies the power to fulfil it. <em>Lex neminem eogit ad vana sen impossibilia. </em>It were futile to open a joint account, if one of the depositors could withdraw the money. All must, therefore, unite in the receipt or check, in order to discharge the banker; and it follows that he cannot rely on a compromise or release by one as a defence; This is not so much an exception to the rule, that a payment to a co-executor discharges the debt, as a return to the general rule, to which that is an exception. The right of each executor to act without the concurrence of the rest seems to have been the growth of circumstances. A testator might have assets in different counties, and lying as far apart as Canterbury and York. It might be difficult or impracticable to find any one who was able and willing to assume the whole responsibility, and he might appoint a representative in either province, in the expectation that each would collect what lay nearest to his own door. So one executor may be chosen for his knowledge of accounts, and another for his skill and sagacity in the adjustment of outstanding and disputed claims. Under these circumstances, it would be useless and injurious to require that all should join in acts that can be better performed by one. The privilege is not confined to executors, but extends ■ measurably to trustees, who, as Lord Keeper Coventry observed, in Townly <em>v. </em>Sherborne, may permit one of their number to receive all or the most part of the profits without a breach of trust, ‘ it falling out many times that some of the trustees live far from the lands, and are put in the trust out of other respects than to be troubled with the receipt of the profits.’ In this case, as in that of executors, the right to receive necessarily implies the power to give an acquittance.</p>

It does not, therefore, exist, where a fund arising from the collection or sale of the assets comes to the hands of two or more executors or administrators, or has been deposited to their joint account. <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>Under these circumstances, there is nothing to exclude the principle that persons acting in á fiduciary capacity must concur in every measure affecting the interests which they represent.
