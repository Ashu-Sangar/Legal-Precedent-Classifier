On the 28th of September 1871 the executors filed an account, which was referred to Samuel C. Perkins, Esq., to audit, &amp;c., and report distribution. On the 25th of November 1871, Charles H. Hart, Esq., was appointed by the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia guardian of the minor children of Joseph W. Phillips, as above mentioned. One of the executors residing out of this state and not having given security, was incompent to act; another, Henrietta C. Phipps, who was also legatee of one-eleventh, died after the appointment of the auditor, leaving John S. Phillips the only executor and trustee under the will. Horace Phillips, another of the children and legatees, died August 4th 1872 intestate, without issue. The auditor corrected and restated the account, and thereby ascertained that the sum of $2224.57 of the “net income” was the proportion for the two minor grandchildren of the testator. The auditor then reported:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[288,1142,1177,1209]]]'>'“ * * * The one-eleventh share of net income distributed as above under the bequest for the benefit of the two grandchildren, Joseph W. and William R. Phillips, also requires special notice. The auditor is of opinion that the testamentary trustees are in fact guardians of the estate of these two minors, with all the duties and responsibilities of guardians; and Mr. Hart did not claim as guardian to receive any portion of the estate, principal or income, bequeathed for the benefit of the minors. His appointment as such guardian was a proper measure of precaution in order to meet any question as to the minors being properly represented before the auditor; and in this capacity, as well as attorney for the guardian of the domicil, he occupies a position to contend fully for their rights in every respect. This court have power to control and direct the application of the income for the benefit of the minors as may be deemed advisable, by way of allowances for maintenance and education, and investment of the surplus, if any, or to direct the whole to be paid to the foreign guardian. Nor is this power different, or any the less, during the minority of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, even in cases where the trust may be held as continuing beyond their minority. It is for the mother of the minors therefore, as the guardian of the domicil, to make such application to this court as she may deem necessary and be advised, for the -payment of the income to her, either in whole or in part, for their use and benefit. In accordance with the above views, until some order of this court be made, upon proper application as above suggested, Mr. Phillips, as testamentary trustee and as such guardian of the estate of the minors, is to hold the income belonging to Joseph W. and William R. Phillips for their use and benefit. * * * ”</p>

But Mr. Hart contended that, by the terms of the will, the legal estate in the share of the residuary bequest intended for the benefit of his wards, vested at once, and that therefore they were entitled to an award directly to themselves, ignoring the trust created or attempted to be created by the will. He further urged that by the death of Mrs. Phipps and Horace Phillips, the trust had become executed as to them, and the parties in remainder were entitled to a division of the estate, including the ground-rents, but excluding the rest of the unsold realty, at once. * * *</p>

No devise or bequest was made to the executors of his estate, but merely the naked powers given them “ to sell,” “ to divide,” “ to invest,” and then “ to hold for the uso and benefit,” which by the Act of Assembly are enlarged for the purposes of sale only: Act of February 24th 1834, sec. 13; Pamph. L. 75, 1 Br. Purd. 418, pl. 71.

If a testator wishes to give a life estate only to the first takers, with remainder to their heirs or to the heirs of their body, he must devise the legal estate to trustees'by certain and express words, and attach to the trust some active duty to be performed, to prevent the merging of the legal and equitable estate. The trust for Joseph W. and William R. Phillips, is a mere simple or dry trust. The only duty enjoined upon the trustee is to hold the share in trust for the use and benefit of Joseph W. and William R. Phillips, so that the same shall not be liable for any of their debts or engagements. There is no power to invest and reinvest for them, none to collect and pay over the income to them or suffer them to receive it. They are treated as being possessed of all powers as owners in fee. The legal title lasts in trustees only so long as they have a trust to perform: Hill on Trustees 239; Hawkins on Wills 143; Ralston <em>v. </em>Waln, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20279" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Wright 279">8 Wright 279</a>.
