Was the expression ‘ without extension,’ contained in judgment note given by Tunis to Weightman, under which the premises were sold to Spotts, and under which he derived his title, a waiver of inquisition ? We think it was; as the word ‘ <em>extension </em>’ is the usual expression employed to show that on an inquisition the rents and profits will, within seven years, pay the liens, and the words ‘extent’ and ‘extension,’ or ‘extended’ occur in the 51st, 58th, 59th, and perhaps other sections of Act of June 1836, relating to executions (1 Bright Purd. 648, pl. 65-67), thus leaving no doubt as to the sense in which the expression is used. Then we accept the law as now settled by Hageman <em>v. </em>Salisbury, 24 P. F. Smith 280, that a waiver of inquisition in a judgment note or bond, is a part of the judgment, it being supposed that Hope <em>v. </em>Everhart, 20 P. F. Smith 231, and Buehler <em>v. </em>Rogers, 18 Id. 9, had determined the reverse, which they did not; the first simply deciding that the entry of judgment was the act of the prothonotary, and bound defendant whether of sound mind or not, and the waiver of inquisition was the act of defendant and not binding if of unsound mind; and the second case merely holding that levy and inquisition are not acts of record, but done by the sheriff <em>-in pais, </em>

Inasmuch as Tunis had parted with his title to Jacob Dundore, on the 1st of April 1865, after the entry of the judgment, but before the sheriff’s sale, could the sale be made on the judgment against Tunis, without inquisition and notice thereof to Dunmore, the then owner of the fee? It is settled in Wolf <em>v. </em>Payne, 11 Casey 97, that a waiver of inquisition by a defendant, who has previously parted with his interest in the premises levied on, subject to the lien of the judgment, will not authorize a sale without inquisition; but in this case it must be observed that there was no waiver in the judgment; it was, on the contrary, an amicable waiver given by Wolf, the defendant in the judgment, <em>after </em>he had conveyed the premises to another, although given on a fi. fa. issued on a judgment confessed by Wolf <em>before </em>he conveyed. It does appear by the report of the case, whether or not Wolf's grantee had assumed the payment of the lien as part of his purchase-money. This decision is based on the 45th sect, of Act of 16th June 1836, 1 Bright. Purd. 647, pl. 56, which provides ‘ that the defendant in any execution, being at the time of issuing thereof the owner of such real estate, or the person owning such estate by title from him, may by writing filed in proper court, dispense with and waive an inquisition as aforesaid,’ &amp;c. But in the present case we have this element, to wit, that Dundore purchased subject to liens, and for the sake of clearness we will say subject to this particular judgment on which the sale was made, containing the waiver of extension, &amp;e. When a man buys subject to liens, he in law makes such liens his own personal debts, because he has the value of them in his pocket, retained out of the price he was to pay; and having assumed payment he is, as between him and his <em>vendor,personally </em>liable: Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, <a href="/watts/6/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts 182" data-case-ids="1846089" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0182-01">6 Watts 182</a>; Crooks <em>v. </em>Douglas, 6 P.

F. Smith 330. Then Dundore owed this very judgment as his own debt, and he owed it upon its terms, to wit, ‘without extension.’ This so completely connects Dundore with this judgment, that his relation to it is precisely what Tunis’s, his vendor’s, was ; and it is not pretended that Tunis can complain of the want of an inquisition, or could, even had he remained owner; and as under the terms of sale by Tunis to Dundore the latter assumed the payment of this judgment, he is in no better situation to complain than his vendor, and if he cannot, no man in the world can; and Dundore being no person but Tunis himself, the conclusion is inevitable that the sale to Spotts without inquisition made a complete and valid title.- The <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>case of Kimball <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 1 Barr 183, is in some respects similar to the one before us. There Starkweather executed a judgment note to Kelsey, waiving inquisition, on 28th October 1837, and it was entered, and several fi. fas. issued, and finally, 20th January 1841, an alias was returned levied on the land in dispute, no inquisition, and a vend, exp., and on 10th March 1841 returned sold to Kelsey for $300, and sheriff’s deed made 17th June 1841. On 26‘th February 1841 Starkweather, the defendant, conveyed the land levied on to Kimball; and the latter contended that Kelsey took no title for want of an inquisition ; but the Supreme Court did not even suspect that any question could be raised, and they there show that the Act of 16th June 1836 is only declaratory of what the practice had been.</p>

This is a more difficult question,.and must claim our candid consideration. The rule is that a purchaser cannot be compelled to accept a doubtful title, nor will a court compel him to take an estate which it cannot warrant to him ; and the question is not whether Spotts’s title is good, but whether it is <em>clearly </em>so: Bumberger <em>v. </em>Clippinger, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 311" data-case-ids="477844" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0311-01">5 W. &amp; S. 311</a>; Ludwick <em>v. </em>Huntzinger, Id. 51; Colwell <em>v. </em>Hamilton, <a href="/watts/10/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Watts 413" data-case-ids="1850951" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0413-01">10 Watts 413</a>; Speakman <em>v. </em>Forepaugh, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20363" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Wright 363">8 Wright 363</a>; Swayne <em>v. </em>Lyon, 17 P.

He is therefore the actor, and must show the title to have been such as he was not bound to accept. The case is not quite so strong as it would be if the vendor sought to compel acceptance and payment; he simply claims to keep what he got, but asks no more.</p>

The question at first sight being whether Dundore, <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>the purchaser, was hound by the waiver of inquisition contained in the judgment; and then the next step was to discover upon what terms did Dundore buy ? And an inquiry into this would have disclosed the fact that he had actually assumed the payment of that judgment, and thus having made the debt his own, a court could assure the title. This investigation was neither difficult nor unreasonable, and Kostenbader should have allowed time to Spotts to show the truth. When doubts are raised by extrinsic circumstances, which neither the purchaser nor the court can satisfactorily investigate for want of means to do so, the courts will refuse their aid; but when the means of inquiry are offered, and the result satisfactory, they will enforce performance. A threat, or even possibility of a contest, will not suffice to cast doubt on the title; it must, in the language of Lord Eldon, in Stapylton <em>v. </em>Scott, 16 Ves. 272, ‘be <em>considerable and rational, </em>such as would and ought to induce a prudent man to pause and hesitate; not based on captious, frivolous and astute niceties, but such as produce real bond, fide hesitation in the mind of the chancellor.’</p>

But Kimball <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 1 Barr 186, and Hageman <em>v. </em>Salisberry, <em>supra, </em>seem quite clear in holding the waiver on the appearance docket sufficient, because the index or judgment docket is intended to guide the searcher to the entry on the former, and if not found in the index he need not look farther.</p>

It was a mortgage to secure a widow's interest — principal $3111.94, annual interest $186.71 — and was spread over a farm worth $15,000, still retained by the vendor, the parcel sold to the plaintiff containing but three acres, with tavern stand erected thereon after mortgage was given. By the terms of the sale Kostenbader, the plaintiff, was to pay $8000; $1500 on agreement (and this he. paid — now sues to recover it back); $2500 on 1st April 1869; $1000 on 1st April 1870; $2000 on 1st April 1871, and another $1000 would remain; so that he had $6500 in his hands to meet this $3111, even if the whole were cast on the few acres, which never could have happened, and the proportion to be borne by the land sold would not have reached $300. There was therefore no ground for rescission on account of encumbrances, and the vendor was not bound to remove them, unless he was put upon doing so by a bonfi fide demand of <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the plaintiff for performance.

No opportunity was given Spotts to procure a release, or do anything towards carrying out his contract; the $2500 due 1st April 1869 were tendered to him, and he offered his deed, and vendee objected to the title, and then sued as upon a rescinded contract.

    <p id="b437-7" data-blocks='[["BL_437.10",437,[147,640,1162,1583]]]'>We are disposed to adopt, without comment, the charge of the learned court below, except so far as it relates to the effect of the waiver of inquisition, as contained in the confession of judgment of Tunis to Whiteman, on the 20th October 1863. Our doubt is, whether under the letter of the 45th section of the Act of June 16th 1836, this waiver was binding upon the property in the hands of Dundore, to whom it was subsequently sold by Tunis. The language would seem, at first blush, to put the power of waiver exclusively in the hands of him who owned the lands at the time of the issuing of the execution, thus attaching this right to the land rather than to the person of the debtor. Certainly the debtor could not waive the privilege of extent after the property, bound by the judgment, had passed to his vendee: Wolfe <em>v. </em>Payne, 11 Casey 97. In such case, however, the debtor having disposed of the property, is but a stranger, and has no right in it that he can waive. As against one phrchasing after the test of the fi. fa., but before sale, such waiver has been held to be good: Kimball <em>v. </em>Kelsey, 1 Barr 183. In this case it seems to be taken for granted that the waiver, as contained in the judgment note, being effective, as against the debtor, bound the property co-extensively with the lien of the judgment, so no point was made as to its effect upon a purchase subsequent to its entry. The argument is, that the provisions relating to the inquisition and extent being intended for the benefit of the debtor, his waiver of such right, thus vested in himself, could not be questioned by any third party. For my own part, I think it is hardly possible to evade the force of this argument ; for it is not to be controverted but that the statute does intend these dilatory provisions for the benefit of the debtor alone, and it is but natural to suppose that if he chooses to contract for their release he should have the power so to do. Again, the contrary theory involves the anomaly that one may dispose of this right for a valuable consideration, and then by his own act annul the contract by which such disposition was made. The creditor, also, is entitled to some consideration ; the waiver is part of the obligation for which he has paid his money or goods, and he ought not to be deprived of a valuable part of his contract on any doubtful construction of the statute.</p>

In many parts of the Commonwealth it has never been doubted but that the waiver in a judgment is co-extensive with the lien, and upon this theory many <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>sheriff’s sales have been made, and many titles acquired; we are, therefore, not inclined by a technical exposition of the act to unsettle rights honestly acquired and upon which many persons have rested for years.</p>
