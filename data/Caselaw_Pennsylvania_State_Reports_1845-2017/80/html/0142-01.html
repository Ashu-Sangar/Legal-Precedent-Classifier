In this case, at the time of bringing suit, there was some $600 or $700 of rent due. There is evidence of a tender of $330, nearly a year before bringing suit, but no other offer of performance subsequent, as to that it was the duty of the plaintiffs to keep up the tender from time to time.”</p>

The collection of $30 a month by Brady, until September 20th 1872, did not amount to a waiver of his right to treat the lease as void for the subsequent breaches of the agreement, but he had still the right to insist on the performance of the agreement, and, upon the breach thereof, to dispose of the land as if the lease had not been made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b145-15" data-blocks='[["BL_145.14",145,[123,1665,1176,776]]]'>Answer. “ This we affirm. If there were subsequent breaches of the agreement to pay $30 per month, we say, if Lambing failed, to keep this agreement, the party of the first part may re-enter that we have answered in our general charge. We say to the jury, that it was Lambing’s duty to pay, or offer to pay, from time to time, in order to carry out the provisions of the lease to him. If he did not do so he cannot stand off, and, after other parties put down a well, then come in and claim the production. We say that it was not Brady’s business to run after the plaintiffs and demand the money ; the money was payable to Brady; it was their place to come to him. The money became due every month, and it was their business to hunt Brady up and pay him the money, and not for Brady to run after them. It was not necessary for him to make demand, but it was their business to look Brady up and pay it. If you find, therefore, that Lambing, or his assigns, did not comply with the compact under the instructions, your verdict should be for the defendants generally; if you find that he did comply, you find for the plaintiffs.”</p>

We say to you, that this clause is a substitution for that, in regard to commencing operations in sixty days, as far as the time of commencing operations is concerned. That is done away with by this subsequent clause, which provides that he may pay $30 per month until operations are commenced. According to the terms and conditions of this article, a failure of the party of the second part to comply with all the requirements, was to work a forfeiture of his rights, except, that if he failed to commence operations within the required time, he might pay $30'per month instead. If he failed to pay every month, Brady might declare it a forfeiture, and re-enter at pleasure.] It appears that Brady never was out of possession of this part of his farm.

There are forfeitures that are odious in law; as where a man mortgages his estate, and provides, if he does not pay, the estate shall be forfeited. The jury can see how that -would be odious. A man might borrow a small sum of money, and if he did not pay it he would lose his whole estate. The law terms such forfeitures odious because they enable people to take advantage— very unjust advantage. The direct result of such forfeitures is to determine estates, and they are not encouraged by the law. [There are cases where a clause of forfeiture may be needed, as in this <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>case, to prevent estates from being tied up instead of determined; needed to prevent the effect of agreements which would otherwise retard the development of the country. Such forfeitures are not odious, hut rather to he encouraged, and this case furnishes an illustration. Brady was to receive $30 a month for a failure to commence operations. The effect of. this was to tie up this lease and retard the improvement of that section of country, where, according to the testimony, one well has produced about 16,000 barrels of oil up to about the first of April, and Brady’s share would be about 2000 barrels, worth about $2500 or $3000; while under this lease he got $190; the effect is, to retard the improvement and development of the country. We do not think this case comes under the rule laid down in regard to forfeitures which are odious and not to be encouraged by law; and after looking at all the circumstances in the case, we say to you, that that rule does not apply to cases of this kind.”]</p>

Its fugitive and wandering existence within the limits of a par<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>ticular tract was uncertain, and assumed certainty only by actual development founded upon experiment. Tbe surface required was often small compared with the results, when attended with success; while these results led to great speculation, by means of leases covering the lands of a neighborhood like a flight of locusts. Hence it was found necessary to guard the rights of the landowner as well as public interest, by numerous covenants, some of the most stringent kind, to prevent their lands from being burdened by unexecuted and profitless leases, incompatible with the right of alienation, and the use of the land. Without these guards, lands would be thatched over with oil-leases by sub-letting, and a farm riddled with holes and bristled with derricks, or operations would be delayed so long as the speculator would find it hopeful or convenient to himself alone. Hence covenants became necessary to regulate the boring of wells, their number and time of succession, the period of commencement and of completion, and many other matters requiring special regulation. Prominent among these was the clause of forfeiture to compel performance and put an end to the lease in case of injurious delay, or a want of success. These leases were not valuable, except by means of development, unlike the ordinary terms for the cultivation of the soil, or for the removal of fixed minerals. A forfeiture for non-development or delay therefore cut off no valuable rights of property, while it was essential for the protection of private and public interest in relation to the use and alienation of property. In the present case the lease was modified by adding immediately after the clause of forfeiture, a stipulation that should the lessee not commence operations at the time specified he should pay to the landlord thirty dollars for each and every month, until such time as drilling should be commenced. The lessee having paid for three months’ delay, suffered eleven months to elapse without payment or tender, and then tendered the whole sum,- which the landlord declined to accept, and insisted on the forfeiture, he in the meantime having made a new lease to a party who went into possession. The learned judge below held that the lease was forfeited by the omission to pay the monthly sums,' the lessee having done nothing in performance of his covenants. We cannot pronounce this to be an error in view of the nature of the lease, the true intention of the clause of forfeiture, and the want of any valuable interest acquired by the lessee, by performance. That time may be made of the essence of the contract by the express agreement of the parties has been so often decided that no citation of authority is necessary. In a case like this equity follows the law, and will enforce the covenant of forfeiture, as essential to do justice. It is true as general statement that equity abhors a forfeiture, but this is when it works a loss that is contrary to equity; not when it works equity and protects the landowner against the indifference and <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>laches of the lessee and prevents a great mischief, as in the case of such leases. To perpetuate an oil-lease for ever by the payment of a monthly sum, as here, at the will or caprice of the lessee, would work great injustice. The covenant of forfeiture was not abrogated entirely, but only modified.</p>
