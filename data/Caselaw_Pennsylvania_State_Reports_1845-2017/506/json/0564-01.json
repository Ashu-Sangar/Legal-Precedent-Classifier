Paragraphs (2), (3) and (5) of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order are stayed pending this determination.\nThe Consent Order and Agreement executed by the parties on January 25, 1983 shall continue in full force and effect except insofar as may be inconsistent with this order.\nLARSEN, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion in which NIX, C.J., and HUTCHINSON, J., joined.",

The appellant is guilty of civil contempt for his failure and refusal to comply with the provisions of a consent order. It is just and proper that he suffer the consequences.\nI dissent, however, to that portion of the majority\u2019s per curiam order which stays paragraph nos. 2, 3 and 5, and remands this case to the Commonwealth Court for a determination as to the suitability of the phase II pit as a hazardous waste facility.\nUnder the terms of the consent order, the appellant agreed, inter alia, that he would not construct any other hazardous waste facility unless the facility had a permit or qualified for interim status. The per curiam order confirms the finding of the Commonwealth Court that the phase II pit \u2014 another hazardous waste facility constructed by appellant \u2014 did not have interim status. Further, it is undisputed that no permit has issued for the phase II pit as a hazardous waste facility. Consequently, under the majority\u2019s holding we would have the Commonwealth Court determine whether or not a hazardous waste permit should be issued for the phase II pit. The authority and procedure for the issuance of such a permit is deliniated in the Solid Waste Management Act of 1980. (35 P.S. \u00a7 6018.501, et seq.). The statutory authority and procedure for the granting of a hazardous waste facility permit does not include a determination of suitability by the Commonwealth Court.\nI would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nNIX, C.J., and HUTCHINSON, J., join in this concurring and dissenting opinion.",
