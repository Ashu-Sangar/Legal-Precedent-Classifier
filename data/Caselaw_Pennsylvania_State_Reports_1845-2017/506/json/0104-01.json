        "text": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\n\u25a0 At issue in this appeal is the standard of causation which triggers the recovery of benefits under Section 301(c)(2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The facts are set forth below.\nThis case arose as a result of a fatal claim petition by Minnie Kusenko (appellee) after the death of her husband Mike Kusenko (decedent). Decedent had worked in the coal mining industry for thirty-six years in the employ of Republic Steel Corporation (appellant). After receiving evidence from both sides, the referee found that decedent died as a result of anthracosilicosis and/or coal miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis due to exposure to coal dust while working in the mines. The immediate cause of death stated on the death certificate however, was carcinoma of the lung. Coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis was listed as \u201cother significant causes.\u201d\nThe referee\u2019s award was affirmed by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board). The Board based their decision on Crucible Steel Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 65 Pa.Cmwlth. 415, 442 A.2d 1199 (1982) stating that the decedent\u2019s pneumoconiosis, which was a major reason for his ultimate death, was sufficient to meet the standard of causation for fatal claim benefits. The Commonwealth Court affirmed, applying the standard it set forth in Evon v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 70 Pa.Cmwlth. 325, 453 A.2d 55 (1982). In order to recover benefits under the Evon standard, all that is required is a \u201ccausal relationship\u201d between the disease and the death or disability. In applying this standard, the Commonwealth Court chose to ignore the standard set forth by a plurality of this Court in McCloskey v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 501 Pa. 93, 460 A.2d 237 (1983) which would require that the occupational disease be a \u201csubstantial, contributing factor among the secondary causes bringing about death.\u201d Id., 501 Pa. at 101, 460 A.2d at 241. Appellant herein petitioned this Court for appeal and we granted allocatur. After consideration, we reverse and remand to the Commonwealth Court for a decision consistent with this opinion.\nThe primary import of this case is to set forth a definitive standard for the determination of benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for deaths related to occupational hazards. Specifically, when a non-compensable disease of life which is unrelated to work intervenes and death results, what role must the occupational disease play so that benefits are forthcoming?\nResolution of this issue necessarily requires an examination of the statutory language which governs the recovery of benefits in a Workmen\u2019s Compensation case.\nPursuant to \u00a7 301(c)(2) of the Act:\nThe terms \u201cinjury\u201d, \u201cpersonal injury\u201d, and \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment\u201d, as used in this act, shall include, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act: Provided, that whenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease: And provided further, that if the employe\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such, period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable. The provisions of this paragraph (2) shall apply only with respect to the disability or death of an employe which results in whole or in part from the employe\u2019s exposure to the hazards of occupational disease...\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2).\nIn McCloskey, supra, we focused on the statutory language which provided that this section shall apply to death which results \u201cin whole or in part from the employee\u2019s exposure to the hazard of occupational disease\u201d Id., 501 Pa. at 100, 460 A.2d at 240; and we rejected the standard of Consolidation Coal Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 37 Pa.Cmwlth. 412, 391 A.2d 14 (1978) i.e. that 301(c)(2) requires that death be \u201cimmediately caused\u201d by the occupational disease. We also implicitly rejected the rather liberal standard of Evon, supra, which was relied upon in this case by the Commonwealth Court.\nThe test announced in McCloskey, supra, which we reaffirm today, provides that:\nWhere there are multiple causes of death and the immediate cause was non-compensable, the requirements of \u00a7 301(c)(2) may be met by a showing with unequivocal medical evidence that the deceased suffered from an occupational disease and that it was a substantial, contributing factor among the secondary causes in bringing about death.\n501 Pa. 93, 101, 460 A.2d 237, 241.\nWe are convinced that this standard accurately reflects the intent of the legislature, and balances the competing interests of the parties. To hold that the occupational disease be the sole or direct cause of the disability or death e.g. Consolidation Coal, supra, is entirely too strict a standard for a claimant to meet, the result being compensation in only the fewest number of cases. On the other hand to say that any contributing cause is sufficient no matter how slight is compensable e.g. Evon, supra, is too heavy a burden to place on industry. Such a standard would effectively reduce the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to a general health and insurance plan. This limitless liability is clearly not what the framers of \u00a7 302(a)(2) had in mind.\nWe therefore hold that the McCloskey standard shall be applied in those cases involving death benefits under 301(c)(2) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2).\nIn light of our disposition, we reverse and remand to the Commonwealth Court for a decision consistent with this opinion.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nHUTCHINSON, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, art. III, \u00a7 301(c), as amended, Act of December 5, 1974, P.L. 782, No. 263, \u00a7 4, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411.\n. We note that in recent years, standards of causation similar to the one set forth in McCloskey have been adopted by a number of states coping with the problems related to occupational disease and death. For example, the Nebraska Supreme Court has held that in order to receive benefits the occupational disease must be a substantial contributing factor to disability Mann v. City of Omaha, 211 Neb. 583, 319 N.W.2d 454 (1982). The West Virginia Supreme Court requires that a claimant establish that the occupational disease be a major contributing factor. Elsie Troxell, Widow of Lewis Troxell v. State Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commissioner and Consolidation Coal, (per curiam opinion filed December 14, 1983, No. 15951). In 1983 the Supreme Court of North Carolina in a case involving disability as a result of cotton dust exposure held that in order for disability arising from an occupational disease to be compensable there must be a showing that the occupational disease contributed significantly to that disability. Rutledge v. Tultex Corp./Kings Yarn, 308 N.C. 85, 301 S.E.2d 359 (1983).\n. Although Mr. Justice Hutchinson does not join this opinion, we note that he expressly agrees with the standard of causation articulated. See Dissenting Opinion, Hutchinson, J.",

        "text": "LARSEN, Justice,\ndissenting opinion.\nI dissent. The paramount responsibility of this Court, in cases arising under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, is to liberally construe and apply its provisions in order to effectuate and implement its remedial nature and humanitarian objectives. Krawchuk v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 497 Pa. 115, 120, 439 A.2d 627 (1981); Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928(c) (pamphlet 1984-85). I believe that the majority\u2019s construction and application of section 301(c)(2) of the Act ignores these remedial and humanitarian objectives and, in so doing, exaggerates the interests of the employer at the expense' of the worker.\nThe majority initially rejects the Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretations of section 301(c)(2), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), in Consolidation Coal Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), 37 Pa.Commw. 412, 391 A.2d 14 (1978) as \u201ctoo strict\u201d, and in Evon v. WCAB, 70 Pa.Commw. 325, 453 A.2d 55 (1982) as too liberal\u201d. In order \u201cto set forth a definitive standard for the determination\u201d of death benefits under section 301(c)(2) of the Act, and to \u201cbalance the competing interests\u201d of workers and employers, slip opinion at 2 and 4, the majority adopts the standard of causation announced in Mr. Justice McDermott\u2019s opinion (joined only by then \u2014 Mr. Justice, now Mr. Chief Justice Nix) in McCloskey v. WCAB, 501 Pa. 93, 101, 460 A.2d 237, 241 (1983), namely:\nWhere there are multiple causes of death and the immediate cause was non-compensable, the requirements of \u00a7 301(c)(2) may be met by a showing with unequivocal medical evidence that the deceased suffered from an occupational disease and that it was a substantial, contributing factor among the secondary causes in bringing about death.\nAt__\nIn the abstract, I might accept this standard of causation under section 301(c)(2) as a straightforward and reasonably fair accomodation of the conflicting interests of worker and employer. We do not deal in the abstract, however, but in the world of real people and real situations. In applying the above standard to deny benefits to claimants such as Mr. McCloskey\u2019s widow, I submit that the majority has added a hidden element to its standard that eliminates from coverage a significant class of deserving claimants. In practical application, the standard of causation adopted by the majority today is neither as \u201cdefinitive\u201d as intended nor as fair an accomodation of conflicting interests as it purports to be; it is, rather, a standard unacceptably close to the \u201ctoo strict\u201d Consolidation Coal standard which the majority purports to reject.\nMy point of departure with the majority lies with the meaning given the word \u201csubstantial\u201d, a meaning which can be garnered only by observing the application of the \u201csubstantial, contributing factor\u201d standard to particular circumstances. In application, the majority denies coverage to a claimant whose decedent has contracted an occupational disease that has \u201cmerely\u201d accelerated or aggravated a non-compensable disease which is the immediate cause of death. Observing the operation of the majority\u2019s standard in McCloskey v. WCAB, supra, we glean the hidden meaning of \u201csubstantial\u201d \u2014 to be considered a \u201csubstantial, contributing factor\u201d, the medical testimony must establish that, but for the occupational disease, death would not have occurred. Thus the majority requires a degree of exactitude that, as the legislature recognizes, medical science is presently incapable of supplying. To demonstrate this point, I shall quote from my dissenting opinion in McCloskey v. WCAB, supra at 501 Pa. 105-117, 460 A.2d 237 (footnotes omitted).\n\u201cUnder the Act, compensation is available for claimants or their dependents for personal injury to the employee or for death by an injury in the course of employment. 77 P.S. \u00a7 431. Section 301(c)(1), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1) provides, in relevant portion:\n\u201cThe terms \u2018injury\u2019 and \u2018personal injury\u2019, as used in this act, shall be construed to mean an injury to an employe, regardless of his previous physical condition, arising in the course of his employment and related thereto, and such disease or infection as naturally results from the injury or is aggravated, reactivated or accelerated by the injury; and wherever death is mentioned as a cause for compensation under this act, it shall mean only death resulting from such injury and its resultant effects, and occurring within three hundred weeks after the injury, (emphasis added).\n\u201cIn 1972, section 301(c)(2) was added, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), which provision embraced occupational diseases within the \u2018injury\u2019 concept. That section provides, in relevant portion:\n\u201cThe terms \u2018injury,\u2019 \u2018personal injury,\u2019 and \u2018injury arising in the course of his employment,\u2019 as used in this act, shall include, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act. Provided, That whenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease: And provided further, That if the employe\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable. The provisions of this paragraph (2) shall apply only with respect to the disability or death of an employe which results in whole or in part from the employe\u2019s exposure to the hazard of occupational disease after June 30, 1973 in employment covered by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. (emphasis added).\n\u201c... This Court has held that an injury need not be the sole or exclusive cause of the disability, Halaski v. Hilton Hotel, 487 Pa. 313, 319, 409 A.2d 367 (1979), nor, as the majority acknowledges, does an injury or occupational disease need to be the sole or exclusive cause of death. E.g., Elliott v. WCAB, 57 Pa.Commw. 70, 425 A.2d 885, 887 (1981). Moreover, it is sufficient under the Act if the injury (including an occupational disease) \u2018aggravates, reactivates or accelerates\u2019 a preexisting condition which preexisting condition was the immediate or primary cause of disability or death. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1), WCAB v. Bernard S. Pincus Co., 479 Pa. 286, 388 A.2d 659 (1978) and Halaski v. Hilton Hotel, supra at 487 Pa. 318-19, 409 A.2d 367 (\u2018it is sufficient if the injury materially contributed to the disability, rather than the disability resulting from the natural progression of the preexisting condition.\u2019)\n\u201cOf particular importance to our determination is the principle enunciated by this Court in Hamil v. Bashline, 481 Pa. 256, 392 A.2d 1280 (1978) and consistently followed in medical malpractice cases. See Jones v. Montefiore Hospital, 494 Pa. 410, 431 A.2d 920 (1981) and Gradel v. Inouye, 491 Pa. 534, 421 A.2d 674 (1980).\n\u201c... Defendants [in Hamil v. Bashline] argued their negligence did not cause the myocardial infarction even though it may have increased the risk of harm to the decedent. Relying on section 323(a) of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, Negligent Performance of Undertaking to Render Services, this Court rejected defendants\u2019 narrow theory of causation, and at 481 Pa. 269, 273, 392 A.2d 1280, held:\n\u201cWe agree with the view of the Superior Court majority expressed in Bashline I that the effect of \u00a7 323(a) is to relax the degree of certitude normally required of plaintiff\u2019s evidence in order to make a case for the jury as to whether a defendant may be held liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injuries: Once a plaintiff has introduced evidence that a defendant\u2019s negligent act or omission increased the risk of harm to a person in plaintiff\u2019s position, and that the harm was in fact sustained, it becomes a question for the jury as to whether or not that increased risk was a substantial factor in producing the harm.\n$ \u2021 * * * \u25a0 *\n\u201cIn light of our interpretation of Section 323(a), it follows that where medical causation is a factor in a case coming within that Section, it is not necessary that the plaintiff introduce medical evidence \u2014 in addition to that already adduced to prove defendant\u2019s conduct increased the risk of harm \u2014 to establish that the negligence asserted resulted in plaintiff\u2019s injury. Rather, once the jury is apprised of the likelihood that defendant\u2019s conduct resulted in plaintiff\u2019s harm, that Section leaves to the jury, and not the medical expert, the task of balancing probabilities. In so saying we do not intend to undermine the well-established standard of \u2018reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2019 as the accepted norm for medical opinions on causation. But we think it would be unreasonable and unrealistic in this type of case to expect a physician to state with a \u2018reasonable degree of medical certainty\u2019 what might have happened when the law (Section 323(a)) recognizes the contingencies involved. See generally D. Danner and E. Segall, Mediocolegal Causation: A Source of Professional Misunderstanding, 3 Am.J.L. & Med. 303 (1978). Where there is at issue the adequacy of medical services rendered in a fact situation to which Section 323(a) applies, therefore, a prima facie case of liability is established where expert medical testimony is presented to the effect that defendant\u2019s conduct did, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty increase the risk that the harm sustained by plaintiff would occur.\n\u201cThis Court further held, in Jones v. Montefiore Hospital, supra at 494 Pa. 416, 431 A.2d 920:\n\u201cProximate cause is a term of art, and may be established by evidence that a defendant\u2019s negligent act or failure to act was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm inflicted upon a plaintiff. Pennsylvania law has long recognized that this substantial factor need not be, as the trial court incorrectly charged, the only factor, i.e., \u2018that cause which ... produces the result,\u2019 (citations omitted) A plaintiff need not exclude every possible explanation, and \u2018the fact that some other cause concurs with the negligence of the defendant in producing an injury does not relieve defendant from liability unless he can show that such other cause would have produced the injury independently of his negligence.\u2019 Majors v. Brodhead Hotel, 416 Pa. 265 at 273, 205 A.2d 873 at 878 (1965).\n\u201cIt is inconceivable to me that this Court would adopt a stricter standard of causation in workmen\u2019s compensation cases than in medical malpractice cases decided under Section 323(a) of the Restatement. That section recognizes a higher duty on the part of one undertaking to render services which justifies a relaxation of the ordinary negligence standards of causation. Surely the statutory and moral obligation of an employer to his employees to provide safe conditions and working environment justifies no more stringent a standard under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, especially in light of the liberal construction which we must give the Act.\n\u201cThe \u2018resulting from\u2019 language of Section 301(c)(2), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2), surely does not preclude a referee\u2019s finding of a causal connection between disability or death and injury (including an occupational disease) where the medical testimony establishes that the disease materially contributed to the death, Halaski v. Hilton Hotel, supra at 487 Pa. 317, 409 A.2d 367 and Crucible Steel v. WCAB, 52 Pa.Comm. 165, 415 A.2d 458 (1980), or was a substantial factor in increasing (\u2018aggravating, reactivating, or accelerating\u2019) the risk of harm to the employee which harm may have been more immediately \u2018caused\u2019 by some other condition or noncompensable occurrence or ailment. See Section 301(c)(1) and Hamil v. Bashline, supra.\n\u201cIn Professor Larson\u2019s treatise, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, \u00a7 13.11, the author makes the following observations:\n\u201cThe second group of medical-causation cases comprises the cases in which the existence of the primary compensable injury in some way exacerbates the effects of an independent medical weakness or disease. \u25a0 The causal sequence in these cases may be more indirect or complex, but as long as the causal connection is in fact present the compensability of the subsequent condition is beyond question.\n******\n\u201c[W]hen the compensable injury produces a condition that interferes with normal curative processes that might have alleviated the preexisting independent condition, the progression of the independent condition is compensable.....\n\u201cIt is also worthy of note that federal regulations (20 CFR \u00a7 718.205) pertaining to benefits to miners whose death was due to pneumoconiosis provide:\n\u201c(b) Death will be considered due to pneumoconiosis if any of the following criteria is met:\n\u201c(1) Where competent medical evidence established that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis, or\n\u201c(2) Where death was due to multiple causes including pneumoconiosis and it is not medically feasible to distinguish which disease caused death or the extent to which pneumoconiosis contributed to the cause of death____\n******\n\u201c(c) For the purpose of this section, death shall be considered to be due to pneumoconiosis where the cause of death is significantly related to or aggravated by pneumoconiosis.\n\u201cA related consideration in this case is the issue of the sufficiency of the medical testimony regarding causation ____\n\u201cIn the realm of causation, \u2018sufficient competent evidence\u2019, 77 P.S. \u00a7 834, means that the expert medical testimony must establish no more \u2014 and no less \u2014 than that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the death or disability was causally connected to the injury (including an occupational disease). No \u201cmagic words\u201d are required so long as the words chosen convey the professional opinion as to causation to that reasonable degree of medical certainty. Wilkes-Barre v. WCAB, 54 Pa.Commw. 230, 420 A.2d 795 (1980). And of course, the referee\u2019s determination whether the medical testimony suffices to demonstrate causation is entitled to substantial deference as the Act has vested the referee with broad discretion in assessing the credibility of witnesses and making findings of fact. Halaski v. Hilton Hotel, supra 487 Pa. at 319, 409 A.2d 367.\n******\n\u201cI would hold that the expert medical testimony establishes, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Mr. McCloskey\u2019s death resulted from his occupational disease (silicosis) in that silicosis increased the risk of harm from the myocardial infarction, thus aggravating or accelerating an independent, preexisting condition. Sufficient competent evidence exists, therefore, to support the referee\u2019s finding that silicosis was a \u2018significant, contributing causative factor in the death\u2019 of Mr. McCloskey and to sustain the award of benefits.\n\u201cFinally, I believe that the expert medical testimony quoted above also meets the majority\u2019s standard of causation, namely, that \u2018unequivocal medical evidence\u2019 establishes that silicosis existed and was a \u2018substantial, contributing factor\u2019 in bringing about death.\nAs in McCloskey, I believe that in the instant case, there was \u201csufficient, competent evidence\u201d on the record, 77 P.S. \u00a7 834, to support the referee\u2019s findings that Mr. Kusenko became disabled and died as a result of coal miner\u2019s pneumoconiosis and that the majority\u2019s standard of causation under section 301(c)(2) has been satisfied. Specifically, I would hold that unequivocal medical evidence establishes that an occupational disease, coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, existed and that the disease was a \u201csubstantial, contributing factor among the secondary causes in bringing about death.\u201d\nMr. Kusenko had worked for some 43 years in the coal industry, 36 of those years for Republic Steel. Following hearings, the workmen\u2019s compensation referee made the following findings of fact:\nSEVENTH: Based upon credible, competent and sufficient medical evidence of record in this case from Dr. Thomas P. Connelly, your Referee finds as a fact that on June 1, 1977, the deceased became totally and permanently disabled as a result of anthracosilicosis and/or coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis which resulted from his total and cumulative exposure to coal dust while employed in the coal industry.\nEIGHTH: Based on credible, competent and sufficient medical evidence of record in this case from Dr. Thomas P. Connelly, your Referee finds as a fact that the Claimant\u2019s husband died as a result of anthracosilicosis and/or coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis due to the total and cumulative exposure to coal dust throughout his working experience.\nThese findings by the referee, the \u201conly legitimate fact-finder\u201d, Garcia v. WCAB (Bethlehem Steel Corp.), 503 Pa. 342, 344, 469 A.2d 585, 586 (1983), were affirmed by the Board, whose \u201cpower ... is preeminent in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings.\u201d McCloskey v. WCAB, supra at 501 Pa. 97, n. 2, 460 A.2d 237 n. 2. (Opinion of McDermott, J.) Accordingly, a reviewing court cannot disturb those findings unless the record lacks \u201csufficient, competent evidence\u201d to support them. 77 P.S. \u00a7 834.\nDr. Connelly, Mr. Kusenko\u2019s treating physician, rendered the following testimony in the instant proceedings:\nA. Now, when I saw him in June, his X-rays did show Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis, and when I had him hospitalized, his Pulmonary Function Test was abnormal \u2014 and these factors led me to form an opinion in June that he was totally and permanently disabled because of Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis.\n# Jit * * sis *\nQ. Are you able to state to a degree of medical certainty that any abnormality on these Pulmonary Function Studies was attributable to Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis as opposed to lung cancer?\nA. I would feel that they would both \u2014 they would both be a factor in causing the abnormalities.\nQ. Are you able to say which one was the greater factor?\nA. I would think the Coal Workers Pneumoconiosis would be the greater factor.\nReproduced Record at 51a and 53a.\nQ. Doctor, do you have an opinion as to what effect Mr. Kusenko\u2019s coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis would have had on his ability to work at the time of his death had he not had bronchogenic carcinoma?\nA. Yes, I examined Mr. Kusenko in June of \u201877, and I felt at that time that he was disabled from coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, and I felt his disability was total and permanent at that time. So I would say at the time of his death, had he not had bronchogenic carcinoma, I would have felt that he was totally and permanently disabled due to the coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\nQ. Doctor, regardless of whether or not Mr. Kusenko had coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis, would the bronchogenic carcinoma eventually have proved fatal?\nA. In my opinion, it would probably have.\nQ. Do you have an opinion as to what effect, if any, Mr. Kusenko\u2019s coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis had when he died?\nA. Yes, it would be my opinion that because of the coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis that he was unable to ward off the bad effects of the bronchogenic carcinoma. In other words, the bronchogenic carcinoma would cause him to gradually deteriorate and lose his appetite, and things like that. And I think that the coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis would aggravate that\u2014 would aggravate that in the progression of the symptoms from the bronchogenic carcinoma.\n>\u00a1C Sic * * * *\nQ. And you have testified that, in your opinion, Mr. Kusenko did have coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis?\nA. Yes, he did.\nQ. What effect would the fact that he had coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis have on the ability of those portions of the lung, not actually invaded by cancer, to deal with the effects of the cancer?\nA. Well, the portions of the lungs that would not be affected by the cancer would also be hampered because of the coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis; therefore, the breathing ability and respiratory ability of Mr. Kusenko would be hampered by the pneumoconiosis.\n* * * * * *\nQ. Basically what effect \u2014 Do you have an opinion as to what effect the fact that, in your opinion, his remaining lung tissue was not itself healthy have on the rapidity of the course of the terminal events?\nA. Yes, I think the fact that he had coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis would hasten his eventual demise. In other words, because of that, I don\u2019t think he would have been able to withstand the effects of the carcinoma. His system was weakened by the pneumoconiosis.\nQ. Doctor, in your opinion, which diseases resulted in Mr. Kusenko\u2019s death?\nA. In my opinion, the direct cause of death was the bronchogenic carcinoma, and I felt that the coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis was a causative factor in his death.\nReproduced Record at 276a-279a.\nQ. Is it possible, Doctor, that Mr. Kusenko may have been unable to ward off the bad effects of this lung cancer absent any coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis?\nA. Yes, it\u2019s possible.\nQ. And is it possible that he may well have died on December the 6th, 1977, at the same time of day, had he never gone down in the mines at all as a result of his lung cancer?\nA. Yes, I would say that\u2019s possible.\n* * * * * *\nQ. Doctor, the crucial word in this instance seems to be the word; may. Doctor, in your opinion, did or didn\u2019t coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis hasten Mr. Kusenko\u2019s death?\nA. \u25a0 Oh, yes, in my opinion, it did.\nReproduced record at 287A. Additionally, as the majority notes, coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis was listed on Mr. Kusenko\u2019s death certificate as one of the \u201csignificant causes\u201d of death.\nBased on the foregoing competent record evidence, this Court must accept the findings of the referee and the Board that Mr. Kusenko had contracted coal, worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, a compensable occupational disease which resulted in his total disability and eventual death. The evidence adequately supports the finding that Mr. Kusenko\u2019s pneumoconiosis was a \u201csubstantial, contributing factor among the secondary causes in bringing about death.\u201d I see no need, therefore, to \u201creverse and remand to the Commonwealth Court for a decision consistent with\u201d the majority\u2019s standard of causation under section 301(c)(2) \u2014 the decision of the Commonwealth Court is consistent with that standard. I would affirm the Commonwealth Court.",
