Injuries incurred rendered him quadriplegic. At the time of the tragic incident, Mr. Myers, like his employer, was a resident of Illinois. Mr. Miller, the other driver involved, was a Pennsylvania resident and insured under a no-fault policy issued by Travelers Insurance Company. As the no-fault carrier, Travelers, forthrightly paid $74,000 medical expenses, and $250,000 in settlement for non-economic loss to Mr. Myers.</p>
    <p id="b536-9" data-blocks='[["BL_536.9",536,[268,1425,1162,640]]]'>Mr. Myers also filed a claim for benefits from his employer, Nicel Industries, under the Illinois Workmen’s Compensation Law. Both Nicel Industries and their compensation carrier, Commercial Union Assurance Companies contested his claim. The contest was resolved on June 28, 1979, by the Industrial Commission of Illinois in favor of Mr. Myers. He was awarded medical benefits and $120.00 per week for life from Commercial Union. Mr. Myers did not receive medical benefits from Commercial Union from the date of the accident to the date of the award. Commercial Union contended they were not obliged because those expenses had already been paid by Travelers.</p>

In a separate equity action Travelers sued Commercial Union for reimbursement of the medical benefits paid Mr. Myers as the no-fault obligor. All actions were consolidated and the case submitted on stipulated facts. The trial court, per the honorable S. Louis Farino, dismissed the respective claims of both insurance companies. They appealed: Commercial Union challenging the decision on its subrogation claim, and Travelers challenging the decision on its claim for reimbursement.</p>

      <em>See </em>48 Ill.St. § 138.5(b). The court’s decision was based on its evaluation of the significant contacts which the state of Illinois had with the underlying dispute, and the lack of countervailing contacts by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Their analysis was in accord with this Court’s decision in <em>Griffith v.

On appeal the Superior Court affirmed the order of the lower court, but not on the basis relied upon by Judge Farino. Rather, in an apparent effort to be consistent with its earlier analysis concerning Commercial Union’s subrogation claim, the court concluded that any claim against the workmen’s compensation carrier should be governed by the law of Illinois; and held that Section 106(a)(3) did not apply to benefits payable by the compensation carrier of an Illinois employer to an Illinois employee. Upon petition of Travelers we granted allocatur. We now reverse.</p>

Such a result would have encouraged the benevolent policy this state had under our repealed no-fault act of insuring immediate help for victims of Pennsylvania automobile accidents no matter what the laws of their home state or their other coverage.</p>

This case involves only a conflict of laws issue. That issue can be resolved in a forum in either Illinois or Pennsylvania. Presumably, either state, applying the <em>Griffith </em>analysis, which is itself in accord with Restatement (Second) of Conflicts § 145 (1971), would reach the same result. The power of either forum to hear the issue is, however, unquestioned.</p>
