All relevant evidence may not be necessary to a prosecution, but one piece of suppressed evidence may make all other evidence irrelevant. It is an argument all its own and certainly must be an argument dehors the record of a suppression court.</p>

It is part of the wisdom of <em>Bosurgi, </em>that such protracted, complicated, and erudite considerations are avoided by direct access of appeal to the nub of the question, i.e., the validity of the suppression. There is no need to thrash about questions of ultimate relevancy when the ache was the suppression. One wonders why the Superior Court would opt for the further burdens of determining relevancy when they are only required to hear argument on the validity of the suppression.</p>

However, in my judgment it was the intention of the Court in that decision to limit the Commonwealth’s right of appeal from an adverse suppression ruling to those instances where the order of suppression either resulted in the termination of the prosecution’s case because of the lack of all of its evidence or “wherein the Commonwealth is <em>substantially handicapped </em>because it cannot present all its available evidence.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Consequently the requirement of a certification is totally unnecessary since the adverse suppression order itself is a matter of record. If the ruling of the Court today is intended as accepting an interpretation of <em>Bosurgi </em>which would in fact limit the right of appeal of the Commonwealth, providing for a certification which is conclusive and <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>not subject to challenge renders the qualification of the right illusory.
