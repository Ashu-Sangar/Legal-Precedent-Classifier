More specifically, we must decide whether county crime labs, which undertake to perform scientific tests at the request of the police, should recognize that the results of those tests are necessary for the protection of criminal suspects who may be affected by them, such that the labs’ failure to use due care in performing those tests will render the labs liable in tort to injured criminal suspects.</p>

After four of these rapes, the police from the respective boroughs submitted clothing from the victims to the Allegheny County Crime Lab for testing. In the first case, upon learning that the Crime Lab had found semen on a pair of slacks, the Wilkinsburg police requested that the Crime Lab test the semen to determine the blood group of the assailant. The Crime Lab refused to do so, however, explaining that unless the police had a suspect there was no point in doing the test. In the second case, the Crime Lab found semen on the victim’s clothing but did not determine the blood group of the assailant. These items of clothing were -eventually returned to the victim. In the third case, the Crime Lab erroneously determined that there was no semen on any of the items submitted. Finally, in the fourth case, a cervical smear was submitted to the Crime Lab along with the victim’s clothing. Although the cervical smear tested posi<a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>tive for the presence of sperm, the specimen was not blood-typed, nor was the victim’s clothing examined.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.4",80,[258,449,1165,522]]]'>The complaint further alleges that on April 17, 1976, appellee Craig Cantwell was arrested and charged with eight rapes, including the four rapes outlined above. The Wilkinsburg police then called the Crime Lab to say that they had a suspect and requested that the semen on the slacks of the first victim be blood-typed. The Crime Lab again refused, this time on the grounds that the passage of so much time precluded the performance of an accurate test. In August, this request was renewed and again refused.</p>
    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[252,1012,1167,849]]]'>According to the complaint, appellee’s criminal trial commenced on September 10, 1976. During the course of the trial, an employee of the Crime Lab testified that it was still possible to do blood-typing on the semen specimens still in the possession of the police. As a result of this testimony, blood-typing was finally performed. In the first and fourth rapes, the Crime Lab concluded that appellee could not have been the assailant because the assailant’s blood group in both cases was B, while appellee’s blood group is A. In the third rape, the clothing from the victim was retested and the Crime Lab determined that sperm were, in fact, present. This clothing was then also blood-typed and the Crime Lab again concluded that appellee could not have been the assailant because the assailant’s blood group was B. These tests were then repeated and the results confirmed by the coroner’s office.</p>

On September 21, 1976, the district attorney moved to dismiss all of the charges against appellee, and the charges were, in fact, dismissed. Because appellee had never been able to post bail, which had been set at $105,000, he had remained incarcerated from April 17, 1976, the date of his arrest, until September 21, 1976.</p>

This is essentially a requirement of foreseeability. <em>See, e.g., Kane v.
