When he comes out to work, the particular unit or police vehicle that he would be using, he would also use that log book assigned to that vehicle”; that no copies of original entries <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>in the log books are made; that the log book is really “pretty much” like a time sheet or diary of an officer’s eight hour tour of duty; that records separate from the log books are kept when arrests are made; that the log books are filed in the police office after they are filled up; that the log books could be used to show patterns or frequencies of particular types of incidents; and that there has not been even “one specific problem, no matter how trivial or insignificant” caused by appellant’s destruction of the old log books.</p>

Rather, there was simply a casual practice or tradition of filing the completed books in the police office. Further, the evidence concerning the nature of the log books was not such as to imply a duty to keep them for future use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> The evidence revealed that the log books were in the nature of diaries, used to provide a continuity between shifts of police officers and to account for an officer’s time during his tour of duty; there was no evidence that the books contained any information that was essential to the legal recordkeeping requirements of a police department, and in fact, the evidence revealed that separate records were kept for arrests. Accordingly, we conclude <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>that there was not substantial evidence to support the Board’s finding that appellant had violated an official duty.</p>

Neglect means leaving things “undone or unattended to especially through carelessness.” Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary (1977). In this case, the evidence failed to show that appellant’s destruction of the old log books constituted neglect of some duty; appellant had no duty with respect to keeping old log books. To the contrary, in view of the failure of the record to establish that the old log books retained any importance, we think appellant was particularly careful in performing his job because he nevertheless kept the completed log books from all of 1980 and 1981 and the end of 1979.</p>

In order for disobedience of orders to constitute the basis for disciplining a police officer, the orders which have been disobeyed must be reasonable and must be reasonably related to the operation of the police department and the function of the officer in that department. This element of reasonableness is required in order to insulate police officers from the unreasonable requests of their supervisors, which may be made simply to harass the officer or as a pretext for disciplinary action when the requests are not complied with.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> In this case, although it is clear that appellant failed to comply with the Board’s order to turn over the log books from 1974 through most of 1979, because there was no evidence that those old log books had any reasonable relation to the efficient operation of the <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>police department or to appellant’s function within that department, there was not substantial evidence to show that appellant had disobeyed an order which could give rise to disciplinary action.</p>

Clites, was the chief of police for Upper Yoder Township, a township of the second class, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>from October 1974 until his discharge on October 30, 1981, for destruction of police log books. Those log books were kept in patrol cars and contained entries regarding all of the official activities involving the car for each shift, including date and time the officer entered the car, time calls were received and cleared, nature of calls and names of complainants, and time officer’s shift ended. As the majority notes, the information contained in the log books could be useful indicia of patterns or frequencies of particular types of incidents or disturbances within the township. The log books were apparently also the sole source of data regarding the use of patrol cars — expensive township equipment. No duplicates of the information contained in the log books existed. It is true the records were <em>made </em>for departmental control by Upper Yoder Township’s police chief and supervisors, and not because their making was mandated by statute, local ordinance or rule. Nevertheless, once made, in my view, the records became government records whose manner of disposal was regulated by statute.</p>

Section 6 of that Act provides in relevant part: “Records which have been reproduced or copied in accordance with section one of this act or other records which are deemed valueless may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of, subject to the approval of the court of common pleas of the proper county.” 65 P.S. § 63.6 (1959). Likewise, Section 6 of the Municipal Records Act, Act of January 18, 1968, P.L. (1967) 961, which provides for the destruction of records in, <em>inter alia, </em>townships of the second class, provides, “[EJach individual act of disposition shall be approved by resolution of the governing body of the municipality.” 53 P.S. § 9006 (1972). <em>Compare, </em>16 P.S. § 13004, which provides for disposition of records in counties of the second through eighth classes subject to certification of Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission; The Administrative Code of 1929, 71 P.S. § 204 (1962) providing for disposition of records of state level departments and agencies subject to <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>approval of the Executive Board and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission; and 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 4321 and § 4322 (1981) governing disposition of court records. Whether Upper Yoder Township declared its intent to follow schedules promulgated pursuant to the Municipal Records Act does not appear of record. Regardless of which statute applies, however, it is clear that no records of the township could properly be discarded on the unilateral act of a single person. Clites admitted discarding the records without approval of any reviewing agency, and, in my view, this evidence supports the- charge of neglect or violation of an official duty, i.e. the duty to preserve the records pending permission to destroy them from the appropriate reviewing body.</p>

Unfortunately, Clites did not secure such approval. Neither did the availability of the information from other sources relieve Clites of the duty to seek approval before these original records were discarded. <em>See, </em>63 P.S. 63.6, supra; 53 P.S. § 9008 (1972).</p>

That section provides that a person commits an offense if he intentionally and unlawfully destroys the availability of any record belonging to or received or kept by the government for information or record. The majority states the log books fall outside the purview of § 4911 because their nature did not imply future use. Unless the books were kept for sentimental reasons, it is difficult to imagine what purpose other than future use was intended when the log book system was implemented. In fact, there was testimony in the Court of Common Pleas that the log books were to be used in an audit. In my view, in the absence of a <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>conviction, there can be no reliance on a violation of the criminal statute as justification for Chief Clites’ dismissal.</p>

Inherent in the nature of this employer-employee relationship is the near certainty that the need for disciplinary action will arise. Section 4 of the police tenure act expressly requires the township supervisors, as the appointing authority, to adjudicate the propriety of its own action preferring charges if the police chief demands a hearing on the charges, 53 P.S. § 814 (1974).

The supervisors, for whatever reason, requested all the records regarding the operation of the police force, which they had a right to do.

Clites then demanded a public hearing, as was his right, 53 P.S. § 814. At that <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>hearing, Clites was represented by counsel, the township solicitor acted as prosecutor and a third' attorney presided over the hearing to guard against possible procedural defects. The parties stipulated that the records had- been destroyed. On' this evidence, the supervisors decided to remove Clites for unauthorized destruction of government property, which they believed to be illegal. What constitutes due process depends on what process is due under the particular circumstances of each case. The procedures employed in this case were entirely in order, and Clites’ argument that the supervisors improperly commingled investigative, prosecutive and adjudicative functions is meritless. Any holding to the contrary would deprive the supervisors of their inherent supervisory powers. We should not “second guess” those eiected to fulfill this responsibility. The majority view, taken to its extreme, would work to nullify the inherent powers of supervision in the elected supervisors, which surely include investigating and calling into question the activities of the township’s police employees.</p>
