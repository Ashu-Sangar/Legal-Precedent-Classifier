She accepted the offer but instead of taking her home, appellee pulled into a secluded parking lot nearby where he assaulted and raped Mrs. Bennett.</p>

Defense counsel attacked the victim’s credibility and her identification of appellee, focusing on a discrepancy between the victim’s description of the color of appellee’s car and its actual color. Counsel also suggested to the jury that Mrs. Bennett had taken a ride from a male acquaintance who was to have taken her home the evening of the rape and had consensual intercourse with him that had gotten out of hand, at which point she reported a rape. Counsel further argued to the jury that, having reported a rape, Mrs. Bennett felt pressure at the police lineup to identify someone as her attacker and that someone happened to be appellee. The jury rejected counsel’s suggestion and convicted appellee of the charges as noted.</p>

At the sentencing hearing in the instant case, appellee first propounded his “victims conspiracy/consent” theory. Defense counsel had failed to interview Russell Gore, who would have testified that he had seen appellee with Mrs. Bennett, although counsel knew of Gore’s existence and availability.

The reasonable basis for defense counsel’s tactics are forcefully apparent on the record. At the time of the instant trial, appellee’s prosecution for the alleged rape of Mrs. Baker had not yet begun. Appellee’s “victims conspiracy/consent” defense would have necessitated placing in front of the jury the fact that appellee had been charged as a rapist in another remarkably similar case currently pending. It is apparent that, under these circumstances, the mention of the appellee’s being charged with a very similar rape of another woman posed enormous risks of prejudice that counsel could reasonably assume outweighed any potential benefits.</p>

If the claimed ineffectiveness for failure to interview and present witnesses stood alone, and the evidence to be offered by those witnesses did not square with the defense presented, the Majority’s reasoning would be beyond question.
