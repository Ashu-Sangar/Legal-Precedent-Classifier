    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[267,508,1159,206]]]'>Appellant, Robert (“Codfish”) Bricker, appeals a judgment of sentence of death for murder of the first degree imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County-</p>
    <p id="b618-6" data-blocks='[["BL_618.6",618,[260,739,1167,1398]]]'>Appellant was charged in connection with the death of Thomas Sacco. The record indicates that Sacco was shot and killed by Miles Gabler on March 25, 1979 at approximately 1:00 a.m. at an after-hours club in the City of Pittsburgh. The Commonwealth’s evidence indicated that Gabler had been solicited by the Appellant to shoot Sacco. The record further indicates that Sacco was conspiring with William (“Eggie”) Prosdocimo in an illegal drug operation in Pittsburgh and that Sacco was employed by Prosdocimo as one of his dealers. Ill feelings appeared to develop between Prosdocimo and Sacco due to Sacco’s apparent financial indebtedness to Prosdocimo. As a result, Prosdocimo stopped utilizing Sacco as a drug dealer. These ill feelings continued to mount between the parties. Subsequently, the record indicates that Sacco became a police informant against Prosdocimo. The Commonwealth’s theory was that on becoming aware of this, a plot was conceived by the Appellant, Prosdocimo and Gabler to kill Sacco. As part of this conspiracy, the Appellant was to receive Sacco’s drug territory. In furtherance of the plot, Sacco was to be lured to the scene of the actual shooting by a promise of a drug delivery. The record clearly indicates that the Appellant denied any involvement either as to the conspiracy or as to the actual murder. Contra, Gabler, one of the admitted conspirators, candidly conceded shooting Sacco. Gabler steadfastly denied any involvement of the Appellant.</p>

Some of these occurred during the cross-examination of Charles Bonasorte, a defense witness. Bonasorte, a bar owner, was called to contradict testimony that the alleged conspirators in the Sacco murder had held a meeting in his bar. The prosecutor opened his cross-examination by asking Bonasorte, “How’s the drug business?”. [N.T.

We used that as a basis to find reversible error. In the Appellant’s case, repeated instances of misconduct permeated the entire proceeding so as to effectively deny him a fair trial. We also held in <em>Collins </em>that the prosecution has the burden to establish that its misconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden is not met in the instant case, in view of the repeated prejudicial remarks.</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.4",630,[248,825,1165,965]]]'>Appellant alleges various instances of ineffectiveness on the part of trial counsel. The only ones which need be discussed here are those pertaining to prosecutorial misconduct. Defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s admonition to Bonasorte to look the jury in the eye, his reference in closing to Gabler nailing the Commonwealth to the wall, or his suggestion that the defense used its right of discovery to fabricate a story. There is no ineffectiveness if counsel’s decisions have a reasonable basis designed to effectuate the client’s interests, <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a> (1967).

In the instant case, we find that the remarks of the prosecutor referred to <em>supra </em>were improper. They were part of a pattern of misconduct to which objections should have been made. We find that counsel was ineffective in not doing so.</p>

Further, the prosecutor’s expression, “That’s a lie,” made to Bonasorte during a portion of the cross-examination, was shown by the record to have been issued in an interrogatory manner, rather than in a declaratory fashion; thus, it did not constitute a seriously prejudicial expression of opinion as to the witness’ veracity. Similarly, the prosecutor’s comment that Bonasorte should look the jurors in the eye, because the jurors were staring at him, was not improper, under the circumstances, for the record reveals that the <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>comment was made in response to Bonasorte’s request, “I want to look at the jury.”</p>

The prosecutor merely introduced evidence that one of the defense witnesses, Rossi, who had known appellant for 20 years, had been in prison for various periods during those 20 years. The mere fact that appellant knew someone who had been imprisoned is not evidence that appellant too had served time, and it is unreasonable to assume that only persons with records of criminal convictions could be acquainted with individuals who have served time in prison.</p>

Kellington stated that he was afraid to warn Sacco because of possible retribution from appellant, whom Kellington described as being a “coldblooded killer”. Kellington was, by this reference, merely explaining the basis for his fear, and without this reference Kellington’s explanation of the basis for his actions would have been an inadequate one. In closing argument, the prosecutor did not express an opinion that appellant was a “coldblooded killer,” but rather merely quoted testimony that had already been presented to the jury, which involved a relevant issue.</p>

Since the record shows that the threat was in fact made, appellant was not unfairly prejudiced by the comment. Finally, the prosecutor’s comment upon defense witness Gabler’s testimony, whereby the prosecutor said, “He is the man who nailed the Commonwealth to the wall. Don’t let him do it,” was improper, but not sufficiently prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.</p>
