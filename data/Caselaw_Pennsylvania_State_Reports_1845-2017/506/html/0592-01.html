Curiously, despite this seemingly inordinate amount of litigation, facts remain in dispute. Resolution of most of the issues presented hinges on ascertainment of the basic amounts of money involved and computations based upon those amounts. As will be seen <em>infra, </em>nearly every dollar amount in the case is still disputed. Indeed, the record is devoid of testimony and stipulations regarding the figures in issue. All of this leads us to question the quality of the advocacy below. Because resolution of the issues depends upon determination of the exact dollar figures, remand is inescapable. Nevertheless, for the sake of judicial economy, we will review the legal issues, using where we can the figures provided by the parties for illustrative purposes only. In addition, the evolution of the orders entered below is so complicated and fraught with misapprehensions and misapplications of the pertinent statutes that we will not even attempt to summarize here all the differences in the various orders. To do so would surely mire the reader in confusion and contempt for the appellate process. Applicable accounts of the evolution of the issues will, thus, be reserved for the discussion of those issues.</p>

Maas and his employer, Rollins Outdoor Advertising, appellant herein, entered into a compensation agreement that Maas would receive compensation in the amount of $52.50 per week.

Subsequently, on December 24, 1973, in an action against the third-party tortfeasors, Maas received a settlement of $67,000 for injuries sustained in the work-related accident.

In February of 1975, appellants filed a termination petition alleging that Maas was no longer totally disabled as of January 29, 1974, and that Maas had received a substantial third-party settlement as a result of the accident causing his disability. Maas then employed his original counsel, Mr. McDevitt, who successfully defended the termination petition.</p>

When the employer discharged the employe without cause, this Court refused to award the employe damages in assumpsit. The employe argued that the contract should be enforced on the ground the statutory prohibition was enacted for the employe’s sole benefit.

They recover $40,999.80 in either case. This argument begs the question. Firstly, and most importantly, it ignores the basic issue of the right of an employer to avoid an illegal bargain, a right which should have been enforced in the first instance by the referee years ago. Secondly, it ignores the value to an employer of receipt of the entire subrogation amount in a lump sum at the earliest possible time.

Confusion over this award arose due, no doubt, in part to the fact that claimant Maas was not actually receiving any payments at that time, as the parties were then in the grace period. In other words, while Maas’ entitlement to disability compensation had not ceased, the actual payment of compensation was temporarily suspended. Thus, appellants were not actually making any payments and when the referee ordered the attorney’s fee be charged to Maas but paid by appellants, a patent ambiguity existed as to which party actually bore the expense. As the award of attorney’s fees is in the discretion of the referee, on remand the referee <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>will have to clarify who is charged with the liability for payment of Mr. McDevitt’s fee. If the fee is the legal responsibility of appellants, then they should be required to pay $10.50 per week for every week that Maas’ disability continues. If, however, Maas is required to pay Mr. McDevitt’s fee, then the $10.50 per week can be paid out of the $17.62 Maas is entitled to recoup during the grace period for his attorney’s fee in the third-party action. This would leave $10.50 for Mr. McDevitt, and $7.12 for Maas. After the grace period, Maas would receive $42.00 per week, and attorney McDevitt would receive $10.50 per week.</p>

We <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>disagree. When appellants took their second appeal to the Board, notification of that appeal was sent, by the Board, to all parties in interest and their counsel. That notification contained the following provision: "Kindly advise whether you desire hearing to be: (a) On the record without argument, (b) On brief to be submitted without argument, (c) On Brief and Oral argument." Maas filed a brief; however, as no formal reply to this notification appears of record, appellants were apparently free to proceed on the record they had already made which clearly spelled out their position that, if the subrogation settlement agreement were illegal, then they should be entitled to be subrogated to the full amount of compensation paid to the date of the third-party settlement.</p>
