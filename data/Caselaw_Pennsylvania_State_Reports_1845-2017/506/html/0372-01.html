This power does not depend upon a physical entry onto the property.

There were two other writings received by appellee or appellee’s attorney which provide additional written notice of appellants’ intent to retake the subject premises. First, a letter dated December 7, 1979 from appellants' attorney to Jackson M. Sigmon, Esquire, who assumed representation of the appellee when Judge Van Antwerpen became a member of the judiciary. Second, a letter dated October 29, 1980 directed to the Bethlehem Township Board of Commissioners which set forth the appellants’ claim in the language of the deed. Both of these letters are part of the record in this case.</p>

Thus such an estate does not end automatically and by expiration as does an estate subject to a special limitation. On the contrary, it is cut short, or divested, if, but only if, the person having the power chooses to exercise it. This option to terminate an estate upon breach of a condition subsequent is referred to in this Restatement as a “power of termination."</p>

In the first place, the interest of the person in whose favor the condition exists is not a "right" as that word is defined in § 1 [of this Restatement]. It is a "power” as that word is defined in § 3 [of this Restatement]. In the second place, under modern law, <em>an entry is normally not necessary in order to terminate the interest subject to the condition. </em>Even if the instrument creating the condition expressly reserves to the conveyor a "power to enter and to terminate” the estate created, <em>no entry is essential. </em>The interest subject to such a power is terminated by any appropriate manifestation, upon the part of the person in whose favor the condition exists, of his intent thereby to terminate the interest in question [emphasis supplied].</blockquote>

The appellants also argued that their actual physical possession and use of the subject property as part of their farm since 1976 and appellee’s knowledge of appellants’ possession and use was notice sufficient to satisfy the requirement of notice set forth in the reverter clause. Since the trial court found that written notice was given, and we find that the lower court finding was supported by adequate evidence, it is unnecessary to consider and decide the question of whether appellee’s knowledge (actual notice) of appellants’ physical possession and use of the premises satisfied the notice requirement.</p>

I do not quarrel either with the conclusion that the wrongful re-entry did not extinguish the “power to terminate” or that the letter of September 5, 1979 satisfied the written notice required by the reverter clause under the August 8, 1914 deed. However, since this lawsuit was instituted on May 19, 1980, a year of nonuse or abandonment had not followed that notice. Clearly, the township is entitled to some period of time to elect to use the land for “railroad purposes.”</p>
