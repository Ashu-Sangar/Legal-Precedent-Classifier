It was for that reason, obviously, that the lower court originally vacated the automatic supersede-as, and it was intervenors (petitioners below) who were effectively granted a stay. Therefore, we evaluate the lower courts’ decisions from the perspective of the inter<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>venors, and for the following reasons, we find no error in their decision. First, intervenors have made the requisite showing that they are entitled to a pre-transfer hearing. Secondly, if the Department is permitted to proceed with their proposed transfers, the patients will suffer the irreparable injury of having been permanently uprooted from their current placement without having the opportunity to challenge the appropriateness of their new placement. Thirdly, although there may be some added financial burden placed on the Department in continuing to maintain the Woodhaven facility, that burden, when weighed against the potential damage to the individuals, is not substantial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Finally, we see no adverse effect on the interests of the public at large, especially when weighed against the potential for harm to these patients.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

This latter challenge is a predicate for intervenor’s argument that due process requires a hearing before a patient may be transferred from a less restrictive placement to a more restrictive placement. <em>See Eubanks v.

The first is simply that any harm which accrues to the Department is largely self created, in that better planning could have prevented many of the present problems. Secondly, the Department admitted that the money originally budgeted for Woodhaven was <em>not </em>reallocated to other mental health uses but, somewhat surprisingly, was returned to the Commonwealth general fund. Thus, at the time Judge DiBona vacated the supersede-as, continuing to operate Woodhaven until hearings were held would not have strained the Department’s budget in a greater manner than was originally provided for.</p>

The above analysis can be applied from the alternative perspective, i.e. the Department’s request for a stay, and the result would be the same in that the Department has failed to make a "strong showing that they can prevail on the merits of their argument,” or that they will suffer "irreparable injury.”</p>

Therein respondent argued that intervenor’s petition to amend the commitment orders was in the nature of a writ of habeas corpus, and therefore the court had jurisdiction under Section 426 of the Mental Health/Mental Retardation Act, 50 P.S. Section 4426. It is clear that the intervenors, petitioners below, did not consider their petition as a petition for habeas corpus, nor was it considered by the hearing judge as such. In light of our decision above we see no need to answer the theoretical question as to whether a petition to amend commitment orders is tantamount to a petition for habeas corpus, especially on the record that was developed below.</p>

Of course, the effect of any such order on individuals who have been individually committed may. be subject to review on due process grounds. Such individual, particularized review may be alternately available in the forum which entered the commitment order, here Philadelphia Common Pleas. The type of review required in Common Pleas would, however, be totally inappropriate for a class action because the needs of each individual patient are discrete and particular. In the old style chancellors would have said the equitable remedy of class action is unavailable because the issues are multifarious. The Defender’s Association of Philadelphia’s attempt to bring a class action on behalf of all the patients at Woodhaven should be dismissed or transferred because judicial review of the Department of Public Welfare’s decision to close the facility will focus on the impact of the closing on the patients as a group, and not as individuals. Consequently, this case belongs in' Commonwealth Court.</p>
