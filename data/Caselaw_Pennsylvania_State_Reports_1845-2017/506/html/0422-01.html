The latter situation is clearly distinguishable from one in which the employer enters into an agreement with knowledge of its illegality. The. record fails to establish that the three voting members other than. Mr. Hartz were aware of his membership in Local 401. Thus it cannot be said that the ratification vote represented an acquiescence in the alleged conflict of interest.

Section 1801(a) not only prohibits participation by employer representatives with interests in conflict with those of the employer but goes further by requiring the disqualification of negotiators for the public employer solely on the basis of affiliation, however tenuous, with the employee bargaining unit.

We agree with that interpretation. A public employer’s failure to avail itself of the remedy of removal should not work to the detriment of the collective bargaining process. If the public employer chooses a negotiator barred from participation under section 1801(a) and fails to ascertain the existence of a legislatively proscribed conflict during the course of the bargaining proceedings, it should not be heard to complain that its former negotiator should not be permitted to vote as a public official on the ratification of the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>ultimate agreement.

Raudenbush, </em><a href="/pa/249/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="249 Pa. 86" data-case-ids="1013569" data-case-paths="/pa/249/0086-01">249 Pa. 86</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=94%20A.%20555" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="94 A. 555">94 A. 555</a> (1915). We find nothing in the instant record which would establish such an interest on the part of Mr. Hartz. It has not been shown that Mr. Hartz’s membership in Local 401 created any tangible interest in the ratification of the instant agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It would strain credulity to maintain that Mr. Hartz, a private sector <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>employee, could benefit from the terms and conditions of employment established for Borough police officers merely because he was a member of the local which represented them in the contract negotiations. Thus we conclude that it was not improper for Mr. Hartz to vote to ratify the police officers’ agreement. That agreement was therefore properly ratified and binding upon the Borough and its non-compliance was properly determined by the Board to be an unfair labor practice.</p>

Local 401 was certified as the exclusive bargaining representative of the Borough’s non-professional employees on January 7, 1982. The record indicates that Local 401 was not so certified as to the police officers’ unit during the time period material herein. The Board’s hearing examiner stated for the record, however, that Act III does not require such certification. That determination has not been challenged herein.</p>

The record reflects only that one participating council member was aware during negotiations that Mr. Hartz was a member of the Teamsters Union. Thus it is questionable whether the record would support a finding that the employer knew of the conflict at the time of ratification.</p>
