Sections 1535(c), 1537 <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and 1551 all reflect an intention to carefully limit the period in which an operator is to be exposed to sanctions as a result of a violation under the Code. Both sections 1535(c) and 1551 provide for the date of conviction as being the operative event from which the six-month time period should run. Reading the sections together, the Department, if it is to assess points, for the violation, must do so within six (6) months. If thd assessment is to result in further action such as a suspension, then both the assessment and the notification of the suspension must be within that period. Had the legislature intended otherwise, it would have clearly expressed that direction by using the date of the assignment of points rather than the date of conviction in section 1551.</p>

It is difficult to accept appellee’s contention that such a time lag is justified considering the state of automation. The citation for speeding in this case was issued on March 5, 1980, and the conviction occurred on March 24, 1980. The assessment of three points was not made until July 21, 1980.

The basis for this conclusion was the Commonwealth Court’s belief that section 1535(c) conferred a right in the department to have up to six months from the date of a conviction to assign the points.</p>
