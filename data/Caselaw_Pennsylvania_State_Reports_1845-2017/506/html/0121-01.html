Thus, the legislature has empowered the Department to make and enforce regulations binding upon the county institution districts. It does not follow that rules and regulations so promulgated are binding upon a court of law vested with a separate, concurrent and broad power, under Section 6351 of the Juvenile Act, <em>supra. </em>In ordering a disposition under Section 6351, the court acts not in the role of adjudicator reviewing the action of an administrative agency, in which case, the regulations promulgated to bind that agency could not be ignored; rather the court acts pursuant to a separate discretionary role with the purpose of meeting the child’s best interests.</p>

It does not follow from this, as CYS has argued, that a court is without the authority to order the county institution district to fund non-appro ved placements.

If this were to be the result, then in the case in which expedient transfer of custody is sought, the possibility of delivery to an individual and that individual’s home under subsection (i) would not be available to the court for the transfer could be only to an agency, public or private, already authorized by law to receive and care for the child. Such a foreclosure of the option of transfer to an individual cannot have been intended by the legislature for it would be in derogation of the best interests of the child, who is best served by the availability of a full panoply of options, including transfer to the custody of an individual and home found by the court to be qualified. A home placement in which a dependent child will presumably live in a supportive family is preferable to institutional facility care.</p>
