Dr. Freeman explained that given appellee’s marked emotional instability, with little tolerance for frustration and limited capacity for mature judgment, the child’s welfare was at stake and <em>the chance of psychological damage was great </em>Dr. Freeman concluded that “she was in no position at this time to assume the responsibility of an infant.”</p>

    <p id="b566-6" data-blocks='[["BL_566.6",566,[266,1065,1165,1091]]]'>This court cannot agree with such a restrictive reading.

      <em>Sarver Adoption Case, </em><a href="/pa/444/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="444 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1938646" data-case-paths="/pa/444/0507-01">444 Pa. 507</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20A.2d%20890" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="281 A.2d 890">281 A.2d 890</a> (1971). However, along with the enactment of the Adoption Act came a concomitant expansion of the courts’ power to terminate parental rights, addressing a number of additional circumstances. <em>Jones Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/449/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="449 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="1945624" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0543-01">449 Pa. 543</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20117" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="297 A.2d 117">297 A.2d 117</a> (1972). The legislature in adopting the Adoption Act concluded that a parent who is incapable of performing parental duties is just as parentally unfit as one who refuses to perform the duties. <em>In re William L., </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. 322</a>, 345, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d 1228</a>, 1239 (1978). Instantly, appellee has demonstrated that she would be incapable of meeting the child’s essential needs. The state is therefore permitted to intervene to protect the “physical or mental well being” of the child. Although we are faced with a situation where the needs of the parent in keeping the child conflict with the interest of the child, the “legislature has mandated that the interests of the weaker party, the child, should prevail.” <em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">477 Pa. at 339</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0322-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="477 Pa. 322" data-case-ids="1738290" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0322-01">383 A.2d at 1236</a>.</p>

We cannot agree. Neither the language of the Act, nor our case law, supports appellee’s position that Section 2511(a)(2) requires a showing that a putative parent have an opportunity to inflict substantial physical or mental harm upon a child before the state can intervene. Rather, a more appropriate reading of the statute is that when a parent has demonstrated a continued inability to conduct his or her life in a fashion that would provide a safe environment for a child, whether that child is living with the parent or not, and the behavior of the parent is irremediable as supported by clear and competent evidence, the termination of parental rights is justified.</p>

The 1970 comment following 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511 notes that clause (2) suggested by Section 19(c) of the Revised Uniform Juvenile Act Court Act (1969), differs from abandonment in that -it centers judicial inquiry upon the welfare of the child rather than the fault of the parent.</p>

    <p id="b567-8" data-blocks='[["BL_567.9",567,[135,1564,1162,204]]]'>I dissent.. The evidence adduced in the instant case was insufficient, within the factual context presented, to support termination of appellee’s parental rights under 23 Pa.C.S.A. § 2511(a)(2).</p>
    <p id="b567-9" data-blocks='[["BL_567.10",567,[133,1791,1162,585]],["BL_568.1",568,[275,308,1163,464]]]'>Appellee has never had an opportunity to demonstrate whether she would render proper parental care since the child in question was voluntarily surrendered to an intermediary (not an agency) for placement through a “private” adoption before appellee was even discharged from the hospital after giving birth to the child. The incidents relied upon by the Orphans’ Court in support of its termination order occurred, to a large extent, at least one year prior to the child’s birth and two years prior to the termination hearing. Much of the testimony in this case was predictive in nature, focusing upon expert opinions as to whether <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>appellee would <em>likely </em>fulfill the duties of a parent, although, under the factual circumstances presented, appellee had no <em>opportunity </em>to do so. Expert opinions which purport to predict matters so complex as the future course of an individual’s behavior often do not have a high degree of reliability, and, where there is not sufficient additional evidence of parental incapacity pertaining to the relevant time period, it cannot be said that clear and convincing evidence of parental incapacity has been offered.</p>
    <p id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[271,790,1164,674]]]'>Such a conclusion does not, however, mean that appellee should be given custody of her child, for the determination of custody, which is governed solely by the best interests of the child, is an entirely separate issue from that of whether to terminate parental rights. A decision not to terminate parental rights in this case would not mean that the child must be allowed to suffer actual harm, in the custody of appellee, as a prerequisite to strengthening the case in favor of terminating parental rights in a future proceeding. A number of alternatives are available to safeguard the interests of the child, including foster care, supervision of appellee’s household, and assistance to appellee in learning necessary parenting skills.</p>
