During appellees’ second year of teaching, on April 30, 1981, the district decided not to renew their contracts, due to a significant decline in student enrollment in the district.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The district’s decision was to take effect on June 12, 1981, which was to be the last day of appellees’ contracts for that year.</p>

Thus, appellees conclude, they should have retained their teaching positions and other employees (who had less seniority but who were tenured because of their service in another school district) should have been furloughed instead.</p>

The school district is not required to tender a “regular contract of employment” to a non-tenured employee at any time before the “end of two years of service.” If the district decides not to offer such a “regular contract” to the non-tenured employee, it may do so by giving the required written statement to the employee at “the end” of the two year period. 24 P.S. § 11-1108(c). It is apparent, therefore, that the legislature intended to establish a full two year period as the line of demarcation between tenured and non-tenured employees. Thus, when a district’s decision not to renew a non-tenured employee’s contract is to take effect at any time up to <em>and including the last day </em>of the second year, that employee remains non-tenured.

The court held that where a reduction of staff is necessary, the seniority rights of professional employees prevail in selecting those to be suspended unless there is a substantial difference in ratings. Temporary professional employees have no right of retention on the basis of seniority or ratings against professional employees or among themselves. Appellees’ rights will be governed accordingly.</p>

Rather than an affirmative rating of satisfactory being required, the absence of an unsatisfactory rating is sufficient, <em>Elias v.

Appellant argues that Appellees should be treated as temporary professional employees, as they had not acquired professional employee status at the time of the May 1, 1981 notice that they would not be retained. Appellees argue that they should be treated as professional employees, as they acquired such status prior to the school year during which the staff reduction was to take effect. I would hold to the latter view. Appellees acquired professional employee status at the end of the 1980-81 school year, having taught for two years without receiving unsatisfactory ratings. That status will determine their rights in regard to any suspension of employees due to staff reduction that takes effect after that time. I would hold that the date, the suspension goes into effect governs, rather than the date of notice of suspension. I would not permit Appellant to diminish Appellees’ rights by giving early notice of suspension. Such result would be contrary to law.</p>
