This finding was based on the court’s determination that no rational basis existed for the distinction between club licenses, which can be held in safekeeping for a maximum of two years regardless of circumstances, and non-club licenses, which can be held in safekeeping indefinitely so long as the licensee can demonstrate to the Board that reactivation of the license is prevented by circumstances beyond his control. Having determined that § 4-474 was unconstitutional, the court remanded the case to the Board for a determination of whether the Appellee’s failure to reactivate the license was caused by circumstances beyond its control.

Accordingly, it was error for the lower court to equate the absence of a statement of the reasons supporting the legislative act with the absence of any rational reason for the legislation.

Within this scheme, the General Assembly has distinguished club licenses from other licenses in a number of ways, e.g. clubs are permitted to make sales after 2:00 a.m. and to make sales on Sunday without a special permit, 47 P.S. § 4-406; club licenses do not count against the quota of licenses which may be awarded in a municipality, 47 P.S. §§ 744-1002 and 744-1003; and the holder of a club license must be a nonprofit corporation or association, 47 P.S. § 1-102.</p>

The sale of liquor is secondary to, indeed in facilitation of, these purposes. The same is not true of commercial establishments whose main purpose is the sale of liquor for profit. Whereas the purposes of a club can be achieved despite the revocation of a liquor license, the purposes of a commercial establishment cannot. It is thus appropriate to give the latter an opportunity to show “circumstances beyond its control” before revoking of the license privilege. More importantly, it is not inappropriate to “presume” in the case of a club which has not been able to find a location for two years either that it can no longer fulfill its main purposes as a club or that it can fulfill those purposes even in the absence of a liquor license.</p>
