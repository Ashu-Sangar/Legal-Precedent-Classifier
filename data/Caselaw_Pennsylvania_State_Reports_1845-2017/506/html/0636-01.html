This is a direct appeal from the Commonwealth Court’s order sustaining Appellees’ preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and dismissing Appellant’s amended complaint. 78 Pa.Cmwlth. 373, <a href="/citations/?q=467%20A.2d%20899" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="467 A.2d 899">467 A.2d 899</a>.

On March 4, 1977, an operation to correct a facial spasm was performed on Eugene Issermoyer at the Hospital Center. Issermoyer failed to recover as anticipated from a general anesthesia which had been administered, and is now paralyzed in both legs and his left arm. In 1978, a complaint was brought in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania before the Arbitration Panels for Health Care by Issermoyer and his wife for injuries sustained as a result of the operation. The Hospital Center and two of its staff physicians, the anesthesiologist and neurosurgeon involved in the operation, were among those named as defendants. After extensive discovery and negotiations, the action was settled for $1,503,935 on behalf of the Fund and the staff physicians. Each of the physicians contributed $100,000 to the settlement by their basic coverage insurance carrier, the Argonaut Insurance Company. The Fund provided the <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>difference.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Although the Issermoyers executed releases in favor of all defendants as part of the settlement, the Hospital Center and its insurance carrier, Hartford, opposed, and failed to contribute to, the settlement.</p>
    <p id="b681-4" data-blocks='[["BL_681.4",681,[164,517,1162,950]]]'>The first count of the complaint alleges that the Hospital Center was negligent, inter, alia, in failing to properly supervise its physicians and in failing to diagnose relevant factors in the patient’s condition, and that its conduct was a substantial contributing factor to Issermoyer’s paralysis. It is asserted that the Fund was secondarily liable to Issermoyer and that it acquired the defendant physicians’ right of contribution as joint tortfeasors against the Hospital Center and Hartford through indemnity and equitable subrogation. It is further alleged that the Hospital Center and Hartford failed to make a good faith investigation and determination of the Hospital Center’s exposure to liability, and of the resulting exposure of the Fund to excess liability. The Appellee’s preliminary objections asserted that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, because the Fund lacked statutory authority to pursue the claim. This reasoning was adopted by the Commonwealth Court.</p>

In <em>Demarco v. Comm., Department of Health, </em>40 Pa.Cmwlth. 248, <a href="/citations/?q=397%20A.2d%2061" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="397 A.2d 61">397 A.2d 61</a> (1979), the Commonwealth Court held that the Secretary of Health lacked the authority to issue orders requiring individuals to desist from violating the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>Cosmetic Act. The Secretary of Health had asserted that the general description of his duties to protect the health of the citizens of Pennsylvania, which was contained in the Act, authorized him to enter the orders. The Commonwealth Court concluded that the general description did not necessarily imply the independent power to command individuals to desist; rather, the Legislature restricted his authority to that of seeking injunctive relief in the courts.</p>
    <p id="b683-4" data-blocks='[["BL_683.4",683,[162,713,1162,580]]]'>The rationale behind these cases restricting the powers of an administrative agency is to insure that the agency does not exceed the limitations which have been established by the Legislature for the agency’s exercise of its <em>own </em>authority. The same reasoning does not support a limitation on the ability of an agency to enforce its rights or seek a remedy in a judicial forum. In the latter situation, an administrative agency does not attempt to independently exercise a power which is beyond that granted by the Legislature. Rather, it tries to act in furtherance of the powers and duties specifically established by law.</p>

Because the Act does not expressly grant authority to the Fund to maintain the action, the Commonwealth Court erroneously held that no such authority existed. In arriving at its conclusion, the Court focused upon two sections of the Act, § 605 [the Fund has right to full indemnity, including defense costs, where claim for recovery made after four years due to willful concealment by health care provider or insurer] and § 702(c) [basic coverage insurance carrier’s failure to notify the director of any case where it is reasonably believed the claim’s value exceeds its coverage shall make it responsible for payment of the award or verdict where the fund is prejudiced by such failure]. The Court interpreted this as indicative of a legislative intent to preclude the fund from maintaining any other type of action. The Court’s result, however, was predetermined by its initial premise that <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>the rule of law limiting an administrative agency’s authority to that clearly conferred by the Legislature was applicable to this action.
