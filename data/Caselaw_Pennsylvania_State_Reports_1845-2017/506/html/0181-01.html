A jury sitting in the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County returned a verdict for Ferrick in the amount of $30,500. Senger’s post trial motion for a new trial was granted by the court en banc on the grounds that the verdict slip was irreconcilably inconsistent and that the court erred in not charging the jury on the law of gratuitous and mutual bénefit bailment, but only on the law of ordinary negligence. Superior Court reversed the grant of a new trial, but ordered a remittitur of 20% of the verdict, holding as a matter of law that no bailment was created in this case, and therefore no instruction on bailment was required; and also that a verdict will be molded when the jury’s intent is clear, as it was, according to Superior Court, in this case, but there was some confusion in the jury’s filling out of forms.</p>

Ferrick’s truck, normally used for this purpose, was out of service at the time. Senger agreed to move the high loader for Ferrick, and sent its truck, operated by Senger’s son, to the site where the high loader was located. Ferrick’s employee drove the high loader onto the truck and both Ferrick and the younger Senger secured the high loader to the trailer of the truck. Ferrick’s foreman then sent Ferrick’s truck driver with young Senger to show him where the high loader should be delivered. Testimony conflicted as to whether Ferrick’s driver, riding in the cab with Senger, gave Senger directions on how to go: Senger testified that Ferrick’s man told him <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>to drive down State Street in Erie; Ferrick’s employee testified that he did not give these directions, but told Senger to go by way of another route which would have avoided State Street. Senger went down State Street, and while passing under a railroad bridge which crossed overhead, damaged the high loader, which was slightly too high to clear the bridge.</p>

    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[154,424,1164,908]]]'>We disagree that the jury’s intent was clear. Superior Court accepts Ferrick’s argument that the jury made its basic findings of negligence, contributory negligence and proximate cause in the first three questions, which establish that Senger was negligent, its negligence was a proximate cause of the accident, and that Ferrick was contributorily negligent. Ferrick would have it that all questions of negligence and causation are settled as of the answer to question 3. There is, of course, no reason why this should be so. Questions 4 and 5 do exist, and unless they are to be regarded as mere surplusage, they set up an irreconcilable inconsistency between the finding in 4 that Ferrick’s negligence was not a proximate cause of the injury and the finding in' 5 that Ferrick’s proximate negligence was 20%. This type of inconsistency, which is not uncommon, demonstrates what some would see as the impracticability of interrogatories to the jury.</p>

Although the verdict is irreconcilably inconsistent, since it simultaneously requires Senger to pay both 100% and 80% of the damages, and although such inconsistency would normally require a new trial, where the party injured by this inconsistency, the plaintiff, is willing to take the lesser of the two sums, the court may properly order a remittitur. This is so because the verdict conclusively establishes both Senger’s negligence and the causal nature of that negligence. Only the proximate causation of Ferrick’s contributory negligence is at issue. If, therefore, a remittitur were to be ordered based upon Ferrick’s agreement to accept the lesser of the two possible verdicts, Senger would not be injured, and would in fa&amp;t benefit from paying the lesser of the two verdicts. Since Ferrick did agree to a remittitur in the amount of 20% of the award, the case was properly resolved as to this issue by ordering the remittitur. <em>See Osterling v. Carpenter, </em><a href="/pa/230/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="230 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="8845628" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0153-01">230 Pa. 153</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.%20405" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="79 A. 405">79 A. </a><a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a><a href="/citations/?q=79%20A.%20405" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="79 A. 405">405</a> (1911) (remittitur ordered so long as remittee agrees to the reduced amount; otherwise a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded).

There was also evidence that the parties had hauled equipment for each other on prior occasions. Senger argues that he was a gratuitous bailee and as such may be held to only a slight degree of care for the property which was bailed. Ferrick argues that there was evidence contrary to the gratuitous bailment theory and that it was within the court’s discretion as to whether the issue should have been submitted to the jury. Secondly, Ferrick contends that even if Senger were a gratuitous bailee, its duty of care is that of ordinary care, on which the court instructed the jury, and that no error was committed.</p>

Bernard, </em>2 Ld.Raym. 909, in the year 1703. “Where a man takes goods into his custody to keep for the use of the bailor,” it was said by Holdt, C.J., in that case, “he is not answerable if they are stole without any fault in him, neither will a common neglect make him chargeable, but he must be guilty of some gross neglect.” The principles which govern the relations between bailors and bailees are succinctly stated in Story on Bailments, sect. 23. “When the bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailor, the law requires only <em>slight </em>diligence on the part of the bailee, and of course makes him answerable only for <em>gross </em>neglect. When the bailment is for the sole benefit of the bailee, the law requires <em>great </em>diligence on the part of the bailee, and makes him responsible for <em>slight </em>ne<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>gleet. When the bailment is reciprocally beneficial to both parties, the law requires <em>ordinary </em>diligence on the part of the bailee, and makes him responsible for <em>ordinary </em>neglect.” In <em>Thompkins v. Saltmarsh, </em>14 S. &amp; R. 275, Duncan, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said: “Where one undertakes to perform a gratuitous act, from which he is to receive no benefit, and the benefit is to accrue solely to the bailor, the bailee is liable only for gross negligence____ It is that omission of care which even the most inattentive and thoughtless men take of their own concerns____ The bailee without reward is not bound to ordinary diligence, is not responsible for that care which every attentive and diligent person takes of his own goods, but only for that care which the most inattentive take.”</blockquote>

Thus, Ferrick’s view notwithstanding, the law of Pennsylvania is, and for <em>at least </em>100 years, has been that different types of bailment impose upon the bailee different standards of care. The reason for the existence of these standards of care, we suggest, is that <em>basic fairness </em>is repelled by the notion that a bailee who acts for the bailor’s benefit, but not his own, should be sued and held to the same standard of care as if he were acting for a fee, when some misfortune befalls the bailed goods.</p>

A rule was formulated by early decisions that where the bailment is for the exclusive benefit of the bailee, hie is bound to use great care and is liable for slight negligence; where the bailment is for the mutual benefit of the bailor and bailee, the latter must use ordinary care and is liable for ordinary negligence; where the bailment benefits the bailor only, the bailee need use only slight care and is liable only for gross negligence.</blockquote>

And the only persons who, according to him, are liable only for gross negligence are those who accept gratuitous deposits. In accordance with the latter rule, the court of King’s Bench agreed, in 1738, that in “case of a simple depositum without reward the law raises only a promise not grossly to neglect or abuse the deposit."</blockquote>

For though he admits that "a bailee of common honesty, if he also have common prudence, would not be more negligent than ordinary in keeping the thing bailed,” yet he thinks that one who takes charge of goods without reward ought not to be required to trouble himself further than to act in good faith, nor would many be willing to do so; while, on the other hand, one who borrows gratis should assume the burden with the benefit, and few would lend without reward except on condition that the borrower use great care.</blockquote>
