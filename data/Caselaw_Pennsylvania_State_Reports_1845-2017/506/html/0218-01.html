Nevin White, his son-in-law, Roy A. Wingate, and Juniata Valley Bank (Bank) as Trustees. The purpose of the trust is to provide income to the minor beneficiaries until such time as each beneficiary reaches twenty-five years of age.

On June 25, 1980, the Bank and Wingate filed a Petition to Resign as Trustees. In their Petition, they indicated that a dispute arose between Raymond White and themselves regarding investment and management of certain timber and coal resources of the trust. As a result of the actions of the Bank and Wingate, one of the trust beneficiaries filed a Petition to Remove Raymond White as a Trustee. Hear<a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>ings on both Petitions were held on August 18 and 20, 1980. As the result of these hearings, the lower court entered an order granting the Bank’s Petition to Resign and denying the beneficiaries’ Petition to Remove Raymond White. Five of the trust beneficiaries, Kenneth K. King, Sarah King, Thomas F.B. King, John King and Mary King, appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed, concluding that White’s past speculative investment proposals were indicative of his future behavior, and thus his continuation as a Trustee would be detrimental to the trust. Furthermore, the Superior Court held that <em>“a </em>corporate fiduciary must show greater cause for resignation that (sic) an individual.” <a href="/pa-super/321/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="321 Pa.

Specifically, the beneficiaries claim that White’s proposals of investing in canned foods, wheat, corn, oats, livestock, Swiss francs and German marks were so speculative as to cause harm to the trust. The Superior Court agreed with this allegation and used these proposals as a basis for removing White. However, in addition to the fact that these proposals were not and could not be implemented by White alone, White testified that he did not consider these investments as poor or risky.</p>
    <p id="b265-8" data-blocks='[["BL_265.8",265,[134,1269,1166,747]]]'>In <em>Croessant Estate, supra, </em>we refused to remove a trustee who had neglected the administration of a trust but promised to actively participate in the future. There we held that the removal of a trustee is a drastic remedy, and the need for such action must be clear. We also indicated that such action must be viewed in conjunction with the settlor’s expressed confidence in the trustee, evinced by the trustee’s appointment. In a case where a settlor appoints a particular trustee, removal should only occur when required to protect the trust property. <em>Holmes Trust, </em><a href="/pa/392/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="392 Pa. 17" data-case-ids="8844769" data-case-paths="/pa/392/0017-01">392 Pa. 17</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.2d%20548" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="139 A.2d 548">139 A.2d 548</a> (1958). <em>(See also, In Re Crawford’s Estate, supra, </em>in which we refused to remove a trustee appointed by the settlor but accused of being hostile to the corporate trustee and of being prone to speculative investments.)</p>

Apparently, the settlors had sufficient confidence in White to appoint him as a Trustee. Until such time as White violates some fiduciary duty, he cannot be removed. Furthermore, the fact that some of the trust beneficiaries are unhappy with White as a Trustee is of no importance. Obviously, the settlor intended that an independent party have control of the trust corpus, not the beneficiaries.

Good intentions alone are insufficient. Neither should a trustee in managing the assets of another put them at risk because such risks were one time fruitful for the trustee in his private business. If a trustee should insist, adamantly insist, upon speculative investments, he shreds the safety net and weakens the confidence reposed in him. Without impugning the intentions or integrity of the instant trustee, that is exactly what he did. The majority answers that whatever he intended or insisted upon were never implemented and therefore harmless. The majority overlooks one crucial factor; the bank or co-trustee prevented their implementation. Now, courtesy of the majority, the bank has been allowed to resign the trust, leaving Mr. Raymond <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>White and his brother, J. Nevin White, as sole trustees. The record is replete with examples of risky and sometimes bizarre investment ideas proffered by Mr. Raymond White. Perhaps such ideas were magic for him in his private affairs, and doubtless he wishes to enhance the trust; but his duties to the trust differ materially from his own fortunes. Again, without impugning integrity, the trustee, Mr. Raymond White, would have made a considerable personal profit had the bank not refused, the purchase of lumber from Mr. White.</p>
    <p id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.4",269,[140,860,1160,1298]]]'>The majority insists that until there is evidence of actual wrongdoing a trustee should not be removed. Fair enough. Certainly, however, all the trustees should be kept in place. Permitting the bank to resign under the circumstances is to dilute the intention of the testator by at least a third, perhaps, indeed, excusing the very persons most relied upon to guard the trust. The majority insists upon a salutary principle of law, that a testator should have who he will be his trustee. If more than one trustee is named however, the intention of the settlor in diversifying their backgrounds should be honored: particularly so where one is a bank, lawyer or other professional trustee appointed for their expertise. To allow one to resign, unreplaced by a similar person or institution, is to dilute the full intention of the settlor. Indeed, trustees may be driven from their post by actions they were designated to prevent or warn against. A good reason for a trustee to resign is a good reason to replace his kind. To allow a trustee to remain and another to resign, under the circumstances here, is to dissolve the full intention of the testator and leave the trust in hands not intended. As the Superior Court noted, “the bank’s presence as a trustee is clearly more beneficial to the trust than Raymond’s continuing as a trustee.” <em>In Re White, </em><a href="/pa-super/321/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="321 Pa.
