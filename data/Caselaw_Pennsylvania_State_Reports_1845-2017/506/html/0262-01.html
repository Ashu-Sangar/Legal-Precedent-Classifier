The affidavit chronicles the Agent’s entire investigation of appellees, reporting the results of his surveillance of appellees and their residence over a six-month period, as well as information obtained from police and motor vehicle records and from two confidential informants. The averments in the affidavit, the most pertinent of which will be summarized below, are presented in chronological sequence.</p>

According to the affidavit, this informant had furnished the Agent with reliable informa<a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>tion over the past two years which resulted in two drug-related arrests and one conviction. The informant alleged that “[a]n individual known as TED JONES is distributing Heroin in the Norristown area” and “deals Heroin to numerous individuals in the area.” Four such customers were identified as being Connie Powers, Kevin Kemper, Richard Zimmerman and Blain Harris. The informant also indicated that Jones and Sirchie were living together on Arch Street in Norristown, and that both were being treated for heroin addiction at a methadone clinic in Norristown.</p>

Specifically, numerous individuals were said to be entering the house, staying a few minutes and then leaving.</p>
    <p id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[274,1386,1163,359]]]'>The Agent conducted a spot surveillance of 17 Glenwood Avenue the following day. He observed two men arrive in a truck, followed soon thereafter by Jones. All three then entered the house and, after ten minutes, the two visitors left. The Agent followed them to a bar where he observed the driver “go on the nod” and exhibit “the tell tale signs of Heroin use.”</p>

Lynch was known to the Agent through police and confidential sources and personal contact as a heroin user. Four days later the Agent saw Sirchie leave 17 Glenwood Avenue and drive to a parking lot where she met briefly with a man in another car, looking around suspiciously during what the Agent interpreted as a drug sale. A subsequent check revealed that the other car was registered to Connie Campbell (a female), previously named by the informant as one of Jones’ clients.</p>

While Jones was seated in his car in the Clinic’s parking lot, two men approached him and handed him money. Jones, after looking all around, handed something to one of them. Jones and Sirchie left shortly thereafter.</p>

Moles left his car, walked over to Jones’ vehicle and handed him money. Jones “palmed” something and gave it to Moles. Jones then left the area. Within five minutes after Jones’ departure, the Agent observed Moles roll up his sleeve and use a hypodermic needle.</p>

This latter informant had provided the Agent with reliable information over the past six years which had led to the arrest and conviction of two individuals in Montgomery County for selling heroin. This informant, like the first, told the Agent that Jones was selling heroin to numerous persons in the Norristown area. The informant named six of Jones’ customers, including Blain Harris, also named by the first informant as a Jones’ client; Kevin Kemper, whose car the Agent had seen parked in front of 17 Glenwood Avenue, also named by the first informant; Ricky Lynch, whom the Agent had observed entering and leaving Jones’ house and whom the Agent knew to be a heroin user; and Charley Moles, whom the Agent had observed engage in a financial transaction with Jones and subsequently give himself an injection.</p>

The informant provided details as to Jones’ operation stating that Jones’ supplier was “a white/male from N.Y. known as Craig,” that Jones “is selling heroin in the form of N.Y. quarters for between $125 and $145 per packet” and that Harris was dealing for Jones.</p>

This result-oriented approach to our rules does not bode well for their stability. Our case law makes it abundantly clear that stale evidence may not be used to establish the probable cause necessary for the issuance of a search warrant, but rather the conclusion that probable cause exists must be based on facts which are closely related in time to the date the warrant is issued. “If the issuing officer is presented with evidence of criminal activity at some prior time, this will not support a finding of probable cause as of the date the warrant issues, unless it is also shown that the criminal activity <em>continued up to or about that time”. Commonwealth v. Tolbert, </em><a href="/pa/492/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="492 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1767197" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0576-01">492 Pa. 576</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="492 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1767197" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0576-01">424 A.2d 1342</a> (1981), and cases cited therein (emphasis in original). The reason for the prohibition against stale evidence is that “... even if the incriminating information is dated, as time passes and it becomes <em>possible </em>for the facts and circumstances to change, a redetermination of probable cause is constitutionally required.” <em>Tolbert, </em><a href="/citations/?q=492%20Pa.%20580" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="492 Pa. 580">492 Pa. 580</a>, <a href="/pa/492/0576-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="492 Pa. 576" data-case-ids="1767197" data-case-paths="/pa/492/0576-01">424 A.2d at 1344</a> (emphasis in original). The facts of the instant case are similar to those of <em>Tolbert </em>where the stale evidence, consisting of the information of an informant who at some time in the past observed a drug transaction involving that appellant, was coupled with the fifty-minute surveillance of the appellant’s house by the police the day before executing the search warrant. This surveillance, standing alone, was not sufficient to provide the probable cause necessary for the issuance of a search warrant, nor was it sufficient to revive the past, observations of the informant, and the evidence was suppressed.</p>

My reading of the affidavit of probable cause indicates that the latest evidence obtained by Agent Bordeleau from which criminal activity can be inferred was obtained on December 20, 1980, fully five months prior to the application for a search warrant. When applying the <em>Tolbert </em>standard in a determination of probable cause where some of the evidence is stale, and given the facts at hand, I find the observations of Agent Bordeleau not to be sufficiently proximate in time to the date of the warrant to establish probable cause on their own. Nor do I find the information supplied by the confidential informant as providing sufficient evidence that the criminal activity observed by Agent Bordeleau continued up to the time of the issuance of the search warrant — a condition necessary to validate the stale evidence. I would therefore affirm the finding of the Superior Court based on the well-reasoned opinion in <em>Tolbert.</em>
