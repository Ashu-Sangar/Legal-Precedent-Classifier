The employer then appealed the Board’s decision to Commonwealth Court.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Commonwealth Court held that the work stoppage initiated by the employees did constitute willful misconduct and concluded, therefore, that they were ineligible for compensation benefits under Section 402(e).</p>

During that tug-of-war each side tries to win concessions from the other while at the same time maintaining the expectation that the dispute will be resolved eventually and operations at the workplace will return to normal. Involvement in a strike, absent a prohibition contained in a valid bargaining agreement, may not properly be viewed as a disregard of standards of behavior which an employer has a right to expect.

As noted at 283, n. 5, however, workers who give notice and then strike to gain concessions from their employer are also subject to replacement as economic strikers. Thus, analysis under federal law in terms of "legal” and "illegal” strikes is not particularly helpful. Federal law also distinguishes between economic and unfair labor strikes. These distinctions are roughly analogous to those between "strike” and “lockout" as used in interpreting Section 402(d) of our Unemployment Compensation Law. Since, however, this is a willful misconduct case under Section 402(e) and not a work stoppage case under Section 402(d), the federal distinctions are not greatly material to this case.</p>

The initial acceptance of the <em>Vrotney </em>standard was based on its easy application on the administrative level and at the same time it served the basic policy concerns involved. <em>Vrotney </em>was designed to encourage the continuation of the work relationship under terms previously agreed to by the parties during that difficult period between the expiration of the old agreement and before the new terms of employment had been agreed upon. <em>Fairview School District v.

Moreover, the administrative units involved in the compensation eligibility decision would have little difficulty in resolving the simple factual question of who first departed from the terms of the expired agreement. <em>Unemployment Compensation Board of Review v.

Once we complicate that decision with requirements of ascertaining the good faith or the justification of a party altering the former terms, we create a standard infinitely more difficult to administer, without a corresponding benefit being derived for such a modification.</p>
