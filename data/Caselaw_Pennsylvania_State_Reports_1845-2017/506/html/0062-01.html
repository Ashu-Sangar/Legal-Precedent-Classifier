As the instant matter is only collaterally related to the administration and distribution of the estate and trust, the matter does not fall within the <em>mandatory </em>jurisdiction of the orphans’ court division. The instant action presents an action at law, sounding in trespass and assumpsit, and was properly commenced in the civil division. However, this fact does not mean the orphans’ court division is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over the instant controversy. Section 712(3) of the PEF Code provides that the orphans’ court division may exercise jurisdiction over “[t]he disposition of any case where there are substantial ques<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>tions concerning matters enumerated in section 711 (relating to mandatory exercise of jurisdiction through orphans’ court division in general) and also matters not enumerated in that section.” 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 712 (Supp.1984-1985). The instant action does arise out of the administration and distribution of an estate, and it raises serious questions regarding the propriety of the parties’ conduct during the estate administration. These are matters which the orphans’ court division is especially well-equipped to handle. Furthermore, any recovery against the trustee arising out of the estate administration would bear a conspicuous resemblance to a surcharge, a remedy which the orphans’ court division has traditionally possessed the power to award. Thus, although the instant action does not fall within the <em>mandatory </em>jurisdiction of the orphans’ court division, it does arise out of the administration and distribution of an estate, and it raises serious questions regarding the propriety of the parties’ conduct during the estate administration, and, for these reasons, I would uphold the transfer to the orphans’ court division.</p>

The objections to merger because of jury trial are based on the same fundamental misconception of what the merger is, the same insistence upon the retention of old forms of action____ Just as <em>the bringing together of law and equity </em>does not change substantive equity or genuine substantive law, so also it <em>does not change, and was not intended to change, the methods of trial of issues of fact used in applying legal and equitable remedies. </em>It simply brings both , together in the same case when issues involving substantive law and equity arise in the same controversy____ The rule which generally prevails is that issues of fact in deciding the equitable defense or counterclaim will be decided by the court without reference to the jury, though the court may in its discretion submit the entire controversy to the jury when that method seems the more effective. This is strictly in accord with the principles of merger of law and <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>equity. <em>Law issues are disposed of by jury trial and equity issues by trial to the court, without change in the form of trial of either kind of issue, but combining both in the same action and in the same trial, saving the expense and delay of separate actions and trials, and eliminating the conflict which made it necessary that equity should restrain the parties from prosecuting their legal remedy pending the trial of the case in equity.</em>

Thus, with the merger of law and equity come juries in courts of equity and the constitutional provision saving the right to “trial by jury ... as heretofore,” PA. CONST. Art.

    <p id="b115-5" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[152,1118,1166,726]]]'>The majority bases its conclusion, that jury trials in the orphans’ court division are prohibited, on Rule 3.1 of the Orphans’ Court Rules. This rule provides, in relevant part, “Except where otherwise provided by ... special order of the local Orphans’ Court [sic], ... the pleading and practice shall conform to the pleading and practice in equity in the local Court of Common Pleas.” In my view, contrary to the conclusion of the majority that this rule prohibits jury trials, the language “by special order” provides the vehicle by which the orphans’ court division judge may, in appropriate instances, grant requests for jury trials. Thus, in my view, transfer of an action to the orphans’ court division for disposition need not result in abridgement of a party’s right to a trial by jury where the right exists.</p>

As discussed <em>supra, </em>the judges of the court of common pleas have equal authority. Thus, judges should follow the decisions of colleagues on the same court when based on the same set of facts, <em>Yudacufski v.

Indeed, it is clear the decision of the orphans’ court division judge was based purely upon analysis of the controlling law, and not upon any additional evidence which had not been considered during disposition of the preliminary objections filed in the civil division. As the decision of the orphans’ court judge was not based upon any additional evidence, it would be inappropriate for the orphans’ court judge to reverse the previous order entered in the civil division. Thus, in my view, the order of the orphans’ court judge retransferring the case to the civil division ought to be reversed, and the case should proceed in the orphans’ court division.</p>
