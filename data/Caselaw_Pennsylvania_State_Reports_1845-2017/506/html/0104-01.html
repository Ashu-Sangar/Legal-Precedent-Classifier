Decedent had worked in the coal mining industry for thirty-six years in the employ of Republic Steel Corporation (appellant). After receiving evidence from both sides, the referee found that decedent died as a result of anthracosilicosis and/or coal miner’s pneumoconiosis due to exposure to coal dust while working in the mines. The immediate cause of death stated on the death certificate however, was carcinoma of the lung. Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis was listed as “other significant causes.”</p>

In application, the majority denies coverage to a claimant whose decedent has contracted an occupational disease that has “merely” accelerated or aggravated a non-compensable disease which is the immediate cause of death. Observing the operation of the majority’s standard in <em>McCloskey v. WCAB, supra, </em>we glean the hidden meaning of “substantial” — to be considered a “substantial, contributing factor”, the medical testimony must establish that, <em>but for </em>the occupational disease, death would not have occurred. Thus the majority requires a degree of exactitude that, as the legislature recognizes, medical science is presently incapable of supplying. To demonstrate this point, I shall quote from my dissenting opinion in <em>McCloskey v.
