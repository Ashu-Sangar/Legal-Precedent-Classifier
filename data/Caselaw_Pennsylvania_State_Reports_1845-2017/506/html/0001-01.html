Because the Commonwealth Court’s jurisdiction over actions brought by the Commonwealth is <em>concurrent </em>with the courts of common pleas, 42 Pa.C.S. § 761(b), the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over ancillary matters, e.g., claims against additional defendants, in such cases.</p>
