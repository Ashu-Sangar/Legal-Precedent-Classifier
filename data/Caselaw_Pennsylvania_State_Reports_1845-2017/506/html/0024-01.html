He was finally returned to custody in Philadelphia in March, 1981 after resisting extradition. The Appellant was arrested and charged with the murder of Terrence Dougherty.

In this initial interview, Young revealed that the Appellant had discussed the Grice murder with him while they were imprisoned and had admitted killing Grice. There were no witnesses to the incident itself, but the police reinterviewed individuals who were present in the Quill and Scroll Bar on that day. The bar, which Grice had owned, was located beneath his apartment where the body was found. The investigators found the witnesses to be more cooperative in the subsequent interviews, which they attributed to the fact that the Appellant was in custody. Shortly thereafter, the Appellant was charged. The detectives testified that, prior to Young’s statement, they felt that there was insufficient evidence to charge the Appellant with the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>Grice murder because there was no direct evidence to connect him with the crime.</p>

[N.T. 477-480]. Appellant’s counsel requested that the prosecutor provide information of Buck’s whereabouts because there were insufficient funds to hire an investigator to locate him. Counsel indicated that he was unsure whether Buck would be called as a defense witness. It is readily apparent that Buck was not a material witness who was lost to the defense due to the delay in filing the charges, as Appellant now claims.

An empty cash box was found open in the <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>bedroom, and receipts had been thrown on the floor. The evidence established that his death resulted from a hard contact gun shot wound in the back of his head. Dr. Halbert Fillinger, the forensic pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination, testified that a hard contact gunshot wound occurs when the front portion of the gun is touching the skin. [N.T. 1380]. A .38 caliber projectile was removed from Grice’s head during an autopsy. The projectile was markedly distorted, however, so that no distinguishing markings could be identified. A pillow which had been used to muzzle the sound of the gunfire was found in the apartment. Although a search of the apartment revealed a fully loaded .38 caliber handgun and a pengun, the testimony of ballistics experts indicated that the fatal shot had not been fired from those weapons.

Dr. Robert Catherman, the pathologist who performed the autopsy, conducted an on-scene examination at Dougherty’s apartment on that date. [N.T. 1407].

The Appellant put the pillow to the gun and fired, but the gun did not go off. Another shot was fired into his back which knocked him off of the bed.

The premises underlying the' Commonwealth’s theory are: (1) the same weapon was used in the Felder arid Dougherty crimes and (2) Appellant used this weapon in the Felder crime. The conclusion which may logically flow from these premises and the demonstrated similarities of the crimes is that it was the Appellant who used the weapon in the Dougherty crime.

    <p id="b76-8" data-blocks='[["BL_76.9",76,[258,1185,1164,491]]]'>I concur in the result reached by the majority, but.I must respectfully disagree with the analysis employed in the discussion of the propriety of introduction of evidence connecting appellant to Dougherty’s murder in the instant case. Quite simply, appellant was acquitted of that offense. Appellant’s acquittal of the Dougherty murder precludes the existence of any evidence of his involvement in that crime, thus, there can be no evidence of appellant’s involvement in Dougherty’s murder admitted on <em>any </em>theory.</p>
