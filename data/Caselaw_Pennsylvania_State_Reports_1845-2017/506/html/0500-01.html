Superior Court affirmed Common Pleas’ denial of Allen’s double jeopardy challenges to the criminal trespass and rape charges and remanded these charges for trial.

Government harassment would not be avoided, because the contempt proceeding is privately triggered by the person in whose favor the order was entered, <em>i.e., </em>the abused spouse or children. The governmental authorities are not necessarily involved in bringing the contempt proceeding; indeed, they may not even be aware that it is brought. They therefore have no real control over that proceeding and should not be prevented by it from protecting the Commonwealth’s interest against violations of criminal law. Similarly, judicial economy would not be served by requiring joinder. To require joinder in such circumstances would not be in accord with the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of <em>Commonwealth v. Beatty, supra. See also </em>the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Flaherty, joined by Mr. Justice Hutchinson.
