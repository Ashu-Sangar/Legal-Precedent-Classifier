At issue is the “option order procedure” used by the PUC to grant this increase pending final action on a request for general rate increase. Horne contends that this procedure is violative of both the Public Utility Code (Code), 66 Pa.C.S. §§ 101-3315, and the due process clause of the United States Constitution. In accordance with well recognized principles of judicial restraint we do not consider the due process issue because we must hold, for the reasons which follow, that in this case the PUC allowed an interim rate increase to become effective pending action on a request for a general rate increase contrary to Section 1310(a) of the Public Utility Code. That section expressly disallows temporary rate increases in general rate proceedings. We therefore reverse the order of Commonw ^alth Court.</p>

Former Section 308(b), relating to voluntary changes in rates (66 P.S. § 1148(b)) and former Section 310(a), relating to temporary rates (66 P.S. § 1150(a)) specifically provided for temporary rates during the pendency of a general rate proceeding. This led to the routine administrative allowance of temporary rates while general rate cases were pending. Faced with this situation, the legislature expanded Section 308 (now § 1308) by including new subsections (d) and (e), and rewrote Section 310 (now § 1310).

Finally, at any time other than during a general rate filing, the utility may seek temporary rate increases, pursuant to Section 1310(a).

Duquesne’s initial request for a higher increase was abandoned and was no longer before the P.U.C. The P.U.C. then permitted Supplement 52 to become effective pursuant to section 1308(d).

The ratepayer filed an objection to the proposed increase in question but was denied an opportunity to be heard during the public meeting at 'which the increase was approved. In rejecting thq ratepayer’s constitutional challenge, we identified as significant factors the procedural safeguards of an automatic year-end meeting for final determination and adjustment of rate increases allowing full participation by all interested parties and the requirement that overpayments be refunded with interest in the event increases are found to be excessive. We also emphasized that the increases required express P.U.C. approval and thus the P.U.C.’s procedure could not be characterized as a private rate-setting scheme necessitating notice and an opportunity to present objections prior to approval. In the instant case the P.U.C. held extensive hearings, in which the utility bore the burden of proving the reasonableness of the increase, prior to final approval. Appellant had the opportunity to voice its objections during those proceedings. Provisional approval had been given subject to potential refunds should the increase ultimately be found excessive. Moreover, initial approval was granted only after investigation and analysis of Duquesne’s filings.
