    <p id="b175-7" data-blocks='[["BL_175.6",175,[191,1548,1160,699]]]'>This being the uncontroverted law of the land, then the deed from Mrs. Elder to the defendant was up to June 3, 1911, absolutely void and of no more force and effect than a blank piece of paper. The title of the land in controversy was up to that date vested in the plaintiff, who was the absolute owner under the protection of the' law, which secures to every citizen his or her property. Can the act of assembly then strike down this right, and divest her of her property, and without her consent transfer it to another? This would be doing the very thing that Sharswood, J., said Palairett’s Appeal cannot be done. It would take the property of one and transfer it to another “without due process of law.”</p>
