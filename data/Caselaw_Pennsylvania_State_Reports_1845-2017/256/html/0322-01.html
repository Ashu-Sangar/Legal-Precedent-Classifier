In the northern part of the City of Scranton, and situate upon the east bank of the Lackawanna river, is a tract of 72 acres of <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>land, on which there are certain public streets, avenues and boulevards, and which is underlaid with several veins of anthracite coal. The title to the coal has been severed from that of' the surface and is in the Pennsylvania Coal Company, which made a lease thereof to the defendants about 1901. Two of the streets above referred to were duly established before and others after such severance. The surface was sold without right of support, and the streets thereafter established were dedicated by the owners of the surface only, and without right of support being secured from the owners of the subsurface. The coal under this tract was subjected to what is termed “first mining,” by which about 60 per cent, thereof was removed, and the balance left in form of pillars for surface support. By the process known as “second mining” the defendants were when this bill was filed and still are proceeding to remove the balance of the coal, without providing artificial supports. This bill was filed on the theory that such removal would cause a subsidence of the surface, to the damage of the streets and peril of the traveling public.</p>
    <p id="b358-4" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[276,1497,1147,305]]]'>Defendants are operating in what is known as the “Big vein,” which is about 14 feet thick, and above which there is over one hundred feet of rock formation. They are also operating in what is called the “Clark vein,” which is about' seven feet thick and above which there is some three hundred feet of rock formation.</p>
    <p id="b358-5" data-blocks='[["BL_358.5",358,[276,1822,1148,594]],["BL_359.1",359,[150,344,1153,975]]]'>The evidence is conflicting as to the exact nature of the formation overlying said veins of coal, that for plaintiff tending to show the presence of such large quantities of quicksand and fireclay as to greatly increase the danger of surface subsidence by removal of the underlying coal; this is denied by the evidence for defendants. It is the theory of defendants, and supported by some evidence, that as the overlying rock breaks up and falls into the excavation made by the removal of the coal the fragments fill from one-third to one-half more space than the solid rock, and by reason thereof choke up the open<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>ing without surface disturbance, especially as to the deeper veins. However, the defendants’ recent mining operations seem to have resulted in some surface subsidence, more on private property than in the streets. The greatest subsidence at any point previous to the trial of this case was two and six-tenths feet. The evidence is conflicting as to whether such subsidence as may result from second mining will be sudden or gradual, and as to whether the ordinary use of the streets will be affected thereby. This is a populous neighborhood, and plaintiff contends that the subsidence of its streets causes an added danger because of damage to gas, water and sewer pipes located therein. This action is based mainly on the Act of July 26, 1913, P. L. 1439, regulating the mining out and removal of coal,'* etc. Pursuant to Section 1 of this act, plaintiff by ordinance created a Bureau of Mine Inspection and Surface Support, but later the ordinance was repealed.</p>

    <blockquote id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.6",359,[148,1604,1151,641]]]'>“Within the past year there have been several surface disturbances along the easterly portion of the tract, indicated by cracks and subsidence, occasioned no doubt by the withdrawal of pillars in the Big vein, which is proceeding from the easterly boundary. These disturbances have been gradual in their progress and of small extent. The point of greatest subsidence is' at one of the Morel greenhouses where it amounted to 2 6-10ths feet. Private property has been injured, but the only street affected is Parke where there was a sag without any break, and so slight as to occasion no interference with its use nor any repairs whatever......</blockquote>

This is the only inference consistent with the great weight of the evidence, and the fact is accordingly so found. That the improvements on private property would in such case be liable to injury, is not disputed; but that the personal safety of the traveling public is menaced by the mining operations does not appear and is not so found.</blockquote>

Any supposition to the contrary would seem to be unwarranted and it is accordingly found that there is only a remote possibility of any disturbance of the surface from that source......”</blockquote>
