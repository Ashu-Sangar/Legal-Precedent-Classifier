In 1900 Mrs. E. Y. Shannon gave a note for $4,000.00 to the Second National Bank of Clarion of which her husband, I. M. Shannon, was then cashier. This was done to* aid Mr. Shannon in the purchase of a mortgage. The note ivas renewed to the bank from time to <em>time; </em>and finally replaced by a note made by Mrs. Shannop payable to her brother, P. M. Yeany, and by him guaranteed and assigned to the bank. This latter note was also renewed from time to time, until in March, 1910, the bank held such note so guaranteed for the amount of $2,800.00. Then Mr. Shannon, acting for his wife, negotiated from plaintiff bank a loan of $3,-000.00, giving therefor her note endorsed and guaranteed by Mr. Yeany, who received a cashier’s check for same, less $60.00 discount, and which check he handed to Mr. Shannon, who deposited $2,800.00 thereof in his wife’s ac<a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>count in said Clarion bank, and the balance of the check, to wit, $140.00, he used as his own. At or about the same time Mrs. Shannon drew a check for $2,800.00 in favor of the Clarion bank in payment of her note of that amount therein.</p>
    <p id="b171-3" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[172,638,1151,961]]]'>In connection with the $3,000.00 loan from the plaintiff bank the Second National Bánk of Clarion made a loan of like amount to one of the officers of the Marien,ville bank, in the nature of an exchange of loans between said banks.. The note in like amount and substantially in like form was renewed from time to time until 1912, when the final note was given on which the judgment against Mrs. Shannon in this case was. entered. Mr. Yeany had no financial interest in the matter and what he did was for the accommodation of the Shannons. It does not appear that the plaintiff knew that Mr. Shannon was to receive any part of the proceeds of the note. Mrs. Shannon died in 1913 and her executor was substituted as defendant. The testimony of two of the officers and stockholders of the plaintiff bank was taken as to matters occurring in her lifetime. This was objected to inter alia as incompetent and was excluded. Some evidence was also taken on behalf of defendant.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[174,1619,1150,753]],["BL_172.1",172,[244,357,1145,91]]]'>The court below in a very careful review of the law and the facts reached the conclusion that Mrs. Shannon was the principal debtor and not -a surety on the note in suit, and discharged the rule to open judgment. There seems to be no doubt of the correctness of that conclusion. Mr. Yeany’s relation to the transaction was clearly that of an accommodation endorser and guarantor. Mrs. Shannon certainly did not make the note for his benefit, for he received no benefit whatever. She did not in making this note guarantee or become surety for the debt of her husband for so far as appears he owed nothing either to Mr. Yeany or the Marienville Gold Standard National <em>Bank; </em>and he was not a party to the note, and plaintiff had no right of action thereon against him. Every in<a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>debtedness has a principal debtor, and here it must be Mrs. Shannon for there was no other.</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[242,468,1148,693]]]'>The question is as to her relation to this note and to this indebtedness. The consideration for the note, except the $140.00, was deposited to her credit and was her money, and she used it to pay the note which she had given to the Second National Bank of Clarion, and on which her brother was guarantor. As between them she was principal on that note. She could do what she liked with the $2,800.00, even to paying an obligation on which she was surety, or her husband’s debts. A bank that in good faith loans money to a married woman is not bound to ascertain for what purpose she borrows it, nor responsible for what she does with it: Class &amp; Nachod Brewing Co. v. Rago, <a href="/pa/240/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="240 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="993226" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0470-01">240 Pa. 470</a>.</p>
