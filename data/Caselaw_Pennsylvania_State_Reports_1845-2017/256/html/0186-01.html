The husband died leaving a will wherein he made his wife tenant for life of certain of the real estate with remainder to his daughter.

It appeared that at the time when the wife acquiesced in the provisions of the will she was ignorant of her rights to the entire real estate; that she was a <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>paralytic and could not have informed herself.

There was no attempt by her to claim the corpus of this fund, and she apparently limited her use of it to that of a life-tenant only; nor did she make a will or convey or attempt to convey the real estate after the making of her husband’s will.</p>

At the time of the execution of the will of Charles Flynn, and for a number of years prior thereto, and continually up until her death, Catherine Flynn was a helpless invalid.

She also expressed her pleasure at the making of her will, because, if it had not been made her son “would have caused the property to be sold and she would have had no income, except what money she would have in the bank,” and said, “if he [her son] would come in, where would you or I get our share?

Aside from his wandering disposition, if it be material, which we do not deem it to be, the court was not satisfied that there was any sufficient ground for excluding him from the inheritance.

    <p id="b230-6" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[239,1047,1145,640]]]'>It is a significant fact that upon the original hearing Mrs. Parker, who at the rehearing testified to the most material fact now involved, that of her mother’s knowledge of the nature of her title and of her rights as tenant by entireties, did not refer to such knowledge. It is also significant that Mrs. McElfresh, who at the rehearing testified to detailed knowledge on the part of Mrs. Flynn with regard to her title, which, if believed, would put an end to complainant’s rights in this proceeding, did not at the original hearing give any such testimony, although she was examined at length and was a most willing witness.</p>
    <p id="b230-7" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[240,1698,1142,698]],["BL_231.1",231,[218,371,1144,425]]]'>In the instances of the testimony of Mrs. Parker, who was but seven years of age at the time she heard Mr. Jones describe to her mother the nature of the title she was acquiring, we are asked to believe that a child of such tender years would have sufficient intelligence and mental acuteness not only to comprehend the nature of the title and the details of a technical presentation of it by Mr. Jones, but to remember all these facts and to be able to testify clearly upon them thirty-one years after-wards. This witness specifically says that she recalls the conversation, and narrates it as follows: “I know when the property was-bought that Mr. Jones explained to her, and I heard her explain to my father, that if it <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>was in both names, neither one would have to make a Avill at the death of the other, and it Avould go direct. ......He explained to her the fact that if she had it made in her husband’s name, that on his death she would need a will and otherwise would only get a third of the property, the widow’s rights, in case there was any children; and if she had the title made in both names it would go direct to the one that survived.”</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[216,807,1145,417]]]'>Yet this witness upon the original hearing gave the testimony on which the court based its eighteenth finding of fact. As indicated by that finding, Mrs. Parker then testified: “Q. — What did your mother say to him Avith regard to hoAV he should make his will? A. — Well, she said she knew my brother did not do what was right and she did not Avant him to come in and claim an equal share with her and I in the will.”</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[216,1243,1144,205]]]'>She also testified: “Q. — What did she say about what you would have? A. — Of course, she says, ‘if he would come in, where do you or I get our share? What would keep me?’ ”</p>
    <p id="b231-7" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[215,1461,1145,371]]]'>It is true Mrs. McElfresh swears to the full knowledge of Mrs. Flynn as to her rights and title, but when the daughter, who would be reasonably supposed to know the most about it, presents positive proof as above, that the mother did not knoAV her rights, it is asking too much under all the circumstances to give credit to Mrs. McElfresh’s story upon the subject.</p>

This witness was very specific and had full recollection as to the identical facts which she was called upon to establish, but was uncertain and had to refer to Mrs. Parker as to where she, the witness, lived at the date that she was called upon to go to wait upon Mrs. Flynn at the home of the latter. Not only is it apparent that she did not have any recollection of material facts which she claims she had, but it is also true that the mother, Mrs. Flynn, was so afflicted that she could make herself understood <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>to but few persons, and that with great difficulty.
