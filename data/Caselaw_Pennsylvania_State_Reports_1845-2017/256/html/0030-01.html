These positions they retained for about a year and failing to obtain another suitable place together, according to Randall’s testimony, decided to take separate places. He secured a position in New York City and continued in this employment for two years, during which time his wife occupied two rooms in the same city where he frequently called to see her. In 1904, he obtained employment in Morristown, New York, and his wife took a place in Albany. A year later he was employed in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and she being in poor health followed him to that city and lived there in a boarding house, where he visited her frequently. After remaining four months in Pittsfield she returned to New York City and from .that time they remained apart, each working at various places, he as a butler and valet and she as cook. At the time of her death, July 4, 1914, Mrs. Randall was employed as a domestic in the City of Pittsburgh under her maiden name and had been so employed since 1907, and appellant was residing in Richfield, Connecticut; they had not seen each other for several years previous to her death. During this period he sent her occasional letters and postal cards, but seldom heard from her owing to the fact, as he states, that “it was very difficult for her to write English.” He neither furnished her with money nor provided her Avith maintenance or support however <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>after their separation in 1906. While he testified she made no requests for assistance he does not say he offered her any. On the contrary, he admits having received from her at one time before her marriage the sum of $314 to be applied as part consideration for a house purchased in Schenectady, New York, the title to which was taken and still remains in his name.</p>

At most, his testimony amounts to a decision, as he says, to take separate places; this implied that she was to continue to work for her living. As the result of this decision announced by himself, she as his wife had to make her way alone among strangers far distant from him. ...... This husband’s apparent solicitude expressed in some of his letters about his wife’s health and her arduous duties in Pittsburgh’s hot summer Aveather, with comments on the picture postal cards which he sent her of the beauties and delights of the lake scenes thereon, are not coupled with any request or offer that she shall come on and share those with him at his expense and rest from her arduous labors. His letters refer to the reminders in flowers, presents, samples of the wines he made which he sent to his other friends on birthdays or festive occasions. He admits he sent not even a Christmas card to his wife; he not only neglected to support her; his conduct toward her by any act of kindness, offer of help, or the 'comforts which a wife has a right to expect from her husband, was as cold as the frigid zone.”</p>

There is no force in this contention. Section two relates to the right of a wife to exercise the privileges of a feme sole trader, while section five specifies the conditions or circumstances which operate to bar the husband’s right to share in his wife’s estate. The two sections deal with separate and distinct matters and each is complete in itself. Under the latter section the husband loses his curtesy rights, either by his neglect or refusal to support his wife or by'wilful and malicious desertion.

Of course, if the parties lived separately through mutual agreement by which the wife voluntarily released her husband from contributing to her support, his curtesy rights are not forfeited. The auditing judge, however, expressly holds there is no testimony to support a finding that Mrs. Randall voluntarily released her husband from his duty to provide her with maintenance, and the mere fact that she did not demand support does not excuse him from the performance of his duty toward her. On the whole we find the conclusion reached by the auditing judge, that appellant wilfully neglected to provide for his wife, is warranted by the evidence and, consequently, his right to share in her estate is forfeited.</p>

For the purpose of rebutting the husband’s testimony the collateral relatives called as a witness a young woman who had known decedent before she came from Sweden to America and who saw her frequently in Pittsburgh up to the time of her death. This witness was permitted to testify to declarations of the decedent to the effect that she gave appellant $1,500, instead of $314, as testified to by him, and that he took her entire earnings while they were living together and did not support her, and for that reason she was obliged to maintain herself.</p>

The auditing judge admitted them on the theory that they tended to contradict appellant’s testimony citing Lightner v. Wike, 4 S. &amp; R. 203, and Postens v. Postens, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 127" data-case-ids="1854617" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0127-01">3 W. &amp; S. 127</a>. In the former case this court held that where a witness for defendant in an ejectment suit testified to the existence of an intimate friendship between him and a deceased testator, through whom both plaintiff and defendant claimed title, evidence of declarations by the testator tending to rebut the existence of such friendship were properly admitted on the ground that the testimony “was not offered to discredit directly the character [credibility] of Ellmaker [the witness]., but to show, that what he had sworn was not the truth, because inconsistent with other facts.” An important distinction between that case and this is that here the evidence was offered for the express purpose of attacking the credibility of appellant and in addition thereto was self-serving, a fact which did not exist in the Lightner case. In the second case cited, the declarations were properly admitted to show the whole transaction and as part of the res gestse. Although we conclude that the admission of the testimony in question- was erroneous, it does not appear to have been harmful to appellant, as the auditing judge expressly based his conclusion as to the facts on the assumption of the truth of, appellant’s testimony with respect to the matters covered by the incompetent evidence. ’</p>
