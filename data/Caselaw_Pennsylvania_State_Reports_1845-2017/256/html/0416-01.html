Defendant agreed to purchase from the plaintiff the lot in question, provided the plaintiff had the right to surface support. Defendant refused to accept the deed, contending that the right to mine the coal without liability of surface support reserved by the coal company in its conveyance of the surface, passed with the conveyance of the underlying coal to the steel company. <em>Held, </em>that the right to surface support passed to the trust company by the conveyance from the coal company, and was con<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>veyed to plaintiff by the deed from the trust company, and that judgment was properly entered against the defendant.</p>

The lot is underlaid with coal, and defendant agreed to purchase it only upon condition that he should be assured of the right of surface support. He refused to accept the deed tendered by plaintiff, on the ground that it does not appear that plaintiff is entitled to surface support of the lot, and, therefore, cannot convey any such right. Whether or not plaintiff has the right of surface support in the land, is the question in controversy. The determination of this question depends upon the proper construction of the language of certain deeds. As the facts were not in dispute, they were agreed upon -by counsel, and the case was sent to a referee. He reached the conclusion that the plaintiff had the right to surface support for his land, and was in position to make valid conveyance to the defendant in strict accordance with the articles of agreement. Exceptions to the report were overruled both by the referee and the court below, and the report was confirmed, and judgment in favor of the plaintiff was entered. Defendant has appealed.</p>

No such privilege follows from the mere conveyance of coal, machinery, fixtures, tools, etc., with the “hereditaments and appurtenances” belonging thereto'. The conveyance of “all the estate, right, title, interest, benefit, property, claim and demand whatsoever” of the grantor, is properly referable to the subject-matter of the grant, to wit, the coal conveyed, and does not necessarily amount to a waiver of the right of the grantor to insist upon support being left for the surface. This conclusion is strengthened by reference to other provisions in the deed. Some sixty-two tracts were conveyed in the same instrument, and, with, respect to only one of them is the right given to remove the coal “without thereby incurring in any event whatever any liability for injury caused or damage done to the surface of said land or to the buildings or improvements which now are or may hereafter be put thereon.” The insertion of such a clause in the conveyance of one particular tract and its exclusion in conveying all of the other tracts, brings the transaction within the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, and indicates an intention, upon the part of the grantor, not to waive the right of support as to other lots. In Graff Furnace Co. v. Scranton Coal Co., <a href="/pa/244/0592-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="244 Pa. 592" data-case-ids="1003511" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0592-01">244 Pa. 592</a>, the same deed from the Lackawanna Iron &amp; Coal Company to the Lackawanna Iron &amp; Steel Company, which is now before us, was under consideration. In that case it appeared that the coal company granted certain property, reserving the coal and the right to remove it, without liability for surface support. A subsequent purchaser of this tract brought suit against the steel company for damages <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>for injury to the surface. It was held there could be no recovery because no right to surface support existed in plaintiff. In that case the exact question now before us was hot presented or decided; we there said, speaking through our Brother Mestrezat (p. 596) : “We do not deem it necessary to determine whether the grant to the steel company released or waived the right of surface support.......It is wholly immaterial whether the common grantor of the parties holding respectively the surface and the coal still retained the right of surface support or whether it has passed to the owner of the coal. The important fact is that it never passed to the plaintiff nor its predecessors in title.”</p>

The right of surface support is a natural right of property which is inherent in such an estate; while in the conveyance of coal, it is thoroughly settled that the right to remove it without liability for damage to the surface is not a fundamental or necessary incident. In the present instance, the acceptance by Matthews of the deed containing the stipulation that the coal company should retain the right to remove the coal without liability for injury, was merely a waiver by him, as purchaser of the surface, of his natural right or easement. This stipulation cannot properly be regarded as the creation of another easement appurtenant to the mineral estate, which would pass merely with its conveyance. The stipulation for the right to remove the coal without liability for injury to the surface did not have the effect of retaining in the grantor any interest outside of the coal, in the land which was being conveyed. It did not authorize the grantor to do anything upon the land of the surface owner, but its effect was merely to absolve the owner of the coal from responsibility for injurious consequences which might follow the removal of the coal. The stipulation may fairly be considered as being a license to do the desired act, that is, to let down the surface, if necessary, in order to remove the coal. It was authority to do an act affecting the land, without, however, conferring upon the licensee any estate in the land. An easement is always an estate in the land. But “a license properly passeth no interest, nor' alters or transfers property in anything, but only makes an action lawful, which without it had been unlawful”: Thomas v. Sorrell, Vaughan’s Bep. (Eng.), 330, 351. It is distinguished in this from an easement: Jones on Easements, 64, 65. The only effect of the stipulation in this case, would be to make lawful the letting down of the surface, which otherwise would be unlaw<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>ful. Further than that, it could not go. Its force would be spent with the removal of the coal. The.license in this case being coupled with a grant of the coal, or rather with the reservation of the coal, was irrevocable by the owner of the surface, and was assignable by the licensee. Beyond question the coal , company had power to assign to the steel company its right to remove the coal without liability for injury to the surface, but it did not see fit to do so. Having retained this right when it sold the coal, the coal company was at liberty thereafter to abandon the right, or to transfer it directly or indirectly to the owner of the surface. It was not something which fastened itself upon the mineral estate, and became impossible of detachment. The coal company was under no obligation to convey to the steel company all the rights which it possessed with respect to the removal of the coal. The language of its deed to the steel company shows that it took pains not to include the right of removal without liability for injury to the surface, and it would be a strained construction indeed which wóuld hold that a valuable property right passed as an appurtenance, when the transfer of any such right was. carefully avoided in describing the principal thing conveyed. The right in question was valuable in connection with the large tract of land held by the coal company, and this fact was probably taken into account, both in the sale of surface and in the sale of the coal. The latter presumably sold for a less price than it would have brought had the right to remove it without leaving support for the surface been included. If, as was stated upon the argument, the coal company retained a considerable-amount of surface land when it disposed of the coal, it was manifestly to its interest to retain for itself, and for the benefit of future purchasers of lots, the right of surface support.</p>

It was not something which must pass with a conveyance of the coal, contrary to the desire and intention of the grantor, the coal company. The rights of the steel company are limited and defined by the language of the deeds to it.

If it must be classed as an “easement appurtenant,” then it would pass by a subsequent conveyance of the mineral estate (Cathcart v.

An easement “is generally defined to be a liberty, privilege or advantage which one may have in the lands of another without profit” : Big Mountain Improvement Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/54/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="54 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1006339" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0361-01">54 Pa. 361</a>, 369. Jones on Easements, at p. 4, states their qualifications thus: “First, they are incorporeal ; second, they are imposed on corporeal property; third, they confer no right to a participation in the profits arising from such property; fourth, they are imposed for the benefit of corporeal property; fifth, there must be two distinct tenements- — the dominant, to which the right belongs, and the servient, upon which the obligation rests.” Immediately thereafter the same authority says: “An easement, aside from an easement in gross, can exist only as it is appurtenant to land; it cannot exist unconnected with the land to the enjoyment and occupation of which it is incident. A right in the land granted for the personal use and benefit of an individual is a personal privilege, which is called an easement in gross, as distinguished from the privilege usually termed an easement, which is a privilege incident to particular land. Whether a privilege is a personal right, or is appurtenant to some estate, and therefore an <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>easement, is determined by a fair interpretation of the instrument creating it, aided, if- necessary, by the situation of the property and the surrounding circumstances” (see <a href="/pa/54/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="54 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1006339" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0361-01">id.,</a> Secs. 28, 47). Thus it may be seen that the right created in the grantor by the deed from A to B has all the attributes of . an easement appurtenant to the mineral estate vested in the former. It is an incorporeal right attached to corporeal property, and, when brought into legal existence, generally speaking, it would pass upon a conveyance of the latter under the general description of “appurtenances”: <a href="/pa/54/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="54 Pa. 361" data-case-ids="1006339" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0361-01">id.,</a> Sec. 20, et seq., and cases hereinbefore cited.</p>

A right of the character of the one with which we are dealing, Avhen properly created, adheres to the estate for whose benefit it was brought into existence, the same as covenants running with the land (Scranton v. Phillips, <a href="/pa/94/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="94 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="485657" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0015-01">94 Pa. 15</a>, 23), and, in order so to do, it need only be convenient, not necessary or essential, to the enjoyment of the dominant estate (Zell v.

To. my mind, clearly, the right to let down the surface, retained in 1873 by A, vested in an easement appurtenant to the mineral estate (Jones on Easements, Sec. 90), and <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>this passed under the general terms of its subsequent conveyance to C; hence, A could not afterwards deal therewith, and its deed purporting áo'to do necessarily failed of that effect.</p>

Where one is the owner of an entire property, both the surface and underlying estates, of necessity no easement, either of the right of support or the right to let down the surface, can exist; for such incorporeal rights can be brought into being only upon a severance of the one estate from the other (Jones on Easements, Secs. 24, 597 and 835; Kieffer v. Imhoff, <a href="/pa/26/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="26 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="977208" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0438-01">26 Pa. 438</a>, 442; Coleman’s App., <a href="/pa/62/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="62 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="1017263" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0252-01">62 Pa. 252</a>, 274; Zerbey v.

Here the grant under discussion, i. e., the deed from A to C, transferred the mineral estate under a large tract of land, of which the lot previously conveyed to B formed but a small part, and it is plain that. this deed did not grant to C the right to let down the surface of any land where an easement to that effect had not previously been created, for the words of the instrument did not expressly confer the right so to do; but it is equally plain that where such a right already existed it was an easement appurtenant to the estate conveyed and, as such, it passed therewith. The judgment entered by the court below rests upon the theory that, since the deed <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>from A to C did not expressly give the right to let down the surface of all the property conveyed, it could not pass an easement previously created to' disturb the surface of a particular portion thereof; but, as I have endeavored to show, this position is not in accord with the relevant rules of law, and no authority has been cited which either directly or by necessary implication sustains it.</p>

Scranton Coal Co., supra, in no sense rules the present appeal; in that case there was no question of a previously existing easement appurtenant to the estate granted. The Graff case was a proceeding in equity to restrain the owner of the underlying mineral estate from disturbing the plaintiff’s land. The surface of the lot there in controversy overlaid part of the coal conveyed by the deed from A to C, referred to in the present case. After disposing of its mineral estate to C, A sold and conveyed to a certain predecessor in title of the plaintiff in the Graff case the lot there in question, “excepting and reserving” the minerals underneath the same, with the right to mine without incurring liability for injury to the surface;' this exception being made expressly for the benefit of the grantor and also of “all persons who may have derived title to said coal......from the party of the first part [the grantor].” In dismissing the bill, we ruled that the words of this latter deed were controlling, that the' exception therein of the right of surface support governed, and that it was not necessary to determine in whom that right was vested, so long as it was apparent that it did not vest in the plaintiff. In the .course of the opinion, however, this significant passage occurs: “The owner of the entire estate may likewise grant the surface of the land and reserve the mineral estate with the right to mine and remove it without liability for any injury or damage done to the surface, and in such case the grantor or those claiming through him may mine and remove all the coal without being compelled to support the surface.” In the case at bar, the present owner of the coal is one claiming through such a <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>grantor as just described; and I cannot agree that the latter, when it stipulated for the right to let down the surface, became a mere licensee of its grantee. One may have a license conferred upon him, but I know of no authority which holds that a grantor of real estate may by words inserted in his own deed retain or confer a license upon himself, in or over the subject-matter conveyed; although, of course, it is well established that he may thus create an easement.</p>
