The only question in such case is whether the requirements of an ordinance for that purpose are reasonable, and not unduly burdensome. Regulation is not to be carried to the extent of prohibition. A jitney is an automobile, and by universal custom automobiles are permitted to use the streets of cities, as are other vehicles. The fact that the owners of jitneys derive a profit from their operation, makes no difference in their legal status. Much of the traffic upon the city streets is a matter of profit, directly or indirectly to those engaged therein. The public highways are for the use of those engaged in commerce or industrial pursuits, no less than <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>for pleasure. cars. But, if, from the usual manner of operating certain vehicles, the public safety is endangered, the right and duty of special regulation is clear. Such regulation may very properly include, as in this case, the requirement of a bond to secure the payment of such damages as may be recovered for loss of life, or injury to person or property occasioned by the negligent operation of the jitney, provided the bond be not made prohibitive in its nature, either by being made too large in amount, or by being unnecessarily restricted as to the sureties who may sign it. In the present case the bond required is restricted to one furnished by a surety company, while the evidence shows that it is difficult to procure such a bond from a surety company. Under the circumstances, we think the exclusion of personal sureties is not justifiable or reasonable. The municipality is entitled to require good and sufficient security, but beyond that it should not go. The terms of the ordinance in this respect would forbid the deposit of cash, or a certified check, or municipal bonds, as security by the applicant for a permit, or the acceptance as sureties upon his bond of individual freeholders of unquestioned financial responsibility. We know of no other instance in which, where security is required by law to be given, an attempt has been made to confine such security to surety companies, to the exclusion of solvent and responsible personal sureties.</p>

No surety could properly be asked to undertake such an indefinite and unlimited responsibility.</p>
