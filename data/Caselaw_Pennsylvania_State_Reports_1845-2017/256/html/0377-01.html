After his death, Mrs. Sheehan withdrew the whole deposit. It is to recover the amount of the deposit that Grady’s administratrix (who is his widow) brings this suit upon the theory that the transaction between Grady and ' Mrs. Sheehan was a gift, and being unexecuted and without change of the intended donor’s- dominion, is ineffective.</p>

    <p id="b413-11" data-blocks='[["BL_413.10",413,[178,1606,1150,643]]]'>It is conceded by the defendant that the right of either to draw, standing alone, and in the absence of any act or declaration of intention on the part of the donor that the account was put in that form for any other purpose than his own convenience would vest no title to the deposit in the defendant. But it is urged that the decision in Flanagan v. Nash recognizes that such a result must yield to proof of a different intention upon the part of the donor, and that an intention to create a joint tenancy in the fund, with right of survivorship, is evident from the paper last above quoted, and the delivery of the deposit book.</p>
    <p id="b413-12" data-blocks='[["BL_413.11",413,[179,2262,1147,152]],["BL_414.1",414,[240,347,1147,588]]]'>It may be conceded that the full control which one has over his personal property includes the right to create such a joint ownership and survivorship either for a <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>consideration or by gift. But if created by way of gift, it is subject to the rules governing gifts, among which is that requiring delivery. Being a chose in action and incapable of manual delivery, delivery can only be made by means of written assignment. This, it has been held, must be an assignment in prsesenti. The assignment by gift even of a promissory note has been held to be executory and ineffective, and the assignment of a certificate of stock evidenced only by the delivery of the certificate without more, is equally ineffective as a gift. (Sullivan v. Hess, <a href="/pa/241/0407-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="241 Pa. 407" data-case-ids="976036" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0407-01">241 Pa. 407</a>.)</p>

    <p id="b414-6" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[230,1110,1153,1009]]]'>Does the paper of February 23, 1912, have this force? In view of the form in which it is executed, that is, with a seal, we cannot regard as unnecessary, as was suggested at the argument, the consideration of its character, whether testamentary or not. For it is in form a sealed instrument. And if its contents are such, as taken with the seal, would make it a deed, it would be at least a voluntary bond, and as such not subject to the ordinary rules governing gifts. That is, the seal would import a consideration and immediate delivery of the property assigned would not be required for validity. (Yard v. Patton, <a href="/pa/13/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="13 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="964995" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0278-01">13 Pa. 278</a>; Candor &amp; Henderson’s App., <a href="/pa/27/0119-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="27 Pa. 119" data-case-ids="979401" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0119-01">27 Pa. 119</a>; Hummel’s Est., <a href="/pa/161/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="161 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="854161" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0215-01">161 Pa. 215</a>.) Moreover, the question of the effect of fraud upon the wife would be involved, she occupying the position of a purchaser. (Greiner’s App., <a href="/pa/103/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="103 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="449140" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0089-01">103 Pa. 89</a>.) And in the absence of evidence of fraud, it would follow that if the paper is to be regarded as a voluntary bond, judgment should be entered for the defendant.</p>

It vested no present interest in anyone but directed what was to be done after the maker’s death. In other words, it had all of the earmarks of a testamentary paper. (Tozer et al. v.
