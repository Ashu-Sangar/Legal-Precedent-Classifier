Testator devised certain real estate to his daughter for life with power to dispose of the remainder by will, and provided that if she should die intestate her children should take. The daughter <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>died leaving a will wherein, after creating a life estate in such property, she devised a part of the remainder to her son for life and “on his death to such child or children of his as may then be living......and in the event of my said son leaving no child or children living at the time of his death, then I will and direct that the said property shall be divided among my nephews and nieces then living, per capita, share and share alike.” The son, who survived his mother, was married but had. no issue. On petition of the son who was in possession of the property an issue was framed to try title thereto; the nephews and nieces claimed an interest in such property contingent upon their surviving the son should he die without issue. The son contended that the appointment violated the rule against perpetuities and that he was the absolute donee of such property. <em>Held, </em>that the exercise of the power of appointment by the daughter must be read into the will of the original testator and so read it violates the rulé against perpetuities and was invalid, and that the son was entitled to the property under the provision of the will of the original testator devising the property of the daughter to her children should she die intestate.</p>

Chancery 188, it was held that a general power to be exercised at death does not constitute ownership, and that in such case the rule of perpetuities applies. This case has not been followed by the later English decisions. Chitty, J., in Rous v. Jackson, L. R. 29 Chancery Div. 521, 526, said of it, “I think the Vice Chancellor in that case fell into error,” and quoting from Lord St. Leonards’ work on Powers, added, “A general power is, in regard to the estate which may be created by force of it, tantamount to a limitation, in fee, not merely because it enables the donee to limit a fee which a particular power may also do, but because it enables him to give the fee to whom he pleases; ......” He draws no distinction between a power exercisable by deed or will or by will only, and it appears <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>to me to make no difference by what instrument the power is made exercisable. Lord St. Leonards also says: “Therefore, whatever estates may be created, by a man seized in fee may equally be created under a general power of appointment; and the period for the commencement of the limitations in point of perpetuity, is the time of the execution of the power and not of the creation of it.” Justice Chitty also quoted Mr. Powell’s note to Fearne’s Executory Devises in favor of the contrary opinion, and in the result states that “there appears to be no solid principle upon which the distinction taken by Mr. Powell can be supported, because the question whether the limitations are good does not depend oh the fact that the donee of the power has also' the fee in default of an appointment, and that you can create the same estate and limitations under a general power of appointment as you can where you have the fee.” He concludes by saying, “I think, therefore, there must be some error, some slip in the decision of James, Y. C., in In re Powell’s Trusts, and that the case Avas wrongly decided.” Mr. Gray regards the principle of In re Powell’s Trusts (supra) as correct, and refuses to accept the doctrine of the later English cases. He insists that where thé donee has a general power of appointment, exercisable only by will, the validity of the gift made by the donee must be referréd in point of time to the creation of the power, because the donee is not the owner and cannot appoint to himself, no appointment can be made until he dies (Gray' on Perpetuities, 3d Ed., Par. 526-526c).</p>
