    <p id="b274-7" data-blocks='[["BL_274.9",274,[252,819,1147,1350]]]'>Plaintiff’s hand was caught and crushed between iron rolls, while he was employed in defendant’s bakery. The rolls were set in a table one ab.ove the other, the top of the lower roll being practically flush with the table. In the process of bread making the dough was passed back and forth between the rolls by workmen standing at each end of the table. Plaintiff seems to have slipped as he was pushing the dough back into the rolls so that the hand he was using for that purpose was caught. The rolls were operated by the employee at the other end of the table by means of a lever. There was some evidence that it was safer to use a paddle in pushing in the dough, and that defendant’s foreman had promised to supply plaintiff with one, but this was denied; also some evidence to the effect that the dough should be pushed against the rolls with the closed hand and not with the fingers. However, the gravamen of plaintiff’s complaint was that the rolls were unguarded in violation of the Act of May 2, 1905, P. L. 352 (Sec. 11). As a matter of fact there were no guards over the face of the rolls, defendant’s contention being that to place guards over them would destroy their efficiency. This was denied by plaintiff, and as to that the evidence was conflicting, and it was properly submitted to the jury, who found for the plaintiff.</p>

Here the defendant took his chances of a favorable verdict on other grounds, and for the first time mentions contributory negligence in the motion for a neAV trial. This would seem to be too late even if otherwise meritorious. This case is no exception to the general rule that the refusal to grant a new trial is not reversible error.</p>
