When he reached Forty-first street he started to drive across the track of the defendant company. Just after his horses’ heads were over the track he turned them north on Forty-first street in an attempt to avoid a collision with one of defendant’s cars coming' north on said track. The horses and wagon cleared the tracks but the car struck the hub of the right front wheel of the wagon throwing the plaintiff therefrom and causing the injuries from which his death ensued.</p>

For this reason the judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto is affirmed.</p>
