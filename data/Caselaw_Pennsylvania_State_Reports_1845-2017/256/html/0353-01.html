Defendant failed to furnish the blanks, and replied to the letter that the insurance feature of the contracts had expired on January 1, 1912, and was no longer in force or effect. Plaintiff accepted dividends paid by the defendant in October, 1911, and February, 1912, the latter however not being paid until February 20, 1912, and having accrued prior to January 1, 1912, the dividends being on the contract but not on the stock. In an action to recover the money paid in by the decedent, held that a recovery for the plaintiff was properly allowed; there was not estoppel by waiver.</p>

The insurance feature was in effect on July 29, 1911, and did not expire by limitation until January 1, 1912. The attempted repudiation of the liability of the defendant was on February 15, 1912. The demand for the refund was made before the dividend was sent, and its acceptance cannot be considered as an election to take the stock, which had not been issued at that time, and the payment <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>was “on the contract” and not on the stock of the company, and the payment had been due prior to January 1, 1912, the defendant delaying the payment until after that date.</p>
