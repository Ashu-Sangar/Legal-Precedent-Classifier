That at the <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>time of the dissolution his brother knew, or should have known, of this stock being there; that he did know that there was such litigation, which involved large figures and grew out of a contract made by the Epsteins, to deliver 100,000 robes to Fenkart, which contract was broken by Fenkart, and that at the time of the dissolution there was a suit actually pending against them for |12,000.</p>
    <p id="b639-3" data-blocks='[["BL_639.4",639,[170,782,1146,421]]]'>7. Abraham Epstein sold and released unto his brother, without any further consideration, all of the interest that he might have in the Fenkart matter, either in merchandise or results of litigation, in consideration of his brother taking care of the indebtedness which might be due by the partnership to Fenkart, and knew at the time that there was a dispute about the Fenkart matter.</p>

    <p id="b641-3" data-blocks='[["BL_641.4",641,[168,565,1145,469]]]'>5. While the trustee in bankruptcy succeeds to the rights of the bankrupt as of the time of adjudication, (and under Section 47 A (2) of the amendments of the Act of 1910, the rights of a trustee are equal to the rights of a lien creditor) yet, as there were no creditors of Abraham Epstein at the time of the settlement of the affairs of the parties, the trustee’s rights do not rise any higher than the bankrupt’s at the time of the adjudication.</p>
    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[168,1056,1145,252]]]'>6.

    <p id="b641-6" data-blocks='[["BL_641.7",641,[166,1547,1146,535]]]'>8. As Abraham Epstein had equal opportunity to see what was going on, and as there was no undue means used for the purpose of preventing him from ascertaining the value of the Fenkart goods; and as he was at the time of the settlement a man of sound mind, and had full knowledge of all of the assets of the copartnership, and as the settlement was made without any duress and no fraud was practiced or attempted to be practiced upon him, he is therefore, bound by the assignment and release executed by him on September 28, 1908.</p>
