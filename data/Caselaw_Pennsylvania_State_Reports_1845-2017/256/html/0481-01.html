Roth the premises known as No. 221 Fifth avenue, Pittsburgh, for the term of four years and seven months, at the rental of $1,250 per month for the first three months, and $1,629.40 per month for the balance of the term, making the total rental $88,476. At the same time the defendant, Joseph Klein, executed a bond to plaintiff in the sum of $4,000, conditioned for the faithful performance by the lessee of all the covenants and agreements in the lease; and a further condition to the effect that upon recovery on the bond an account should be stated between Rafferty and Roth and if it thereby appeared that plaintiff had received more money than he would if Roth had faithfully kept the covenants of the lease, the overplus to be returned to defendant. In December, 1912, a petition in involuntary bankruptcy was presented in the United States Court against Mr. Roth, and the Commonwealth Trust Company of Pittsburgh was appointed receiver and later trustee of his estate. On January 18, 1913, the receiver sold the merchandise and fixtures on the premises for <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>$17,349.79. Mr. Roth seems to have paid the rent in full to January 1, 1913; and plaintiff’s statement avers that he made default in payment of tbe rent of $1,629.40 per month for the months of January, February, March and April, 1913, by reason of which he claims to recover in this suit the $4,000 specified in the bond, with interest thereon from May 1, 1913; a copy of the bond and lease being attached to the statement.</p>

    <blockquote id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[267,1157,1145,152]]]'>“First. Said estate is indebted to said claimant for only one month’s rent, to wit, January, 1913, in the sum of $1,629.40.</blockquote>

It also contains an averment that shortly after the sale of the merchandise and fixtures, the plaintiff, for a valuable consideration, made a contract permitting the assignees of the purchaser of the merchandise, etc., to keep the same on the premises until such time as plaintiff would require possession thereof, pursuant to which they retained possession of the premises for about one month; and further:</p>

    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[266,847,1147,805]]]'>The referee in bankruptcy had jurisdiction to adjudicate the rent claim as between plaintiff and the estate of Moritz L.

However, the suggestion of his counsel that the matter adjudicated by the referee Avas limited to so much of plaintiff’s claim as was preferred, may be shown to be well founded. The liability of the surety is not greater than that of the principal: United States v. Allsbury, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20U.S.%20188" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="71 U.S. 188">71 U. S. 188</a>.

As the rent for January of that year has been paid, it would seem that the defendant would not be liable in any event beyond the rent for February and March, 1913, less whatever plaintiff may have received for the use of said premised during those months for the storage of merchandise, etc., as <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>above mentioned. There is not, so far as appears, any matter between the original lessor and lessee requiring an accounting, and so the clause above referred to in the bond with reference thereto does not seem here important. The case is such that the rights of the parties can be best determined by a trial, where all the facts and circumstances may be developed.</p>
