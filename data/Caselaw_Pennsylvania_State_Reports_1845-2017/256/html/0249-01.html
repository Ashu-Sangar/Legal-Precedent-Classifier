Defendant has a four track railway system extending westwardly from Pittsburgh along the north bank of the Ohio river, on which, about twelve miles out of the city, Glen Osborne Station is located, the depot buildings be<a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>ing on the north side of the tracks. On the south side opposite the depot there is a platform some three hundred feet long for the accommodation of eastbound passengers; on it there is a shelter shed. The eastbound and westbound tracks are separated by a fence. Mrs. Montalini, herein called the plaintiff, took passage on one of defendant’s eastbound trains at Ambridge for her home in Glen Osborne. In alighting therefrom plaintiff was injured by falling on the platform. She had in her arms a four months’ old child and a small package. The accident happened about 4: 30 p. m. The train consisted of an engine and four coaches, and had stopped to receive and discharge passengers. The conductor knew that plaintiff intended to leave, the train at Glen Osborne. Her testimony was to the effect that as she came down the car steps and was about to pass to the platform the train started forward with a sudden jerk, as the result of which she was thrown and injured. She was corroborated to some extent by the testimony of four other witnesses, who claim to have seen the accident from a distance. Much doubt was thrown upon the evidence of some of these Avitnesses.</p>

And further if plaintiff did not exercise proper care and it wa’s through her negligence, or she contributed in any manner to this accident, then she cannot recover; that to voluntarily attempt to get on or off a moving train is negligence; and if plaintiff attempted to alight from the train, after it had started, she was herself to blame and cannot recover no matter how guilty the defendant may be of negligence.
