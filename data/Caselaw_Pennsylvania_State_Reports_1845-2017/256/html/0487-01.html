At .the hearing of a petition to charge certain real estate of the decedent with the payment of such legacy, it appeared that the petition was not filed until 28 years after the testator’s death and until 24 years after the petitioner became of age; that the owners of real estate sought to be charged had never acknowledged that the land was subject to such charge, and that no demand had theretofore been made upon them. <em>Held, </em>(1) the legacy became a charge on the land at the time of testator’s death and was presently demandable; (2) petitioner’s claim was barred by the Act of 1855 and the petition should have been dismissed.</p>

Mrs. Stephenson may never have paid her granddaughter any moneys expressly to apply on said legacy; but Miss <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>Lewis was seventeen years old when testator died, and for ten years thereafter lived with and was supported by her grandmother, including her board, clothing, college education, etc. And the court below finds upon competent evidence that $2,500 were so expended and should be credited on the legacy. Mrs. Stephenson exhausted the personal estate and left practically nothing. The residuary estate, of which she had the life use under the will, included a farm of sixty acres in Allegheny County, which, subject to such life estate, vested in testator’s heirs at law. When she became of age, Miss Lewis and the executrix discussed the question .of the legacy and obtained legal advice to the effect that, because of the blending of real and personal estate in said residuary clause of the will, her legacy was a charge upon the farm and would be paid on sale or partition thereof. Maggie J. Lewis, now Mrs. Teets, the petitioner in this case, inherited and owns one-fourth of the farm and the balance was inherited and is owned by respondents. This proceeding was brought in 1915, praying that said legacy be decreed a charge upon the above mentioned farm and payable out of the samé.</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[248,1537,1149,643]]]'>After a full hearing, the court below granted the prayer of petitioner as to the $2,500 found to be still unpaid on said'legacy, with interest thereon from the death of the executrix. There is no evidence that petitioner, prior to filing her petition in this case, made any claim or demand upon the respondents for the payment of said legacy, or that they made any payment thereon or any declaration or acknowledgment of the existence thereof, except, as we understand the facts, the question of this legacy was mentioned in reference to a proposed partition of the farm a short time before the beginning of this proceeding.</p>

    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[197,1332,1149,861]]]'>By the will the executrix is constituted a trustee in effect to collect and deposit said legacy and use it for petitioner’s benefit; and it became a charge upon the land if ever at testator’s death and presently demand-able.

And it was not within the power of Mrs. Stephenson, as life tenant or executrix, to extend or enlarge the lien of said legacy as against respondents’ land; and so far as appears she never attempted to do so. Her payments or acknowledgments znight bind her own interest but not that of the heirs.
