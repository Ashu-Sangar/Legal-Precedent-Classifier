    <p id="b432-11" data-blocks='[["BL_432.18",432,[238,1638,1145,371]]]'>Plaintiff’s husband, John Falyk, was killed while in the employ of defendant railroad company on July 4, 1915. He was and for over four years had been in such employ as a car cleaner in defendant’s yard, which extends between Thirty-first and Thirty-third streets, Pittsburgh, where its passenger cars are transferred between the east and the west, in interstate commerce.</p>
    <p id="b432-12" data-blocks='[["BL_432.19",432,[237,2019,1142,263]]]'>It is the custom for gangs of men to clean the cars while standing there awaiting transfer. Among the tracks in the yard is No. 31, where a west bound baggage car was placed on that day, and to which the gang foreman called Mr. Falyk’s attention.</p>
    <p id="b432-13" data-blocks='[["BL_432.20",432,[240,2292,1140,101]],["BL_433.1",433,[157,339,1166,1357]]]'>At the same time there was an east bound combination car for passengers and baggage standing on the same <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>track east of the baggage car; and between them was an open space of from three to four feet. Both were vestibule steel cars with end doors and buffers or diaphragms of the width of about three and one-half feet; and on each side of the diaphragm, at the height of some four feet from the rail, was a ledge or sill of the width of about seven and one-half inches extending outward to near the side of the car. The vestibules project so far be-, yond the sills that when the cars are coupled there is ample room for a workman to stand upon or between the ledges. The outside of the car is cleaned by wiping it off with waste or other like substance. The deceased, as was his duty, proceeded to wipe off the baggage car and began on the end next the combination car. The tracks there are on a slight grade descending toward the west and cars are started at the east end of the yard and then drift or drop down to the west. On this occasion a coach with four sleeping cars attached was so started or shunted down said track in charge of a brakeman for the purpose of getting the combination car. The cars ran nearly 700 feet without undue speed and under the control of the brakeman, and coupled to said combination car thereby moving it sufficiently to crush and kill Mr. Balyk, who was caught between the diaphragm of it and that of the baggage car on which he was working.</p>
    <p id="b433-3" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[169,1706,1149,480]]]'>No one saw the accident and just how he came to be between the buffers or diaphragms does not appear. It was not necessary for him to occupy such a position in cleaning the ends of the cars, unless engaged in cleaning the vestibule doors; and whether it was a part of his duty so to do was a disputed question in the case. While at work on the end of the baggage car he was facing west and not where he could see the approaching cars or where he could be seen by the brakeman.</p>

Formerly, pursuant to a rule of defendant, a blue flag was placed upon a car by day and a blue light at night to indicate that work was being done thereon and that it-must not be disturbed ; but in October, 1913, this rule was abrogated by defendant as unnecessary, so far as it applied or was construed to apply to car cleaners, except as to those engaged in that work by the use of ladders, trestles or scaffolding. Such abrogation of the rule was by letter from the superintendent to those in charge of the workmen. The cars in question being engaged in interstate commerce, this action to recover for the death of the deceased was brought by his administratrix under the Act of Congress, known as the Federal Employers’ Liability Act.</p>
    <p id="b434-4" data-blocks='[["BL_434.4",434,[252,1096,1144,367]]]'>The trial judge properly instructed the jury, as provided in said act, that contributory negligence if found would reduce the damages but not wholly defeat the action; and also submitted to the jury the question of defendant’s negligence and that of the assumption of risk by the deceased. The verdict was for the plaintiff, on which judgment was entered.</p>

The general rule seems to be that: “It is true the’master is not responsible for accidents, occurring to his servant, from ordinary risks and dangers which are incident to the business in which he is engaged; for, in such case, the contract is presumed to be made with reference to such risks. But, on the other hand, where the master voluntarily subjects his servant to dangers, such as, in good faith, he ought to provide against, he is liable for any accident arising therefrom......The servant does not stand on the same footing with the master. His primary duty is obedience, and if, when in the discharge of that duty, he is damaged, through the neglect of the master, it is but meet that he should be recompensed......The employer is bound to furnish and maintain suitable instrumentalities for the <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>work or duty which he requires of his employees, and, failing in this, he is liable for any damages flowing from such neglect of duty”: Patterson v.

It seems to be a correct statement of the law that: “Where coemployees are distant from each other and it is dangerous for one to have another continue at his work, he who is subject to the peril not being-in a position to ascertain the true conditions, it is the duty of the employer to frame and promulgate such rules and regulations as will afford safety to employees”: O’Rourke v.

The necessity for such precaution seems yet to be a mooted question. The situation of a car cleaner is entirely different from and less hazardous than that of an inspector who goes under the car, hence this case does not seem to be controlled by that of Marean v. N.
