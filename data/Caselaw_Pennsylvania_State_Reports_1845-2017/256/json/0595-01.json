For this reason the judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto is affirmed.",

Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company.\nNegligence \u2014 Street railways \u2014 Horse and wagon \u2014 Bight angle collision \u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Judgment for defendant n. o. v.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband caused by a right angle collision between a wagon driven by the deceased and one of defendant\u2019s cars, judgment was properly entered for defendant n. o. v., where it appeared that if deceased had looked before attempting to cross the track he would have seen the car coming rapidly towards him and so close that he could not have crossed in safety.\nArgued Jan. 22,1917.\nAppeal, No. 256, Jan. T., 1916, by plaintiff, from judgment of C. P. No. 5, Philadelphia Co., Sept. T., 1914, No. 3753, for defendant non obstante veredicto in case of Katharine Weber, Administratrix of the Estate of Franz Weber, Deceased, v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Potter, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for death of plaintiff\u2019s husband. Before Staples, P. J., specially presiding.\nFrom the record it appeared that Franz Weber, the original plaintiff, was driving a two horse team attached to a brewery wagon east on Cambria street, in the City of Philadelphia. When he reached Forty-first street he started to drive across the track of the defendant company. Just after his horses\u2019 heads were over the track he turned them north on Forty-first street in an attempt to avoid a collision with one of defendant\u2019s cars coming' north on said track. The horses and wagon cleared the tracks but the car struck the hub of the right front wheel of the wagon throwing the plaintiff therefrom and causing the injuries from which his death ensued.\nFurther facts appear by the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $7,045. The court subsequently entered judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in entering judgment for defendant n. o. v.\nB. W. Archibald, Jr., of Ehrlich, & Archibald, for appellant.\nHoward H. Yocum and Charles Biddle, for appellee, were not heard.\nFebruary 26, 1917:"
