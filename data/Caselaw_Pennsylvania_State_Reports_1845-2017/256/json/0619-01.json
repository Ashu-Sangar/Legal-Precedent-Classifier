Her election to take against his will was resisted in the court below by his executrix and the residuary devisees and legatees, on the ground that she had, by adulterous conduct, forfeited her right to so elect. The adjudicating judge failed to find that she had been guilty of adultery, and our examination of the testimony offered to sustain the charge has satisfied us that no error was committed in failing to find that the accusation had been sustained. The appeal is dismissed, at appellants\u2019 costs, on the brief but all sufficient opinion of the learned court below dismissing the exceptions to the adjudication.",

Munich, also Residuary Devisees and Legatees under the Will of Joseph E. Munich, Deceased, from decree of O. C. Philadelphia Co., July T., 1915, No. 63, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Joseph E. Munich, Deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Stewart, Moschzisker, Frazer and Walling, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication. Before Lamorelle, J.\nThe facts appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court and in the following opinion of G-ummex, J., on exceptions to adjudication:\nA careful reading of the testimony in this case convinces us that the auditing judge could not have found otherwise than he did, as the facts and circumstances relied upon to establish the guilt of the wife do not justify such a conclusion.\nIt seems unnecessary to add anything to what has been said by the auditing judge; it is essential to the exceptants\u2019 case that adultery should be found affirmatively, and failing this, it would benefit no one to discuss what would have been the effect upon the distribution if adultery had been proved.\nThe exceptions are dismissed, and the adjudication confirmed absolutely.\nThe court dismissed the exceptions. Frances Bowers, Margaret Munich, Caroline H. Munich and Florian E. Munich appealed.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing the exceptions.\nJules E. Pereyra, for appellants.\nDaniel J.
