    "head_matter": "Palen v. International Lumber & Development Co., Appellant.\nContracts \u2014 Stoclc companies \u2014 Insurance feature \u2014 Right ip recover moneys'paid in \u2014 Waiver\u2014Estoppel.\nDecedent, in her lifetime, made certain contracts with the defendant in the years 1906 and 1907, by which the defendant agreed .to cultivate certain plantations until January 1, 1912, and she agreed to pay a sum of money upon entering into the contracts and a stipulated amount each month until the stock of the company for which she subscribed was paid for in full. It was provided in case she died at any time during the life of the contract, that the defendant would, within sixty days after proof of death, refund all 'money which had been paid by her. There was also a provision that the contracts might be carried out if the heirs, executors and administrators elected so to do, and they might accept full paid stock certificates for the amount paid in. Decedent died July 29, 1911, before the expiration of the contracts, after having paid into the company $1,300. On February 15, 1912, tbc plaintiff, the eseeutrix of the decedent, through her attorney, requested defendant to supply the forms desired for proof of the death of decedent, and informed the defendant of the necessity of converting the certificates into cash in order to settle the estate. Defendant failed to furnish the blanks, and replied to the letter that the insurance feature of the contracts had expired on January 1, 1912, and was no longer in force or effect. Plaintiff accepted dividends paid by the defendant in October, 1911, and February, 1912, the latter however not being paid until February 20, 1912, and having accrued prior to January 1, 1912, the dividends being on the contract but not on the stock. In an action to recover the money paid in by the decedent, held that a recovery for the plaintiff was properly allowed; there was not estoppel by waiver.\nArgued Jan. 9, 1917.\nAppeal, No. 442, Jan. T., 1916, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 5, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1912, No. 444, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Anna Palen, Executrix of Elizabeth Palen, Deceased, v. International Lumber and Development Company and John O. Sheatz, Receiver.\nBefore Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart, Mosci-izisker and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit to recover moneys paid. Before Martin, P. J.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion by the court below:\nThis cause came on for trial before M\u00e1rtir, P. J., the 6th day of October, 1915. The. defendant offered no defense, but moved the court for binding instructions in favor of the defendant, which, after argument in support of the motion, was refused, for the reasons stated by the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury.\nThere was no dispute as to the facts in the case. Elizabeth Palen, in her lifetime, made certain contracts with the defendant in the years 1906 and 1907, by which the defendant agreed to cultivate certain plantations until January 1, 1912,' and she agreed to pay a sum of money upon entering into the contracts and a stipulated amount each month until the stock of the company for which she subscribed was paid for in full. It was provided in case she died at any time during the life of the contract, that the defendant would, within sixty days after proof of death, refund all money which had been paid by her. There was also a provision that the contracts might be carried out if the heirs, executors and administrators elected so to do, and they might accept full paid stock certificates for the amount paid in.\nElizabeth Palen died July 29, 1911, before the expiration of the contracts, after having'paid into the company thirteen hundred dollars.\nOn February 15, 1912, the plaintiff, who is the executrix of Elizabeth Palen, through her attorney, requested defendant to supply the forms desired for proof of the death of Elizabeth Palen, and informed the defendant of the necessity of converting the certificates into cash in order to settle the estate. Defendant failed to furnish the blanks, and replied to the letter that the insurance feature of the contracts had expired on January 1,1912, and was no longer in force or effect.\nIt was contended that within the period of about seven months which elapsed from the date of the death of Elizabeth Palen until the request was made for the blanks to furnish proofs of death, the plaintiff, by accepting dividends paid by the defendant in October, 1911, and February, 1912, subsequent to the death of Elizabeth Palen, waived her right to the withdrawal of the money demanded, and is estopped from claiming it, and is relegated to the exchange for certificates of stock, which is her only right under the terms of the contract.\nAny value as evidence of the acceptance of the dividends which the defendant voluntarily sent to the plaintiff \u201cwas neutralized so far as it intended to prove ah election on her part to continue the contract by the letter which her attorney sent informing the defendant of the necessity for the money and requesting forms or blanks for the proofs of death.\u201d It does not appear that the proofs of death were sent, as the defendant was under \u2022obligation to send, The plaintiff\u2019s testatrix had died during the life of the contracts, which was until January 1, 1912, she having died on the 29th day of July, 1911. The alternative provision was:\n\u201cIn case of the death of the party of the second part, at any time during the life of this contract, the party of the first part agrees within sixty days after proof of the death of the said party of the second part has been duly made to the party of the first part, and upon surrender of this contract, to refund to the heirs, executors or administrators of the party of the second part, all moneys that may' have been paid by the party of the second part to the said party of the first part upon this contract prior to the death of said party of the second part, and this contract thereupon shall become null and void; but the full force and effect of this contract may be carried out, provided the heirs, executors or administrators of the said party of the second part, deceased, shall so elect, or said heirs, executors or administrators may take contracts for full paid stock certificates for the amount paid, which amount shall be entitled to dividends. Certificates for such shares shall.be issued at the end of the development period.\u201d\nThe notice of the death must be within a reasonable time. It was not evidenced that February 15j 1912, when the notice was sent, was not within a reasonable time. The status of the parties was fixed by the death of Elizabeth Palen on July 29, 1911, and there was no right upon the part of the defendant company to repudiate its original undertaking on the basis of which it had secured the contracts of the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, dated January 16, 1906, and January 1, 1907. The insurance feature was in effect on July 29, 1911, and did not expire by limitation until January 1, 1912. The attempted repudiation of the liability of the defendant was on February 15, 1912. The demand for the refund was made before the dividend was sent, and its acceptance cannot be considered as an election to take the stock, which had not been issued at that time, and the payment was \u201con the contract\u201d and not on the stock of the company, and the payment had been due prior to January 1, 1912, the defendant delaying the payment until after that date.\nWe believe the clause:\n\u201cIn case of the death of the party of the second part at any time during the life of this contract, the party of the first part agrees within sixty days after proof of the\ndeath of the said party of the second part......and upon\nsurrender of this contract, to refund to the......executors ........all moneys that may have been paid......\nupon this contract prior to the death......and this con-\ntract thereupon shall become null and void\u201d is most pertinent.\nThe contract then contains a further provision providing that the contract \u201cmay\u201d be carried out, provided the representatives of the decedent \u201cshall so elect.\u201d ' There was no evidence of such an election. On the contrary, \u2022 the defendant made no attempt to prove an election or to offer any testimony whatever. 1\n\u201cThe only evidence from which the defendant argues an election is the acceptance by the plaintiff of the dividend in February, 1912. This can have absolutely no weight as evidence of an election, since this dividend was not received until February 20, 1912, and the plaintiff had on February 16th, by letter from her counsel, made demand on the defendant for the return of the money and the carrying out of the insurance feature of the contract. The taking of the dividend \u2018on the contract\u2019 can have no bearing whatever, therefore, as evidence of an election.\u201d\nThe letter of February 20, 1912, \u201cTo the Shareholders of the International Lumber and Development Company,\u201d recites:\n\u201cEnclosed you will find check to cover the quarterly two per cent, on the money you have paid in on your contracts. This payment is on the contracts, not on stock in the company.\u201d\nIndeed, it would appear from this letter that the contracts had not even been exchanged for the certificate of stock to which the contract-holders would have been entitled, and it was only the payment thereafter to be made which \u201cwill be as dividends on stock, rather than as interest on amount paid on your contracts, which has been the case heretofore.\u201d\nWe have carefully considered the authorities which the learning and commendable industry of the counsel for the defendant company and its receiver has submitted in their carefully prepared brief, but we are not persuaded they show an intent upon the part of the plaintiff executrix to waive the right of the testatrix, Elizabeth Palen. The delay in asserting the right was not unreasonable, and we have already shown the payments accepted were not as dividends upon stock, which stock had never been formally issued. It was testified :\n\u201cIt was the custom of the company to pay quarterly dividends during the development period.\u201d\nWe cannot find that the effectiveness of Mr. West\u2019s letter, as to defining the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cposition with regard to the contracts\u201d was affected by his reference to the three other contracts not sued upon.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $1,570.53 and judgment thereon. Defendant appealed.\nError assigned was the refusal of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto.\nHarry Reiss Axelroth, with him Olin Bryan, for appellant.\nJ. M. Mitoheson, with him W. Nelson L. West, for appellee.\nJanuary 29, 1917:"
