T., 1916, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 5, Philadelphia Co., Dec. T., 1915, No. 2818, discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in case of The Berg Company v. I. P. Thomas & Son Company.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Stewart and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a contract for the sale of personal property.\nRule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nThe contract upon which the action was brought was, in part, as follows:\nPhiladelphia, Pa., May 19, 1915.\nI. P. Thomas & Son Company, Philadelphia, Pa., have sold and The Berg Company, Philadelphia, Pa., have bought\nFrom seven-hundred to one-thousand tons (700-to-1,000) Acid-Phosphate, at buyer\u2019s option, quantity to be declared Aug. \u2014 15th, 1915, guaranteed to contain fourteen per cent.

After 545 tons had thus been delivered I. P. Thomas & Son Co. on November 3, 1915, notified the Berg Company that it would not deliver more than the minimum quantity (700 tons) mentioned in the contract. The price of phosphate had in the meantime risen in the market and the Berg Company having demanded the whole 1,000 tons, brought suit to recover $1,575, the loss it suffered by reason of the I. P. Thomas & Son Co.\u2019s refusal to deliver the remaining 300 tons.\nIn discharging the rule for judgment, the court, per Staake, J., filed the following opinion:\n\u201cThe statement of claim alleges a sale of 700 to 1,000 tons acid phosphate at buyers\u2019 option, quantity to be declared August 15, 1915.\n\u201cThis was a sale of 700 tons, with an option permitting plaintiff to demand delivery of an additional 250 tons or any part thereof. It was to be acted upon August 15th, or as that day fell upon a Sunday, the 16th at the outside. It Avas not exercised on either date, and the right ended.\n\u201cThe letter written by plaintiff dated August 16th, it is averred in the affidavit of defense, was not deposited in the mail until August 18th. The option having expired, this letter was in the nature of a new offer. It was not accepted by defendants, and their silence did not make a neA5L.contrar.tjTr prevent the expiration of the option.\u201d\nThe court discharged the rule. Plaintiff appealed.\nError assigned was in discharging the rule.\nFrank P. Prichard, with him John G. Johnson, for appellant.\nJames Collins Jones, for appellee.\nFebruary 26, 1917:"
