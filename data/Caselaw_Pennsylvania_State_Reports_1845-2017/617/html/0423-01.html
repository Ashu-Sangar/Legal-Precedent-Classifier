According to the defendants, the Pennsylvania General Assembly carefully crafted the limitation on post-merger remedies to protect management decisions and attract business to the Commonwealth. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for Appellants in <em>Mitchell, </em><a href="/f3d/656/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="656 F.3d 201" data-case-ids="3831933" data-case-paths="/f3d/656/0201-01">656 F.3d 201</a>, at 16 (“Appellant incorrectly understands Pennsylvania’s carefully balanced statutory procedure, which was enacted as part of a deliberate legislative decision both to promote corporate flexibility and certainty and to provide greater protection to directors and officers[.]”).

They asserted, moreover, that Mitchell has sought to confuse this reasoning by'relying almost entirely on an aggressive reading of a single <em>case </em>— Herskowitz—in which the lawsuit in question was filed prior to the merger.
