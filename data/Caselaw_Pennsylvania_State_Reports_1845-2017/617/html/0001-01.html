As premiums for annuities are always fixed, it is impossible for members to recoup assessments for annuities through premium increases; their only option is the tax credit, using the proportionate part factor. To include annuities in the denominator but not in the numerator of the proportionate part factor means the two sections of the statute are in contradiction to each other. The consequence of interpreting § 991.1707 and § 991.1711 in isolation, and construing § 991.1711(a) and (b) separately, leads to the oxymoronic result of providing tax credit for a group of policies, then excluding that group from the tax credit formula.

The OISA agrees with Allstate that the General Assembly could not have intended to treat annuities differently from other insurances, especially life insurance, and thus finds it "difficult to believe the legislature meant to accomplish such a curious prohibition [of annuities from the numerator] through a tacit omission.” OISA Op. at 1081-82. An annuity is starkly different from life insurance, however. Annuities are generally contracts between an investor and insurance companies; life insurance policies provide for the needs of beneficiaries upon the insured’s death. Annuities are often times paid to the insured himself, <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>during his life time; the proceeds of insurance policies are paid to survivors upon the insured’s death. While irrelevant in a plain language analysis, these differences could be why the General Assembly did not include annuities in the subsection (b) defined numerator. Respectfully, the point is that the plain language is our "best indication of legislative intent,” and that plain language clearly states that only guaranteed premiums of life, health, and accident insurance shall be included in the subsection (b) numerator.</p>

Accordingly, we would further remand this appeal to the Commonwealth Court for consideration of any remaining and preserved constitutional claims.</p>
