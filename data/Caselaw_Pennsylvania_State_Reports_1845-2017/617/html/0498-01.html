In her complaint, White alleged that she refinanced the mortgage on the home she owned on October 30, 2002, obtaining title insurance at the closing, and refinanced the mortgage on her home once again on February 17, 2005, purchasing title insurance from Conestoga. She further alleged that, even though she satisfied the criteria for Conestoga’s Refinance Rate of $406.63 for the title insurance she purchased in 2005, Conestoga charged her the higher rate of $508.28, thereby unlawfully pocketing $101.65 of her money. White also alleged that Conestoga’s agents could have learned from documents tendered at closings that homeowners, like herself, were eligible for either one of the Conestoga’s reduced rates, but knowingly and intentionally failed to avail themselves of that information, in order to charge the homeowners a higher premium. In addition, she averred that Conestoga engaged in a pervasive, long-standing scheme of deception in which it willfully refused to apply its Reissue and Refinance Rates to the financial detriment of hundreds of purported class members.</p>

Conestoga asserts that the TIA is one such statute, in that it obligated the Company to charge White no more than its applicable filed rate for the title insurance she purchased, and provides her with a process by which she may secure redress, if she establishes, as she averred in her complaint, that the Company should have charged her a lower rate.

Conestoga also challenges the court’s construction of the TIA’s remedy as permissive, based on the General Assembly’s use of the word “may” in Section 744(b), and its policy decision in Section 748 to allow for cumulative penalties. <em>See </em>40 P.S. §§ 910-44(b), 948.

While the General Assembly indicated its intent, in Section 748 of the TIA, to override the reluctance historically displayed by the courts to impose cumulative penalties — specifically, with respect to the Commissioner’s authority, <em>see supra </em>note 12 — it did not indicate a corresponding intent, anywhere in the statute, to override the rule it articulated in Section 1504 of the SCA regarding the exclusivity of statutory remedies, or this Court’s jurisprudence in this area. <em>See Geffen v.

The Commissioner posits that the TIA’s procedure was intended to correct nothing more than the good faith, but mistaken, application of a title insurer's filed rates and was not enacted, as was the private right of action in the UTPCPL, for the purpose of compensating consumers victimized by an insurer’s deceptive trade practices.

The Majority, without challenging appellant’s view, undertakes a lengthy discussion intended “to clarify” the question of whether such a distinction does or should exist, including in its discussion criticism of an existing case. The Majority describes the interplay between Section 1504 and the judicial doctrine of administrative exhaustion, holds that they are one legal consideration, and lists seemingly settled jurisprudential exceptions to the general rule. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 506-07 n. 10, 58 A.3d at 725-26 n. 10. Subsequently, the Majority concludes that appellee — the plaintiff below — has not in her complaint, and does not on appeal, rely on any such exception to argue the inapplicability of Section 1504. <em>Id. </em>at 522-24, 53 A.3d at 735-36.</p>
    <p id="b565-4" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[229,1125,1151,453]]]'>Meanwhile, in footnote 11, the Majority discusses whether Section 1504 is jurisdictional or prudential and collects cases which ascribe to either one or the other view. The Majority suggests that the distinction may be relevant to whether the Court could address the issue <em>sua sponte. </em>Ultimately, however, the Majority concludes that the conflict need not be resolved because appellant preserved the issue for appeal, and fails to offer any other purpose for its observations. <em>Id. </em>at 507-08 n. 11, 53 A.3d at 726-27 n. 11.</p>

Strict enforcement of that proposition is perhaps an impossible task, and, in my view, there may be perfectly good reasons for the Court to reach out and offer guidance beyond points actually accepted and briefed. Indeed, it has been my position that “the question of what issues are properly reachable in an appeal is a prudential matter, not an absolute, and it is not surprising that the members of the Court, reasonably and in good faith, may reach different conclusions when presented with a particular factual and legal matrix.” <em>Freed v.

The Majority engages these issues after simply noting appellant’s uncertainty regarding a related question on the interplay between Section 1504 and the judicial doctrine of administrative exhaustion. The Majority offers no insight either into any interest by the parties in pursuing the broader issues it addresses in footnotes 10 and 11, grants the parties no opportunity to brief the relevant points, and does not explain the necessity for the <em>dictum.</em>

    <p id="b566-4" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[271,926,1151,684]]]'>In this particular situation, I believe that the perceived necessity for clarification is not sufficient to overcome prudential concerns in addressing points outside the scope of a discretionary appeal. <em>Accord Harsh v. Petroll, </em><a href="/pa/584/0606-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="584 Pa. 606" data-case-ids="988551" data-case-paths="/pa/584/0606-01">584 Pa. 606</a>, <a href="/a2d/887/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="887 A.2d 209" data-case-ids="8998420,988551" data-case-paths="/a2d/887/0209-01,/pa/584/0606-01">887 A.2d 209</a>, 216 n. 16 (2005) (“While we acknowledge amicus’s points in these regards and the desirability of additional clarification, the points are outside the scope of this limited appeal.”). The parameters of the exhaustion doctrine (whether statutory or prudential) are of sufficient complexity, and the factual circumstances giving rise to exhaustion issues of sufficient variety, that I would not speak broadly or correctively in the area unless in the context of a case where we have a focused issue and targeted advocacy along those lines.</p>
    <p id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.5",566,[268,1633,1153,735]],["BL_567.1",567,[216,335,1156,1069]]]'>For example, footnote 10 lists the exceptions to Section 1504 in cases where the administrative remedy: “was unable to address the legal issues presented and effectively provide relief to all those in a position to seek it and presented a substantial question of constitutional import or would result in duplicative and piecemeal litigation likely to yield inconsistent results, or would lead to irreparable harm.” Maj. Op. at 508 n. 10, 53 A.3d at 726 n. 10 (citing, <em>inter alia, Kowenhoven v. County of Allegheny, </em><a href="/pa/587/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="587 Pa. 545" data-case-ids="3466842" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0545-01">587 Pa. 545</a>, <a href="/pa/587/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="901 A.2d 1003" data-case-ids="3466842,8419141" data-case-paths="/pa/587/0545-01,/a2d/901/1003-01">901 A.2d 1003</a> (2006)). Derived by the Majority from caselaw, this mere listing does not capture the multifaceted calculus, of which <em>Kowenhoven </em>is illustrative, behind these decisions. In <em>Kowenhoven, </em>the majority decision, which I joined, excused compliance with Section 1504 to address a question of great constitutional impor<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>tance and avert the need for a multiplicity of duplicative lawsuits on the single, controlling legal question presented. However, as a general matter, I would not consider duplicative litigation or, separately, the simple presentation of a constitutional question sufficient grounds to bypass the salutary function of the administrative process. <em>Cf. Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, </em>— U.S.-, <a href="/us/567/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="132 S.

Accordingly, I am reticent to draw broad and non-fact specific lines of demarcation regarding instances in which the Court should find an exception to the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement. I respect that the Majority may intend its comments to be a mere recitation or a compilation of relevant sources of settled law, but they are likely to be advanced by litigants, and cited by lower courts, as broadly deciding various issues that I, for one, believe may warrant deeper consideration.</p>
