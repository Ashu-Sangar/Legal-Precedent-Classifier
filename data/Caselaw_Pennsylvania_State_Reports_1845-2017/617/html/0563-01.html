Furthermore, the Law specifically requires that — notwithstanding provisions of <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>Section 1510(b) relating to the issuance and content of the cards — PennDOT shall issue them at no cost:</p>

    <p id="b607-5" data-blocks='[["BL_607.6",607,[220,885,1153,732]]]'>However, as implementation of the Law has proceeded, PennDOT — apparently for good reason — has refused to allow such liberal access. Instead, the Department continues to vet applicants for Section 1510(b) cards through an identification process that Commonwealth officials appear to acknowledge is a rigorous one. <em>See </em>N.T. at 690, 994. Generally, the process requires the applicant to present a birth certificate with a raised seal (or a document considered to be an equivalent), a social security card, and two forms of documentation showing current residency. <em>See </em>N.T. at 467, 690, 798.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The reason why PennDOT will not implement the Law as written is that the Section 1510(b) driver’s license equivalent is a secure form of identification, which may be used, for example, to board commercial aircraft. <em>See </em>N.T. at 699-700, 728-30, 780.</p>

Furthermore, both state agencies involved appreciate that some registered voters have been and will be unable to comply with the requirements maintained by PennDOT to obtain an identification card under Section 1510(b). <em>See </em>N.T. at 713 (testimony from a deputy secretary for PennDOT that “at the end of the day there will <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>be people who will not be able to qualify for a driver’s license or a PennDOT ID card”), 749, 772, 810, 995. It is also clear to state officials that, if the Law is enforced in a manner that prevents qualified and eligible electors from voting, the integrity of the upcoming General Election will be impaired. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T. at 480.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[280,666,1150,1319]]]'>Faced with the above circumstances and the present litigation asserting that the Law will impinge on the right of suffrage, representatives of the state agencies have testified under oath that they are in the process of implementing several remedial measures on an expedited basis. Of these, the primary avenue lies in the issuance of a new, non-secure Department of State identification card, which is to be made available at PennDOT driver license centers. However, preparations for the issuance of Department of State identification cards were still underway as of the time of the evidentiary hearing in the Commonwealth Court in this case, and the cards were not slated to be made available until approximately two months before the November election. N.T. at 534, 555, 706, 784, 993. Moreover, still contrary to the Law’s liberal access requirement, applicants for a Department of State identification card may be initially vetted through the rigorous application process for a secure PennDOT identification card before being considered for a Department of State card, the latter of which is considered to be only a “safety net.” N.T. at 709, 711, 791-95 (testimony from the Commissioner of the Bureau of Commissions, Elections and Legislation that applicants who are unable to procure a PennDOT identification card will be given a telephone number to contact the Department of State to begin the process of obtaining the alternative card); <em>see also </em>N.T. at 993.</p>
    <p id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[278,2012,1152,359]],["BL_609.1",609,[229,333,1149,625]]]'>In the above landscape, Appellants have asserted a facial constitutional challenge to the Law and seek to preliminarily enjoin its implementation. They contend, most particularly, that a number of qualified members of the Pennsylvania voting public will be disenfranchised in the upcoming General Election, because — given their personal circumstances and the limitations associated with the infrastructure through which <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>the Commonwealth is issuing identification cards — these voters will not have had an adequate opportunity to become educated about the Law’s requirements and obtain the necessary identification cards. While there is a debate over the number of affected voters, given the substantial overlap between voter rolls and PennDOT’s existing ID driver/cardholder database, it is readily understood that a minority of the population is affected by the access issue. Nevertheless, there is little disagreement with Appellants’ observation that the population involved includes members of some of the most vulnerable segments of our society (the elderly, disabled members of our community, and the financially disadvantaged).</p>
    <p id="b609-5" data-blocks='[["BL_609.4",609,[229,982,1150,512]]]'>On its review, the Commonwealth Court has made a predictive judgment that the Commonwealth’s efforts to educate the voting public, coupled with the remedial efforts being made to compensate for the constraints on the issuance of a PennDOT identification card, will ultimately be sufficient to forestall the possibility of disenfranchisement. This judgment runs through the Commonwealth Court’s opinion, touching on all material elements of the legal analysis by which the court determined that Appellants are not entitled to the relief they seek.</p>
    <p id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.5",609,[228,1528,1151,574]]]'>As a final element of the background, at oral argument before this Court, counsel for Appellants acknowledged that there is no constitutional impediment to the Commonwealth’s implementation of a voter identification requirement, at least in the abstract. Given reasonable voter education efforts, reasonably available means for procuring identification, and reasonable time allowed for implementation, the Appellants apparently would accept that the State may require the presentation of an identification card as a precondition to casting a ballot. The gravamen of their challenge at this juncture lies solely in the implementation.</p>
    <p id="b609-7" data-blocks='[["BL_609.6",609,[225,2127,1152,250]],["BL_610.1",610,[272,330,1151,571]]]'>Upon review, we find that the disconnect between what the Law prescribes and how it is being implemented has created a number of conceptual difficulties in addressing the legal issues raised. Initially, the focus on short-term implementation, which has become necessary given that critical terms of the <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>statute have themselves become irrelevant, is in tension with the framing of Appellants’ challenge to the Law as a facial one (or one contesting the Law’s application across the widest range of circumstances). In this regard, however, we agree with Appellants’ essential position that if a statute violates constitutional norms in the short term, a facial challenge may be sustainable even though the statute might validly be enforced at some time in the future. Indeed, the most judicious remedy, in such a circumstance, is the entry of a preliminary injunction, which may moot further controversy as the constitutional impediments dissipate.</p>
    <p id="b610-5" data-blocks='[["BL_610.4",610,[273,925,1150,467]]]'>Overall, we are confronted with an ambitious effort on the part of the General Assembly to bring the new identification procedure into effect within a relatively short timeframe and an implementation process which has by no means been seamless in light of the serious operational constraints faced by the executive branch. Given this state of affairs, we are not satisfied with a mere predictive judgment based primarily on the assurances of government officials, even though we have no doubt they are proceeding in good faith.</p>
    <p id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.5",610,[272,1415,1153,731]]]'>Thus, we will return the matter to the Commonwealth Court to make a present assessment of the actual availability of the alternate identification cards on a developed record in light of the experience since the time the cards became available. In this regard, the court is to consider whether the procedures being used for deployment of the cards comport with the requirement of liberal access which the General Assembly attached to the issuance of PennDOT identification cards. If they do not, or if the Commonwealth Court is not still convinced in its predictive judgment that there will be no voter disenfranchisement arising out of the Commonwealth’s implementation of a voter identification requirement for purposes of the upcoming election, that court is obliged to enter a preliminary injunction.</p>

I thus fully join her excellent dissenting statement.</p>

However, a new prediction from the lower court will have no more legal significance before this Court than the existing one, and I <em>predict </em>that, once again, we will be presented with a record that establishes that many thousands — indeed, ultimately uncountable numbers — of otherwise qualified electors will lack a Photo ID for purposes of the upcoming election, and hence will be disenfranchised, despite the Commonwealth’s last ditch efforts to loosen the standards established by Act 18. In the end, it is this Court that must determine whether the Pennsylvania Constitution requires the entering of an immediate preliminary injunction prior to the November election. For the good of the electorate, and to foster respect for the judiciary and the integrity of the electoral process, I agree with Justice Todd that now is the time for this Court to make that decision.</p>

When Appellants’ lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of Act 18 placed a spotlight on these burdens and impediments, the agencies charged with implementing Act 18 began efforts, first on or about May 23, 2012, and then on or about August 27, 2012, to relax the procedures for obtaining the requisite <a href="/pa/573/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="828 A.2d 995" data-case-ids="197230,9107810" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0637-01,/a2d/828/0995-01">ID.</a> Although these efforts may be laudable, they necessarily suffer from the compressed timeframe in which they are expected to achieve the purported goals of Act 18.

Where a fundamental constitutional right is at issue — arguably the fundamental right — an implementation of even a lesser burden on the exercise of that right, ten weeks before it is to be exercised, is simply unreasonable and constitutionally insupportable. Indeed, the Commonwealth’s activities in this regard are a tacit admission that Act 18 is simply not ready for the prime time of the November 6, 2012 election.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a>

    <p id="Al4" data-blocks='[["BL_615.4",615,[222,505,1153,1001]]]'>Indeed, the Commonwealth offered no evidence below of the existence of in-person voter fraud in this state or that in-person voter fraud is likely to occur in the upcoming election. The Commonwealth’s interest in the implementation of this law, at least as concerns the November election, is somewhere from slight to symbolic. I wholeheartedly reject the arguments made by counsel for the Commonwealth before this Court that we must defer to the legislative findings and the evidence the legislature purportedly received concerning the existence or potentiality of in-person voter fraud. The Commonwealth declined to test such “evidence” in a court of law, and instead stipulated that, essentially, there was no known evidence of in-person voter fraud, and that Act 18 was not genuinely needed to combat in-person voter fraud in the November election. Stipulations have legal consequences, and the Commonwealth must live with those it entered. The purported evidence received by the legislature is thus of no moment,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a> and the balance of potential harm unquestionably weighs heavily in favor of an injunction.</p>

Notably, this Court determines that the immediate issue raised by Appellants concerns whether the implementation of Act 18 for purposes of the November 6, 2012 general election violates constitutional rights of qualified electors of this Commonwealth, which is a question distinct from that upon which the Commonwealth Court placed its basic focus: <em>ie., </em>whether a Photo ID law generally violates such rights. <em>See Per Curiam </em>Order at 5-6. The <em>Per Curiam </em>Order also correctly deter<a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>mines that any voter disenfranchisement arising out of the Commonwealth’s implementation of a Voter Photo ID requirement before the November 2012 election obliges the Commonwealth Court to enter a preliminary injunction. <em>See id. </em>at 7.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_5" id="ref_footnote_3_5">5</a> Notwithstanding the astute recognition in the <em>Per Curiam </em>Order of the Commonwealth Court’s errors and the Order’s illumination of the Commonwealth Court’s obligation to enter a preliminary injunction under certain circumstances, I believe circumstances already exist such that we should remand with the specific directive to the Commonwealth Court to immediately grant the requested preliminary injunction. I do not believe that further hearings are either necessary or appropriate.</p>

However, the legislature pointedly ignored the Commission’s recommendation that a Photo ID requirement be phased in over two federal election cycles to ease the transition from the existing system. The Carter-Baker Commission also wisely determined that confidence in our electoral process may be achieved in “a uniform voter identification system that is implemented in a way that increases, not impedes, participation.” Carter-Baker Commission (2005), at iii (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 6. Act 18, enacted in March 2012, and subsequently altered by <em>ad hoc </em>implementation procedures, which are still in flux, substantially threatens to do just the opposite. Where there is concededly no harm that will be remedied by implementing Act 18 prior to the November 2012 election, where the potential for harm to the cherished right to vote to uncountable numbers of citizens is substantially threatened, and where this harm cannot be remedied by any post-election lawsuit, contrary to <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>the Commonwealth Court’s astounding belief, the need for immediate judicial action cannot be denied.</p>

I cannot now be a party to the potential disenfranchisement of even one otherwise qualified elector, including potentially many elderly and possibly disabled veterans who fought for the rights of every American to exercise their fundamental American right to vote. While I have no argument with the requirement that all Pennsylvania voters, at some reasonable point in the future, will have to present photo identification before they may cast their ballots, it is clear to me that the reason for the urgency of implementing Act 18 prior to the November 2012 election is purely political. That has been made abundantly clear by the House Majority Leader. Exhibit 42 at R.R.2073a. I cannot in good conscience participate in a decision that so clearly has the effect of allowing politics to trump the solemn oath that I swore to uphold our Constitution. That Constitution has made the right to vote a right verging on the sacred, and that right should never be trampled by partisan politics.</p>
