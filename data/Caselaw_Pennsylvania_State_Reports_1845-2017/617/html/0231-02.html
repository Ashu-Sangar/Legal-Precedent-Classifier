The Court majority first held that the declaratory judgment action was justiciable. The Court noted that a declaratory judgment inquiry encompassed “the ascertainment of the rights of the parties and whether protection for the asserted right can be judicially molded.” <em>Id. </em>at 762. The Court then observed that because the General Assembly’s control of fiscal matters might in some circumstances be limited by the Constitution, the “financing of state institutions has not been incontrovertibly and in all cases relegated to the direction and control of the General Assembly.” <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that the action merely required a determination of whether the General Assembly had imposed obligations upon the County to fund Pennsylvania’s court system, and if so, whether that obligation was constitutional. Since the rights of the parties “were able to be determined by construction of the relevant statutes and constitutional provisions,” the Court held, the case was justiciable and the Commonwealth Court erred in entering judgment upon preliminary objections. <em>Id. </em>at 762.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[282,1359,1152,738]]]'>Turning to the merits, the Court first recognized that, “it is apparent that the General Assembly intended to create a legislative scheme in which funding of the various judicial districts was primarily a responsibility of the counties, and that these responsibilities" include the funding of salaries, services and accommodations for the judicial system.” <em>Id. </em>at 763 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 2302, 3541, 3544, 3721 and 3722, and 16 P.S. § 1623). The Court then addressed the question of whether this obligation that the General Assembly placed upon the counties was constitutional. The Court held that it was not constitutional, because the “unified” judicial system envisioned in Article V, Section 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires Commonwealth funding of all courts, including the county courts of common pleas. <em>Id. </em>at 765.</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[281,2122,1152,252]],["BL_277.1",277,[241,344,1150,1172]]]'>In explaining its holding, the Court first emphasized the last sentence of Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution, which provides that “All courts and justices of the peace and their jurisdiction shall be in this unified judicial system.” Pa. Const. art. I, § 5. The Court then consulted the dictionary definition <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>of the term “unify,” which means “to cause to be one: make into a coherent group or whole: give unity to: HARMONIZE.” <em>Id. </em>at 763 (quoting Webster’s Third New International Dictionary). The Court then noted that Allegheny County’s claim, in essence, was that the statutory system requiring the counties to fund their courts was not harmonious, but was instead “fraught with dissention [sic] and conflict which produces fragmentation.” To illustrate this point, the County had focused on the fact that its authority to determine the number of employees necessary to the functioning of the local courts and their compensation, and the fact that the County is the employer for purposes of collective bargaining, “often embroil county authorities in disputes with the various judicial districts” over matters embracing, <em>inter alia, </em>collective bargaining rights, enforceability of labor arbitration awards, and whether the County’s mandatory retirement system should cover court employees. <em>Id. </em>at 763-64 (characterizing County’s argument). The Court then added that, in addition to disputes over collective bargaining and pensions, “there is a history of strife between the various judicial districts and the counties regarding funding [for court operations].” <em>Id. </em>at 764 (citing three examples of litigation that reached this Court).</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[238,1541,1153,848]],["BL_278.1",278,[278,344,1150,625]]]'>The Court then opined that, “[i]t goes without saying that when relations between the judicial branch and the county governments deteriorate to the point where litigation is required to settle disagreements as to funding, the relationship is neither harmonious nor unified, but rather, fragmented.” <em>Id. </em>The Court then noted that the Commonwealth argued that, irrespective of such disunity and fragmentation, the fact remained that the framers of the 1968 Constitution did not address the question of court funding, and therefore intended that the courts be funded as in the past, <em>i.e., </em>by the counties. The Court rejected this argument, stressing that, while the Constitution does not specify 'the manner of funding, it “does require that the judicial system shall be unified,” and in the Court’s view: “It is inconceivable that unity, in any meaningful sense of that word, can be attributed to a court system characterized by management and fiscal disagreements which <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>periodically culminate in litigation in which the various counties and the courts within them are set off against each other as antagonists.” <em>Id. </em>In making this point, the Court also addressed the argument forwarded in Chief Justice Nix’s dissent (further described below) that county court systems were funded by an exercise of taxing power delegated to the counties, and thus, there was no disunity. The Court deemed this argument to be “illusory,” because, while it may be true that the counties derive taxing power from the state, “these ‘state’ funds are being <em>administered by local authorities </em>in a manner that causes continual friction and dissension.” <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
    <p id="b278-4" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[278,993,1150,948]]]'>After noting that its interpretation of the “concept” of unified judicial system depended not only upon its literal meaning, but also “upon an awareness of the legal and constitutional implications of those words,” the Court added two additional points to support its conclusion that a unified system required centralized, Commonwealth funding of county courts. First, the Court addressed the issue of court staff, noting that the purpose of a unified judicial system is “to provide evenhanded, unbiased and competent administration of justice.” <em>Id. </em>at 765. To the Court, this fact created an expectation that cases “will be processed as well in one county as another.” <em>Id. </em>To meet that expectation, “judicial resources and staffing must be proportionately similar in all judicial districts,” <em>i.e., </em>“[tjhere must be uniform hiring practices and standards, and judges must be free to hire competent staff, not merely those referred by local political figures.” A system subject to such political considerations in hiring, the Court reasoned, “will be neither evenhanded nor competent.” <em>Id.</em>

The likely effect of permitting court funding to remain in the hands of local political authority, the Court opined, would be “suspicion or perception of bias and favoritism.” <em>Id. </em>In the Court’s view, a unified <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>judicial system cannot tolerate such uncertainties: “All courts must be free and independent from the occasion of political influence and no court should even be perceived to be biased in favor of local political authorities who pay the bills.” <em>Id.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b279-4" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[234,569,1149,363]]]'>For these reasons, the Court vacated the Commonwealth Court order and entered judgment in favor of the County. However, recognizing the disruption that its holding would create given the existing statutory scheme, the Court stayed its judgment “to afford the General Assembly an opportunity to enact appropriate funding legislation,” thus leaving the existing funding scheme in place. <em>Id.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[228,955,1156,1262]]]'>Chief Justice Nix’s dissent, joined by Justice McDermott, forcefully criticized the majority’s reasoning, arguing that the question of court funding was clearly within the province of the General Assembly, and the majority’s holding therefore violated the separation of powers doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 765-68 (Nix, C.J., dissenting). The dissent further argued that: the majority neglected to note that the General Assembly already made a “significant direct contribution by reimbursement” to the County to defray court expenses, in addition to directly paying all judicial salaries; and the majority’s conclusion that direct appropriation from the General Assembly was required for local courts ignored both “the distinction between the obligation to provide the funding and the discretion involved in determining an appropriate scheme of funding,” and the fact that the County’s taxing power is not separate and independent of the state’s taxing power, but rather is a state power delegated to the County with conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 766. In the dissent’s view, such a delegation of taxing power to counties where the common pleas courts were located “is in no way incompatible” with the constitutional requirement of a unified judicial system. <em>Id. </em>This was so because the constitutional mandate to fund the unified judicial system did not direct the method of funding; rather, that question was left to the Legislature. <em>Id. </em>at 765-66.</p>

In the dissent’s view, the County “has no right to complain” merely because a state delegation of taxing power carried with it “the concomitant responsibility” to use the funds generated for the purpose designated by the delegating authority. <em>Id. </em>at 766-67. The dissent also challenged the majority’s conclusion that the court financing scheme “created an air of dissension that is incompatible with the concept of a <em>unified </em>system.” The dissent viewed such disputes between local courts and county commissioners to be isolated and insufficient to prove an “irreconcilable state-wide breakdown of the local funding process,” and further noted that centralized funding would not eliminate funding disputes but merely shift them, which did not promise “a more harmonious process.” <em>Id. </em>at 767.</p>
    <p id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[282,1128,1154,509]]]'>Finally, the dissent questioned the majority’s “unstated judgment” that centralized direct funding would provide a “greater benefit” to the operation of a unified judicial system. <em>Id. </em>In the dissent’s view, this was not a judgment to be made by the judicial branch, and the validity of the assumption was questionable. The dissent noted the diversity of the state, including a range in cost of living standards; standardizing salaries according to function, the dissent opined, could inflate the cost of court operations in a given county without assuring an enhancement in the quality of services. <em>Id. </em>at 767-68.</p>

Justice Papadakos, who had joined the majority opinion, filed a dissenting opinion with respect to the post-decision applications of the Governor and the General Assembly; Chief Justice Nix and Justice McDermott joined this dissent.

On this point, Judge Montemuro noted, in the Preface to his report, that “fragmentation is readily apparent in the Judiciary as it now stands: there are 67 counties comprising 60 judicial districts in Pennsylvania, suffering from numerous disparities in staffing, compensation, caseloads and programs.” The Preface further noted that: “The President Judges of these districts are dependent upon the beneficence of 67 boards of commissioners for hiring, salary determinations, program support and physical and technological improvements. Each of these boards has a different vision of what constitutes the role of the Judiciary, and indeed what elements comprise the Judiciary; some of these visions are in diametric opposition to a judicial system which is a true and equal participant in a tripartite system of government.” Interim Report at 8-9.</p>

Although petitioners stated that they “welcomed” the Interim Report as a “significant first step,” and asked that the Court accept it, petitioners also noted concerns about the master’s recommendations regarding control of facilities, security, transfer of fixed assets, and funding of indigent defense in criminal cases. The presiding officers of the General Assembly, rather than finding fault with the report as measured against the task delegated to the master, essentially sought to relitigate the Court’s mandamus order. Thus, the officers objected to the Interim Report on the ground that the Court’s grant of mandamus relief and appointment of the master had not “accorded the Legislature the deference due to a co-equal branch of government.” The Commonwealth, per the Attorney General, made a similar objection regarding due deference, and further stated that the “asserted constitutional principle for the recommendations contained in the report— the right of equal access to equal justice for all Pennsylvanians — has not been demonstrated to have been compromised to any degree.” The exceptions to the Interim Report have remained pending, and this Court has not formally approved, or disapproved, of the Interim Report in whole or in part.</p>

This critical reform was no doubt instigated by Judge Montemuro’s finding that “absent the establishment of an administrative infrastructure at the state level very early in <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>the transition, any attempt to enhance the system of delivering justice on a state-wide basis would be further impeded.

But, the Court has never implemented those terms with a similar broad specificity. Moreover, as we have noted, the landscape today is considerably different from the landscape facing the Court before the inter-branch cooperation which emanated from <em>PSACC </em>and the appointment of a master.

From this experience in incremental advancement of a unified system — experience which, by definition, was unavailable to the Courts that decided <em>Allegheny County II </em>and <em>PSACC </em>— has arisen a realization that it is neither necessary nor wise to require that all <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>matters affecting local courts become standardized and be subject to direct funding by the General Assembly.

We trust in the prospect of further cooperation of the coordinate branches to determine what local court functions are necessary, or wise, to be incorporated within a unified, centrally funded system. The situation is not now as it was in 1996, when the Court was faced -with legislative inaction.
