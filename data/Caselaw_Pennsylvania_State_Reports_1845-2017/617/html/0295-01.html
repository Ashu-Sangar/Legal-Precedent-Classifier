For the following reasons, we decline to impose such a duty as a matter of Pennsylvania common law. Accordingly, we vacate and remand to the Superior Court for further disposition consistent with this Opinion, including consideration of whether any preserved issues remain that were not addressed as a result of the Superior Court’s disposition.</p>

Mr. Thierfelder’s wife Joanne Thierfelder (“appellee-wife”) began treating with appellant about a month later. Both appellees saw appellant for several years, during which time appellant treated both for, <em>inter alia, </em>libido problems. Appellant’s treatment of appellee-wife addressed various physical ailments but also symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, attention deficit disorder, and other emotional problems. Eventually, appellee-wife came to believe that appellant had “cured” her problems; she told him that he was her “hero” and that she believed she was in love with him. In the spring of 2002, the two began a sexual relationship that persisted for almost one year. The encounters took place at the Medical Center at Gwynedd where appellant maintained an office, in an automobile, and at appellant’s parents’ residence. Appellee-wife became increasingly anxious and depressed; at one point, she attempted to break off the relationship, but appellant convinced her to continue until she finally ended the affair in January 2003.</p>

The complaint further alleged that appellant was reckless, negligent, and careless and deviated from the “standard of care for physicians under the circumstances” by: instituting and continuing a sexual relationship with his patient; failing to end the sexual relationship; failing to insist that appellee-wife find another physician to treat her for her medical and men<a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>tal/emotional problems; placing his own physical needs and desires before the psychological welfare of his patients; misusing confidential information given to him by both appellees; violating the fiduciary duty he owed to appellees; interfering with appellees’ marriage; and violating the standards of ethics for physicians. The complaint asserted that as a result of appellant’s conduct, appellee-wife suffered deterioration of her psychological condition, severe depression, mental anguish, physical pain, emotional damage and harm, and loss of the opportunity to obtain relief from her psychological condition. Appellees also asserted both intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress and willful, wanton, and reckless conduct on appellant’s part; appellees sought “exemplary damages” of five million dollars.

Appellant responded by filing preliminary objections asserting that appellees had failed to state causes of action for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress; willfulness, wantonness, and recklessness; tortious interference with a marital contract; breach of fiduciary duty; and breach of physician-patient confidentiality. Appellant also argued that appellees failed to state a cause of action for medical negligence because their allegations stated only that the sexual relationship arose after appellant’s “rendition of medical care” to appellee-wife, as demonstrated by her statement that appellant had “cured” her; according to appellant, a cause of action for medical negligence must assert sufficient facts that the harm claimed arose “from” (and not “after”) the rendition of medical care.

The complaint asserted that as a result of appellant’s conduct, appellee-wife suffered deterioration of her psychological condition, severe depression, mental anguish, physical pain, emotional damage and harm, and loss of the opportunity to obtain relief from her psychological condition. The “Medical Malpractice” section of the second amended complaint pertained to appellee-wife only, and alleged that appellant “deviated from the standard of care for physicians under the circumstances” by: misusing drugs during the course of her treatment, breaching patient confidentiality, failing to treat her appropriately, practicing therapeutic techniques beyond the scope of his competence, terminating her treatment without appropriate follow-up or referral, failing to warn her that “certain treatment has been harmful,” failing to properly recognize, diagnose, and treat the “transference” that befell her,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and failing to timely refer her to another physician.

Appellant also referred to a recent trial court decision in which the Honorable Sandra Mazer Moss of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County held that, lacking a <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>mental health therapist-patient relationship, sexual relations between a physician and a patient’s estranged wife did not constitute medical malpractice.

Appellees answered the preliminary objections, stating that their certificate of merit expressed that appellant’s conduct departed from acceptable medical standards and was the cause of appellees’ harm; appellees also argued that contrary to appellant’s assertions, a mental health therapist-patient relationship did arise and develop between appellant and appellee-wife. Appellees’ Answer to Appellant’s Preliminary Objections, 10/31/03. The court overruled appellant’s preliminary objections, but ordered appellees to file another amended complaint pleading their asserted material facts with greater specificity. Trial Ct.

    <p id="b342-5" data-blocks='[["BL_342.4",342,[276,1209,1151,683]]]'>Appellees filed a third and final amended complaint in February 2004. In the section titled “Negligence,” appellees set forth a detailed account of the manner in which the affair between appellant and appellee-wife began and how appelleewife grew increasingly more anxiety-ridden, obsessive, and dependent as the relationship progressed. Appellees also alleged that appellant made attempts to convince appellee-wife to continue the relationship when she attempted to end it. Appellees also added allegations that appellant made certain statements to appellee-wife that worsened her already fragile emotional state over the affair. In the “Medical Malpractice” section, appellees listed the same allegations set forth in the previous complaint. Third Amended Complaint, 2/4/04.</p>

      <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>In March 2004, appellant filed preliminary objections in the 04-03111 matter asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellees’ complaint failed to state a cause of action for either ordinary negligence or medical malpractice. Appellant argued that appellees’ complaint did not set forth the requisite factual basis to prove that his rendition of professional medical services to appellees caused them cognizable injury or was an “unwarranted departure from generally accepted standards of medical care.” Moreover, according to appellant, “the alleged sexual conduct at issue can’t possibly constitute medical malpractice under Pennsylvania law where the therapist-patient relationship is lacking.” Appellant cited Judge Moss’s decision in <em>Long v. Ostroff </em>for the proposition that, in the absence of a therapist-patient relationship, a family physician’s sexual conduct with a patient’s wife did not constitute medical malpractice under Pennsylvania law. As for appellees’ allegations sounding in ordinary negligence, appellant countered that “the mere happening of a consensual sexual relationship between adults, outside of the context of marriage,” did not give rise to a duty of care in either participant to the other participant “with respect to the commencement, happening of or termination” of the relationship.

      <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>The <em>Long </em>Superior Court panel construed the trial court’s grant of the defendant’s motion to dismiss as a grant of summary judgment and noted that the “novel” legal issue presented was whether a claim for medical malpractice is cognizable, as a matter of law, premised upon a physician having an affair with his patient’s wife. The panel concluded that a general practitioner’s duty of care does not prohibit an extramarital affair with a patient’s spouse. In so holding, the panel noted that, in arguing that the doctor owed him a duty of care not to engage in a sexual relationship with his wife, the plaintiff relied “solely and heavily” upon a North Carolina case, <em>Mazza v. Huffaker, </em><a href="/nc-app/61/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="61 N.C.

The panel noted that <em>Mazza </em>was not binding in Pennsylvania and that, in any event, it was distinguishable on two grounds. First, the panel distinguished <em>Mazza </em>because it spoke to a supposed “special duty” owed by psychiatrists to their patients, which the panel said “does not extend to general practitioners.” Second, the <em>Long </em>panel noted that <em>Mazza </em>had to be understood in light of peculiarities then existing in North Carolina tort law (involving recognized torts for criminal conversation and alienation of affection), whereas Pennsylvania had abolished such tort claims. <em>Long, </em><a href="/a2d/854/0524-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="854 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="9215494" data-case-paths="/a2d/854/0524-01">854 A.2d at 528</a>.

Thus, appellant argued, appellees’ medical malpractice allegations were legally unsustainable. Appellant pointed particularly to the <em>Long </em>opinion’s distinction between unethical and tortious conduct by a medical professional: “Simply put, unethical conduct does not provide the foundation for a cause of action sounding in medical negligence.” Appellant’s Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Reconsider, 12/30/04, at 3.

Citing cases from Minnesota, New York, and North Carolina, appellant stresses that transference is central to the patient-psychotherapist relationship, and in fact is an expected and accepted part of treatment for which mental health professionals receive particular training; and it is for that reason that some courts have held that a mental health professional’s sexual relationship with a patient may be actionable as medical malpractice.</p>

In appellees’ view, this new reality should mandate that the mental health professional’s duty to avoid sexual contact with patients should be imposed on all medical providers who render mental health care, regardless of specialty.

In these jurisdictions, the cause of action is often tied to the mental health professional’s alleged mishandling of transference, which occurs when a therapist encourages a mental health patient to “displace” feelings regarding other figures in the patient’s life, often parents, onto the therapist. The therapist is trained to manage and use transference as a therapeutic tool.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a> When transference occurs, the therapist helps the patient to contend with previously repressed or unresolved feelings so that the patient may improve. But, mental health professionals recognize, transference magnifies the patient’s mental and emotional vulnerability; it is for that reason that some courts have held that the therapist must refrain from taking advantage of the circumstances to engage in what would otherwise be non-actionable (albeit ethically questionable) consensual sexual conduct with a patient. The Ninth Circuit has explained this link between transference and malpractice as follows: “The crucial factor in the therapist-patient relationship which leads to the imposition of legal liability for conduct which arguably <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>is no more exploitative of a patient than sexual involvement of a lawyer with a client, a priest or minister with a parishioner, or a gynecologist with a patient is that lawyers, ministers and gynecologists do not offer a course of treatment and counseling predicated upon handling the transference phenomenon.” <em>Simmons v.

The Supreme Court of Minnesota accepted the case on the coverage question and in the course of its analysis, stated that the underlying conduct by the defendant amounted to the negligent mishandling of transference and, because transference is so closely bound to the patient-therapist dynamic, the defendant had committed professional malpractice when he involved himself sexually with his patient: “The medical and legal communities uniformly agree that a psychiatrist’s mishandling the transference phenomenon during treatment and taking sexual advantage of his patient is malpractice or gross negligence.” <a href="/nw2d/459/0698-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="459 N.W.2d 698" data-case-ids="10606964" data-case-paths="/nw2d/459/0698-01">459 N.W.2d at </a>700 (citing Louisell <em>&amp; </em>Williams, 2 Medical Malpractice ¶ 17A.27, at SO-SO).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> Thus, the prevailing view among the states that have <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>considered the issue in the context of a mental health professional’s conduct is that sexual relations with a patient, even if ostensibly consensual, may be the basis for a viable malpractice claim, particularly when transference occurs during the course of the therapy.</p>

Stat. 740/140-2 (1989, amended 1997), recognizes, in pertinent part, that “[a] cause of action against a psychotherapist, unlicensed health professional, or unlicensed mental health professional for sexual exploitation exists for a patient or former patient for injury caused by sexual contact with the psychotherapist, unlicensed health professional, or unlicensed mental health professional.” California has a narrower enactment, limited to psychotherapists, embracing psychiatrists as well as both licensed clinical social workers and associate clinical social workers who may not yet be licensed. Thus, California Civil Code § 43.93(b) (2003) provides that: “A cause of action against a psychotherapist for sexual contact exists for a patient or former patient for injury caused by sexual contact with the psychotherapist.” A handful of other states have adopted statutory enactments in this vein. <em>See </em>Minn.Stat. §§ 604.20, 604.201 (1986) (applies to <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>“physician, psychologist, nurse, chemical dependency counsel- or, social worker, member of the clergy, marriage and family therapist, mental health service provider, licensed professional counselor, or other person, whether or not licensed by the state, who performs or purports to perform psychotherapy”); N.C.

To determine whether to impose that particularized duty upon general practitioners as a matter of Pennsylvania common law, we look to the <em>Althaus </em>factors, which consider: (1) the relationship between the parties; (2) the social utility of the actor’s conduct; (3) the nature of the risk involved and foreseeability of the harm incurred; (4) the consequences of imposing a duty upon the actor; and (5) the overall public interest in the proposed solution. <em>Id. </em>at 1169.</p>

That is true in most, but not all cases, and it is certainly true in this case. Where present, we do not doubt that this relative disparity gives rise to a relationship based on trust and the general duty of care that any doctor owes to his patients. As explained above, when the relationship is one centered in the rendering of psychotherapy, the patient is in a particularly vulnerable mental and emotional state, which has caused courts to recognize a particularized duty on the part of the mental health professional to, at the least, refrain from any action or activity that would worsen the patient’s insecurities and fears. According to the cases and secondary literature addressing transference, it can be a powerful therapeutic tool, and mental health professionals employing transference must take pains to facilitate and direct it when it occurs in their patients. Courts that have imposed a duty upon mental health professionals to avoid sexual contact with patients recognize that mental health professionals should not engage in conduct that preys upon their patients’ hopes, fears, feel<a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>ings, and personal issues, which are the very basis of the therapist-patient relationship.</p>

There is a qualitative difference between this kind of treatment, which goes more to the patient’s overall well-being, and the sort of dedicated course of therapy provided by a mental health professional. This is particularly so because a general practitioner is less likely than a mental health professional to recognize, understand, and employ transference as a conscious therapeutic method. While there is a relationship of trust in any doctor-patient compact, we believe there is insufficient basis in consideration of this first <em>Althaus </em>factor to warrant importation of the same <em>per se </em>duty that would apply to mental health professionals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a>

Obviously, sexual activity between a general practitioner and a patient has no social utility in and of itself. But, under appellees’ theory, the proffered absolute duty to refrain from sexual activity is a byproduct of the rendering of incidental mental health treatment by appellant, a general practitioner. The occasion for general practitioners to address their patients’ situational mental and emotional well-being arises from various potential sources, such as: doctor-patient familiarity, convenience, or insurance requirements that make general practitioners a necessary “first stop” in their patients’ healthcare process. This type of occasional but more immediate treatment of increasingly common mental and emotional burdens arising from modern day lifestyles and stressors is accepted, and it obviously has significant social utility and value. Imposing the same absolute duty to avoid sexual contact with patients upon general practitioners as would be imposed upon mental health professionals employing transference necessarily burdens the social utility in general practitioners serving as first-stop medical providers for a litany of maladies, including mental and emotional issues that may not be so severe as to require a mental health specialist.

The risk and harm that can ensue if a mental health professional takes sexual advantage of his or her psychotherapy patients’ vulnerability and transference of feelings to the therapist has been documented in the cases accepting the tort against mental health professionals for the negligent management of transference. In some states, a mental health professional’s exploitation of transference to engage in sexual relations with a patient, if undertaken in an intentional manner, has effectively been deemed to be predatory conduct warranting criminalization. But, a general practitioner unfamiliar with transference, or less familiar with the effects of the treatment, or who is not deliberately employing the technique in undertaking basic or situational care of a patient’s mental and emotional difficulties, is less likely to foresee that an apparently consensual sexual affair with the patient may risk worsening the patient’s psychological prob<a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>lems and even create new doubts, anxieties, and agitations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_25" id="ref_footnote_1_25">25</a> The harm and the risk are real with regard to the patient, but this <em>Althaus </em>factor focuses on foreseeability respecting the doctor and whether a concomitant duty may reasonably be imposed on a general practitioner based solely on the nexus of some degree of mental or emotional care and the occurrence of a sexual relationship. Although it is close, we view this factor as weighing against extending a mental health professional’s duty to general practitioners, even if the general practitioner has engaged in some degree of care regarding the patient’s mental and emotional well-being.</p>

As noted in our discussion of social utility, in today’s world, it is common for general practitioners to provide their patients with some form of front-line mental or emotional care; and this care may go so far as to include the prescription of medications to relieve stress-induced anxiety and even antidepressants. The proffered duty and tort would impose significant consequences on general practitioners rendering such care who become sexually involved with a patient, solely because of incidental mental health treatment. Ours is a fluid and complex society, where concepts of free will and personal responsibility hold some sway. The prophylactic absolute duty of avoidance of sexual contact proffered here excises those concepts in one narrow situation deriving from the special circumstances, vulnerability, and potential exploitation that may arise from a course of mental health treatment, based upon a phenomenon familiar to specialists in the field. To hold general practitioners providing incidental care to that same standard would have <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>the effect of discouraging general practitioners from rendering what appears to have become, by now, relatively routine attention to their patients’ mental and emotional well-being.

We are, of course, aware that many issues involving the liability of physicians in this Commonwealth have been the subject of legislative concern and judicial rulemaking in the past several years; and, from this experience, we are well aware of the complexity involved in any expansion or contraction of exposure. The public concern giving rise to a specialist’s absolute duty is understandable — it protects those who seek therapeutic help for serious mental and emotional problems from having those very problems exploited by the therapist, either intentionally or negligently, for the therapist’s own sexual satisfaction. But, determining whether the public interest is <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>best served by applying the same absolute safeguard to general practitioners who provide some level of incidental mental and emotional support for their patients is a far more complex matter. Of course, the effect of transference may exist in a patient even where the doctor is unaware of, or does not deliberately employ, the technique; and the cases suggest that an improper sexual affair may have a potentially devastating effect on an already unsettled patient who has developed trust and confidence in his or her doctor. But, as noted, imposing this new absolute duty on general practitioners would have a high social cost, and would discourage general or primary care doctors from meeting their patients’ manageable mental and emotional needs, as opposed to the focused treatment provided by a specialist. At the same time, it would likely have little effect on those doctors who would intentionally exploit their “power” over their patients to satisfy their own libidos. It is also noteworthy that other theories already exist that may encompass this scenario, such as a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, which appellees did raise initially in this litigation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_27" id="ref_footnote_1_27">27</a> Other causes of action may also be employed without importing an absolute proscription regarding sexual relations with patients from cases involving mental health specialists. Accordingly, we view this factor as weighing against extension of a mental health specialist’s duty to refrain from sexual relations with patients to general practitioners who provide some incidental mental and emotional care for their patients.</p>

To do so would be to go too far, at least for purposes of expanding tort liability through common law decision-making. To do so would also improperly blur the still-meaningful distinction <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>between the standards and duties of care borne by specialists and general practitioners. Furthermore, as our analysis above has demonstrated, the question presented implicates broad and complicated concerns of social policy involving the liability of physicians that are not particularly well suited to resolution by judicial decision. In our view, any further adjustment in this particular, narrow area is a question better suited to the policy-making branches, including the General Assembly and the Commonwealth’s boards and associations charged with regulating the medical profession. This position goes no farther than recognizing that the “classic” form of medical malpractice is not easily distilled in the increasingly common context of general practitioners providing incidental, situational, or even ongoing mental and emotional support as part of overall patient care.</p>

However, we must register our respectful disagreement, as we have throughout this Opinion, with the dissent’s mischaracterization of our balancing effort and holding as an “alteration” of the applicable test, rather than an application with which the dissent happens to disagree. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dissenting Op. at 342, 346, 349-50, 52 A.3d at 1280, 1283, 1285. First, our holding does not forever bar the potential for finding a duty of care when a doctor who is not a mental health specialist undertakes mental health treatment with a patient and then engages in sexual relations with that patient. Rather, the question accepted for review, which our deliberations have revealed is not as simple as it might initially seem, is whether to extend a <em>per se </em>duty that would apply to mental health specialists to general practitioners, in order to support a claim for money damages. As Justice Todd’s dissent itself recognizes and reiterates, professional disciplinary action remains possible, and as we have noted above, other actions in tort may remain available in cases such as this. Our disposition to remand does not foreclose pursuit of any such claims that may have been preserved and not yet addressed by the Superior Court. Second, the dissent’s formulation suggests that the question of <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>duty we decide involves a sexual relationship pursued, perhaps purposefully, as part of appellant’s “treatment” of appellee for mental health problems. We do not understand the complaint as pursuing that theory; and, in any event, the duty we are asked to embrace is much broader, and not confined to that circumstance. The dissent’s formulation of the issue before us may ring well as an aphorism; but, it is an inaccurate description of the Court’s holding and analysis, which hardly advances our deliberations.</p>
    <p id="b381-4" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[244,823,1152,461]]]'>Application of our holding is straightforward. The facts as alleged by appellees — the occurrence of some degree of mental and emotional care by appellant and a sexual relationship between appellant and appellee-wife — do not establish that appellant violated his duty of care to appellees, which was that of a general practitioner and not that of a mental health specialist precluded from engaging in sexual relations with a patient. In holding otherwise, the Superior Court held appellant to a novel duty and standard, which we reject.</p>

Accordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand for consideration of any remaining preserved claims that may persist in this litigation. Jurisdiction is relinquished.</p>

Justice Todd’s Dissenting Opinion makes much of the fact that Pennsylvania regulations governing state board certified medical doctors (aside from mental health professionals, who are covered by specific provisions) dictate that sexual relations between practitioners and patients are prohibited misconduct for which a doctor may be subject to disciplinary action under 16 Pa.Code §§ 16.61, 16.110. Dissenting Op. at 344 n. 2, 52 A.3d at 1281 n. 2 and passim.

But, the duty in civil tort law that the dissent would create is not actually limited in any meaningful fashion. Recognition of an absolute "duty” in general practitioners to refrain from sexual relations with patients they have treated for mental health issues establishes what amounts to a per se cause of action: showing both treatment and sexual relations proves the case, irrespective of other particulars of the relationship.

We have used die qualifier "incidental” to distinguish the sort of treatment that arises during the course of a preexisting doctor-patient relationship, one not originally or usually involving mental health treatment, from the sort of targeted treatment rendered by a mental health specialist.

Indeed, the dissent would have it both ways: the care and duty is monolithic when the dissent formulates its rule, but episodic when it comes to criticizing the Court’s approach. The dissent’s <em>per se </em>duty apparently would embrace the most "incidental” of mental health treatment rendered by a general practitioner, a highly ambiguous situation upon which to base a tort claim.</p>

Justice Todd’s disagreement with our balancing of the first <em>Althaus </em>factor, Dissenting Op. at 346-50, 52 A.3d at 1283-85, loses sight of the <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>fact that the duty we are asked to recognize in this case is a particularized one of absolute avoidance of sexual conduct, deriving from a specialized duty that applies to mental health professionals. The doctor-patient relationship, which we do not by any means minimize in this appeal, obviously remains, and serves as a basis for other theories sounding in medical malpractice alleging a breach of the doctor's duty of care through improper diagnosis and treatment; and a general practitioner who undertakes to provide systematic and regular mental and emotional care to a patient may well be subject to liability in negligence if he or she mishandles the situation and worsens the patient’s mental and emotional state. But, in this appeal as presented to us, appellees seek a rule that would allow them to prove their case by operation of a <em>per se </em>"heightened” duty arising out of the mere nexus between some or any form of mental or emotional assistance that may be provided by a general practitioner and the occurrence of sexual relations between the doctor and patient.

Justice Todd’s Dissenting Opinion defines the question of social utility in loaded fashion, as "the social utility of a physician having sexual relations with a patient while rendering treatment for mental disorders without legal consequences in tort,” and then accuses the Court of suggesting that "there is social utility in not prohibiting a physician from having sexual relations with a patient he is treating for mental disorders.” Dissenting Op. at 350-51, 52 A.3d at 1285-87. As the discussion in text makes plain, the social utility recognized by the Court reposes in the important role general practitioners have come to serve in treating their patients’ mental health issues. Our approach squares with <em>Althaus.

The need for prevention of child abuse is unquestionable, as is the importance of adequate psychological treatment for children who have been sexually abused. Thus, therapists who treat sexually abused children perform a valuable and useful activity to society.”). Obviously, not all such first-stop treatments by general practitioners result in sexual relationships; and the fact that sexual relationships arise in some cases does not eliminate the actual social utility involved in the readier availability of treatment.

JoAnn Thierfelder contends in her complaint that she and her husband, David Thierfelder, were patients of Dr. Irwin Wolfert. Mrs. Thierfelder avers that the couple divulged to Dr. Wolfert details of their intimate relations so that Dr. Wolfert could provide appropriate medical care. According to Mrs. Thierfelder, Dr. Wolfert treated her for depression and anxiety and prescribed medication for her depression. Importantly, during the course of the physician/patient relationship, Mrs. Thierfelder claims that Dr. Wolfert’s treatment and medication regimen caused her to believe that Dr. Wolfert had “cured” her, that she informed him that he was her “hero,” and that she believed that she was in love with him. Third Amended Complaint, at ¶ 13. Mrs. Thierfelder alleges that, after she informed Dr. Wolfert of her feelings, and while treating her for depression, Dr. Wolfert began a sexual relationship with her. After the relationship became sexual, Mrs. Thierfelder maintains that she became increasingly anxious and depressed and attempted to break off the relationship, but that Dr. Wolfert convinced her to continue the relationship. Ultimately, Mrs. Thierfelder contends she ended the relationship with Dr. Wolfert and, later, informed her husband about the affair. Because of Dr. Wolfert’s actions, Mrs. Thierfelder alleges that she suffered deterioration of her psychological condition, severe depression and psychological harm, was deprived of the opportunity to obtain relief from her psychological condition, and suffered severe physical pain and mental anguish.</p>

Moreover, a physician holds a position of superiority over a patient based upon his expertise and the patient’s vulnerable position in seeking care, which as noted involves, at its core, trust in the physician and the primacy of the patient’s well-being. This inequity is only exacerbated where a patient seeks care for mental health disorders, as did Mrs. Thierfelder. In my view, this close relationship and the heightened sensitivities in the context of treatment for mental health disorders logically counsels towards recognizing a legal duty to protect patients who suffer from mental health disorders from exploitation by a physician. Moreover, this ap<a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>proach to the first <em>Althaus </em>prong, and a conclusion that, at a minimum, this prong suggests the finding of a duty, is consistent with our Court’s prior case law.</p>

Yet, contrary to our prior precedent and foundational authority, the majority comes to the remarkable conclusion that even the physician-patient relationship fails to support finding a duty of care. Rather than analyzing the relationship between the parties, the majority instead amends the factor to focus on the type of care provided. Specifically, the majority asserts that, because “it is increasingly common for primary or general care physicians to advise patients on relatively common matters of emotional or mental import, like stress or depression, and also to prescribe widely-used medications for such conditions,” and because there is a “qualitative difference” between treatments by a general practitioner and a “dedicated course of therapy provided by a <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>mental health professional,” this somehow changes the nature of the relationship of the parties.

Rather, in the majority’s view, it is the regularity and type of treatment rendered that defines the relationship. Second, the asserted “qualitative difference” in the treatment rendered by a general practitioner as compared to a mental health professional regarding any given malady suffered by a patient, or specifically the depression suffered by Mrs. Thierfelder in this matter, is rank speculation. As noted below, a general practitioner is licensed to provide mental health and psychiatric services, and, thus, the difference in treatment is immaterial to the analysis. Moreover, while the majority characterizes depression as “common matters of emotional or mental import” and suggests such conditions are treated by “widely-used medications,” Majority Opinion at 334, 52 A.3d at 1275, it fails to tie its analysis to the particular averments made in the complaint before us. Mrs. Thierfelder has averred that she was suffering from depression, a mental health disorder, when being treated by Dr. Wolfert, and that he provided medications for her condition. There is no indication whether the type of depression from which she suffered was “common” or complex or severe. At this stage in the proceedings, it is unknown whether or not the medications Dr. Wolfert prescribed to his patient for her mental health disorders were “widely used.”</p>

Moreover, and importantly, we are at the preliminary objection <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>stage, and Mrs. Thierfelder pleads indicia of transference, and Dr. Wolfert’s mishandling thereof. Thus, the majority’s reliance upon qualitative differences in treatment is not only divorced from the complaint, but, again, is in tension with the current state of the law where a general practitioner is licensed to provide mental health or psychiatric services. Consequently, any suggestion that general practitioners are limited in the type of care they can provide, or that they cannot provide a “dedicated course of therapy,” akin to that of a mental health professional, is simply without foundation.</p>

Importantly, this prohibition is reserved not only for mental health professionals, but rather applies to all medical practitioners. According to the profession’s ethical code, sexual relations between physician and patient “detract from the goals of the physician-patient relationship, may exploit the vulnerability of the patient, may obscure the physician’s objective judgment concerning the patient’s health care, and ultimately may be detrimental to the patient’s well-being.” American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics § 8.14 (“Sexual Misconduct in the Practice of Medicine”).

Moreover, under <em>Althaus, </em>we look to see if the defendant created the harm or foresaw the possibility of the harm. <em>Althaus, </em><a href="/pa/562/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="222" data-cite="562 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="225970" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0547-01">562 Pa. at 554</a>, <a href="/a2d/756/1166-01" class="citation" data-index="223" data-cite="756 A.2d 1166" data-case-ids="11244912,225970" data-case-paths="/a2d/756/1166-01,/pa/562/0547-01">756 A.2d at 1170</a>.

Thus, the majority apparently believes that such negative outcomes are simply too unforeseeable for the general practitioner, and, accordingly, finds it unreasonable to place a legal duty on a general practitioner to abstain from sexual relations with a patient who is suffering from a mental health disorder. I cannot agree. The possibility and import of harm concerning transference has been known for decades, <em>see, e.g., Simmons v. U.S., </em><a href="/f2d/805/1363-01" class="citation" data-index="224" data-cite="805 F.2d 1363" data-case-ids="1111552" data-case-paths="/f2d/805/1363-01">805 F.2d 1363</a>, 1364-65 (9th Cir.1986), yet the majority gives general practitioners a pass on knowing and understanding the possible ramifications and injury that could occur from their undertaking treatment of mental health disorders of their patients. Furthermore, the <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>American Medical Association explains generally the potential for harm in giving its rationale for its prohibition on physician-patient sexual relationships: such relationships “exploit the vulnerability of the patient, may obscure the physician’s objective judgment concerning the patient’s health care, and ultimately may be detrimental to the patient’s well-being.” American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics § 8.14.</p>

Further, here we have a physician providing care for a mental health disorder to a vulnerable patient, and, thus, virtues of free will and personal responsibility simply do not resonate with their typical force. The parties’ free will may be honored should the mutual desire for a sexual relationship prove compelling: the physician may immediately terminate the professional relationship with the patient and, at some appropriate subsequent time, engage in the sexual relationship desired; or, in the alternative, the physician may continue treating the patient but refrain from having a sexual relationship.

Again, I find this conclusion to be inexplicable. The majority accepts that general practitioners now provide a significant degree of mental or emotional care for their patients, including the prescribing of medication; yet, to a large degree, the majority reasons that such widespread caregiving justifies not imposing a duty. The opposite is true in my view: that the health care system has changed, that the distinction between general practitioners and mental health professionals has become blurred, and <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>that it has become commonplace for general practitioners to treat patients for mental health disorders and to prescribe drugs to these individuals for these conditions, counsels <em>towards </em>protecting these patients, not <em>against </em>it. Insulating from liability general practitioners who decide to engage in sexual relations with their patients serves no public interest of which I am aware. Indeed, I find there to be a significant overall public benefit in recognizing a duty of general practitioners <em>not </em>to engage in sexual relations with patients suffering from mental health disorders, as such a duty will reduce the chance of injuring or exacerbating the symptoms of a patient the physician has pledged to assist, will enhance the chance of recovery, and will discourage conduct by the physician that could result in professional disciplinary action and the loss of the physician’s license.</p>

In light of our Court’s understanding of the notion of duty, I have no hesitation in concluding that general practice physicians who provide treatment for mental health disorders to patients have a duty to abstain from sexual relations with their patients — conduct which is deemed to be unprofessional and prohibited by the medical community — and that these physicians may be potentially liable in professional negligence actions for any harm to their patients — patients they pledged to take no action to <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>harm — as a result of engaging in such conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_10" id="ref_footnote_2_10">10</a>

In its opinion, the majority begins that the question before us is "whether a medical general practitioner who provides <em>incidental </em>mental health treatment to a patient, with whom he then engages in a sexual affair, may be held to a particularized ‘specialist duty,' applicable to mental health professionals, that prohibits consensual sexual contact with patients, such that the defendant general practitioner may be subject to medical malpractice liability in tort.” Majority Opinion at 298, 52 A.3d at 1253 (emphasis added). Then, the majority begins its analysis by rephrasing the issue as follows: "The question here is whether to extend a mental health specialist’s presumed duty to refrain from sexual activity with patients to general practitioners who provide <em>some degree </em>of mental or emotional counseling to a patient, or who prescribe <em>common medications </em>for depression or anxiety for that patient, and then engage in consensual sexual relations with that patient." Majority Opinion at 331, 52 A.3d at 1273 (emphasis added). Not only is the progressively evolving nature of the statement of the issue troubling, but the majority’s characterization of the mental health treatment at issue as "incidental” and any prescriptions as "common medications” is divorced from the complaint, to which, at this stage of the pleadings, we are limited. We do not know the type of treatment rendered by Dr. Wolfert to Mrs. Thierfelder or the nature of the medication prescribed. Further, the majority asserts that its repeated use of the qualifier "incidental” to describe the mental health treatment under consideration distinguishes "the sort of treatment that arises during the course of a preexisting doctor-patient relationship, one not originally or usually involving mental health treatment from the sort of targeted treatment rendered by a mental health specialist.” Majority Opinion at 334 n. 22, 52 A.3d at 1275 n. 22. Yet, the majority does not explain the relevance of when the treatment arises in the relationship or whether the treatment is for a first-time patient or a repeat patient. Indeed, as the focus is whether the patient is being treated for mental health disorders, it appears to me that these considerations are irrelevant. Nor does the majority’s state<a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>ment of the issue account for the distinction or suggest a duty with respect to more serious treatment by a general practitioner.</p>

The majority further suggests, at some length, that courts have been reluctant to recognize a cause of action in professional liability when a general practitioner provides treatment for a physical injury, i.e., non-mental health treatment, and engages in consensual sexual conduct with a patient. I do not quibble with its characterization of the law, but simply emphasize this issue is plainly not before us. What I am concerned about is the majority’s characterization of the circumstances before us as occurring "in the grey area between purely physical medical care and mental and emotional care, which may entail a broad range of treatments from simple counseling, to a single prescription by a general practitioner to treat a regular patient’s occasional anxiety ..., to comprehensive and sustained treatment <em>by mental health specialists </em>to address serious psychological illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.’’ Majority Opinion at 331, 52 A.3d at 1273 (emphasis added). The broad range of treatment we consider today, however, is that given by a general practitioner — not a mental health specialist— who, as noted below, may fully engage in "comprehensive and sustained treatment" for "serious psychological illness.” Thus, the majority's division between which type of practitioner may engage in differing levels of treatment is not only unfounded, but, properly understood, sharpens the point: today’s holding fails to recognize a duty on the part of a physician, and, thus, a claim in professional negligence against not only general practitioners who give a "single prescription,” and engage in sexual relations with their patients, but also those generalists who provide "comprehensive and sustained treatment” for "serious psychological illness,” and engage in sexual relations as well.</p>

Majority Opinion at 331-32 n. 21, 52 A.3d at 1273 n. 21. First, the "absolute duty” to refrain from sexual relations with his or her patients is no different than the "absolute” ethical duty currently imposed upon physicians, with which they must abide. Thus, while I would recognize a duty on a physician when treating a patient for mental health disorders to refrain from sexual relations with that patient, doing so respects an unqualified prohibition already firmly in place. Second, and contrary to the majority's assertions that "showing both treatment and sexual relations proves the [cause of action]," <em>id., </em>to be successful for a claim in professional negligence in these circumstances, a patient would need to establish not only treatment for a mental health disorder and sexual relations between physician and patient, but also that the sexual relations both caused and resulted in harm to the patient. Finally, while criticizing my approach as absolutist, it should be contrasted against the majority’s own absolutist bar of any professional negligence liability for a general practitioner based upon sexual contact with a patient, regardless of the nature of the treatment or how severe the mental health disorder suffered by the patient.</p>
