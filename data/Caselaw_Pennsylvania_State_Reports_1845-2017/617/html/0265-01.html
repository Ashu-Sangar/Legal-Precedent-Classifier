The specific question presented is whether a party must file post-trial motions in a remand scenario — here, a circumstance where, on remand from the Superior Court, the trial court recalculated a damage award without receiving any additional evidence from the parties. The Superior Court quashed appellants’ appeal from the trial court’s recalculated damages order, holding that appellants had waived all claims by failing to file a second <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>round of post-trial motions. Also implicated in this matter is the fact-bound question of whether a trial occurred on remand, thereby triggering the post-trial motion procedure contemplated by Rule 227.1. For the reasons that follow, we find that the panel erred in deeming appellants’ claims to be waived for non-compliance with Rule 227.1. Accordingly, we vacate the quashal order below and remand for consideration of the merits.</p>

(“Genuardi’s”), and a division of Safeway, Inc. (“Safeway” or collectively with Genuardi’s “appellants”). Newman Developmental Group of Pottstown, LLC (“Newman” or “appellee”) is a real estate development company comprised of Marc Newman, David Newman, Barry Newman, Michael Wachs, and three members of the Akel family.</p>
    <p id="b308-5" data-blocks='[["BL_308.5",308,[287,1212,1149,520]]]'>In 1996, Wachs identified a potential site consisting of six separate parcels at the intersection of Cedarville Road and Route 100 in North Coventry Township, Chester County, as a location to construct a shopping center to be known as Town Square Plaza. Newman entered into agreements of sale for the six properties contingent upon Newman’s ability to construct the shopping center at the site. Newman applied to the Township for the necessary rezoning to permit a shopping center on the properties, which resulted in significant public opposition against the plan.</p>
    <p id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.6",308,[286,1755,1152,625]],["BL_309.1",309,[245,350,1149,368]]]'>Meanwhile, in 1998, before the necessary zoning was in place and before Newman had legal title to the properties, Newman began negotiations with several grocery store chains, among them Genuardi’s, which signed a letter of intent to lease space in the shopping center in June of 1998. On April 14, 2000, Genuardi’s and Newman entered into an Agreement of Lease (“lease”) for space in Town Square Plaza. Because Newman had equitable title pursuant to the agreements of sale but not legal title to the properties, the lease included provisions relating to the construction of the shopping center, including time frames for specific stages of construction. Section 6.4 of the lease provided that, if building permits were not <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>issued by January 1, 2001, or the footings and foundations of the building were not completed and steel erected by May 1, 2001, or if the delivery date of the property did not occur before September 1, 2001, Genuardi’s would have the option to extend the completion date or, upon notice to Newman and after Newman’s failure to comply within an additional thirty-day period, terminate the lease.</p>
    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[241,760,1156,1166]]]'>In the course of negotiations, Newman indicated to Genuardi’s that meeting the dates for the stages of construction might be problematic; therefore, the parties agreed to hold the lease in escrow in order to grant Newman an extension of time if necessary to complete the project. Counsel for both parties, through the exchange of correspondence, established an escrow agreement whose purpose was to commit the parties to the Town Square Plaza project without obligating Newman to adhere to a construction schedule that both parties knew to be unrealistic. The escrow agreement, as it emerged from the correspondence, provided that the lease would be held in escrow by Genuardi’s pending Newman’s entering into a lease agreement or agreement of sale with either Target or Lowe’s Home Center to serve as the shopping center’s anchor tenant; but that, if such a lease agreement or agreement of sale was not executed -within one year of the closing of the sale of the properties to Newman, Genuardi’s reserved the right to terminate the lease upon notice to Newman. In the event of a delay in the closing that affected the construction schedule set forth in Section 6.4 of the lease, the parties would discuss amending the completion dates to reflect a reasonable schedule.</p>

Marc Newman signed the letter acknowledging the assignment and returned it to Genuardi’s counsel. Safeway purchased Genuardi’s in February of 2001, and, that same month, representatives of Safeway and Newman met to dis<a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>cuss moving forward and with timelines for approvals for the project.</p>
    <p id="b310-4" data-blocks='[["BL_310.4",310,[276,485,1150,1112]]]'>On February 13, 2002, counsel for Safeway sent Newman a letter notifying Newman of Safeway’s intent to terminate the lease due to noncompliance with the completion dates set forth in Section 6.4 of the lease. The letter specifically stated that Newman had failed to obtain building permits prior to January 1, 2001, did not complete the footing and foundation or erect structural steel by May 1, 2001, and failed to deliver the property to Safeway by September 1, 2001. At the time the letter was sent, Donald Wright, Safeway’s senior vice president of real estate and engineering, who authorized the termination letter, was unaware of the escrow agreement and had not seen the documents establishing that agreement. The following day, February 14, 2002, Newman’s counsel apprised Safeway’s counsel by letter of the escrow agreement and stated that neither party had the right to terminate the lease at that time. Safeway responded to Marc Newman that Newman’s obligations under Section 6.4 of the lease were independent of the co-tenancy requirement regarding Target or Lowe’s Home Center that was the subject of the escrow agreement and reiterated that Safeway intended to terminate the lease.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[276,1646,1150,741]]]'>On March 20, 2002, Newman filed the instant lawsuit against appellants alleging an anticipatory breach of the lease agreement and asserting claims in equity for quantum meruit and promissory estoppel based on the assertion that appellants had no right to terminate the lease agreement. Newman then sought replacement tenants and eventually obtained commitments from PetSmart and Michael’s Arts and Crafts (“Michael’s”) to occupy the space previously reserved for Genuardi’s. Newman obtained zoning approval and construction permits for the shopping center and closed on the agreements of sale for the properties in March of 2004. Lowe’s signed a lease with Newman on the date Newman acquired the site. On December 28, 2005, Newman sold the shopping center to Inland Real Estate Acquisitions, Inc.</p>

      <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>Meanwhile, on October 3, 2005, this matter proceeded to a nonjury trial before the Honorable William P. Mahon that consisted of ten days of testimony taken from October 2005 to January 2006.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Judge Mahon found that appellants had breached the lease agreement with Newman. He determined that Newman was entitled to rent from appellants from June 25, 2005 until Newman sold the shopping center on December 28, 2005. The court awarded Newman $131,277 in damages, which represented the difference between the amount of rent owed by appellants and the rent Newman actually received from PetSmart and Michael’s over the same period.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[224,975,1153,851]]]'>Both parties filed post-trial motions. As pertinent here, Newman claimed that the trial court erred in calculating damages only until December 28, 2005, rather than awarding damages based on the entire twenty-year term of the lease. The trial court ruled that Newman was entitled only to the difference in rental income between that anticipated under the lease and the rent paid by PetSmart and Michael’s for the period of time during which it owned the property. However, the court found that it had miscalculated the rental loss from June 25, 2005 through the date of the sale because PetSmart and Michael’s did not begin paying rent until December 1, 2005. Thus, the court recalculated the loss to Newman to include full rent from June 25 through December 1, 2005, and, on December 19, 2006, amended the verdict, awarding Newman damages in the amount of $316,889.92, exclusive of contractual counsel fees, expenses and costs.</p>

Appellants challenged the trial court’s finding that they breached the lease agreement with Newman as well as Newman’s entitlement to damages; the panel affirmed the trial court’s decisions in this regard. Newman renewed the argument made in its post-trial motions, claiming that the trial court erred in not applying the measure of damages outlined in Section 20.2.2 of the lease, entitled “Reletting,” which <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>provided for damages equal to the loss of rental income over the entire twenty-year term of the lease.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In short, the formula agreed to by Newman and Safeway provided compensation in the form of the actual damages caused by Safeway’s total breach of the lease agreement.</blockquote>

This amount, when subtracted from total expected rent, equals a net damages amount of $10,494,490 in rent expectation damages. There are also brokerage commission costs for the replacement tenants of $30,808 proven by [Newman] to secure the substitute tenants in this matter.</blockquote>

The Superior Court remand was not a trial proceeding but rather a posttrial/post-judgment proceeding. Rule 227.1, appellants claim, makes a clear distinction between trials and other stages of a case. In fact, appellants point out, this Court promulgated the present version of the Rule in 1989 to clarify confusion regarding whether the Rule applied to pre-trial rulings such as preliminary objections. The Court amended the Rule by add<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>ing an Official Note specifically exempting pre-trial orders because, simply put, “[p]re-trial orders do not need post-trial motions.” <em>Id. </em>at 21.

Newman echoes the panel’s focus on the purpose of Rule 227.1 in affording trial courts an opportunity to reconsider and correct errors and thus to avoid appellate review. Citing <em>Cemiga, </em>Newman argues that there is no exception to the requirement of filing post-trial motions simply because a matter is before the trial court on a remand. Regarding the specific procedural posture of this case, Newman notes that the trial court issued its remand/damages decision on February 25, 2010, and that decision occurred <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>after a trial, was the product of the trial, and was rendered at a point when all prior decisions had been vacated.

Newman acknowledges that Rule 227.1 provides exceptions to the post-trial motion requirement but maintains that remand proceedings are not among the limited exceptions.</p>

Newman disputes appellants’ account of <em>Cerniga, </em>countering that the procedural history of that case establishes that: (1) the trial court issued its initial decision following a trial; (2) the defendant filed timely post-trial motions; (3) the trial court denied the post-trial motions, and the defendant appealed; (4) the Superior Court vacated the trial court’s decision and remanded for proceedings consistent with its opinion; (5) the trial court in fact did not take any new testimony or evidence but, consistent with the panel’s directive, made new factual findings and conclusions of law based upon the existing record; (6) the trial court made the same substantive determination based upon the new findings; (7) the defendant failed to file post-trial motions; and (8) on the plaintiffs’ motion, the panel quashed the defendant’s ensuing appeal due to the failure to file post-trial motions. Newman says that appellants mischaracterize <em>Cerniga </em>because the panel there did not remand for a trial or a factual hearing, but rather remanded <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>only for proceedings consistent with the opinion. According to Newman, it is clear from the <em>Cerniga </em>trial court’s opinion on remand that it based its decision on the initial trial record. Thus, Newman concludes, <em>Cerniga </em>establishes that, in determining whether post-trial motions are required in remand scenarios, the question is not whether new facts and testimony are heard, but whether the trial court makes new factual determinations and conclusions of law — post-trial motions are required on remand regardless of whether new evidence is implicated.</p>

The Bar Associations also stress that the trial court made its specific determination without taking any additional evidence or conducting a proceeding that in any way resembled a trial.

The trial court on remand made additional factual findings and conclusions of law and issued another order, again adverse to the Boat Club. The Boat Club did not file a second set of post-trial motions, but instead appealed to the Superior Court. The appellees filed a motion to quash, and the Superior Court asked for a response from the appellant regarding whether the failure to file post-trial motions resulted in waiver. Notably, unlike appellants in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the appellant Boat Club did not argue that Rule 227.1 did not apply to remand determinations. Instead, the appellant argued that it was not obliged to file post-trial motions because the Appellate Rule 1925 process was sufficient to preserve its issues, which were the same issues raised in the prior appeal.</p>

      <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>The <em>Cerniga </em>panel granted the motion to quash. The panel noted that several of the appellant’s issues had involved additional findings of fact and conclusions of law arising on the remand, and held that the appellant had waived its appeal issues by failing to file post-trial motions:</p>
    <blockquote id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[284,629,1111,1011]]]'>[O]n direct appeal, this Court vacated the trial court’s order and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions that the court make additional findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the trial court did indeed make additional factual findings and legal conclusions on remand. By failing to file post-trial motions to the trial court’s new order, which was based on these new factual findings and conclusions of law, Boat Club frustrated the purpose of Rule 227.1 and deprived the trial court of an opportunity to correct any errors in its new ruling, albeit one that was consistent with its prior ruling. Indeed, some of the issues which Boat Club now raises on appeal specifically involve the additional factual findings and legal conclusions entered by the trial court on remand. Accordingly, we conclude that Boat Club was required under Rule 227.1 to file post-trial motions to the trial court’s May 2, 2003 order, and that by failing to do so, Boat Club has failed to preserve any issues for appellate review. We therefore grant Appellees’ motion and quash the instant appeal.</blockquote>

Moreover, although the court in <em>Cemiga </em>was careful to ask for a reply before ruling on the motion to quash, it was not presented with the argument this Court has had presented to it here: <em>ie., </em>that Rule 227.1 does not, by its <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>terms, clearly speak to remands short of a retrial. Indeed, the actual waiver dispute in <em>Cerniga </em>did not so much involve the proper scope of Civil Rule 227.1 as it did the question of whether Appellate Rule 1925 can compensate for a Rule 227.1 lapse.</p>
    <p id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[277,625,1151,1049]]]'>Looking to <em>Lenharb </em>and <em>Cemiga, </em>not for guidance as to the actual scope of Rule 227.1 as conveyed by its language, but rather for what those decisions reasonably conveyed to practicing attorneys regarding what triggers the post-trial motion requirement of the Rule in remand scenarios, we believe that the waiver holding below cannot stand. <em>Cemiga </em>stressed that the remand produced “new” and “additional” factual findings and conclusions of law. A party or attorney reading <em>Lenharb </em>and <em>Cemiga </em>could reasonably conclude that a remand proceeding before the trial court that does not involve taking new evidence or resolving a new factual dispute is not a trial within the meaning of Rule 227.1, and does not require the filing of new post-trial motions. Such a reading is buttressed by the Official Note’s advice that post-trial motions are not required in response to “other proceedings which do not constitute a trial.” And, even if this were not the best reading of the Superior Court decisional law, the fact remains that the argument forwarded here concerning the proper scope of Rule 227.1 is an argument that was not forwarded in <em>Cemiga, </em>and that is enough to take this case out of that decisional rule.</p>

But, having said that, we stress that our task encompasses more than merely interpreting and aligning the decisional law of the lower courts concerning our Civil Rules. Our primary holding remains that, notwithstanding the interpretation of the Superior Court which was powered by its accurate estimation of the Rule’s overriding purpose, the proper interpretation of the Rule is that it does not purport to address the remand scenario, and thus a party cannot be faulted — upon pain of waiver — for failing to file post-trial motions to a proceeding upon remand which amounts to less than an actual trial. A <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>remand proceeding such as the one here, that relies on an existing record, is not a trial — even if the trial court draws different conclusions from that record to comport with an appellate court’s directive. Thus, the remand proceeding in this instance, where the trial judge merely reached a different damage calculation based upon facts and contract terms already in the record, was not a “trial,” and Rule 227.1 does not apply.</p>
