Thus, § 9545 clearly dictates the PCRA court had no jurisdiction to entertain the instant petition unless appellant pled and proved one of the three statutory exceptions. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b); <em>Howard, </em>at 354. Appellant alleged the discovery he received pursuant to the 2005 federal court order provided him with newly-discovered evidence which satisfied the “governmental interference” exception to the time-bar. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)®, (ii). Specifically, he contended many facts he learned about one of the Commonwealth’s key witnesses, Rodney Carson, could have been used to impeach Carson at trial. Therefore, he concluded the Commonwealth committed <em>Brady </em>violations by failing to disclose these allegedly exculpatory facts prior to trial. The PCRA court dismissed the petition as untimely for appellant’s failure to file it within the 60-day period required for petitions subject to an exception. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2).</p>

In its notice, the PCRA court explained the “PCRA petition is formally dismissed (as being without merit). (And untimely).” Pa.R.Crim.P. 909 Notice, 4/12/07. Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 909, a PCRA court is obliged to provide a capital petitioner with pre-dismissal notice of its reasons for dismissal, thus providing the opportunity for the petitioner to seek leave to amend to cure any material defect in the petition. <em>See id., </em>909(B)(2)(a)-(b) &amp; (c)(ii). Thereafter, the court decides whether to “(i) dismiss the petition and issue an order to that effect; (ii) grant the defendant leave to file an amended petition; or (iii) order that an evidentiary hearing be held on a date certain.” <em>Id., </em>909(B)(2)(c)(i)-(iii). In the present case, the PCRA court dismissed appellant’s petition, reasoning it was meritless and untimely. While failure to bring a meritorious claim is potentially curable, failure to file a petition within the required time <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>period is not. Further explanation concerning the reasons the PCRA court found appellant’s petition untimely were unnecessary as, regardless of the reasons, appellant would be unable to cure his untimeliness.

However, while the PCRA court recognized “the process of providing [appellant’s] counsel with copies of [the] initial documents was completed on May 19, 2005,” it determined the 60-day time period was triggered April 25, 2005, when the United States Attorney’s Office made the requested documents available to appellant for review and copying. PCRA Court Opinion, 5/31/07, at 8-9, 12.

Thus, April 25, 2005, is the first date his PCRA claim could have been brought, and June 25, 2005, was the date by which he was required to bring such claims. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(2). Moreover, appellant was provided with copies of the relied upon documents by the Commonwealth on May 3, 2005.

With very rare exceptions, the point of federal <em>habeas </em>review is not to go on fishing expeditions to find new facts and claims not already presented in state court; federal courts are to review only the federal constitutional claims properly presented to state courts, while showing required deference to the reasonable decisions of the sovereign state courts. The U.S. Supreme Court made this elemental point clear this past term:</p>

Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the past tense, to a state-court adjudication that “resulted in” a decision that was contrary to, or “involved” an unreasonable application of, established law. This backward-looking language requires an examination of the state-court decision at the time it was made.
