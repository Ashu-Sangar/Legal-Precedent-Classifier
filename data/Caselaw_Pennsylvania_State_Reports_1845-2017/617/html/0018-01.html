In addition, appellant claims that the selection of Woodlands for the slots license undermines the Act’s objective of assisting the horse racing industry; according to appellant, Woodlands will have a negative impact on revenues from The Meadows Racetrack and Casino (“The Meadows”), a Category 1 facility located just 44.67 miles away from Woodlands. Appellant claims that the Board ignored “voluminous” evidence about this “cannibalization” problem. In addition, appellant argues, the Board’s selection of Woodlands as the applicant most likely to produce new revenue reflects a capricious disregard of evidence regarding the saturation of the southwestern Pennsylvania gaming market, and the unreasonable assumptions included in the financial projections of Woodlands, which is located in a sparsely populated, remote area.</p>

The Board also claims that political influence did not affect its decision, contrary to appellant’s allegations, and that appellant never raised the issue of political influence during the proceedings below. Similarly, the Board argues, appellant never raised any objection to the resignation and replacement of two Board members during the pendency of these proceedings, and that there is no evidence of bias or impropriety arising from the personnel change.

Moreover, the Board rejects appellant’s argument that Woodlands is located too close to The Meadows in Washington County, and thus undermines the Act’s goal of supporting the horse racing industry. The Board points out that the Act provides very specific requirements about distance between licensed gaming facilities, and, because Woodlands complies with these requirements, appellant’s argument that Woodlands will cannibalize revenues from The Meadows is without merit.</p>

Finally, Woodlands rejects appellant’s proffered “standard” for reviewing applicant suitability — that the Board should ensure that “no stone was left unturned” — and argues instead that it was sufficient that the BIE and the Board found on the facts of record that Woodlands and its principals established their character suitability by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1310(a)(1).</p>

Nevertheless, it is difficult to see how a grand jury investigation and ensuing report and recommendations provide a basis for reconsideration of a Board licensing decision under the Act; much less does such a report provide a basis for this Court to find that the Board’s procedures here violated due process.

Nothing in the report specifically impugns the proceedings arising out of the applications of appellant and Woodlands.

Next, Woodlands’ close proximity to both Maryland and West Virginia; its on-site air strip; and its existing large number of out-of-state guests, all but ensures its potential to generate revenue via out-of-state patrons. Even without a Category 3 license, Woodlands currently draws 350,000 visitors annually, with 100,000 of those visitors staying overnight.

Writing for the Court, Mr. Chief Justice Cappy stated that the “prudent man rule” does not “channel this Court’s appellate review,” and instead determined that this Court must affirm the Board’s decision unless we find “an error of law or that the order, determination or decision of the board was arbitrary and there was a capricious disregard of the evidence,” in accordance with the appellate standard of review expressly set forth in the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 242^13 (citing 4 Pa.C.S. § 1204).

Also in concurrence, Messrs. Justice Saylor and Baer, likewise stated a view that the “prudent man rule” applies to the Board’s actions in licensing decisions, and should be considered by this Court in its appellate review of decisions implicating that rule.

The majority rejects this claim by stating that the Gaming Act’s requirement that the Board use the prudent man standard has no effect upon the review that this Court must undertake in determining whether the Board erred in the award of a gaming license. It would appear, however, that if it were evident that the Board failed to apply such a standard as required by statute, this would constitute an error of law, thus providing possible grounds for reversal. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1204 (stating that this Court must affirm the Board’s order unless it finds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board committed an error of law). Under the facts of this case, moreover, Majestic Star’s troubled financial history does raise a legitimate question as to whether a “prudent man” would have selected PITG over its competitors for licensure. Still, as the majority points out, the record contains evidence of some positive indicators. For example, the financial suitability task force found that PITG had the resources to build its casino, and the Board determined that the project would be very profitable. Therefore, given this Court’s highly deferential review as prescribed by the Legislature, I must ultimately conclude that the Board’s actions did not constitute reversible error under the prudent man standard.</blockquote>

However, the Board weighed that evidence within the context of the new, “non-cannibalized” revenue potential from the extensive out-of-state clientele of Woodlands. <em>See supra </em>at 36-37. We find no imprudence or error in the Board’s consideration. The question, as to this challenge at least, is not the comparative suitability of Woodlands, but its absolute suitability, as measured by a prudent man standard. We recognize that the other applicants here might also be financially suitable for licensure, or even more so than Woodlands on the measure of revenue projection (itself an uncertain and subjective endeavor), but this does not prove the unsuitability of Woodlands or disqualify that applicant. As long as Woodlands was properly found to be financially suitable under the Act, the fact that other applicants might have been stronger candidates on this one factor does not lead inexorably to the conclusion that the Board erred in granting the slots license to Woodlands. <em>Cf. Station Square, </em>927 A.2d at 245 (Board may consider quality of facility in determining which applicant receives slots license, but Act does not impose burden on applicant to show by clear and convincing evidence that its proposed facility is “the best quality”).

The record indicates that, in the past, the 2001 Trust obtained a line of credit in order to provide loans to 84 Lumber. However, the BIE sought and received information regarding the ability of the owners to satisfy the letter of credit if necessary without implicating Woodlands, and determined that, at the time of the suitability hearings in this case, there were no outstanding loans to 84 Lumber relative to this line of credit. Further details about 84 Lumber’s financial stability were revealed in a confidential “Category 3 Background Investigation and Suitability Report,” and also during a closed executive session held by the Board in order to receive testimony about the finances of the privately held company, as well as sensitive character issues raised relating to its founder, and the grantor of the 2001 Trust, Joseph Hardy.

N.T. 11/17/10, 1^49.

While the Grand Jury Report does not relate specifically to the licensing decision in this case, the report nonetheless provides insight into the short-comings of the Board’s procedures generally, emphasizing that the specific cases discussed were merely “the best examples of problems and failures that extended throughout the application and licensing process in all the license categories.” Grand Jury Report No. 1 (“GJR”) at 38.

Investigators also detailed how information they acquired was not adequately presented to the Board in the final suitability reports prepared by the Bureau of Licensing, and the applicant’s burden of establishing good character by clear and convincing evidence was shifted to the investigators. This created a huge loophole in the thoroughness and accuracy of the BIE information getting to the Board, especially areas of concern found throughout BIE investigations.</blockquote>

In discussing why certain investigatory information was removed from reports presented to the Board, the Chief Enforcement Counsel to the Board explained that “the goal with regard to the suitability reports was to secure stipulation from the other side, from the applicant, as to its admissibility and making it part of the record.” <em>Id. </em>at 57.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> If a stipulation was not secured, the investigators had to demonstrate absolute proof of the questioned piece of information for it to be included in the final report to the Board.

Specifically, Mason-Dixon alleges that the Board inadequately investigated the allegations against the Woodlands’ principals during an executive session in November 2010 regarding the criminal complaint against Mr. Hardy and the allegation of interference with the criminal investigation involving that complaint. My review of the closed executive session confirms Mason-Dixon’s concerns in regard to the interference allegation. It appears that at the Board’s executive session the representative of the Office of Enforcement Counsel (“OEC”) relied exclusively on assertions of the Woodlands’ principals in affidavits, very brief testimony, and on the assumption that the fear of other criminal prosecution was sufficient to protect against the principals perjuring themselves before the Board. It is not clear whether the OEC or the BIE attempted to contact anyone other than the Woodlands’ principals. Given the Grand Jury’s findings that the investigators were often prevented from performing thorough investigations and that the information they did gather was not always passed on to the Board, I am particularly disturbed <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>by the cursory investigation into alleged interference with a criminal investigation.</p>
    <p id="b108-4" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[293,449,1152,1212]]]'>Notwithstanding BIE’s seemingly obvious failure to investigate fully the allegations in this case, the record reveals that the Board accepted BIE’s investigation as sufficient. I find that conclusion is not supported by the current record, especially considering that the Gaming Act requires the applicant to prove suitability by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>4 Pa.C.S. § 1310(a). Even if it is eventually determined that the principals did not interfere with the criminal investigation, the Board must base its conclusion of character suitability on more than self-serving affidavits, very brief testimony, and the belief that if the parties were lying they would have more to worry about than the denial of a gaming license. While I recognize that the Gaming Act provides for confidentiality of information submitted by applicants or obtained by the BIE or the Board for purposes of character suitability review, I nonetheless believe that such confidentiality places a duty on the Board to probe and assess the accuracy of this information that is not otherwise subject to public scrutiny. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1206(f), 1310(a). The Board cannot act as a rubber stamp for character suitability but must instead conduct a thorough and searching inquiry to determine whether an applicant has proven its principal’s character suitability by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

The absence of a full investigation and inquiry is particularly concerning given that two former Pennsylvania State Police troopers brought a lawsuit against the State Police alleging that they were subject to discriminatory and illegal employment practices in retaliation for their reporting and investigation of the allegation that the state trooper associated with the Woodlands’ principals attempted to interfere with the Hardy criminal investigation. The State Police settled this lawsuit for $675,000, which in my view, lends credence to the allega<a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>tion that some individuals were attempting to benefit Mr. Hardy and the Woodlands by interfering with the police investigation.</p>

Accordingly, I dissent from the affirmance of the grant of the Category 3 slot machine license to Woodlands Fayette, LLC. Instead, I would remand for a proper investigation into the allegations against the principals in this case.
