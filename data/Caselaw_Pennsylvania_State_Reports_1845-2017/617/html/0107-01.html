    <p id="b152-6" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[292,495,1150,842]]]'>In this appeal, our Court is presented with two questions: (1) whether a defendant’s convictions for first-degree murder and other crimes which rest solely on subsequently recanted out-of-court statements given to police violate the due process guarantees of either the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions; and (2) whether the confessions of a former co-defendant should have been admitted as evidence as statements against interest under Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3). After careful consideration, we hold the recanting witnesses’ out-of-court statements to the police were sufficient to sustain Appellant’s convictions against a due process challenge. However, because we also find that the trial court erred by not allowing other portions of the co-defendant’s confessions to be entered into evidence as statements against interest, we are constrained to vacate Appellant’s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>

    <p id="b152-8" data-blocks='[["BL_152.7",152,[290,1485,1153,683]]]'>The following pertinent factual and procedural history is necessary to understand the issues presented by this appeal. In the evening hours of December 4, 2000, at or around 8:43 p.m., a group of men were assembled outside the Cleveland Minimarket (“Minimarket”), located at the intersection of Cleveland and York Streets in the North Philadelphia neighborhood. Abutting the southern border of the Minimarket was a vacant lot. Immediately behind the Minimarket, adjoining its western side, was a six-foot-wide alleyway which exited onto York Street. The men congregated outside of the Mini-market were involved in a dice game, played on the sidewalk which lay between the eastern side of the Minimarket and Cleveland Street (“Cleveland Street sidewalk”).</p>
    <p id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.3",153,[210,335,1152,728]]]'>
      <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>As the dice game concluded, three of the players, Anthony “Manny” Williams, Keita “Ta Ta” Lacey, and Donald McCoy a/k/a “Don King,” walked up the Cleveland Street sidewalk and turned left onto the sidewalk which lay between the northern side of the minimarket and York Street (“York Street sidewalk”). The three men stopped near the corner of the two sidewalks where a payphone was located, as McCoy decided to make a phone call. While McCoy was talking on the phone, with Williams and Lacey standing nearby, armed gunmen, who had covered the lower portions of their faces, rushed towards the trio and opened fire. All three men were struck during the ensuing hail of bullets. There was no evidence that any of the shooting victims fired back at their assailants during this episode.</p>
    <p id="b153-5" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[207,1087,1153,675]]]'>After the shooters fled, bystanders used their cars to transport the victims to nearby Temple Hospital. Two of the injured men, Lacey and Williams, were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. The Philadelphia Medical Examiner later determined, after examining a bullet taken from Lacey’s body, that Lacey died of a gunshot wound to his left hip inflicted by a .44 caliber bullet. The Medical Examiner concluded that Williams died from heavy internal bleeding caused by a .38/.357<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">1</a> caliber bullet.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a> McCoy was shot in the right side of his abdomen; additionally, a spent .44 caliber round was recovered from the inside of his jacket. McCoy underwent emergency surgery, and he subsequently made a full recovery.</p>

Ballistics testing revealed that all six empty cartridges were ejected by the firing of a single “9 mm” firearm, which Officer Lay opined was either a “Glock” or “Smith and Wesson” model. A 9 mm. semiautomatic pistol was also found by Officer Cona<a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>way, lodged underneath Williams’ body as it lay on the sidewalk. Testing of this weapon indicated it was not the source of the spent 9 millimeter shell casings. Additionally, a bullet fragment of undetermined origin was discovered intermixed with the spent shell casings. Further, a bullet strike mark was observed by one of the investigating officers on the wall behind the payphone where McCoy was standing. Based on his examination of the totality of the recovered physical evidence, Officer Lay opined at trial that three separate guns had been discharged during the shooting episode. Officer Lay testified that the .44 caliber round recovered from McCoy’s jacket and Lacey’s body was most likely fired by the same .44 caliber revolver; the .38/.357 magnum round recovered from Williams’ body was probably fired by a .38A357 caliber revolver; and the spent 9mm cartridges were ejected during the firing of a semiautomatic weapon.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a> The actual guns used in the shootings were never recovered by the police.</p>
    <p id="b154-5" data-blocks='[["BL_154.4",154,[278,1239,1151,784]]]'>Although a crowd gathered near the scene in the shooting’s immediate aftermath, no one came forward to offer police any information. Consequently, the investigation was at a standstill for over a month and a half, until, on January 23, 2001, an individual called the police station and requested to speak with the homicide detective who was overseeing the investigation into the shootings — Detective Gerald Lynch. After the individual on the phone told Detective Lynch that he was an eyewitness to the shooting, and, also, that he knew one of the victims, Williams, Detective Lynch asked him to come to the homicide division and talk with him about the investigation. The individual complied — presenting himself to Detective Lynch as “John Garvin,” N.T. Trial, 2/2/06, at 157; however, the individual was not, in fact, John Garvin, but, rather, his younger brother David Garvin.</p>

Detective Lynch had Garvin sign the bottom of each page of the statement, in addition to an “adoption attestation form” at the end of the statement, which is an affirmance by the signatory that he has read the statement and agrees it is true and correct. In each place Garvin signed, he used the name “John Garvin.” N.T. Trial, 2/1/06, at 275-279.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[197,803,1153,1124]]]'>In the statement, Garvin related that the following series of events occurred on the night of the shooting: Around 8:43 p.m., he was walking up York Street in the direction of the Minimarket, and he stopped outside a convenience store located across from the Minimarket. While standing there, Garvin looked down Cleveland Street and saw Appellant and Jasaan Walker, both of whom he had known for two years, walking up Cleveland Street towards York Street. He noticed them enter the vacant lot on the southern side of the Minimarket and then, very shortly thereafter, saw two people come out from the alley behind the Minimarket and onto York Street. Although both of these individuals wore masks around their mouth and nose, Garvin was confident that they were Appellant and Walker because of the short duration between his observation of them going into the lot and the appearance of the two masked men on York Street. According to Garvin, once Appellant and Walker emerged from the alley onto York Street, both began shooting at Williams, Lacey, and McCoy. Garvin heard approximately five or six shots; Appellant carried a nine millimeter handgun, and Walker had a “Glock 40;” and the entire episode lasted 10 or 15 seconds.</p>
    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[196,1968,1150,416]]]'>Detective Lynch testified that, after Garvin provided him with this information, he showed Garvin two computer generated photo arrays. Garvin selected Appellant’s picture from the first array, chose Walker’s photo from the second array, and identified both as the individuals he saw shoot the victims. Garvin printed the name “John Garvin” and the date on a copy of both photo arrays underneath each of the photos he had chosen. N.T. Trial, 2/1/06, at 276-279.</p>

      <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>One week after Detective Lynch’s interview of Garvin, on January 30, 2001, Lynch and another detective transported Lionel Lawrence from his home to the police station for questioning, as one of the bystanders at the shooting had supplied Lawrence’s name to the police. Detective Lynch, who recorded the interview by hand, recalled that Lawrence, who had moved from the neighborhood shortly before the interview, was upset the detective wanted to talk to him about the murders and said he was “concerned for his well-being.” N.T., Trial, 2/6/06, at 124, 127. According to Lawrence’s statement, on the night of the shootings, he was traveling along York Street and turned left onto Cleveland Street when he observed Lacey, whom he knew, standing near the payphone at the corner of York and Cleveland Streets with Williams, McCoy and others, and he decided to stop to talk. When traffic began to back up due to his stopped vehicle, he decided to circle the block. When he prepared to turn again onto Cleveland Street from York Street, he saw two men, wearing dark jackets and with their mouths covered by masks, approach the Minimarket on the York Street sidewalk and shoot Lacey, Williams, and McCoy. He accelerated down Cleveland Street out of fear, but then, after the shooting ceased, he backed up Cleveland Street to the corner. McCoy got into Lawrence’s car, and Lawrence drove him to Temple Hospital and helped him into the emergency room.</p>

Appellant was taken into custody in February 2001. He did not make a confession, nor did he provide any inculpatory statements related to the shootings. His preliminary hearing was held on March 8, 2001. At that hearing, David Garvin testified, under his real name, and recounted substantially the <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>same details included in the statement he had previously given to Detective Lynch. Garvin further testified that he was standing “two or three” feet away from Appellant and the victims when the shootings occurred. N.T. Trial, 2/1/06, at 294-295 (quoting N.T.

Trial, 2/2/06, at 22 (quoting N.T. Preliminary Hearing, 3/8/01). At the conclusion of the hearing, Appellant was held for trial on two counts of first-degree murder and related offenses.</p>

Based on these confessions, Walker was held for trial on two counts of first-degree murder and other charges.</p>

Detective Centeno had Lanier transported to Philadelphia in March 2004 to interview him, and while speaking with Detective Centeno about that murder, Lanier told him that he also had information regarding the instant case. Lanier claimed that he was present the evening of the shooting, and he gave the following version of the events: Lanier was playing dice with Lacey, Williams, and McCoy, whom Lanier considered to be his best friend, on the Cleveland Street sidewalk and had lost all of his money. Once the dice game broke up, and the three went to the corner where the Cleveland and York Street sidewalks met, Lanier followed. While Williams was talking on the phone, Lanier crossed York Street and stood at the northwest corner of York and Cleveland Streets to wait for him to finish. At that moment, Lanier noticed Appellant and Walker, both of whom he had known for 11 years, peeking out from a nearby lot. Appellant and Walker then exited the lot wearing masks and carrying guns. Lanier watched them as they rushed towards the corner and opened fire.</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[277,1465,1148,468]]]'>On May 18, 2004, Lanier was interviewed again by two members of the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office — Assistant District Attorney Mark Gilson, who prosecuted Appellant at trial, and Assistant District Attorney Edward McCann. During this interview, according to the trial testimony of ADA McCann, Lanier’s statement to Detective Senteno and Fuss’ role in the shooting were discussed. Lanier also mentioned that he was receiving threats in prison, and, as a result, ADA McCann arranged to have Lanier moved to a different facility.</p>

Lanier claimed that in April 2004 Walker approached him in a Philadelphia correctional facility where they were both being held, and told him to “bend but don’t break,” which Lanier interpreted as an instruction to tell detectives a little bit of the truth about how <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>the incident transpired, but not to tell them everything. N.T. Trial, 2/6/06, at 20. Lanier also related to Detective Rodden that Walker’s mother, during a visit to that same prison facility, asked him not to testify against her son, or, if he did testify, to “flip.” <em>Id. </em>at 19. Lanier described “flipping” to Detective Rodden as the practice of telling police one thing and then, when on the witness stand at trial, telling the opposite story and taking the defense side. <em>Id. </em>at 20. Lanier also recounted that his girlfriend, who was present at the prison with Walker’s mother, urged him not to testify against Appellant and Walker, noting that “we live around there,” and threatening that she would cease to have contact with him. <em>Id. </em>at 19.</p>

Midway through the hearing, after the detectives who took his confessions testified, and his videotaped confession was played for Judge Hughes, Walker, through his attorney, approached ADA Gilson about the possibility of reaching a plea deal.</p>

Appellant’s Brief at 23. In <em>Orrico, </em>a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the defendant’s conviction for participation in a fraudulent insurance company capitalization scheme involving check deposits. When the government’s two witnesses testified that they could not remember whether the defendant instructed them to deposit certain checks, the prosecution introduced, as its sole evidence inculpating the defendant, each witness’s prior inconsistent statement, which identified the defendant as the individual who ordered them to deposit the checks. Appellant notes the Sixth Circuit recognized that <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>these prior inconsistent statements met the minimal standards for admissibility as evidence, but found, as the statements were the government’s sole evidence, they did not provide a “substantial factual basis as to each element of the crime, providing support for a conclusion of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.” Appellant’s Brief at 23 (quoting <em>Orrico, </em><a href="/f2d/599/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="599 F.2d 113" data-case-ids="489268" data-case-paths="/f2d/599/0113-01">599 F.2d at 118</a>). Appellant submits that the <em>Orrico </em>panel was concerned by the fact that the defendant had no opportunity to cross examine the witnesses about the accuracy of those statements at the time they made them, and, because of this lack of cross examination, the panel viewed such statements to be of limited utility in a criminal trial.

In response, the United States Senate Committee considering the Rule stated that it was “not addressed to the sufficiency of evidence to send a case to the jury, but merely to its admissibility. ...

Consequently, in the Commonwealth’s view, a uniform rule which requires reversal of a conviction in every instance that prior inconsistent statements are used to support a conviction would disregard the integrity of a jury verdict since it would mandate an automatic conclusion, on appellate review, that the jury was wrong to rely on such statements in reaching a verdict without allowing any further inquiry into the probative value of the evidence.</p>

This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts. Once a defendant has been found guilty of the crime charged, the factfinder’s role as weigher of the evidence is preserved through a legal conclusion that upon judicial review all of the evidence is to be considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution.

We agree with Professor McCormick that a finder-of-fact should be permitted to hear of any such improper influence which a recanting witness may have been subjected to, as it is integral to the finder-of-fact’s credibility determinations. Once again, observation of the witness at the time he or she made the original statement is not necessary for the finder-of-fact to make this assessment at trial, but, rather, allowing the parties to utilize the “great engine of cross examination” is a suitably efficacious means by which any such influences may be unearthed, and their potential impact on the witness’s alteration of his or her story suitably considered by the finder-of-fact.</p>

Further, once its witnesses have recanted while on the stand, the Commonwealth, in order to carry its burden of proof, is forced into the position of having to convince the finder-of-fact that its own witnesses were, at once, unreliable and unbelievable when testifying in court, but wholly reliable and believable when they gave their prior statements. The defendant is, of course, free to further attempt to cast doubt on the Commonwealth’s case by cross examining the witnesses to suggest to the finder-of-fact that the substance of the in-court recantation is most credible, but the defendant is not required to prove anything at all in response to the recantations.

Garvin, Lawrence and Lanier were thoroughly tested through cross examination at Appellant’s trial, so that the jury had the opportunity to observe these witnesses as they repudiated their out-of-court statements, and to assess the credibility of their explanations for the repudiations. Further, the three out-of-court statements were fundamentally consistent with one another in recounting the same narrative of the manner in which the shooting transpired and in describing similar essential details; thus, they were not so patently unreliable so as to render a jury verdict based upon them one of pure conjecture. Under these circumstances, the out-of-court statements of Garvin, Lawrence and Lanier furnished legally sufficient evidence to sustain Appellant’s convictions, and, hence, his convictions did not violate due process.</p>

Consequently, Fuss came to view Williams as a threat to the viability of the operation and hatched a plan to exact revenge on Williams, which resulted in a pact among Walker, Fuss, and Cub to kill Williams. Although he characterized himself as a reluctant participant in Fuss’s plan, Walker nevertheless acquiesced to Fuss’s request to meet him on the evening of December 4, 2000 at a home located at the corner of Cumberland Avenue and 18th Street in order to carry out the murder of Williams.</p>

Appellant observes that, even after receiving these warnings and giving this consent, Walker further amplified, in his videotaped confession, the admissions he had made in his written confession.

The Commonwealth asserts that what makes a statement admissible under this exception, is only the declarant’s “self-inculpation” since it is what subjects the declarant to criminal liability. Commonwealth’s Brief at 42. The Commonwealth contends that non-self-inculpatory parts of a confession are not admissible under this exception because they do not subject the maker to criminal liability. The Commonwealth characterizes the portions of Walker’s confessions in which he implicated his half-brothers in the shooting as “collateral,” as they were not self-inculpatory.</p>

Commonwealth’s Brief at 42. The Commonwealth also suggests Walker may have named his half-brothers out of a desire for revenge since he was arrested for capital murder, while they remained free; hence, this may be why Walker was so explicit in detailing their drug dealing activities.

The Commonwealth argues that, because of this lack of corroborating evidence, the confessions are not admissible under Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3) for this additional reason. The Commonwealth assigns little value to Walker’s correct description of the weapons used by the shooters, characterizing it as not “particularly remarkable” that a killer would know this type of information. <em>Id. </em>at 44. The Commonwealth also discounts Walker’s admission of his own in<a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>volvement in the drug dealing network with his half-brothers, as well as his admission to the crime of conspiracy because, from the Commonwealth’s perspective, Walker’s naming of his half-brothers did not personally inculpate Walker, and, thus, was merely “gratuitous.” Commonwealth’s Brief at 46.

Nevertheless, Walker freely and openly admitted to his commission of the aforementioned criminal acts, describing in intricate detail: the creation of a pact with two other individuals to kill Williams; their planning of the killing; the implementation of those plans by the execution of a coordinated ambush on Williams and his companions; and the steps they took, together, to conceal their involvement after the shootings.

    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[274,564,1151,670]]]'>Also, Walker gave a nearly identical account of his criminal actions, both in his written confession and, significantly, in the confession which was videotaped by the investigating detectives. As Appellant notes, this was not a situation where a self inculpatory statement was given in a remote setting where there were no witnesses, and the recipient of the statement was a person of questionable character. Instead, these confessions were given in a police station to detectives who scrupulously recorded every word in writing and with a video camera exactly as Walker said them. Hence, Walker’s confessions were given under conditions which gave maximum assurance that their contents were an accurate reflection of what he said.</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[274,1266,1151,723]]]'>Moreover, in making these confessions, Walker did not try to shift the responsibility for his actions from himself to anyone else. While he also implicated his half-brothers, he did so only in the context of explaining his own involvement with them in the commission of the crimes. Although he indicated that he felt some reluctance at one point in participating with his half-brothers in the commission of the crimes, he, nevertheless, admitted to willingly doing so and never suggested that they coerced, threatened or otherwise forced him to do so. Also, Walker’s primary purpose in giving his confessions did not seem to be a desire to exonerate Appellant, as he did not, in those confessions, bring up Appellant’s non-involvement — except in response to inquiries from the investigating detectives.</p>

In his confessions, Walker described the gun he was carrying as a .44 magnum revolver, and also stated that Cub had a .38 caliber revolver, while Fuss had a “dock” 9 millimeter. These were the precise caliber and type of the <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>three guns which the Commonwealth’s ballistics expert opined were used in the shooting.

These competing views cannot be resolved solely from an examination of the plain meaning of the relevant terms of Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3). As indicated previously, “statement” is defined by Pa.R.E. 801(a) as an “assertion.” Assertion, in turn, is defined as “a positive statement or declaration.” <em>Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary, </em>125 (2d. Ed.1998). The term “statement” is ascribed two widely accepted and common meanings, one broad in scope and one narrow. <em>See id. </em>at 1861 (defining “statement” alternatively as “a communication or declaration in speech or writing, setting forth facts, particulars etc.” or “a single sentence or assertion”).</p>

The first and paramount factor to be considered is the foundation on which this rule rests, namely, the belief that it is a fundamental aspect of human nature that people will not make statements that are harmful to their own interests unless they have “substantial reason to believe that the statements are true.” 2 McCormick On Evidence § 319; <em>see also </em>Bernard S. Jefferson, <em>Declarations Against Interest: An Exception to the Hearsay Rule, </em><a href="/citations/?q=58%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="58 Harv. L.

It is for this reason declarations against penal interest have been deemed sufficiently reliable to be admissible at trial, despite the fact that they are hearsay and the declarant is unavailable for cross examination. Thus, a construction of Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3) which admits only those individual statements in a declaration which subject the maker to criminal liability would seem best suited to effectuate that purpose.</p>

      <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>The Commonwealth makes no argument in regard to harmless error, nor do we discern how the Commonwealth could carry its burden of demonstrating that the trial court’s exclusion of Walker’s statements in which he admitted to conspiring with two other individuals to having murdered Williams, and to having personally shot Williams, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. This evidence would have been significant to the jury’s consideration of the question of Appellant’s guilt, as it showed that two other individuals acted in concert with Walker to shoot the victims, not one. Walker’s statements thus directly contradicted the Commonwealth’s theory of the case that Appellant acted in conjunction with only one other person to shoot the victims, and, also, directly contradicted the out-of-court statements of Garvin, Lanier, and Lawrence, on which the Commonwealth relied as the sole evidence to convict Appellant, since each of those out-of-court statements described the shooting as having been committed by only two people. In light of the fact that the Commonwealth presented no evidence in support of Appellant’s guilt other than the out-of-court statements of Garvin, Lawrence and Lanier, which each of these witnesses repudiated on the stand, and, most significantly, that the ballistics evidence suggested three shooters were involved, not two as the out-of-court statements indicated, we cannot regard the trial court’s error in excluding Walker’s self-inculpatory statements as harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Consequently, Appellant is entitled to a new trial. On remand, if Jasaan Walker is again unavailable to testify, the trial court may consider, consistent with the guidelines set forth in this opinion, whether any remaining portions of Walker’s confessions, in addition to those discussed herein, as well as the identity of the two other shooters whom Walker identified as his half-brothers, are admissible under Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3) or under any other rule of evidence.</p>

Secondly we hold that, in determining whether an out-of-court declaration is admissible under Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3) for subjecting its maker to potential criminal liability, a trial court must examine each of the individual statements in the declaration, in the context in which it was made and in context with the other statements and factual circumstances surrounding the criminal activity described in the declaration, and admit only those individual statements which “so far tended to subject the declarant to ... criminal liability ... that a reasonable person in the declarant’s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.” Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3). Accordingly, while we approve the lower courts’ rulings regarding the sufficiency of the evidence, we conclude that the lower courts erred in excluding those self-inculpatory portions of Walker’s confessions discussed above, and that such error was not harmless. Thus, Appellant is entitled to a new trial consistent with the evidentiary guidelines set forth in this opinion.</p>

Consequently, Appellant’s present assertion that the prior inconsistent statements of the Commonwealth’s trial witnesses, repudiated at trial, were too unreliable to establish, as a matter of law, his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is a claim which implicates the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>

Appellant additionally has raised arguments in his brief contending the trial court’s decision to preclude the admission of Walker's confessions and also the terms of the plea agreement the Commonwealth reached with Walker, which stated Walker would not testify at Appellant’s trial, constituted due process violations since both actions interfered with Appellant’s constitutional right to present a defense at trial. In his thoughtful concurrence, Justice Saylor has cogently highlighted the troubling aspects of the factual record recited at greater length, <em>infra, </em>which he deems to raise significant due process concerns. In sum, this evidence suggests that the Commonwealth prevented the jury from hearing from a witness who gave a statement to the police implicating himself and two other individuals in the shooting, and who also furnished details consistent with the ballistics evidence recovered from the scene, but inconsistent with the Commonwealth’s theory of the case that there were only two shooters, while, at the same time, the Commonwealth secured an express agreement from the witness that guaranteed he would be placed outside of the ability of Appellant to cross examine him at trial.

R.E. 804(b)(3), the portions of Walker's confessions in which he admits to shooting the victims along with his two half-brothers "surely" qualify as an admission against interest as they tended to subject him to criminal liability, and that a reasonable person in Walker’s position would not have made the confession unless he believed it was true. Amicus Brief at 26. Amicus points out these confessions resulted in subjecting Walker to drug, conspiracy, and homicide charges. However, Amicus suggests that it is not only such plainly inculpatory statements which fall within the ambit of rules of this nature, but, rather, these rules can be construed to allow the admission of statements which, while not directly inculpatory, nevertheless give the police "significant details about the crime,” <em>id. </em>at 29 (quoting <em>Williamson v.

Amicus propounds that, because Walker's statements that he and his half-brothers shot the victims satisfies the requirements of Rule 804(b)(3) because they subject him to criminal liability, we need not consider the question of whether collateral but non-inculpatory statements are admissible as well under this rule. However, Amicus notes that at least one jurisdiction, Iowa, has held that collateral material which is "necessary to provide context to the [inculpatory] statements” is admissible under its equivalent exception to the hearsay rule. <em><a href="/nj/158/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="293" data-cite="158 N.J. 230" data-case-ids="751949" data-case-paths="/nj/158/0230-01">Id.</a> </em>at 32 n. 8 (quoting <em>State v.

With respect to the corroboration requirements of Pa.R.E. 804(b)(3), Amicus asserts these ought not to be construed in a manner so stringent that they interfere with a defendant’s ability to present relevant evidence to the jury, and the corroborating factors need not prove the statement is true, but, rather, must simply be sufficiently trustworthy for admission into evidence, with the jury making the ultimate determination as to whether they should be believed or disbelieved.</p>

Concurring and Dissenting Opinion (Castille, C.J.) at 190-91, 52 A.3d at 1190-91. We respectfully disagree. As Justice Saylor notes in his Concurring Opinion, Concurring Opinion (Saylor J.) at 183-84, 52 A.3d at 1186, Appellant requested that the trial court admit Walker’s confessions in their entirety as declarations against penal interest, and the statements which we presently conclude should have been admitted into evidence by the trial court on that basis comprise a discrete subset of the total number of statements comprising Walker’s confessions. Appellant has specifically argued at all times, and in all phases of this litigation, that Walker's statements were admissible as declarations against penal interest because their contents were self-inculpatory, and he renews this theory of relief in the present appeal before our Court. Thus, while not all of the statements in Walker's confessions were self-inculpatory, Appellant is, nevertheless, entitled to relief for the improper exclusion by the trial court of the specific statements of Walker which were self-inculpatory.</p>

With regard to Rule 804(b)(3)’s specification that declarations against penal interest may only be admitted where corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the statement’s trustworthiness, I am in alignment with the majority to the degree it finds this prerequisite satisfied based upon external circumstances, primarily: the fact that the ballistics evidence recovered by the police aligned with Walker’s description of the number and types of weapons used in the crime, <em>accord U.S. ex rel.

Most notably, I would not assign any weight to Walker’s assertion that he was threatened with death if he cooperated with the police, or his denial that the police offered him leniency in return for his confession. These do not seem like the type of items that can supply corroboration for Rule 804(b)(3) purposes, as the majority seems to indicate. The statements — which the majority appears to accept as fact, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 167-68, 52 A.3d at 1176-77 — constitute untested allegations in the declaration itself. I am circumspect about relying on such allegations as “circumstances” tending, on their own, to bolster the reliability of the statement in which they appear. <em>See generally </em>Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), Advisory Committee Note (“The requirement of corroboration should be construed in such a manner as to effectuate its purpose of circumventing fabrication.”).</p>

Nevertheless, I do not understand this Court’s present holding to encompass a specific requirement that Walker’s identification of his half-brothers as his co-conspirators be placed before the jury. In my reading, the majority leaves room for the trial court to redact such names if it finds that they do not tend to inculpate Walker. Even assuming such a redaction occurs, however, I concur with the majority that the trial court’s error was not harmless because an alleged three-man conspiracy, together with ballistics evidence indicating that three weapons were used, could have raised a reasonable doubt as to whether the prior statements of Lawrence, Garvin, and Lanier were trustworthy. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 178-80, 52 A.3d at 1183-84.</p>

The "surmise or conjecture” language of <em>Farquharson, </em>in a sufficiency analysis, obviously was an unfortunate choice of words. Evidence is sufficient or it is not; evidence satisfying each of the elements is presented or it is not. When there is evidence as to all elements of the crime, sufficient for the case to go to the factfinder, the question of guilt is for the factfinder, period. As a matter of logic, it is weight claims, not sufficiency claims, that authorize post-decisional judicial intervention premised upon the strength of otherwise sufficient evidence.</p>

Indeed, the contrary approach is absurd, essentially forcing the trial judge into a partisan advocate's role, to become co-counsel (if not senior partner) to trial counsel. Enforcement of salutary and fundamental issue preservation principles here is particularly appropriate because, as the proponent of the evidence, appellant bore the burden of persuasion regarding why the exculpatory parts of the confessions were relevant and admissible as exceptions to hearsay. Moreover, counsel’s choice to forgo parsing Walker’s confessions and, instead, to seek admission of them <em>in toto </em>was likely tactical, since the governing law — until today— would have counseled that the only relevant, exculpatory parts of Walker's confessions were inadmissible hearsay unless bootstrapped to Walker's self-inculpatory statements which were irrelevant to appellant’s defense. <em>Accord Commonwealth v.

When the trial judge receives the Court’s Opinion informing her of the error she made, which requires the time and expense of a new murder trial, she will no doubt be surprised to learn that she has been faulted for a ruling and decision appellant never asked her to make. To make matters worse, she will be faced with a situation where neither appellant, nor the Majority, have yet bothered to parse the statement and identify its allegedly admissible sub-components. Apparently, this will be left to the trial judge. Evidence is not vague or ephemeral; it (like an evidentiary proffer) is supposed to be specific. The judge will be warranted in wondering, if she really was so wrong in her non-ruling, why is it so difficult to specify exactly what “parts” of the hearsay statements she was obliged to <em>sua sponte </em>mine and deem admissible.</p>

In any event, the predicate of this theory is missing here because Walker’s self-inculpatory declarations were irrelevant to either the Commonwealth’s case or appellant's defense, and were, therefore, inadmissible themselves.

But, I would note that the question of what type of corroboration is sufficient is not yet settled. One commentator has described the definition of "corroboration” in the context of the federal Rule 804(b)(3) as "hopelessly confused.” McCormick on Evidence, Practitioner Treatise Series, § 319, at 328 (5th Ed. 1999). McCormick suggests that "[cjorroboration of the trustworthiness of the out-of-court declaration should generally focus on the circumstances of making of the statement and the motivation of the declarant.... Significantly, the rule does not require that the statements themselves be independently proved to be accurate; rather it requires only that corroborating circumstances indicate trustworthiness.” <em>Id.</em>
