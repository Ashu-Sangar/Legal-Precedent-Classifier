Basile commenced a civil action against H &amp; R Block, Inc., H &amp; R Block Eastern Tax Services, Inc. (collectively, the “Block companies” or “Block”), and Mellon Bank. Ms. Basile alleged, among other things, that the Block companies maintained and breached fiduciary duties in connection with their “Rapid Refund” program.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> This program allowed customers to receive the amount of their income tax refund within days after electronically filing their income tax return via a short-term bank loan, termed “refund anticipation loans.” Although the program was apparently a profitable one, it raised concerns on the part of various regulators and spawned a number of civil actions nationwide. <em>See, e.g., Reynolds v. Beneficial Natl Bank, </em><a href="/f3d/288/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="288 F.3d 277" data-case-ids="9437003" data-case-paths="/f3d/288/0277-01">288 F.3d 277</a>, 280 (7th Cir.2002) (observing that, beginning in 1990, more than twenty class actions were brought against Block and others, charging violations of state and federal consumer-finance laws and breaches of fiduciary duty under state law). In the present one, Ms. Basile asserted that the program was deceptive, because, while customers may have understood that payment <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>of a fee was required, they did not apprehend that they actually received a loan, and they did not know the high rate of interest imposed. <em>See <a href="/f3d/288/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="288 F.3d 277" data-case-ids="9437003" data-case-paths="/f3d/288/0277-01">id.</a> </em>(explaining that the annual interest rate on a refund anticipation loan “will often exceed 100 percent — easily a quarter of the refund, even though the loan may be outstanding for only a few days”). Ms. Basile sought to assert claims on behalf of herself and others who were similarly situated.</p>

The common pleas court’s conclusion, in this respect, was based on the premises that Block was not the plaintiffs’ agent and that no confidential relationship otherwise existed between the parties. In the ensuing appellate litigation, the court’s decision on the agency score ultimately was conclusively sustained. <em>See Basile v.

Here, Plaintiffs did not establish what percentage of the class was comprised of inhabitants of urban centers and rural areas, persons who did not complete high school, as well as high school and college graduates, those who are impoverished fortuitously and those who are of modest means by choice or avocation, or persons with some financial acumen versus those without any. Because each of these characteristics, and a multitude of others, will weigh in on whether each class member is more or less susceptible to solicitations or advertisements, [the common pleas court] correctly recognized that “... it will be necessary to consider the evidence of the unique qualities of each class member since the fact finder must determine whether each placed his or her complete trust in the defendant’s expertise.”</blockquote>

      <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>On considering the background and the arguments, we agree with several primary lines of the Block companies’ contentions. First, determining the appropriateness of class treatment is an inherently fact-laden inquiry. <em>See generally Samuel-Bassett, </em><a href="/pa/613/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="613 Pa. 371" data-case-ids="4205963" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0371-01">613 Pa. at 396</a>, <a href="/pa/613/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="34 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4205963,7265404" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0371-01,/a3d/34/0001-01">34 A.3d at 15</a> (observing that class certification is treated as a mixed question of law and fact). As Block amply develops, where material facts are in dispute, class certification — and decertification — rulings are to be premised on properly determined facts, not assumed ones. <em>See </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 1710; <em>see also supra </em>note 6. Hence, the Superior Court plainly should not have relied on factual assertions which previously were taken as true only when considered for a very different purpose <em>(ie., </em>evaluating whether the claims were amenable to summary disposition).</p>
    <p id="b263-5" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[232,1101,1154,1056]]]'>Sanctioning such an intermixing of summary-judgment and class-certification review principles would have the deleterious consequence of postponing to the time of trial the determination of whether collectivized treatment is appropriate. <em>See, e.g., Basile, </em><a href="/a3d/11/0992-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="11 A.3d 992" data-case-ids="7288839" data-case-paths="/a3d/11/0992-01">11 A.3d at 999</a> <em>(“If the finder of fact [at trial] decides that [this evidence is] truthful and persuasive, </em>then it will not be necessary for the finder of fact to ‘consider the unique qualities of each class member’.... ” (quoting <em>Basile, <a href="/a2d/777/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="777 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="11077738" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0095-01">777 </a></em><a href="/a2d/777/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="777 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="11077738" data-case-paths="/a2d/777/0095-01">A.2d at 106</a>) (emphasis added)). Such delay is particularly untenable, given that class certification decisions serve as critical milestones in the tracking, management, and handling of mass claims. For this reason, deferring close consideration of class certification to the time when facts are determined by a jury at trial (namely, in connection with the verdict) is incompatible with the governing procedural rules. <em>See, e.g., </em>Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 1710 (reflecting that decisions concerning class treatment are to be based on judicial determinations of the facts pertinent to class treatment). Furthermore, the approach would conflate a management decision appropriate to trial judges with merits determinations relegated to juries.</p>

Even if the substance of those documents is taken as true, however, it is not appropriate to presume that Block’s marketing and customer relations strategies had the same impact on each and every putative class member. While Block may very well have desired to assert strong influence in the marketplace, and it may have possessed information reflecting vulnerability across a wide segment of its clientele, nothing in the record presented demonstrates an actual, class-wide, homogeneous effect on 600,000 of Block’s customers in the nature of “overmastering influence.” In other words, the Superior Court’s decision fails to account for the inherently discrete and subjective aspects of marketing and customer-relations impact.</p>
