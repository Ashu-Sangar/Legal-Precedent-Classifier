The CBA includes a provision that an employee can be terminated only for just cause. Thomas Mitchell, a warehouseman employed by PHA, was accused of sexually harassing a co-worker, Stephanie Broadnax, and was fired following an internal PHA investigation. Thereafter, appellant filed a grievance on Mitchell’s behalf. When the grievance procedures of the CBA were exhausted without a resolution satisfactory to appellant and Mitchell, appellant filed a demand for arbitration. Arbitration hearings were conducted on August 27, 2003 and February 17, 2004. The issue before the arbitrator was “whether [PHA] had just cause to terminate [Mitchell’s] employment, and, if not, what would be the appropriate remedy.” Arbitration Award, dated July 12, 2004, at 27. The arbitrator made extensive factual findings. <em>Id. </em>at 3-27.</p>

She described acts of inappropriate touching and sexual comments made by Mitchell, which caused her discomfort, particularly when she and Mitchell were alone. She described one particularly egregious incident where Mitchell grabbed Broadnax from behind while she was filing paperwork, “grinding” himself into her for approximately 15 seconds. <em>Id. </em>at 5, 9. Another incident involved Mitchell hiding under a desk to “take a nap” and then asking Broadnax if he could “eat her pussy” while she worked. Mitchell would hug Broadnax, throw his arms around her neck, and “play with himself’ while speaking to her; he made her “upset and nervous.” Broadnax testified that she also witnessed Mitchell pinch the breasts of the other female warehouse employee, Linda Bradford.</p>

Broadnax conceded that there were occasionally jokes of a sexual nature among the eight employees who worked in the warehouse, but she stated that very little of this behavior was engaged in by anyone other than Mitchell.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">2</a>

Brunetti broke up the argument, and took Mitchell outside to discuss and criticize his behavior.

Although he found that Mitchell’s misconduct was “unacceptable,” the arbitrator also found that after the “verbal warning” given to Mitchell by Brunetti, Mitchell engaged in no further inappropriate sexual harassment of Broadnax.

Appellant argues specifically that the award is not contrary to any well-defined, dominant public policy, and thus the very narrow public policy exception to the essence test does not apply here. Appellant states that the exception derives from the law of contracts prohibiting enforcement of agreements that violate the law or public policy, and application of the exception should be undertaken “cautiously and infrequently.” Appellant’s Brief at 21. Here, according to appellant, the arbitrator’s award did not violate any well-defined, dominant public policy that would preclude the use of a warning to curtail further sexual harassment, instead of termination of the offending employee. Relying on federal cases holding that counseling, admonishment or relocation may be sufficient disciplinary responses to harassment, appellant argues there is no public policy that requires “severe discipline” in response <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>to sexual harassment that has been otherwise effectively resolved; the public employer is not required to fire the harasser. <em>Id. </em>at 29-31.

According to PHA, termination of Mitchell was warranted under the circumstances, and the award reinstating him — together with back pay and no other sanction — was contrary to a dominant and well-defined public policy against sexual harassment in the workplace. PHA argues the public policy is clearly derived from federal law — Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the regulations of the EEOC — as well as federal cases interpreting them. PHA also cites to the PHRA, and this Court’s recent decision in <em>Weaver v. Harpster, </em><a href="/pa/601/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="601 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="4195396" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0488-01">601 Pa. 488</a>, <a href="/pa/601/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="975 A.2d 555" data-case-ids="4195396,7294696" data-case-paths="/pa/601/0488-01,/a2d/975/0555-01">975 A.2d 555</a>, 567 (2009) (in enacting PHRA, “the legislature articulated a public policy to eliminate all forms of invidious discrimination, including sex discrimination in the workplace”). PHA further argues that these laws also create a public policy which favors voluntary employer prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace, as well as the application of sanctions for harassment. The arbitrator clearly found that Mitchell had engaged in sexual harassment and, according to PHA, its responsive decision to terminate Mitchell advanced these strong public policies. PHA asserts that the arbitration award which removed all sanctions against Mitchell undermined PHA’s attempts to comply with its own rules designed to <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>eliminate sexual harassment. Further, according to PHA, the verbal “counseling” given to Mitchell prior to any investigation by PHA of the harassment claims could not possibly have constituted an adequate sanction for Mitchell’s conduct. PHA claims that the arbitrator effectively condoned Mitchell’s “unacceptable” behavior by ordering his reinstatement with back pay. PHA emphasizes that, despite appellant’s argument to the contrary, PHA does not take the position that “severe discipline” or termination is required in every instance of sexual harassment; however, PHA does argue that it should be allowed to fire a sexual harasser under the right circumstances, such as those shown in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">8</a>

The award in this case encourages individuals who are so inclined to feel free to misbehave in egregious ways, without fear of any meaningful consequence. The arbitrator’s opinion includes a detailed description of Mitchell’s behavior in the workplace and the arbitrator concedes it was “unacceptable.” But, the arbitrator ultimately divorced Mitchell’s conduct, and his failure to accept responsibility, from any consequence and held that PHA did not have just cause to fire Mitchell. In our view, the rational way to approach the question is to recognize the relationship between the award and the conduct; and to require some reasonable, calibrated, defensible relationship between the conduct violating dominant public policy and the arbitrator’s response.</p>

The arbitrator’s finding that the pre-investigation discussion between Brunetti and Mitchell resolved the matter before a higher level of management became involved is equally problematic. Appellant apparently views this chastisement as an appropriate response that was “reasonably calculated” to stop the harassment, Appellant’s Brief at 26, and that nothing more severe was either required or permitted. But, apart from acknowledging that “the only action taken in terms of counseling or discipline” prior to termination was Brunetti’s “verbal warning,” the arbitrator did not measure its value as discipline. The arbitrator was charged with determining whether termination was proper and, if not, whether some other form of discipline was. Were we to approve the arbitrator’s award finding no just cause for termination, and ordering reinstatement with back pay, we would essentially be holding that PHA has no recourse from the arbitrator’s conclusion that Mitchell’s cessation of overt acts of sexual harassment, which he denied in testimony found to be unbelievable, sufficed to end the matter.</p>

We reject this argument and conclude instead that a public employer must be permitted to do more than engage in adjectival condemnation when faced with this sort of employee misconduct. We therefore hold that the arbitrator’s award of reinstatement with back pay violates the public policy of this Commonwealth, and we thus affirm the Commonwealth Court’s decision to vacate the award.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">16</a>

But there are degrees of assault — a slap is not the same as a gunshot, though both qualify as assaults — and there are gradations of punishment that mirror the seriousness of the assault. Likewise, there are degrees of harassment, and there should be degrees of consequences as well.

      <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>The majority opinion, however, failing to articulate any scope or standard of review for when a PERA arbitration award purportedly violates public policy, appears to simply dive right into a <em>de novo </em>review of the record before the arbitrator, which review appears to include, I respectfully but regrettably posit, reweighing evidence and even finding facts, as the following examples demonstrate: “PHA also makes the salient point that Mitchell’s apparent cessation of overt sexual misconduct in the few months after the verbal warning — and during the investigation, while all eyes were upon him — should not have prevented the imposition of appropriate discipline for the misconduct that had already occurred.” Majority op. at 82 n. 11, 52 A.3d at 1124 n. 11. The arbitrator did not make any factual finding that Mitchell had stopped his harassment when “all eyes were upon him” during the investigation. Rather, the arbitrator found salient that Mitchell had stopped his harassment after being warned, period. “Mitchell also attempted to mislead the tribunal about [the charged acts], and failed to take responsibility for his conduct.” <em>Id. </em>at 82, 52 A.3d at 1125. The arbitrator did not make such factual findings, even though the arbitrator did not find Mitchell’s testimony credible. And, as the majority opinion references Mitchell’s “failure to take responsibility” several more times, one must question whether the majority, <em>sub silentio </em>and without legal foundation, is asserting such a concept as a new legal requirement to obtain relief in PERA arbitration. “Broadnax did present evidence of retaliation [by Mitchell] in the form of unexplained falling rag bundles, overturned paint cans and other items strewn about the warehouse, but the arbitrator dismissed the events as coincidences, finding they were ‘not attributable to proven actions’ by Mitchell.” <em>Id. </em>at 88-89 n. 16, 52 A.3d at 1128 n. 16. The unmistakable implication here is that the arbitrator should have found that Mitchell did, in fact, perform these acts. Finally, <em>see id. </em>at 86-87, 52 A.3d at 1127-28 (wherein the majority opinion discounts the arbitrator’s findings regarding the work environment, based on extensive testimony that there was a great deal of sexually charged joking and banter occurring. The majority opinion essentially concludes that this environment — and the arbitra<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>tor’s findings on this point — are irrelevant and refers to the evidence relied upon by the arbitrator as “reports.” Further, the majority disparages the arbitrator’s reliance on the apparently effective warnings of Mitchell’s supervisor, criticizing the arbitrator’s conclusion that the supervisor was part of the employer’s management.).</p>

Unless grounded in specific law, public policy does not shift depending on whether the employer is private or public. Here, the public policy that is implicated is the prevention and discouragement of sexual harassment.

It is a term found in the relevant collective bargaining agreement that the parties thereto have agreed would be, when an unresolved dispute arose, interpreted by an arbitrator, who would then finally resolve the dispute. When the arbitration award violates public policy, reviewing courts do not then step into the shoes of the arbitrator and decide the case or signal the preferred result.

When a challenge is made that an arbitration award, which otherwise meets the essence test, violates a clear and dominant public policy of this Commonwealth, the court’s review must proceed hand-in-glove with the overarching public policy of minimal interference with the arbitrator’s role. PERA, and the parties through their collective bargaining process, have determined that the arbitrator decides employment disputes, not the courts; and a reviewing court, in exercising rare oversight, must never lose sight of this imperative.

Secondly, where, as in this case, the discrepancy between the arbitrator’s factual findings and his or her ultimate award establish that the clear and dominant public policy is thwarted, then a reviewing court will not engage in further review, but will simply vacate the arbitrator’s award and remand to the arbitrator to fully consider the public policy consequences, pursuant to the court’s guidance.
