Ackerman determined the value of Lessee’s leasehold interests for each tax year in question by dividing the net income Lessee received from subleases to commercial tenants by an overall capitalization rate of 10%, which rate reflected Ackerman’s evaluation of factors such as the location and condition of the property, the financial risk and cost of financing to Lessee, the tax rate, and general market conditions influencing the price of rent and vacancy rates. <em>See </em>Valuation by Mark D.

Appellees further maintained that the Board of Viewers misinterpreted the holdings of both <em>Marple Springfield </em>decisions in that neither decision precluded the inclusion of the market value of such improvements in a determination of the fair market value of realty for tax assessment purposes even though they were owned by Lessee as leasehold interests. Appellees additionally asserted that the result of the Board of Viewers decision violated the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a> since it would allow identical improvements made to land to be taxed differently depending on whether they were owned outright by the landowner or leased by the landowner to a different entity.</p>

Because Appellant argued that there could only be a single tax assessment to it as the owner and lessor of the property, and that the improvements to the property could not be taxed to Lessee, Judge Wettick considered the only question for his resolution to be “whether the single assessment should include the value of the buildings and other improvements which the tenant has made to the property.” Common Pleas Court Opinion, at 5.

Judge Wettick viewed <em>Downingtown </em>as establishing the basic principle that, in order for constitutionally mandated uniformity of tax assessments to be achieved, comparable properties should be assessed at the same percentage of assessed value to market value, and, thus, <em>Downingtown </em>forbade the use of any assessment system which is not constructed to assess comparable properties in a similar fashion. Consequently, Judge Wettick reasoned that, since Appellant could point to no other assessment of a shopping center in Allegheny County which did not include both the value of the land and the values of buildings and other improvements, allowing an exception to this scheme of <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>taxation in situations where the improvements were made by a lessee and not the owner of the land would be violative of the Uniformity Clause and, also, of the prohibition against creating tax exemptions which are not otherwise permitted under the Pennsylvania Constitution.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_17" id="ref_footnote_1_17">17</a>

He pointed out that a construction that accounts for the value of the improvements made to the property by a lessee is possible because Section 201(a) of the General County Assessment Law permits the assessment of all “real estate,” which term includes buildings and parking lots. Since another provision of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. § 5020-402 (“Section 402”), further requires that real estate be assessed at its actual value, Judge Wettick viewed these statutory provisions as acting in concert to prohibit the use of an assessment method which does not consider the value of buildings and other improvements.</p>

Judge Wettick did not view <em>Assid </em>as requiring the capitalization of income approach mandated by <em>Marple Springfield I </em>to be used whenever a tenant in a long-term lease makes improvements to property, as (1) counsel for the taxing authority in that ease had <em>conceded </em>that the capitalization of income approach was proper, and (2) the taxing authority was precluded from filing a brief with the Commonwealth Court which, consequently, did not have the benefit of considering the arguments presented by Appellees in the instant matter.

The court first looked to Section 402(a) of the General County Assessment Law, which obligates assessors to value “all objects of taxation.” <em>Tech One, </em><a href="/a2d/974/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="974 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="7298574" data-case-paths="/a2d/974/1225-01">974 A.2d at 1230</a> (quoting 72 P.S. § 5020-402(a)).

The court rebuffed Appellant’s suggestion that <em>Marple Springfield I </em>allowed identical property to be treated differently for real estate tax purposes depending on whether it was leased or not, as it found the issue of whether such a classification would violate the Uniformity Clause was not present in that case. The court remarked that, in other decisions where our Court has considered the uniformity issue, we have held that “a tax must be applied upon similar kinds of property with substantial equality of the tax burden on all members of the class.” <em>Tech One, </em><a href="/a2d/974/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="974 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="7298574" data-case-paths="/a2d/974/1225-01">974 A.2d at </a>1231 (citing <em>Amidon v.

Thus, the court determined that, because the land and buildings are objects of taxation, there is an insufficient basis to tax them differently just because different parties own them.

Therefore, according to Judge McGinley, “[s]ince a property is only worth what an investor-buyer could earn from it, a property encumbered by a long-term lease with a fixed rent must be valued based on the income it will yield to a <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>purchaser.” <em>Tech One, </em><a href="/a2d/974/1225-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="974 A.2d 1225" data-case-ids="7298574" data-case-paths="/a2d/974/1225-01">974 A.2d at 1232</a>. Hence, in Judge McGinley’s view, the economic reality of the long-term lease in the present situation meant that a prospective buyer of the property would be limited by its terms to receiving as income from the property only the fixed rent provided for by the lease, so any valuation of the property must reflect this limitation. Judge McGinley opined that any buildings and other improvements — even if he considered them to be of the magnitude of the Taj Mahal or the Empire State Building— would not affect the amount of rent the owner of the land would receive under the lease; thus, he reasoned Judge Wettick should not have included their value in the assessment.</p>

Thus, we deemed Section 201(a) to authorize taxation of only those specific types of property named therein. As a result, we rejected the Commonwealth Court’s finding that the leasehold interests in oil and gas were “lands,” noting “the dissimilarity between the nature of oil and gas and those items which the General Assembly saw fit to enumerate as the proper subject of taxation.” <em>Independent Oil and Gas Ass’n, </em><a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="572 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="716451" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01">572 Pa. at 247</a>, <a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="814 A.2d 180" data-case-ids="716451,9336482" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01,/a2d/814/0180-01">814 A.2d at 184</a> (emphasis added).

In arriving at his specific valuation of these separate interests, Ackerman considered all three methods of valuation set forth in Section 402 — the cost, comparable sales, and income approaches — but he deemed the income approach to be the most “probative.” N.T. Assessment Hearing, 4/21/05, at 57. As he elaborated in his appraisal report, “[t]his approach is normally heavily weighted in the valuation process and in any investor’s decision to purchase an income producing property, since it is the investor’s anticipation of a return on his investment and the associated risk, which are the main concerns in purchasing property of this type.” Valuation by Mark D. Ackerman, 2/15/05, at 9. Consequently, as the market value of the leased fee and the leasehold interests, respectively, were, in this instance, principally determined by the income which the holder of each interest could expect to receive, Ackerman capitalized the contract rent paid to Appellant by Lessee, and capitalized the contract rent which Lessee collected from the tenants of the shopping plaza under its sublease arrangements with them. This is a standard methodology commonly used by real estate appraisers to value such interests. <em>See The Appraisal of Real Estate </em>81-83 (12th ed. 2001) (“The valuation of a leased fee interest is best accomplished using the income capitalization approach.... The market value of a leased fee interest depends on how contract rent compares to market rent.”; “Leasehold interests are typically valued using the income capitalization approach....

The Commonwealth Court reversed on the grounds that it considered the use of the capitalization of income method of valuation to be inappropriate when property is rented at a rate below fair market value. The Commonwealth Court also ruled that, in valuing the <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>property, Section 402 required the property be treated as if it was in an unencumbered form, essentially ignoring the existence of the long-term lease.

To interpret the tax assessment statute as requiring valuation of property in hypothetical “unencumbered form,” as Commonwealth Court did, is to ignore the economic realities of commercial real estate transactions.

Our holding in <em>Marple Springfield I </em>did not alter this fundamental precept. <em>Marple Springfield I </em>merely established two basic principles applicable to valuing real property which is subject to a long-term lease: First, the “economic reality” of the existence of the lease must be considered by an appraiser in establishing the market value of property encumbered by a lease, since it will be a factor which affects the price which a purchaser of the property is willing to pay. Second, when the property generates income, the capitalization of income approach is an appropriate method to use to ascertain its value, and, in applying that method, the contract rent received under the lease is the relevant income stream which is to be capitalized, even if it is below prevailing market rental rates.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_30" id="ref_footnote_1_30">30</a> Where, as here, ownership of taxable real estate which comprises one tax parcel is divided into leased fee and leasehold interests, Section 402(a) still requires that the market value of the real estate as a whole be determined as this statutory provision unambiguously requires the valuation of “all objects of taxation.” 72 Pa.S.A. § 5020-402(a) (emphasis added). Our holding in <em>Marple Springfield I </em>simply necessitates that, in conducting this valuation, the impact of the lease on the market value of the real estate owned as the leased fee and, also, on the market value of the real estate owned as a leasehold interest must be considered. Further, if the holder of the leased fee and the leasehold interest each receive rent pursuant to a contractual arrangement, it is appropriate, pursuant to <em>Marple Springfield I, </em>to employ the capitalization of income approach to value these interests utilizing the contract rent.</p>

Likewise, in valuing the shopping center buildings and other improvements owned by Lessee as leasehold interests, he considered the impact of Lessee’s lease with Appellant on the value Lessee could expect to receive if it attempted to assign these leasehold interests to others, and, in capitalizing the value of the income stream generated by Lessee’s leasehold interests, he used the contract rent which Lessee received under the subleases which it had entered into with tenants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_31" id="ref_footnote_1_31">31</a>

However, as we have explained, the value of the real estate owned as the leased fee, alone, was not determinative of the value of the entire tax parcel in this matter, which consisted of all of the real estate owned as the leased fee and leasehold interests. Thus, we discern no error of law in the lower courts’ use of the aggregate value of Appellant’s leased fee interest in the land and the value of Lessee’s leasehold interests in the shopping center buildings and other improvements, as determined by Appellee’s expert, for the market value of the subject tax parcel in each of the tax years 2001-2005.</p>

Likewise, we reject Appellant’s contention that, because the lease payments themselves are not included in Section 201(a) as a subject of taxation, while ground rents are included, this indicates an intent by the legislature to exempt leased real estate from taxation. It is not the lease payments which are the subjects of taxation under Section 201(a), but, rather, the leased real estate. Further, as we explained previously, <em>see supra </em>note 21, a ground rent is considered an interest in land, and, hence, is a particular form of real estate; thus, its inclusion with other types of real estate listed in Section 201(a) is unremarkable. A required lease payment, by contrast, is not a form of real estate but, rather, a contractual obligation; thus, we attach no significance to its omission from Section 201(a)'s enumeration of specific kinds of real estate subject to taxation.</p>

As we explained in <em>Clifton, supra, </em>Allegheny County’s indefinite utilization of 2002 as a base year violated the Uniformity Clause since it resulted in significant disparities in the ratio of assessed value to actual value between similar classes of properties throughout Allegheny County. Since we are concerned in the present appeal only with the proper methodology to be used in determining the market value of the buildings and improvements of the shopping center, and not with the correctness of the ultimate assessed value of this property, as determined by application of the base year method, our decision in <em>Clifton </em>does not affect the validity of Section 402 in this regard.</p>
