The RTKL presumes that all records in possession a local agency are public, <em>see </em>65 P.S. § 67.305, and are therefore accessible for inspection and duplication, <em>see </em>65 P.S. § 67.701. A public record is defined as “[a] record, including a financial record, of a Commonwealth or local agency that: (1) is not exempt under section 708; (2) is not exempt from being disclosed under any other Federal or State law or regulation or judicial order or decree; or (3) is not protected by a privilege.” 65 P.S. § 67.102. The exemption implicated here is Section 708(b)(20), which exempts, <em>inter alia, </em>a coroner’s autopsy records. Importantly, however, Section 708(b)(20) also contains a proviso that “[t]his exception <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>shall not limit the reporting of the name of the deceased individual and the cause and manner of death.” 65 P.S. § 67.708(b)(20).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The RTKL also contains a conflict provision: “[i]f the provisions of this act regarding access to records conflict with any other Federal or State law, the provisions of this act shall not apply.” 65 P.S. § 67.3101.1.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[285,662,1150,833]]]'>With this statutory background in mind, we turn to the facts of this case. On April 16, 2009, a nineteen-year old college student was found dead in his Shippensburg apartment, and, subsequently, the Coroner investigated his death. In due course, the Coroner determined the student’s cause and manner of death. Requester filed a Right-to-Know request (Request) with the Coroner pursuant to the RTKL, seeking solely the “[m]anner of death.” The Coroner, acting in accord with the RTKL as an Agency Open Records Officer, <em>see </em>65 P.S. § 67.502,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> denied the request. The Coroner indicated that cause and manner of death records would only become available to the public thirty days after the end of the year in accord with Section 1251 of the Coroner’s Act, 16 P.S. § 1251. The Coroner viewed the RTKL as providing no greater right of access than that already provided in Section 1251 of the Coroner’s Act.</p>
    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[286,1528,1146,92]],["BL_649.1",649,[236,336,1149,458]]]'>Pursuant to the RTKL, Requester appealed the Coroner’s determination to the OOR. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.1101. On May 27, <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>2009, the OOR issued a determination denying the appeal and affirming the Coroner’s determination, concluding that the cause and manner of death record only becomes a public record subject to disclosure under the RTKL when it has already been made public pursuant to Section 1251 of the Coroner’s Act. Thus, Requester would have to wait to view the manner of death record until the Coroner deposited his official records and papers with the prothonotary by January 30, 2010.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.4",649,[234,828,1154,889]]]'>Requester filed a motion for reconsideration, which the OOR granted before issuing a final determination affirming the Coroner’s rejection of the Request and concluding that the RTKL did not require immediate access to the manner of death. The OOR further took the opportunity to address a specific legal challenge advanced by Requester to its initial ruling. Specifically, Requester argued that under Section 305 of the RTKL all records in possession of a local agency are presumed to be public unless exempted by, <em>inter alia, </em>Section 708(b)(20). According to Requestor, although this section exempts a coroner’s autopsy records, it also contains an exception to the exemption for “the reporting of the name of the deceased individual and the cause and manner of death.” 65 P.S. § 67.708(b)(20). Based on this proviso, Requester argued that the report of the cause and manner of death is a public record subject to immediate disclosure under the RTKL.</p>

The OOR found a further conflict between immediate disclosure under the RTKL and Section 1236.1 of the Coroner’s Act. Although the OOR recognized that Section 1236.1(c) provided an avenue to access the coroner’s records at any time, it interpreted Section 1236.1(a) (authorizing the coroner to comply with “requests for examinations or other professional services” at the coroner’s discretion) as also vesting discretion in the coroner as to whether to comply with <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>requests for the early release of records, for a fee, under Section 1236.1(c). Because it viewed Section 1236.1(c) as providing the coroner with discretion, it found that it was in conflict with the mandatory, immediate release authorized under the RTKL.</p>
    <p id="b650-4" data-blocks='[["BL_650.4",650,[277,623,1149,474]]]'>To resolve this perceived conflict, the OOR examined the conflict provision in Section 3101.1 of the RTKL. 65 P.S. § 67.3101.1 (directing that where there is a conflict between the RTKL and another law, the other law shall prevail). It held that Sections 1251 and 1236.1 of the Coroner’s Act govern, and the RTKL merely provides a “vehicle” to obtain the Coroner’s official records and papers after the Coroner has already deposited them with the prothonotary for public inspection in accord with Section 1251.</p>
    <p id="b650-5" data-blocks='[["BL_650.5",650,[276,1128,1151,580]]]'>Requester appealed to the court of common pleas. After a hearing, the trial court affirmed the OOR. The court focused on the language of Section 708(b)(20) and held that the intent of this section was to exempt from the definition of public records all autopsy records except to the extent the coroner is already obligated under Section 1251 of the Coroner’s Act to make its records available following the end of the year. The trial court read Section 708(b)(20) as specifically accounting for the year-end reporting obligation of the Coroner’s Act rather than mandating immediate access to the cause and manner of death report.</p>

It held that although the RTKL generally mandates immediate access to public records, it does not apply where it conflicts with another law. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.3101.1. Turning to the Coroner’s Act, the Commonwealth Court, like the Coroner, read the year-end public reporting obligation in Section 1251 as conflicting with the right of immediate access arguably granted in the RTKL, such that the Coroner’s Act would prevail. The Commonwealth Court interpreted Section 1236.1(a) as vesting discretion in the coroner with regard to whether to release written reports before January 30 of the following <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>year.

We concluded that Section 1236.1(c) provided a “rapid means” of obtaining an autopsy report from the coroner for those who did not want to wait until the record became available to the public after the end of the year.

Third, Requester finds nothing in Section 1236.1 of the Coroner’s Act that gives the Coroner any discretion with respect to requests for the disclosure of records. Requester observes, correctly, that the only time the word discretion appears in Section 1236.1 is in subsection (a) in relation to deciding whether to comply with requests that the coroner undertake certain tasks, specifically, “examinations and other professional services.” 16 P.S. § 1236.1(a). Requester argues that this subsection merely addresses autopsies and other medical examinations and related tests, not the disclosure of records.

Fifth, Requester relies on this Court’s decision in <em>Penn Jersey </em>as support for his position that he is entitled to immediate disclosure of the manner of death records. Specifically, Requester relies on our statement that there is no conflict between the year-end <a id="p614" href="#p614" data-label="614" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*614</a>reporting obligation of Section 1251 and the rapid access provision of Section 1236.1(c). <em>Penn Jersey, </em><a href="/pa/599/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="962 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="3440818,8186950" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0534-01,/a2d/962/0632-01">962 A.2d at 637</a> (recognizing that “[b]y the terms of Section 1251, the records that a coroner must deposit with the prothonotary are not available until thirty days after the end of each year, at which time interested persons may “inspect” such records,” while “Section 1236.1 merely provides a rapid means of procuring an autopsy report for those who do not wish to wait until after the end of the year, and who are also willing to pay the charges associated with procuring it.”).

Requester observes that in enumerating exemptions from public disclosure in Section 708(b), the General Assembly could have exempted all official papers and records of coroners, but, instead, it carefully crafted a narrow exemption to disclosure solely for autopsy reports and certain related audio and photographic records. The exemption specifically does not encompass cause and manner of death records, which, according to Requester, therefore remain public records subject to disclosure. Requester lastly observes that the Commonwealth Court’s interpretation would create a <em>de facto </em>coroner’s exemption from the RTKL, permitting coroners to respond to requests for records in an arbitrary manner through the exercise of unfettered discretion, immunized from the appeal and judicial review procedures of the RTKL.</p>

It regards the conflict in the same manner as the Commonwealth Court did, premised on its view of that the only disclosure mandated by the Coroner’s Act is the year-end filing requirement of Section 1251. The disclosure contemplated in Section 1236.1 is, according to the Coro<a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>ner, discretionary, as the discretion referenced in subsection (a) extends not only to deciding whether to undertake certain examinations and services, but also to releasing the information within the written report that was generated by those services. In this regard, the Coroner argues that a request for a report under subsection (c) is “in essence a request for the professional services of the coroner in written form” subject to the coroner’s discretion.

Instead, the RTKL’s own conflict provision, 65 P.S. 67.3101.1, applies, and directs that any conflict between the RTKL and <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>any other law must be resolved in favor of the other law.

Although the Statutory Construction Act sets forth rules for a court to follow when provisions in or among statutes are in conflict and cannot be reconciled, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1933-1936, the RTKL itself has a conflict provision that provides that if the RTKL <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>conflicts with another law, “the provisions of [the RTKL] shall not apply.” 65 P.S. § 67.3101.1.</p>

The year-end reporting requirement of Section 1251 requires that the coroner’s official records and papers to be deposited with the prothonotary by January 30 of the following year. Because Requester chose not to wait until January 30, 2010, to review the cause and manner of death records at issue, Section 1236.1 is implicated. Subsection (a) of this section vests discretion in the coroner to decide whether to comply with requests for examinations or professional services made by other counties or persons, and subsection (b) permits the coroner to establish fees for such examinations and professional services. The release of reports is addressed in subsection (c), which permits the coroner to establish fees for, specifically, autopsy reports, toxicology reports, inquisition or coroner’s reports, and “other reports and documents requested by nongovernmental agencies,” which includes cause and manner of death records. 16 P.S. § 1236.1(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> There is no mention in Section 1236.1(c) of discretion. By its plain terms, therefore, and contrary to the Commonwealth Court’s holding and the dissenting opinion, Section 1236.1(c) allows the coroner to charge fees for records, but does not afford the coroner any discretion with regard to releasing such records. The discretion afforded to the coroner to entertain requests for “examinations or other professional services” by “other counties or persons” in Section 1236.1(a) plainly provides coroners with a choice about whether to allocate staff and resources beyond the coroner’s statutory duties in its own county. <em>See e.g., </em>16 P.S. § 1237 (mandating investigations of the facts and circumstances of “deaths which appear to have happened within the county ... ”).</p>

Consequently, the arguments of the Coroner, the OOR, and the dissent, that because the coroner has discretion in Section 1236.1(a) to decide whether to perform services requested by other counties or persons, the coroner must also have discretion regarding whether to release the records associated with those services, are not persuasive in the context of this case.</p>

Grim, </em><a href="/pa/599/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="599 Pa. 534" data-case-ids="3440818" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0534-01">599 Pa. 534</a>, <a href="/pa/599/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="962 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="3440818,8186950" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0534-01,/a2d/962/0632-01">962 A.2d 632</a>, 636 (2009). There is no argument in this case that the manner of death record at issue in this case is not subject to Section 1251 and 1236.1(c). Moreover, all parties agree that <em>Penn Jersey, </em>which involved autopsy reports, is equally applicable to the manner of death record requested in this case. As discussed below, however, the RTKL distinguishes between autopsy records and "cause and manner of death.” <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.708(b)(20).</p>

I would hold § 1236.1(c) of the Coroner’s Act gives the coroner discretion concerning whether to release a written report regarding cause and manner of death prior to the statutorily-mandated time period in § 1251, and therefore conflicts with § 708(b)(20) of the RTKL, which provides cause and manner of death reports are not exempt from the Act’s access requirements. Because of this conflict, the Coroner’s Act provisions control, and the requested record is exempt from disclosure under the RTKL. <em>See </em>65 P.S. § 67.3101.1 (stating if RTKL’s provisions regarding access to records conflict with any other federal or state law, RTKL’s provisions shall not apply).</p>

A majority of this Court concluded as much in <em>Penn Jersey Advance, Inc. v.

In <em>Penn Jersey, </em>the issue was whether a coroner’s autopsy report is an “official” record within the meaning of § 1251 and thus subject to that section’s mandatory annual disclosure requirement. <em><a href="/pa/599/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="962 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="3440818,8186950" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0534-01,/a2d/962/0632-01">Id., </a></em><a href="/pa/599/0534-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="962 A.2d 632" data-case-ids="3440818,8186950" data-case-paths="/pa/599/0534-01,/a2d/962/0632-01">at 637</a>. In holding such a report constitutes an official record under the statute, we rejected the notion there was a conflict between § 1251, which allows access to autopsy reports free of charge if they are deemed “official” records, and § 1236.1(c), which allows a coroner to charge for autopsy reports. We noted § 1251 bears a time requirement, and observed § 1236.1(c) does not contain such a requirement. Accordingly, we concluded, “Section 1236.1 merely provides a rapid means of <em>procuring </em>an autopsy report for those who do not wish to wait until after the end of the year, and who are also willing to pay the charges associated with procuring it.” <em>Penn Jersey, </em>at 637 (emphasis in original).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>

The fact that “discretion” was articulated in subsection (a) but not subsection (c) was not determinative; the Court read the section in its entirety and concluded it gives a coroner discretion to release information sooner <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>than the annual disclosure, coupled with the ability to charge a fee for such rapid disclosure.</p>

Requester contends the Commonwealth Court applied a new lenient standard of “inconsistency” instead of the “irreconcilability” required by the Statutory Construction Act. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933 (when general provision in statute “conflicts with a special provision in the same or another statute, the two shall be construed, if possible, so effect may be given to both; if conflict between two provisions is irreconcilable, the special provisions shall prevail”). Here, the Coroner’s Act only requires disclosure of cause and manner of death reports by a coroner once a year; earlier disclosure is discretionary with the coroner. The provision of the RTKL requiring immediate disclosure of such reports upon request is thus not reconcilable with the Coroner’s Act. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court did not create a new, more lenient standard; it properly concluded the two provisions were contradictory, and as such, the RTKL does not apply.</p>
