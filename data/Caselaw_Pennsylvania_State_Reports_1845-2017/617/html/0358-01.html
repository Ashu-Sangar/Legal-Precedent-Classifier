According to Appellant, such an arrangement evidences a conflict of interest and is relevant to counsel’s stewardship.

The PCRA court does not appear to have required Appellant to submit a statement of matters complained of on appeal; rather, it relied on Appellant’s appellate jurisdictional statement in discussing the issues. In the jurisdictional statement, Appellant advanced claims concerning police presence and the courtroom outburst, but he did not attach derivative claims of deficient stewardship on the part of his trial and appellate counsel. However, Appellant had presented such claims to the post-conviction court in his amended PCRA petition, as well as in his post-hearing memorandum. Thus, the court was on notice of the derivative aspects.</p>

Parenthetically, I disapprove of the trial court's "wait-and-see” approach to redress, including its deferral of review of Appellant’s "excellent” issue to the appellate courts. Our trial courts are charged, in the first instance, with the full and fair judicial resolution of controversies with which they are presented. Indeed, the deference our appellate courts afford to the trial courts reflects those courts’ closer proximity to the facts and circumstances at hand upon making their essential rulings. This record, unfortunately, suggests an abdication on the part of the trial court of its responsibility to make such a necessary, timely decision in an emotionally-charged, high-profile case.</p>
