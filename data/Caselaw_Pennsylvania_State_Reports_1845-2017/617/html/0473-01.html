Pennridge Tax Collectors Suzanne Clark, Jennifer Crocus, Susan Paff, Judith Patton, Kathleen Percetti, Patricia Siwert, and Sue Snyder affirmed that Telly’s testimony was an accurate representation of the job of tax collector. <em>See </em>N.T., July 27, 2009, at 178, 184, 192, 204, 218, 225, 232.

She acknowledged that, while there <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>are off-peaks throughout the year, she spends an average of 32-hours per week collecting real estate taxes, and at times hires an assistant to help handle the workload. In total, she estimated that the job requires approximately 1,800 hours per year. <em>See id. </em>at 45. When asked how she allocates her time among the various tax collecting duties, Telly testified that she devotes approximately one-third of her time to processing tax bills and depositing payments and two-thirds of her time to handling the accounting aspects of tax collection and providing customer service to taxpayers. <em>See id. </em>at 43. In regards to the accounting aspects of the job, Telly testified that accounting and reconciliation is done on a daily basis, and that she must submit monthly detailed reports to the township, school, and county. She also testified that at the end of the year there is reconciliation for final liens. <em>See id. </em>at 40. As to customer service, Telly explained that she receives approximately 2,000 calls a year regarding various inquiries, such as interim bills, installment plans, the homestead reduction, and tax certifications. <em>See id. </em>at 43.</p>

She further testified that the eight tax collectors for Pennridge collect $72 million of the district’s approximate $110 million budget, and, for this service, the School District compensates them with an aggregate amount of $44,571.75. <em>See id. </em>at 67, 76. As for her part, Telly testified that she had personally collected more than 5,500 tax bills in 2008, which amounted to $25 million in school taxes, and was paid $12,876.00. <em>See id. </em>at 32, 38, 75.

She noted, however, that she also maintains a website where her constituents can obtain information and file their taxes electronically. <em>See </em>N.T., Aug. 27, 2009, at 15-16. Pertaining to school district taxes, Labs stated that the seven <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>Central Bucks tax collectors collect nearly $200 million of the School District’s $279 million budget, and that their aggregate compensation under the current scheme is $149,898.00. <em>See id. </em>at 33.

For Penn-ridge, Robert W. Reinhart testified that, after consulting with several other school districts, Pennridge planned to implement a lockbox system. He explained that, under such a system, the county or school district would print real estate tax bills and the School District’s business office would then mail them to constituents. Taxpayers would make checks payable to the Pennridge School District or the individual tax collector and either send them to a post office box or deliver them in person to the bank operating the box. The bank would then scan the checks and deposit the payments directly into the school district’s account. Each day, a clerk in the business office would download the data provided by the bank, allowing for an automatic reconciliation against the original tax bills provided <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>by the county. <em>See </em>N.T., Sept. 18, 2009, at 105-06. Based on proposals submitted by financial institutions, Reinhart explained, Pennridge estimated that it would save $50,088.00 per year by implementing a lockbox system, notwithstanding an additional 120 hours of secretarial help needed for implementation of the new system. <em>See id. </em>at 75, 97.</p>

Matyas, testified that the school district considered collecting taxes through a commercial tax collection agency, such as Berkheimer Tax Administrator, Inc. (“Berkheimer”). Based on Berkheimer’s presentation to the Central Bucks Finance Committee and the school board, Matyas estimated that the school district would save $558,900.00 over a four-year period if it switched to using an outside taxing agency. <em>See </em>N.T., Aug. 28, 2009, at 221.

Consequently, he granted the Tax Collectors’ request for a permanent injunction and ordered the School Districts to reinstate the prior tax collector compensation rates. In his opinion, Judge Waite observed that, under the Local Tax Collection Law, <em>see </em>72 P.S. §§ 5511.1-5511.42 (the “LTCL”),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> elected tax collectors are required to collect all taxes levied by taxing authorities, with the exception of those imposed pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> including real estate taxes assessed by counties, local municipalities, and school districts. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 5511.2. Judge Waite noted that the LTCL does not set rates of compensation for tax collectors in counties, boroughs, or second class townships, but rather allows the local taxing authority to determine such rates, subject to a <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>maximum amount. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 5511.35(a)(1). Significantly, as to school district taxes, the court explained, the LTCL provides the board of school directors with the authority to set tax collector compensation rates, <em>see </em>72 P.S. § 5511.35(a)(3), and permits the taxing entities to adjust the pay of elected tax collectors by ordinance or resolution, prior to municipal elections, <em>see </em>72 P.S. § 5511.36a.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The court observed that the LTCL pits the fundamental interests of two sets of elected officials against one another: the Tax Collectors have the duty to effectively and efficiently collect taxes as well as perform all of the duties implicit in that task, whereas the School District has the responsibility to ensure that its funds are appropriated in an efficient manner, including the implementation of cost-effective technologies. Consequently, the court reasoned, such considerations must be balanced when determining how compensation rates should be calculated.</p>

Decidedly absent from that statute, however, is any direct guidance concerning the methods by which such rates should be calculated or evaluated. The Public School Code, which provides school directors with the authority to annually levy and collect taxes, <em>see </em>24 P.S. § 5-507, is similarly devoid of any instructions for calculating tax collector compensation or a means by which the appropriateness of compensation rates adopted by school boards may be assessed.

      <em>Yost </em>held that although the school board’s adoption of an alternative tax collection scheme was well-motivated, it was a misapplication of the law to essentially eliminate the elected tax collector position and instead place tax collection in the hands of the school district and a bank. <em>See Yost, </em><a href="/citations/?q=397%20A.2d%20453" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="397 A.2d 453">397 A.2d at 457</a> (“There is [no] indication that the Legislature intended that local taxing authorities should have the power to reduce compensation as a means of reforming ... the system of local tax collection____”).</p>

Notably, <em>Yost </em>examined the historical context of the LTCL, specifically observing that Section 36.1, which authorizes school boards to adopt changes to tax collectors’ compensation, was enacted during a post-war period where school populations and, consequently, school taxes, were rapidly increasing. <em>See Yost, </em><a href="/citations/?q=397%20A.2d%20453" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="397 A.2d 453">397 A.2d at 456</a>.

In <em>Hollidaysburg, </em>however, although the court appropriately noted the distinction between a tax collector’s dissatisfaction with the set compensation rate and compensation rates that do not allow a tax collector to perform her statutory duties, ultimately the court deemed the considerations found germane in <em>McKinley </em>and <em>Yost </em>irrelevant. <em>See Hollidaysburg, </em><a href="/a2d/660/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="660 A.2d 245" data-case-ids="7867987" data-case-paths="/a2d/660/0245-01">660 A.2d at 247</a>; <em>see also Baker v.

With regard to the Pennridge Resolution, the trial court found that the bank would not perform certain duties, such as providing tax certifications or filing liens for overdue payments. The trial court also found it significant that, under the alternative tax collection method, there would be no customer service provided to the constituents. <em>See Telly, </em>No. 2009-04824-31, <em>slip op. </em>at 6.

We acknowledge and agree with the Commonwealth Court’s determination that the provision of the Pennridge Resolution giving the elected tax collectors the option to disclaim their responsibility for collecting school taxes is void. <em>See Telly, </em><a href="/a2d/995/0898-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="995 A.2d 898" data-case-ids="7290816" data-case-paths="/a2d/995/0898-01">995 A.2d at 905</a>. As discussed in this opinion, however, we disagree with the court’s conclusion that the Pennridge Resolution as a whole is valid, as the compensation rates it imposes effectively deprive tax collectors of the option to collect taxes in accord with their statutory duties.</p>

In light of the arguments made, I write to posit the caveat that we cannot permit tax collectors to unilaterally expand their role from tax collector to customer service representative and expect those self-imposed duties to be the subject of mandatory compensation. School boards clearly have the authority to reduce the rate of compensation, but not to the extent of prohibiting tax collectors from performing their <em>statutory </em>duties. School Boards need not be made to compensate for <em>non-statutory </em>duties. Customer service is a very nice thing, but when tax dollars are tight, it is a luxury item, not a statutory duty, and what is fair and reasonable compensation must be based on the statutorily-<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>required responsibilities of tax collectors alone. If the Board wishes to pay for more, it certainly may, but if it does not, it cannot be made to pay for more than the duties set forth by the Legislature.</p>
