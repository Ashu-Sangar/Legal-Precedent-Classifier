The Court rejected the claim as stated, since the appellant had failed to object at trial or in post-trial motions. Notwithstanding the default, when the Court reviewed the sufficiency of the evidence, it looked to the new Crimes Code, and then effectively imported the intoxication affirmative defense reasoning from <em>Rose </em>into the self-defense realm, as a matter of statutory interpretation. The <em>Cropper </em>Court noted that Section 505 did not affirmatively state that a defendant who asserts self-defense has the burden of proving the defense. The Court found this silence significant because a number of other sections of the Crimes Code addressing defenses specifically required that the defenses, or certain elements of them, be proved by the defendant by a preponderance of evidence. The absence of such a stipulation in Section 505, the Court held, suggested that the General Assembly did not intend to impose on defendants the burden of proving self-defense. The Court did not note or discuss the common law approach or the legislative commentary stating that Section 505 intended to merely codify existing law pertaining to self-defense.</p>

There was also testimony that, as appellee attempted to ward off the blows, he inadvertently hit one of the women in the face due to her proximity. Several witnesses testified that appellee threw no punches, but instead was fumbling for something in his waistband or pocket while King punched him. Ultimately, appellee pulled a loaded gun from his waistband. Upon seeing the weapon, King backed away with his hands raised in the air. Nevertheless, appellee fired — not once, but twice — at King from approximately three to four feet away. The first bullet hit a bystander in the crowded bar, Darlene Redding, striking her in the right thigh; the second hit King in the left cheek. Appellee did not remain at the scene, but left the bar through the main exit. King died fifteen days later as a result of complications from the gunshot wound to his head. At the time of trial, Redding continued to suffer pain and debilitating effects from the wound to her thigh. Appellee remained a fugitive for ten months, until his arrest on July 27, 2007.</p>

Turning specifically to self-defense claims, the panel cited the <em>Beck /Amos </em>rule that the victim’s criminal record could be admissible either to corroborate the defendant’s knowledge of the victim’s violent character, to prove that the defendant was in reasonable fear of danger; or, as character/propensity evidence, to prove that the victim was in fact the aggressor. Noting that only the second of these grounds for admission was at issue, the panel reasoned that: the trial court’s decision to exclude King’s prior robbery conviction was premised upon its initial determination that there was insufficient evidence of self-defense to charge the jury on the theory; in the panel’s view, there was “at least some evidence that King attacked [appellee] and that [appellee’s] actions were arguably designed to defend himself;” therefore, “the trial court erred in excluding King’s [criminal] record on the basis of a lack of self-defense evidence;” and, finally, that the error in excluding evidence of the prior conviction was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 16-18. The panel’s extremely brief analysis focused solely upon its belief that the prior conviction was relevant to the question of who was the aggressor; the panel did not discuss the other elements of self-defense.

In the Commonwealth’s view, the evidence here was insufficient to support a claim of self-defense and the Superior Court’s decision to the contrary contradicts this Court’s precedent in three respects. First, the decision contradicts cases like <em>Commonwealth v. Bracey, </em><a href="/pa/568/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="568 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="163716" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0264-01">568 Pa. 264</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="795 A.2d 935" data-case-ids="163716,9427271" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0264-01,/a2d/795/0935-01">795 A.2d 935</a>, 947 (2001), which, in passing upon a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue self-defense, noted that self-defense is only available to one who was both protecting himself against the use of unlawful force and was also “free from fault in provoking or continuing the difficulty which resulted in the killing.” The Commonwealth stresses that appellee both provoked the fatal encounter and continued the difficulty that culminated in his shooting the victims. This is so because the uncontradicted evidence showed that appellee not only harassed the women in the bar, <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>but followed them and threatened to kill them. Given appellee’s role as overall instigator, the Commonwealth argues, he was “flatly ineligible” to claim self-defense.

The Commonwealth notes the uncontradicted fact that, once appellee drew his illegally possessed handgun, the unarmed King backed away with his hands in the air. Thus, the Commonwealth notes, appellee had successfully “protected” himself from the danger (of his own creation) he faced just by drawing his gun. However, rather than simply leave the bar, appellee shot twice, injuring a bystander and killing King. The Commonwealth argues that these circumstances — existing when appellee actually employed deadly force — prove he was not entitled to pursue self-defense, such that King’s criminal rec<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>ord could be deemed relevant.

Appellee also argues that this case is unlike the <em>Boone </em>case relied upon by the Commonwealth because he fired the fatal shot during the heat of the conflict, immediately after being repeatedly punched by the victim, and appellee reasonably believed at the time that the victim still posed a threat of serious harm to him. Appellee also distinguishes the Superior Court decisions cited by the Commonwealth. Thus, he claims that, unlike in <em>Yanoff, </em>he shot King immediately after King repeatedly punched him, and, unlike in <em>Bullock, </em>King was not running away when appellee shot him, he was just backing away with his hands raised.

With respect to the element of appellee’s reasonable belief, the Commonwealth replies that appellee’s assertion — that the fact that the victim was backing away did not necessarily establish that appellee’s alleged belief that he was still in danger was unreasonable — has no basis in law or fact.

In this case, the evidentiary ruling concerning Bang’s criminal conviction is intertwined with a predicate, purely legal issue, which is whether the question of self-defense was properly before the jury. To the extent that review of that predicate issue depends upon whether there was some evidence of self-defense presented at trial, our review is plenary. <em>See, e.g., id.; see also Black, </em><a href="/pa/474/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="474 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1732162" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0047-01">376 A.2d at 628</a>. The trial court initially excluded King’s conviction solely because it determined that there was no evidence to warrant a jury charge on self-defense. The court did not consider the remoteness of the conviction, the limited purpose for which such evidence may be introduced relative to self-defense, and <a id="p548" href="#p548" data-label="548" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*548</a>whether its probative value in proving the victim was the aggressor outweighed any prejudice to the Commonwealth under the circumstances (circumstances which included the fact that it was undisputed that King punched appellee before appellee drew his loaded weapon). And, if the court was correct in its initial view that there was insufficient evidence to raise a jury question of self-defense, the court obviously was correct to exclude King’s prior record irrespective of its probative value in establishing that King was the aggressor; King’s conviction was not admissible merely to smear his reputation in a case without adequate evidence to raise an issue of self-defense.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[285,987,1150,1003]]]'>The evidentiary issue became more complicated when the trial court determined that, even though it would not instruct the jury on self-defense, appellee’s counsel could still argue that the victim was the aggressor. There is no record explanation for this seemingly inconsistent ruling. After counsel forwarded the argument permitted by the court in his summation, the prosecutor argued to the jury that the court would not charge on self-defense — a point that would seem to have been accurate, given the existing ruling by the court — whereupon the court reexamined the evidence and governing law and ultimately instructed the jury on self-defense. At that point, the calculus concerning admissibility of the victim’s prior conviction was altered. Notably, however, the evidence had closed, and despite being faced with this new reality, appellee did not seek to reopen the case and renew his request concerning admission of the prior conviction. Thus, the trial court never engaged in the discretionary analysis of whether to admit a prior conviction that, the Commonwealth now argues, was remote in time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

But, it is not a straightforward matter to assess a discretionary ruling in the situation where no discretion was exercised.

The defense “justifies” what would otherwise be criminal conduct; if accepted by the fact finder, the result is an acquittal. In arguing self-defense, appellee would have his physical fight with King viewed in isolation, with King initiating the difficulty as the sole physical aggressor, and appellee acting in responsive self-defense. But, this is an incomplete and inaccurate view of the circumstances for self-defense purposes. The altercation between appellee and King did not occur spontaneously, or in isolation; it was the culmination of an ongoing confrontation in the bar initiated by appellee alone and continued and escalated by appellee alone. As a matter of law, we conclude that appellee was not free from fault in provoking or continuing “the difficulty” that led to the slaying, so as to warrant his use of deadly force, such that he cannot be held responsible for shooting two people, one fatally.</p>

But, the uncontradicted evidence here shows that appellee’s words and actions were substantially more provocative than a mere verbal insult. Appellee did not simply utter rude or crass comments to the women; he closely followed the women down a flight of stairs, verbally haranguing them the entire time. Moreover, he threatened to kill them, in no uncertain terms. Not all words are the same; and words combined with conduct can be extremely provocative. Threats to kill, moreover, invite response or even interference, including from those with <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>a sense of chivalry, and even from those of a mind to go further and punish the provocateur. Appellee may well have been emboldened by alcohol consumption, as he now says. But, it is no less likely that his actions represented a bravado borne of the fact that he knew — where others in the bar, including King, did not — that, in harassing and threatening the women, he was armed not only with his wits and his fists, but with a loaded handgun concealed in his waistband. In any event, the actual motivation for appellee’s conduct as he perceived it is pure speculation, for he elected not to testify, and he argues his motivation and beliefs from the external circumstances. Those circumstances establish that appellee was not free from fault, but provoked what became a fatal encounter, irrespective of what he now alleges he may or must have believed respecting the need to defend himself.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

The requirement of a reasonable belief encompasses two aspects, one subjective and one objective. First, the defendant “must have acted out of an honest, bona fide belief that he was in imminent danger,” which involves consideration of the defendant’s subjective state of mind. Second, the defendant’s belief that he needed to defend himself with deadly force, if it existed, must be reasonable in light of the facts as they appeared to the defendant, a consideration that involves an objective analysis. <em>Commonwealth v.

Even assuming that this approach is adequate as a theoretical matter to raise an issue of self-defense, the objective circumstances revealed by the actual evidence fatally undermine appellee’s position. The evidence was undisputed that appellee carried a concealed, loaded handgun throughout the incident, and at the moment appellee employed deadly force by drawing that weapon and firing twice at King, King was backing away with his hands raised. Absent testimony or some other specific account of what appellee actually believed, the evidence was not sufficient to raise a jury question whether appellee subjectively believed that he had to use deadly force when he twice pulled the trigger.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Again, the evidence showed that when appellee shot Redding and King, King was backing away with his hands raised: the universal symbol of surrender. The case is similar to <em>Boone, supra, </em>where we found that the trial court properly denied a defense motion for a self-defense directed verdict in a situation where, <em>inter alia, </em>the victim was backing away when the defendant stabbed her. <em>See also Black, </em><a href="/pa/474/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="474 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="1732162" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0047-01">376 A.2d at 630-31</a> (where there are reasonable alternatives available, such as ordering victim to halt and/or warning him that defendant possessed weapon, evidence does not support finding that defendant entertained reasonable belief it was necessary to use deadly force to protect himself).

    <p id="b592-5" data-blocks='[["BL_592.5",592,[283,1275,1152,615]]]'>The Superior Court panel did not discuss these elements of self-defense, focusing instead only on the possible relevance of the victim’s prior criminal conviction to prove that King, and not appellee, was the aggressor. This focus was both inappropriately narrow and problematic in its own right. It was problematic in its own right because, in examining the question of aggressor, the panel focused on a moment frozen in time, essentially ignoring appellee’s conduct prior to King’s intervention. As the cases reflect, these situations routinely involve developing factual patterns that must be considered in their totality. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The specific dispute between appellee and King comprised only a small, concluding part of the entire incident and the jury heard undisputed evidence from eyewitnesses that the victim punched appellee first and multiple times. The fact that King had a prior conviction did not negate appellee’s actions in instigating and continuing the difficulty before King entered the picture; nor was it probative of appellee’s alleged belief that he had to employ deadly force to defend himself, or whether appellee instead violated a duty to retreat, when he shot King. Exclusion of evidence in support of a point that was not a subject of dispute is not a proper basis for overturning a murder conviction.

In its later Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the court stated, however, that it issued the instruction on self-defense "solely” to eliminate any potential bias which could have arisen from the prosecutor's closing argument, which the court deemed inappropriate. (The question of whether the remarks were appropriate given the court’s prior ruling is not before this Court.) Noting these inconsistent accounts from the trial judge concerning the reason for charging on self-defense, the Superior Court concluded that the court issued the instruction both as a cure and because the factual record rendered the instruction appropriate.</p>

We recognize that many of the cases discussed by the parties are inapposite in that the question here is whether self-defense was even an issue for the jury, whereas the published decisional law tends to involve sufficiency <em>challenges </em>— i.e., claims that the Commonwealth failed to disprove self-defense — which is not the same thing; indeed, many of the sufficiency cases turn upon deference to the fact finder in accepting the Commonwealth's affirmative evidence. Nevertheless, the circumstances presented here fit comfortably within the cases where claims of self-defense were rejected. For example, in <em>Brown, supra, </em>the Superior Court held that the defendant's use of deadly force was not justified because, <em>inter alia, </em>he had provoked the entire encounter by engaging in a verbal altercation with the victim and reaching for a knife in his pocket that he had earlier displayed in a threatening manner. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa/484/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="88" data-cite="484 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="1753726" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0071-01">484 Pa. 71</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="398 A.2d 948" data-case-ids="1753703,1753726" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0070-01,/pa/484/0071-01">398 A.2d 948</a> (1979), this Court determined that the evidence sufficiently disproved self-defense where Smith had initiated the fatal encounter by arriving, uninvited, to his estranged wife’s home, kicking in the door, and shooting the victim. <em>Samuel, <a href="/pa/527/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="527 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1827733" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0298-01">supra,</a> </em>where a claim of self-defense was found viable, also supports our determination that the facts here do not raise a jury issue of self-defense. Significantly, it was the alleged victim in <em>Samuel </em>who first brandished a deadly weapon in an offensive manner. Moreover, the victim in <em>Samuel </em>set the incident in motion by entering the home uninvited, refusing to leave when asked, and then retrieving a shotgun and aiming it at the defendant. In any event, the facts here present other difficulties with self-defense, as discussed below.</p>

Appellee’s failure to offer any evidence to support the subjective aspect of his claim of self-defense highlights the difficulties associated with assigning the Commonwealth the burden to disprove a defense where necessary facts are peculiarly within the knowledge and control of the defense. In any event, the fact that the burden has been assigned to the Commonwealth — erroneously, as addressed in Part I <em>supra </em>— not only to affirmatively prove the elements of the offenses charged, but also to disprove self-defense where it is at issue, does not remove the necessity that there be some actual evidence to support the elements of the defense when proffered.</p>

      <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>Further, I have serious misgivings regarding the degree to which the majority not only encourages future parties to question our Court’s prior precedent interpreting the Crimes Code concerning the proper burden of proof in a claim of self-defense, but also provides significant fodder for such a challenge. Specifically, the majority begins by casting the burden of proof having been placed on the Commonwealth as a “relatively recent ... adjustment” of the law — although it has been the law of the Commonwealth for almost 40 years — and continues for the next four pages to assail this Court’s precedent during those four decades, ostensibly in order to give “context” to the issue before us. Majority Opinion at 532-35, 53 A.3d at 741-43. Although the majority contends that the federal Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, does not constitute an impediment to a change in the burden, that Court is not the final word on the proper burden of proof in this Commonwealth, which is principally a matter of statutory interpretation for which we are the final authority. <em>Id. </em>at 532-35, 53 A.3d at 741-43.</p>

As indicated above, Part I of the Majority Opinion purportedly provides background, and my reading of it reveals nothing more than a stern criticism of the current state of the law. Moreover, this discussion is in conflict with the majority’s proper acknowledgment that appeal was not allowed in this case to reconsider or adjust the burden of proof, <em>id. </em>at 533-35, 53 A.3d at 742-43, and I add that neither party has questioned or even suggested any dissatisfaction with our current standard in their briefs. Thus, to be clear, the burden <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>remains upon the Commonwealth to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p id="b596-5" data-blocks='[["BL_596.4",596,[285,441,1150,462]]]'>I also distance myself from the majority’s strong suggestion that a defendant needs to provide affirmative evidence to support the subjective aspect of his claim of self-defense — i.e., testimony from the defendant himself or herself — and that a defendant should not be able to rely upon inferences from the circumstances surrounding the events. <em>See id. </em>at 548-52, 53 A.3d at 751-53.
