Checks of the corporation had been deposited in the former to the amount of $5,700, and credit given, but they were returned protested. With other claims, the total indebtedness had reached $7,000, and this was unsecured. A demand was made for immediate adjustment, and the result was the execution of a note for the sum due, signed by the president and treasurer of the Fertilizer Company, payable to the order of defendants, and endorsed by them, with a waiver of protest and guaranty of payment at maturity. It was discounted, and the entire proceeds, less the amount required to satisfy the claim of the plaintiff, was duly credited to the company. A small part of the principal was subsequently paid.</p>
    <p id="b211-4" data-blocks='[["BL_211.7",211,[163,1339,1152,751]]]'>This suit was brought to recover from the endorsers. They defended on the ground that a promise had been made by the plaintiff’s cashier, at the time of signing, that there would be no personal liability, as the paper was taken solely for the purpose of balancing the books, so that complaint from the bank examiner could be avoided. When the trial was had, the note was offered in evidence, and the defendants were then permitted, against objection, to offer proof of their understanding of the transaction. The jury was told, if the agreement testified to had been proven, to find in their favor. A verdict was, however, rendered for plaintiff and judgment entered thereon, and from this action of the learned court below the present appeal arises.</p>

At the time the note was given it was in financial distress, but had prospects of a sale of its plant, which would furnish relief to those involved. They desired to prevent the institution of any adverse proceedings, and the threatened application <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>for a receiver, — later appointed, — endangered the possibility of a return on their investment. The obligation was discounted by the bank, and the unpaid checks, for which credit had been given, were lifted. “Every negotiable instrument is deemed, prima facie, to have been issued for a valuable consideration, and every person whose signature appears thereon to have become a party thereto for value”: Act May 16, 1901, P. L. 194, article II, section 24. It is not necessary, however, in this case, to rest on any legal presumption, for the testimony clearly indicated the substantial benefit accruing. “An antecedent or preexisting debt constitutes value” (section 25), and as the defendants gave their note to satisfy the claim of the corporation, to prevent suit, they cannot successfully defend on the ground that the proceeds were not personally received. They were accommodation endorsers, and liable, though this fact may have been known by the subsequent holder for value: Act 1901, supra, article II, section 29. Nor is there force in the assertion, if true, that the name of the maker was added after they had signed: Act 1901, supra, article V, section 63, 66,</p>
