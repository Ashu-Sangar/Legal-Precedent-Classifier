His left arm and right leg were broken, and right wrist injured. The compensation agreement did not specify under which class he was to be paid, and defendant ceased paying 175 weeks after the accident. On claimant’s petition to amend the agreement so that its terms might provide for definite losses, the board and court below affirmed the referee in awarding compensation under section 306, paragraph (c), for 215 weeks for the permanent loss of the left arm, 215 weeks for the permanent loss of the leg, and, in addition, under paragraph (b), for the partial loss of earning power due to the fractured wrist of the other arm. This award, except the latter part, cannot be very well disputed on the facts.</p>

The act specifically permits compensation for the combined number of weeks (section 306, paragraph c): “For the loss of any two or more of such members.......fifty per centum of wages during the aggregate of the period specified for each.” This part of the award is in direct accord with Sharcheck v. Beaver Run Coal Co., <a href="/pa/275/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="275 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1075646" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0225-01">275 Pa. 225</a>, 227: “When the injury happened it could be well regarded as one of...... total disability......with a possibility either of improving and entirely healing, or, as it did, of lapsing into a different condition, i. e. permanent, causing the loss of the use of a foot,......and while compensation was being made under section 306 (a). Claimant [when the extent of loss was determined] was then entitled to an award for the loss of the use of a foot......[page 228]. So, if the injury or wound becomes permanent, causing the loss of the use of a member named in 306 (c),...... for all disability to such member, resulting from such permanent injury, compensation shall be ‘exclusively’ as provided in 306 (c)......,” and this just covered the 150 week period for which compensation was to be, and has been, paid.</p>

It' embraces not only all incapacity to labor, directly or indirectly arising from such permanent injury, whether total-or partial, but, likewise, cases of no incapacity at all. The compensation includes payments while the claimant is undergoing treatment. Payment for the loss of such members, or treatment’ charges, cannot be made under section 306, paragraphs (a) and (b), either for partial or total disability. But section 306 (c) does not include defections to other parts of the physical structure, distinct from the permanently injured member, though directly caused thereby. Compensation may be made for an injury to, de<a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>struction or affection of, other organs or parts of the body, produced by the permanent injury, causing a disability separate, apart and distinct from that mentioned in paragraph (c).

Where injuries are under process of recovery, the resulting disability for compensation purposes may be partial, total or be compensable under 306 (c); where a temporary injury lapses into a permanent one, causing total loss of the member, the final award comprehends all compensation as a direct result of the injury, including the time under treatment: Lente v.

This he computed at 175 weeks for total disability under 306 (a) — he was not under treatment all this time — and 125 weeks for partial disability under 306 (b). The act makes no provision for such a determination under the facts as found in the court below. At the hearing claimant had complete use of the right arm to the wrist, and from it to the tips of the fingers, — there was a slight stiffness at the wrist. But, in fixing compensation for this, the results of his two major injuries — and the compensation claimant was receiving therefor — were entirely ignored, though the use of the arm and leg was absolutely gone; the referee treated the case as if, while undergoing treatment, and up to the time payment ceased, the loss was due entirely to the fractured wrist. To so hold places a value on it higher than the law sanctions for the amputation of the arm below the elbow.</p>

It must, under the express language of section 306, stand on its own foundation; claimant is not entitled to be paid for this partial loss under 306 (b), as that inability (to use his wrist) may be aided, influenced and affected by loss of the leg and left arm. A just determination for the loss of earning power due to the fractured wrist cannot be made without taking into consideration these elements of total disability paid for under 306 (c) during the period covered by such payments. Claimant may in the future be entitled to some compensation for this partial disability, but, when ascertained, it must be separate and distinct from the disability now being paid for in the permanent loss of the leg and arm. In fixing the number of weeks and per cent, the depleted earning power from the injury to the wrist must not include that which comes from other permanent losses.
