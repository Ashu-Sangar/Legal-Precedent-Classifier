Each party claims through Mary E. Brown, now deceased, and the only point to be decided is the true interpretation of the following paragraph of her will, when viewed in the light of such of the facts, averred in the affidavit of defense, as may properly be considered in ascertaining her intention: “Fourth. I give, devise and bequeath unto my friend Mary T. Warrington [defendant] now of 3518 Spring Garden Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, my real estate and property known as Nos. 1208, 10 and 12 S. Carlisle Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.”</p>

Carlisle Street, but at neither date, nor at any other time, was she the owner of 1208 S. Carlisle Street’, or of any other property in the City of Philadelphia. Her instruction to her counsel, who drew the will, was that her three properties on Carlisle Street, were to be given to defendant; through some mistake in his office, the figures 1208 were substituted for 1204; her at<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>tention was not called to this error, and she did not notice it, when, in his absence, she executed the will, which thereafter was always in his possession and never seen by her.</p>

But the facts regarding the ownership of the properties, are clearly to be considered, and are of controlling effect on the question of entering or affirming this summary judgment. It is always helpful and sometimes essential, when a will is to be construed, to “put ourselves in the testator’s place” (Shaffer’s Est., <a href="/pa/262/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="262 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1044360" data-case-paths="/pa/262/0015-01">262 Pa. 15</a>), and from that standpoint “consider the will and interpret its meaning......in the light of all the circumstances by which [he] was surrounded when he made it, and by which he was probably influenced”; and, having thereby reached a conclusion as to his intent, the court will not permit this “to be set aside because it is not clearly expressed by his scrivener”: Postlewaite’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>; Webb v.

Carlisle Street, which, on the record as now made up, was intended to be given to her? If only the numbers of the properties are to be considered, of course her contention cannot prevail, but this is not the situation here. The gift is of <em>“my </em>real estate and property known as 1208,......S. Carlisle Street.” Which then is to give way, the “my” or the “1208” ? The answer to this question is found in the maxim falsa demonstratio non nocet.</p>

The second of these rules is as follows: “Where the description contained in the will of the thing intended to be devised, ......is true in part, but not true in every particular, ......parol evidence is admissible to show what' estate was intended to pass,......provided there is a sufficient indication of intention appearing on the face of the will to justify the application of the evidence.”</p>

Carlisle Street,” but is “not true in every particular,” because of the use of the number “1208,” and therefore, “parol evidence [regarding the ownership of the Carlisle Street properties] is admissible to show what estate was intended to pass......[since] there is a sufficient indication of intention appearing on the face of the will [in the use of the “my,” etc.] to justify the application of the evidence.”</p>
