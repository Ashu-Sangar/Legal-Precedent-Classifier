If it is meant to suggest that this fact must appear in order to give priority of claim over the mortgage, it is sufficient to say the date may be proved by parol, where, on distribution, the dispute arises solely between claims which have been discharged by the sale: Reading v. Hopson, <a href="/pa/90/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="90 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="1065591" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0494-01">90 Pa. 494</a>.</p>
    <p id="b203-4" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[143,945,1148,317]]]'>(5) The objection to the liens that “the ground described embraces more than the curtilage of the liened buildings,” cannot prevail since, quoad the liens, section 23 of the Act of 1901, supra, furnishes the only method provided for objecting to the curtilage included, and of having it properly specified.</p>
    <p id="b203-5" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[142,1273,1149,975]]]'>(6) It is a matter of indifference that the mechanics’ “claims as filed name as real owners the parties who were merely trustees of the church, and who held apparently nothing but the legal title to the real estate,” whereas, by the sale on the bond accompanying the mortgage, the proceeds realized represented “the beneficial as well as the legal title, [and there was] no evidence of what portion of the fund, received from the sheriff’s sale, arose from the naked legal title itself.” It is sufficient to say in regard to this contention, — if it is necessary to say anything on the point, — that the unincorporated church congregation, which was the equitable owner of the property, knew the church and parsonage were being built, and, at a congregational meeting, held upon the property itself, expressly authorized the trustees to proceed with the work, thereby ratifying their action, and subjecting both the equitable and legal titles to these liens: Section 4, Act of 1901, supra.</p>

    <p id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[276,507,1147,1229]]]'>(8) The contention that the liens were bad, because of section 2 of the Act of 1901, supra, which provides that “no lien shall be allowed......against any property held by the committee of a lunatic, the guardian of a minor, or a trustee under deed, will or appointment by the court, unless by virtue of a contract made under authority of the court, or of the power contained in the deed or will,” is of no avail, because the section quoted has no relation to dry trusts (see Cannevin v. Gallagher, <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pitts%20L.J.%20559" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="62 Pitts L.J. 559">62 Pitts. L. J. 559</a>, 560); in these cases, the equitable owners, if sui juris, may consent to that which is done, and no one else has a right to control their action in this regard. The section is intended to prevent the interests of third parties, ultimately entitled to a property, from being subjected, by the person in possession, to lien and sale, except upon authority set forth in the deed or will, or by consent of the court.
