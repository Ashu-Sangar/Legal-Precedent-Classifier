The defense was as follows: Siena and Castellana had known each other in a friendly way for at least six years, Edith Bizzo, a sister of the latter, having lived at one time with the former; during a walk these two men were taking together on. the day of the homicide, Siena insisted Edith should return to him, and Castellana, while not opposing his companion’s desire, expressed the opinion it would not be complied with; after more of such talk, Siena drew a revolver, pressed it against Castellana and said, unless the sister resumed her former life with him, he would kill defendant and the “whole Castellana family” (a threat which he wished the jury to believe deceased had repeated to third parties on other occasions, though uncommunicated to Castellana) ; defendant, in fright, ran away, and, having first' picked np a club, entered a barn, to which he was pursued by Siena, with the pistol in his hand; a struggle followed, wherein Castellana, after striking Siena with the club, wrested the revolver from him, and then, according to defendant’s testimony (which the verdict shows was not accepted by the jury), he shot and killed deceased in order to defend himself from what he says was a murderous assault,</p>

However, as there is some confusion in our cases on the point in hand, we take this opportunity to discuss them.</p>

Of course, in connection with instructions on the law as to the elements which constitute the degrees of murder, the court must inform the jurors that, if they find the accused guilty of murder, it is within their power to ascertain and fix the degree. There is no complaint that this was not done in the present case; nor, in fact, is any other criticism made of the charge.</p>
    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[307,1104,1165,576]]]'>Defendant testified, in support' of his plea of self-defense, that deceased had made a wicked and unprovoked attack on him, with a deadly weapon, as set forth more fully at the beginning of this opinion. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth was permitted, over the objection of defendant, to introduce evidence of the reputation of deceased as a peaceable and law-abiding citizen, the trial judge stating, when he made his rulings in this regard,. that he allowed the testimony because of the nature of the defense; these rulings are criticised in several specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[306,1700,1149,478]]]'>It is highly improbable the rulings in question affected the verdict, for the kind of evidence objected to was given by only two witnesses, one of whom admitted he really knew nothing of deceased’s reputation, while, so far as the record indicates, little was made of the testimony of the other; nevertheless, we shall give full consideration to the guiding principles which govern the matters of complaint and which should control the question of the admissibility of the evidence here attacked.</p>

This kind of proof is allowed to the defendant in a criminal court because, as said in Hanney v. Com., supra, one accused of crime may be able to produce no evidence except his own oath and proof of good character to exculpate himself from the charge against him. On the same theory, when a prisoner sets up a defense, like the one at bar, wherein he charges the deceased with an act of personal violence against him, and thereby becomes the accuser and makes deceased the accused, why should not the Commonwealth, the only one that can answer for the accused deceased, in reply to this charge, have the same privilege as the defendant, when a similar charge is made against him, and be allowed to put in evidence the good reputation of the deceased- (who in this instance is the accused) as a peaceable citizen?</p>

The general rule seems to be that the state cannot, in the first instance, offer evidence of deceased’s reputation as a peaceable citizen; for, until attacked by the defense, his reputation is presumed to be good (Wharton on Homicide, 3d ed., section 269; Michie on Homicide, section 188 (7); 13 R.

People, <a href="/ill/229/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="229 Ill. 81" data-case-ids="5630040" data-case-paths="/ill/229/0081-01">229 Ill. 81</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20N.E.%20198" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="82 N.E. 198">82 N.

A like argument might as well be made against permitting evidence of the good reputation of defendant; but it loses force in either case when we remember that such testimony is properly confined to the mere fact of general reputation, the courts refusing to permit proofs of particular acts.</p>

Surely, on this state of the proofs) the fact that Siena was a peaceable, law-abiding citizen was a relevant circumstance tending to prove the improbability of his having done the unlawful acts of violence alleged against him by defendant, and therefore it was proper to admit the evidence assigned as error. At least, this rule ought to prevail in a case like the one at bar where, because defendant and deceased were the only persons present, no actual witness to the occurrence under investigation could be called by the Commonwealth, which was obliged to depend for its entire proofs on the (somewhat self-serving) confessions of the prisoner, certain points made against him on cross-examination, and the physical facts in the case.</p>
