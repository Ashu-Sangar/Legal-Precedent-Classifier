Notice was given in the morning to the foreman that, owing to a high wind, the fire would be carried to the buildings. No attention was paid to this notice; nor was any effort made to extinguish or control the fire, but more fuel was added. A little later burning paper was blown from defendant’s dump to appellant’s property. At noon this paper ignited the grass and fences, close to the buildings subsequently burned. This was put out by defendant’s foreman, plaintiff and others; a few minutes afterwards the barn was discovered in flames.</p>

The rubbish thereon is not described, nor was it shown that there were any papers or other materials in it to be carried by the wind. Foreman Shetler testified to a fire in the stove in plaintiff’s wash-house. Nothing was shown to be unusual about the stove, nor that the fire in it could in any way contribute to the conflagration; it did not start in that room. The witness states the barn was set on fire by burning paper, and, outside of the fact that there was a fire in the stove and on Curren’s dump, there was not even a suspicion the buildings might have caught from these sources. Plaintiff, testifying as to the fire, states: “Q. Now, after you got that information [as to the start of the fire], what did you do and what did you say? A. I ran out and I jumped through the back window of my washhouse and helped them put it out. Q. What did you see? A. Saw the fire burning. Q. Where? A. The paper, right back to the westward. [Defendant’s dump was in that direction.] Q. What was burning? A. The paper, and the fence would have burned..... .Q. You saw the paper burning and the fence burning? A. Yes. <em>Q. </em>And you put the fire out at the fence? A. We thought we had. Q. How close had this paper blown up' to your barn? <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>A. Half of the field, within seven or eight feet of the bam......A. I saw the fire start in the bam. Q.— Now, how long was that after yon had stamped ont the fire at the fence? A. I guess ten minutes was the limit. ......Q. Now, Mr. Propert, when you say the wind was blowing all day there, will you please tell us what' you saw blowing? A. Well, the fire was burning and the paper was blowing and that is what made me tell them about burning me down. Q. Which way was the paper blowing? A. Coming right dead west, probably a little bit to the north, northwest, right up the dump. Q. Where did the paper come from? A. Off the dump. Q. Which dump? A. Flanagan and Dorney’s dump. Q. When you went out there to put the fire out, did you see any paper blowing then? A. There was plenty of it blowing when we put it out. Q. Where did it come from? A. Came from the dump. Q. Whose dump? A. Flanagan and Dorney’s. Q. Was there any of that paper that blew up there burning? A. We put several pieces out and Mr. Shetler knows it.” This evidence is corroborated in part by others.</p>

This evidence might be regarded as being very close to direct evidence that the origin of the destruction of plaintiff’s barn was defendant’s dump. If other independent causes existed and have not been eliminated, it must be conceded, under this positive testimony, the facts established negligent conduct in tbls defendant, and if there was concurrent negligence from other causes contributing or likely to contribute to the loss, that would not relieve defendant from the wrong his negligent act is shown to have inflicted: Klauder v.
