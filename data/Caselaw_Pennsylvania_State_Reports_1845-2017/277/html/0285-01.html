    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.7",311,[140,986,1151,1287]]]'>We said, when this case was here before, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Schaffer, <a href="/pa/271/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="271 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="295646" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0212-01">271 Pa. 212</a>, that Mary Ann Snyder’s interest in the property was divested by a sheriff’s sale; by remaining in possession she did so without claim of right so far as the purchaser, plaintiff’s predecessor, was concerned. She was a sister of plaintiff’s ancestor, and Hattie Mock was a niece. Nothing was done prior to this sister’s death to establish a hostile possession sufficient to start the running of the statute on which to predicate title by adverse possession, and, until the beginning of this suit, no act of Hattie Mock was in law hostile to plaintiff’s claim. Title by adverse possession, then, did not rest on, nor was it aided by, a building that might have been erected by defendants; though evidence concerning payment for the building was submitted at the first trial, it was really not a part of the case. This evidence consisted in part of checks. Defendant has since discovered (so alleged in a petition for a rule to open the judgment and grant a new trial) that one of the checks claimed by plaintiffs as payment was in reality a loan. This it is asserted was a fraud in law and an imposition on the court. The rule was discharged, and from that order the present appeal was taken.</p>

The ancestors of the parties are all <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>dead, and the only fact to sustain a loan of the amount of this check is two entries in a book, designating as a loan sums equaling the face of the check. Without more, this would not show that money on this particular check was given as a loan, so the real purpose for which it was given, other than as testified, might never be established. When the case was on trial, the same book detailing the alleged fraud was in court; defendants were at liberty to examine it. They knew evidence in relation to checks was to be produced, and should have been prepared to meet it in the way they now wish.</p>
