Karlavagn Kelly, the defendant, at 202 North Franklin Street, Philadelphia.

Despite defendant’s denial, the trial court found the existence of a partnership and ordered him to file an account, which he did; and this appeal by him is from the dismissal of exceptions to the report of an auditor appointed to pass thereon. By stipulation filed, the parties agree to the facts as found by the auditor and the only question is, Do they sustain his conclusions and the court’s decree based thereon? In our opinion they do. The auditor finds, inter alia, that the account was false in numerous particulars, that it claimed many credits t'o which accountant was not entitled and omitted to charge himself with many items for which he was liable, that he kept no proper system of accounts and even destroyed books and papers which would have aided the investigation. The result was an entirely different statement from that shown by the account as filed.</p>
