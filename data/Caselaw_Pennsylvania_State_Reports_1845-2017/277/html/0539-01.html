It defined “veterinary medicine” to include veterinary surgery and veterinary dentistry or any branch thereof, and established a full and complete system of regulation of its practice. It made provision, however, for the licensing and recording, as “existing practitioners,” of persons who had been registered and licensed before, and for their lawful continuance in practice; but if not legally authorized to practice at the passage of said act, they would have to possess certain qualifications and submit to an examination by the board.

L. 248, deprive appellant of his property without due process of law, in violation of the 14th amendment to the Federal Constitution or of article I, section 9, of our State Constitution? (3) Was the prosecution barred by the statute of limitations?</p>

In the New International Encyclopedia (under title, Veterinary Medicine) it is said: “As a rule veterinary dentistry is merely one branch of the ordinary practitioner’s work and is confined entirely to equine practice......Some horses require frequent attention to their teeth on account of the tendency to develop sharp points and other irregularities.” It is treated as a branch of veterinary surgery in standard text books on the subject, and the form and use of dental instruments are explained in connection therewith. See, Regional Veterinary Surgery by Moller and Dollar, pp. 25-29. A dentist is a dental surgeon: 30 Cyc. 1546. The Encyclopedia Britannica (vol. 8, p. 50, 11th ed.) calls dentistry, “a special department of medical science;” and while, as respects the treatment of human beings, the professions of medicine and dentistry are now specialized and separately regulated, it is interesting to note that the first statute in Pennsylvania regulating the practice of dentistry (Act of April 11, 1876, P. L. 39), provided: “That from and after the passage of this act it shall be unlawful for any person, except regularly authorized physicians and surgeons, to engage <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>in the practice of dentistry, unless,” etc., thus treating dentistry as a branch of the medical profession. With respect to the treatment of animals this specialization has not taken place and dentistry still remains, as before, a branch of veterinary medicine and surgery and is regulated accordingly. The title “doctor,” used in connection with the initials V.D. (presumably Veterinary Dentist), is likewise in our opinion an analogous title to Veterinary Surgeon.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b567-3" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[124,810,1155,1191]]]'>Our conclusion is supported by analogous rulings in the English Courts. The Veterinary Surgeon Act of 1881 (44-45 Vict. c. 53, s. 17) prohibited the unauthorized use of the title of Veterinary Surgeon or Veterinary Practitioner, or any name, title, addition or description, stating that such unauthorized person was a veterinary surgeon or a practitioner of veterinary surgery or any branch thereof or was specially qualified to practice the same. In Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons v. Robinson, L. R. (1892) 1 Q. B. 557, it was held that a farrier who conducted a “veterinary forge” was guilty of a violation of said act by holding himself out as being specially qualified to practice a branch of veterinary surgery within the meaning of the act. In Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons v. Collison, L. R. (1908) 2 K. B. 248, one who advertised himself as a “canine specialist” was held to have violated the act. In Attorney General v. Churchill’s Veterinary Sanatorium, L. R. (1910) 2 Ch. 401, the provisions of the act were held to have been violated by a company advertising as “Churchill’s Veterinary Sanatorium, James Churchill, Managing Director, M.D., Specialist.”</p>

Palmer, <a href="/pa-super/71/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="71 Pa. Super. 188" data-case-ids="638121" data-case-paths="/pa-super/71/0188-01">71 Pa. Superior Ct. 188</a>. In that case the defendant advertised himself as Dr. S. Melvin Palmer and followed the occupation of “horse dentist.” <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>We upheld his conviction for practicing veterinary medicine without a license, notwithstanding his practice was limited to the care of horses’ teeth and his treatment was extremely primitive.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b568-4" data-blocks='[["BL_568.4",568,[283,528,1158,1345]]]'>The Supreme Court of the United States held, in Dent. v. West Va., <a href="/us/129/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="129 U.S. 114" data-case-ids="8299212" data-case-paths="/us/129/0114-01">129 U. S. 114</a>, that a somewhat similar statute of the State of West Virginia which required every practitioner of medicine in that state to obtain a certificate from the State Board of Health that he was a graduate of a reputable medical college, or had practiced medicine in that state continuously for ten years prior to March 8, 1881, or had passed an examination and been found qualified to practice, and which subjected persons practicing without such certificate to prosecution for a misdemeanor, did not deprive a person who had been practicing as a physician in that state, without a diploma from a reputable medical college, for a period of only five years before 1881, of any property without due process of law. The court distinguished the cases of Cummings v. Missouri, <a href="/us/71/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Wall. 277" data-case-ids="6139656" data-case-paths="/us/71/0277-01">4 Wall. 277</a>, and Ex parte Garland, <a href="/us/71/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Wall. 333" data-case-ids="6139904" data-case-paths="/us/71/0333-01">4 Wall. 333</a>, relied upon by this appellant, and showed that they were not applicable to statutes which only prescribed appropriate qualifications for a profession, attainable by reasonable study or application.

As before-pointed out, the Act of 1915, was not the pioneer statute in the regulation of veterinary medicine and surgery. It is the last of a series of acts extending over twenty-five years. Full opportunity was given the defendant to register under the provisions of the Act of <em>1889; </em>and this was renewed from time to time <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>until as late as January 1, 1910.
