In an action by the driver of a motorcycle against the driver of an automobile for injuries sustained by a collision at an inter, secting street, the question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence is for the jury, where it is conceded that defendant was negligent, and the evidence shows plaintiff, having the right of way, was advancing by order of the traffic officer at a moderate speed, that, after he had practically completed the entire crossing, he was hit on the side by the automobile which suddenly swerved, without signal, to make a left hand turn onto another drive before reaching the centre of the intersecting street, and that the distance was so close plaintiff could not protect himself.</p>

In the center of the latter an officer is stationed, who regulates the congested traffic. At the time of the collision which gave rise to this suit, east- and west-bound vehicles had been stopped by <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>proper signal, and those desiring to proceed at right angles were ordered to move. Kuneck, the plaintiff, started on his motorcycle from the south on Eidge Avenue, keeping to the right, and his car, when it had practically completed the crossing of Wissahickon Drive, was struck on the left side by the automobile of defendant, which, coming from the north, suddenly swerved to his left to enter the drive before reaching its center, plaintiff being hit 15 feet from the curb-line which he was approaching, more than 85 feet of the intersecting street having been safely traversed. Damages were claimed for the injury sustained; a trial resulted in a verdict, and from the judgment entered this appeal is taken.</p>
    <p id="b481-5" data-blocks='[["BL_481.4",481,[138,1067,1167,696]]]'>Admittedly, the defendant was guilty of negligence, since he attempted the crossing at the same time as the motorcycle, which, under the circumstances, had the right of way (Act June 30, 1919, P. L. 678), and Conti was under obligation to make his left-hand turn to the east beyond the center point of intersection of the two streets: Weber v. Greenebaum, <a href="/pa/270/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="270 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1066113" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0382-01">270 Pa. 382</a>; Uhler v.

The-court below was asked to give binding instructions to this effect, but refused to do so, or to subsequently enter judgment n. o. v. It is the correctness of its rulings which we are called on to consider. In passing upon the contention raised, it is to be remembered that we must accept as true all of the testi<a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>mony, and inferences deducible therefrom, favorable to the plaintiff (Geiger v.

    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[254,569,1155,1568]]]'>Viewing the record in this light, it is clear plaintiff had the right of way, was advancing by order of the traffic officer at a moderate speed, and, after having practically completed the entire crossing, was hit on the side by a car which “suddenly” swerved, without signal, before reaching the center of the intersecting street. Kuneck had reason to believe defendant intended to continue in the direction he was moving, and that no turn was to be made. When this did occur, the distance was so close —nineteen feet — as to make it' impossible for him to protect himself. The evidence does not permit the assumption that he ran into the oncoming motor, and took no care to avoid the accident. The facts here shown do not present a situation which would justify a court in declaring contributory negligence, as a matter of law, as in Lessig v. Reading Transit &amp; Light Co., <a href="/pa/270/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="270 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1066008" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0299-01">270 Pa. 299</a>; Hill v.
