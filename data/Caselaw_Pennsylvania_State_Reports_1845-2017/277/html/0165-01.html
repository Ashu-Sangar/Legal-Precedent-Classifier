Hill, on her own behalf, filed a bill in equity to compel George R. Hill and W. W. Clark, trustees under the will of Jonathan A. Hill, deceased, to reimburse expenditures made by Mrs. Hill for the education of her daughter; a decree was entered accordingly and defendants have appealed.</p>

Hill and plaintiff, Mabel Snow Hill; during the years 1918 and 1919, this grandchild, then seventeen years of age, was sent to the Shipley School at Bryn Mawr, the expenses being paid by her mother; “the Shipley School is an institution of high standing, well suited for the educational requirements of Marjorie Hill, considering her circumstances and surroundings at the time she entered” it; just prior to Marjorie’s entering the Shipley School, however, the trustees had determined that her education should be obtained in the high school of the Borough of Towanda, for the following two years, “of which decision [plaintiffs 1 had full notice”; this high <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>school is a first-class institution of its kind, and a suitable place for supplying the then educational needs of Marjorie “were it not for the dissensions existing between her parents”; for some years Mr. and Mrs. Hill lived apart, and finally were divorced; their relations, after the legal separation, continued to be most unhappy and strained, — they were in frequent legal conflicts, and “continuous” dissension existed between them, principally over the care and control of their children; as a consequence of this unfortunate state of affairs, Marjorie would have been “unable to pursue her studies with the efficiency a girl of her years should attain,” if she had remained in the place where both her parents lived, “and her moral and mental growth would develop to a much higher degree by her attendance at some school away from the distracting influence of her father and mother.”</p>
    <p id="AkG" data-blocks='[["BL_192.4",192,[293,1225,1147,207]]]'>On these findings the court determined that “the estate of Jonathan A. Hill should pay to Mabel Snow Hill the sum of $1,373.17 with interest, being the [reasonable] expense of sending Marjorie Hill to the Shipley school.”</p>
