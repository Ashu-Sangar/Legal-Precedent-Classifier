Complaint was filed at Washington prior to March 1, 1920, the state commission’s powers over intrastate movements having been suspended during the period of federal control. The Transportation Act of 1920 returned to the state the control of intrastate rate regulation ; Congress, however, fixed a guarantee period, from March 1, to September 1, 1920, within which existing rates could not be disturbed without the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Appellee, after March 1st, filed an additional protest with the Pennsylvania commission covering the same rate previously complained against. The State had then resumed regulatory control of these rates. The Pennsylvania commission, October 25, 1921, found the fair and reasonable rate from March 1, 1920, to August 25, 1920, to be twenty-five cents per ton; and that, after August 25th, with the horizontal in-increase of forty per cent applicable to group rates or levels (see Increase Rate Case known as “Ex Parte 74,” <a href="/citations/?q=58%20I.C.C.%20220" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="58 I.C.C. 220">58 I. C. C. 220</a>), thirty-five cents was the fair rate. This latter rate, at the carrier’s request, was continued to December 17, 1921, when the rate became effective for the future by the final order of the commission.</p>

It reads, “When the commission shall determine, after hearing......upon complaint, that the rate......[is] unjust ......[it shall] determine and prescribe by specific order the......reasonable <em>rate......to- be thereafter established, demanded, exacted, charged or </em>collected.” This fits in harmoniously with reparation adjustments, and other matters in the act. The order of October 25, 1921, provided for rates after December 17, 1921; it included the findings of fact upon which the order was based; these covered the time from March 20, 1920, to October 25, 1921.

Questions on the findings are not to be taken up piecemeal,— that is for the future under this appeal, and the reasonableness of the past rate on an appeal from a reparation award, though in the latter the commission may limit recovery to any damage actually sustained.

What is done under that section is to be done by the commission ‘in the exercise of its powers to prescribe just and reasonable rates,’ i. e., powers derived from previous amendments to the Interstate Commerce Act, which have never been construed or used to embrace the prescribing of intrastate rates.” And, finally, “It is said that our conclusion gives the commission unified control of interstate and intrastate commerce. It is only unified to the extent of maintaining efficient regulation of interstate commerce under the paramount power of Congress. It does not involve general regulation of intrastate commerce. Action of the Interstate Commerce Commission in this regard should be directed to substantial disparity which operates as a Teal discrimination against, and obstruction to, interstate commerce, and must leave appropriate discretion to the state authorities to deal with intrastate rates as between themselves on the general level which the Interstate Commerce Commission has found to be fair to interstate commerce.” See State of New York et al. v.

The rate guaranteed during the six months following is the lawful rate, or such tariff found by the Interstate Commerce Commission to be just and reasonable on the effective date of the guarantee period (March 1st). That rate controlled the carrier, the state commission and the state appellate courts reviewing the question. By the action of the federal commission sustaining this appellee’s complaint before it, twenty-five cents a ton was the rate fixed to continue through the guarantee period, unless changed as provided by the Transportation Act. The state commission, acting under 208 (a), did not reduce a rate, but rather enforced the corrected rate. Twenty-five cents per ton was, in legal contemplation, written into the tariff from the beginning, the former rate being wholly annulled.</p>

What this court now considers is the action of the Superior Court in sustaining the commission’s finding as to a reasonable rate during the guarantee period. Section 208 (a) does not prohibit a complaint from being filed against a rate established during federal control for the guarantee period. It does prohibit a reduction in rates without the approval of the Interstate Commission. The Superior Court found from the record sufficient evidence to sustain the state com<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>mission’s order, and that the reduction was not confiscatory. Without considering the proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission on the complaint there filed, and, assuming the state’s action was on a rate not before assailed, if we affirm this order the carrier is not injured until the state commission’s order is approved by the federal commission, and afterwards only on an order of reparation. Carriers are afforded every opportunity contemplated by section 208 (a) to contest before the commissions and the courts the complaint filed against the rate, but, when the order is here finally approved, the federal authorities must also act before the reduction can be made effective. It is not necessary to state action, that a conditional approval from Washington be first obtained. Section 208 (a) reads, “No such rate......shall be reduced......unless the reduction ......is approved.” There must be prior action somewhere to secure an approval. The act of Congress intended the Interstate Commerce Commission to act as a reviewing body over rates during the guarantee period, determining whether the reduction is a proper one, having in view the purposes of the act.</p>
