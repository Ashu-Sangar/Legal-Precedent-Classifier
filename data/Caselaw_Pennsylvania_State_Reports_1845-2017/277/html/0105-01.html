Hilbert, shipped a carload of household goods from Huntington, Mass., to Philadelphia, by way of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, defendant. By some oversight the goods were not delivered to plaintiff on arrival, although she made repeated inquiries for them, but were sent to a storage warehouse, where they were later found. Meantime, charges had accumulated, without payment of which defendant declined to surrender the goods, and, to recover their value, plaintiff brought this action of trespass. The trial judge granted a compulsory nonsuit and the refusal to take it off forms the basis of this appeal by plaintiff.</p>

It was an interstate shipment and as such governed by federal law. See Mo., Kans. &amp; Texas Ry. v.

This shipment, as above stated, was made November 21, <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>1917, and the defendant passed under federal control on December 28, 1917. Plaintiff’s claim is for a conversion of the goods, what at common law would be an action of trover, but there is no suggestion of any conversion, prior to the date last named; in fact, plaintiff bases her claim on defendant’s refusal to deliver the goods upon demand made in May, 1920. Hence, as the cause of action did not accrue prior to federal control, the last above quoted provision has no application, and we need not consider whether it applies to a contractural limitation.</p>
