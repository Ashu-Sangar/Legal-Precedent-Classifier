The land involved consists of four separate parcels in Finley Township, Allegheny County, embracing a total of two hundred and eighty-nine acres, upon which John C. Cos-grove, the defendant, on December 12, 1919, gave the plaintiff, William M. Craig (who assigned a one-half interest to his coplaintiff, S. S. Ferguson), an oil, gas and gasoline lease for the term of five years and so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced from the premises, with the exclusive right of drilling and operating thereon for the same. Craig paid defendant $250 in hand and the lease stipulates for a further payment of one dollar a year per acre in quarterly payments in advance, beginning with October 1, 1920. The lease contains numerous provisions, among others, that, “Lessee shall commence the actual work of drilling a well on said premises on or before October 1, 1920, and prosecute the work of drilling with due diligence”; also, that “Failure on the part of lessee to commence the drilling of the wells provided for in this lease, or pay the rental above mentioned at the times agreed upon, shall work a forfeiture of this <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>lease and the same shall thereupon become null and void forthwith.” The lessee did not make the quarter yearly payment of rent on October 1, 1920, and had not then commenced the drilling of a well upon the demised premises ; but in November, 1920, he let a contract to John O. Bauder for drilling a well thereon and on December 10, 1920, mailed Cosgrove a check of $53.50 for the first quarter’s rent. Ten days later Cosgrove’s attorney wrote Craig stating, inter alia, that the lease “expired by its own terms on October 1, 1920,'through your failure to commence the actual work of drilling a well on the leased premises on or before OctoberT, 1920----- .By Mr. Cos-grove’s direction I am returning herewith your check of December 10, 1920, in the sum of $53.50.” Meantime, Bauder began drilling the well and so continued until January 10, 1921, when he was forcibly ejected from the premises by defendant’s employees.</p>

Pitzharris, a local mining engineer, to look after the lands in question, and plaintiffs’ proof, although contradicted, was sufficient to support a finding that, as such agent, Pitzharris had orally waived the time limit for commencing the first well. An agent may be constituted by parol except where he is to convey an estate in land (Miles v. Cook, <a href="/grant/1/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Grant 58" data-case-ids="225819" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0058-01">1 Grant 58</a>), and as such has authority to extend the time for the performance of a contract: Locust Mountain Water Co. v. Yorgey, <a href="/sadler/10/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="10 Sadler 317" data-case-ids="251659" data-case-paths="/sadler/10/0317-01">10 Sadler 317</a>. Here the burden of proving the agent’s authority and the extent of it was upon the plaintiffs (Beal &amp; Simons v. Express Co., <a href="/pa-super/13/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="13 Pa. Super. 143" data-case-ids="825536" data-case-paths="/pa-super/13/0143-01">13 Pa. Superior Ct. 143</a>) and the main question is, Does the proof sustain the finding of such authority? This question must be answered in the affirmative, for the effect of Craig’s testimony is that Cosgrove told him he had given Fitzharris full and exclusive control of the lands in question and whatever he did with reference thereto was valid. If true, that constituted a general agency and rendered the act of Pitzharris binding upon Cosgrove. This evidence, while con<a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>tradicted, is corroborated by the numerous acts done by Fitzharris from the time of negotiating the lease (which was executed by Cosgrove) until he headed the armed men who ejected plaintiffs’ employees from the premises. The evidence, even Fitzharris’ own testimony, tends to show him in actual charge of the property in question. Had he been defendant’s agent for a special purpose only, like the making of leases or collections, the case would be different.</p>
