Frick, deceased, to this Commonwealth, of which he was a resident, and in which he was domiciled when he died on December 21, 1919. A number of points are raised; some concern the interpretation of the Constitution of the United States or of this State; others the construction of our Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521; and still others the meaning of testator’s will. The argument took a wide range, possibly because of a belief regarding the importance of the questions raised, due partly to the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>large amounts involved; and perhaps also because of a conviction, which the writer shares, that the State should have, as part of its public policy, a refusal to tax any gift for a “purely public charity,” since no valid reason can be given for taxing the public for the benefit of the public. Whatever appellant’s reasons may be, however, we are compelled to follow along the lines of the able arguments presented, though this results in what would ordinarily be considered an unnecessarily long opinion.</p>

No claim was made upon the fund except by the State and the legatees; no creditor asked that distribution be delayed or a fund set apart to await a future adjudication of his claim; and no refunding bonds were required of the distributees, to whom the balance in the account was awarded. Hence, even if there are unpaid creditors, who hereafter present and prove their claims, they cannot, under our statutes, successfully maintain suits against the distributees or the executors, to obtain a refund of the sums paid by the latter to the former, on the faith of the court’s decree, but can only have recovery against assets not appearing in the present account: Sections 49 (b) and 50 (a) and <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>(b), Fiduciaries Act of June 7, 1917, P.

L. 521, under which the proceedings were had, provide regarding the tax and how it is to be calculated? Section 2 thereof states, inter alia, that, “In ascertaining the clear value of such [decedents’] estates, the only deductions to be allowed from the gross value of such estates shall be the debts of the decedent and the expenses of the administration of such estates, and no deduction whatsoever shall be allowed for or on account of any taxes paid on such estates to the Government of the United States or to any other state or territory.” And section 10 says: “The register of wills of the county, in which letters testamentary or of administration were granted upon the estate of any person dying seized or possessed of property while a resident of the Commonwealth, shall appoint an appraiser, whenever occasion may require, to appraise the value of the property or estate of which such decedent died seized or possessed.”</p>

The appraisement to be made is not of the legacies or devises but of the whole estate of a' decedent; the debts and expenses of administration are' not to be deducted from any particular gift or gifts, but from the whole estate, and the taxes paid to the United States or to any other state or territory, if permitted to be deducted, would have been from the whole estate. We <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>therefore conclude that it is the entire value of the estate, less the credits specified, which forms the basis of the tax, and not the amounts received by the particular legatees; hence, as stated in Knowlton v. Moore, <a href="/us/178/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="178 U.S. 41" data-case-ids="3612841" data-case-paths="/us/178/0041-01">178 U. S. 41</a>, that which the State “taxes is not the interest to which some [or many a] person succeeds on a death, but the interest which ceased by reason of the death.” Since this is the true construction of the act, much of the argument made by these appellants, founded as it is upon the contention that the tax is levied only upon the particular gifts, when and as received, becomes ineffective because it has no relation to the actual status.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[162,1000,1150,918]]]'>Basing their elaborate argument largely on their erroneous construction of the act as last stated, the executors and residuary legatees who appeal, ask us to ignore the clear and unambiguous language of section 2, above quoted, and to decide that the court below erred “in ascertaining the clear value” of the estate, because it did not deduct from its “gross value” (a) the amount paid the Government for the federal estate tax; (b) the amounts paid other states and the Province of Quebec for their inheritance taxes on decedent’s real and personal property there located; and (c) the inheritance tax payable to this State.

Eisner, <a href="/us/256/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="256 U.S. 345" data-case-ids="3678530" data-case-paths="/us/256/0345-01">256 U.

No valid reason is given why this may not be done. On the contrary, as stated in the last cited case, where “the tax attaches to the estate before distribution, — if it is a tax on the right to transmit, or on the transmission at its beginning, — obviously it attaches to the whole estate, except so far as the statute sets a limit.”</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[286,739,1163,1388]]]'>Recognizing that their contention now being considered is in direct antagonism to the express language of the statute, these appellants in effect ask us to ignore this language, and from isolated phrases and words in-the statute to reach an opposite conclusion, partially because of general expressions found in our opinions in Oliver’s Est., <a href="/pa/273/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="273 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="1070781" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0400-01">273 Pa. 400</a>, and Kirkpatrick’s Est., <a href="/pa/275/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="275 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1075699" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0271-01">275 Pa. 271</a>, — though this question was not directly raised in either of them, — apparently forgetting the basic rule that “It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit when the very point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the ease decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated”: Cohens v. Virginia, <a href="/us/19/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="6 Wheat. 264" data-case-ids="11730243" data-case-paths="/us/19/0264-01">6 Wheaton 264</a>, 397, per Marshall, C.

Of course we cannot permit isolated expressions in a statute, or in any opinion of ours, to override the express language of the act being construed.</p>

The only section of the Constitution of this State, which is supposed to affect the matter, is article IX, section 1, which provides that “all <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.” This, however, is not infringed, since the estates of all decedents are subjected to a uniform inheritance tax in all parts of the Commonwealth; and hence we turn to the provisions of the federal Constitution, alleged to have been violated by the decree below, to see if they or any of them stand in the way of enforcing the statute as written.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[132,837,1151,853]]]'>The first claim regarding this is that it is “repugnant to clause 1, of section 8, of article I, of the Constitution of the United States, in that it interferes with the power of Congress to levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.” This is a veiled attack upon our dual form of government, and, in its ultimate analysis, would appear to be an attempt to deny to the states any right to exercise their taxing power upon subjects which the federal government may also tax. It needs no argument to show the error of such a contention. Moreover, there cannot be found anywhere within the four corners of the act, in the practice under it, or in the decree below, the slightest evidence of a desire to interfere with the taxing powers of the United States.</p>

The principle contended for is wholly inapplicable, however. Given the fact, that a state may levy an inherit' anee tax on the value of the entire estate of a decedent, <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>even though part of it consists of United States bonds (Plumber v.

S. 278</a>), it necessarily follows that, in determining the way in which this tax shall be computed, it may, subject to constitutional provisions, refuse to allow any deduction for taxes paid to the United States and other states. “The right to dispose of one’s property by will, and the right to have it disposed of by the law, after decease, is created by statute, and therefore the State may impose such conditions upon the exercise of this right as it may determine” (Banker’s Trust Co. v. Blodgett, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, January 22, 1923, and not yet officially reported); hence the method of calculating the amount to be paid must necessarily be one for legislative consideration, for, as there stated, “The power of taxation, with its accessorial sanctions, is a power of government, and all property is subject to it.” If the question of priority of right ever arises, — which American history since 1865 renders extremely doubtful, —the contention now made may become important; it does not arise here; in fact the federal estate tax has long since been paid, while Pennsylvania is still seeking to collect the amount due to her.</p>

We agree that “A tax can only be imposed by the State when it has either jurisdiction over a person or jurisdiction over his property”; here it has jurisdiction over both, decedent having been and appellants being domiciled in the State, the latter appearing to the action, all the property now in course of distribution being within the State, and a valid state statute lawfully imposing the tax.

If the estate has been deprived of the “equal protection of the laws,” since all the facts are agreed to, it should be easy to point out exactly how this is so. What has Pennsylvania done which operates to “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws”? These executors and residuary legatees are accorded exactly the same protection given by this statute to every other person within its jurisdiction.

It is clear that neither testator nor any other decedent can, by his will, alter the amount which the Commonwealth is entitled to receive, save to the extent the statute itself specifies, that is, where the gifts are to a “father, mother, husband, wife, children, lineal descendants born in lawful wedlock, legally adopted children, children of a former husband or wife, or the wife or widow of the son of a person <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>dying seized or possessed thereof......or from the mother of an illegitimate child, or from any person of whom the mother is a lineal descendant to snch child, his wife, or widow [or] passing from an illegitimate child to his mother” (these being commonly called direct inheritances) ; but two per centum is to be charged upon the value thereof, and where the gifts are to collaterals,— which include all distributees except those above specified, — five per centum is to be charged upon the value thereof. It necessarily follows that the direction of the present will “that all inheritance......taxes_____ .shall be paid out of the capital of my residuary estate,” can have no effect in reducing the amount of tax to be paid to this State, but only operates, as between the two classes of gifts, to fix the ultimate payment upon the residuary devisees and legatees, in relief of the others, each of whom, but for that clause, would suffer an abatement of his or her devise or bequest, to the extent of the tax imposed upon its value. If this was not so, and a testator was permitted to reduce the amount payable to the State, by simply charging upon the residuary estate all the taxes paid elsewhere, the sovereign power of the State to impose them as it pleases, subject only to the requirement of equality and uniformity, would be made subject also, in this class of cases, to the unrestrained directions of a testator. Under such circumstances, a decedent who had a relatively large amount of property elsewhere, might, by the device stated, greatly embarrass and perhaps largely or wholly defeat the claim of the domiciliary State, even upon the value of the property within her own borders.</p>

On the contrary, section 16 expressly provides that before paying any legacy the “executor or administrator, or other trustee......shall deduct [the tax] therefrom at the rate of two per centum upon the whole legacy [if the inheritance is direct]......and at the rate of five per centum upon the whole legacy,” if the inheritance is collateral. Hence it is palpably erroneous to say that the percentage to be levied on the “clear value of such estate,” as calculated in the manner provided by the statute, should not be levied thereon, but on a sum which is that “clear value” less the tax itself; that is, in the case of direct inheritances on 98 per cent of that value, and in the case of collaterals on 95 per cent of it.

Kentucky, supra, [page 211], says, “are controlled by different considerations.” It follows that as the right of transmission is state-created, and hence the Commonwealth can legally say, and does say, upon what terms this testator may give and his legatees may receive property within her jurisdiction, she may, for the reasons already specified, declare that the only basis upon which her conditions can be met, shall be by payment of a tax upon the value of decedent’s property wherever located.

Tennessee, <a href="/us/104/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="104 U.S. 493" data-case-ids="3493090" data-case-paths="/us/104/0493-01">104 U. S. 493</a>; Com. v.

The Commonwealth claims that they are “antique.....furniture,” within the meaning of those words in the foregoing quotation from testator’s will, and hence were included in the gift to the trustees for the benefit of the Frick Collection, and upon their appraised value a tax of five per cent should be assessed, although that corporation refused to receive them because they were given by the will to the widow, who, under the decree below, pays a tax at the rate of two per cent only. The court below overruled this claim because of an agreement of all the parties interested, including the Commonwealth, that these and the other articles of furniture in testator’s New York home were “nothing more than the ordinary furniture and furnishings suitable for such residence.” Since that which is “nothing more than ordinary furniture” and “antique......furniture” are not or may not be the same, and there is no evidence compelling the conclusion that they are not, we cannot con<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>vict the court of error in holding they are not “antique ......furniture” within the meaning of the will. Moreover, the refusal of “The Frick Collection” to receive them as “antique......furniture” necessarily resulted, if they were such, in their falling into the residue, upon which the tax imposed on their value would have been at the rate of two per cent, exactly as it was charged in the decree appealed from.</p>

There can be no doubt as to the meaning of the Act <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>of 1919. The legislature plainly intended, by section 2, to prevent the deduction of such tax before assessing the state transfer tax. The statute was passed to overcome the decisions of this court in Otto’s Est., <a href="/pa/257/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="257 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="1032399" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0155-01">257 Pa. 155</a>, and Knight’s Est., <a href="/pa/261/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="261 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1042203" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0537-01">261 Pa. 537</a>, wherein we held that, in computing the net value of the estate, taxes due the federal government and foreign states should be deducted. The Act of 1919, on the point here involved, was construed by this court in Kirkpatrick’s Est., <a href="/pa/275/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="275 Pa. 271" data-case-ids="1075699" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0271-01">275 Pa. 271</a>. The writer dissented from the conclusion reached in that case by the majority of the court, but filed no opinion setting out his reasons for such dissent. In view of the presentation of the same question in this proceeding, and of the further fact that this case will probably be taken before the Supreme Court of the United States, it seems proper that reasons for such dissent be briefly stated.</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.4",292,[305,1218,1148,1186]],["BL_293.1",293,[110,346,1150,2063]],["BL_294.1",294,[308,354,1147,209]]]'>The power of the United States to tax is limited only by the extent of the necessity for raising money to meet the various needs of government. “That the power to tax involves the power to destroy; that the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to create; that there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which other, with respect to those very measures, is declared to be supreme over that which exerts the control, are propositions not to be denied”: McCullough v. Maryland, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20U.S.%20315" class="citation" data-index="78" data-cite="17 U.S. 315">17 U. S. 315</a>, 129. The opinion in which this language was used firmly established the principle that a state is without power to tax an instrumentality of the federal government, — a principle which has been constantly followed and applied in the century elapsing since the decision there rendered. The general rule is, therefore, that states are without authority, by taxation or otherwise, to in any manner control or interfere with the operations of the federal government, or the instrumentalities by which that government is carried on. The latter is supreme within its sphere of action, and, where there is inconsistency or conflict, the state laws <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>and regulations must yield for the benefit of the whole. If the State of Pennsylvania is permitted to tax property appropriated by the federal government, under its taxing power, this, in effect, permits the State to collect revenue from property set aside for the use of the United States. If we concede the state tax is on the right to transmit the property and not on the property itself, still the total estate has been depleted by the amount of the federal tax and it is only the balance, thus remaining, decedent has a right to transfer and if the total estate is taken as the basis of the state tax, the effect is 'to give the State a revenue derived from a fund set aside for the benefit of the United States. The federal tax is an estate tax payable out of the estate of decedent and is imposed, regardless of the will of the decedent, on the gross estate, after deducting designated items: Knight’s Est., supra. The right of the United States to first collect its tax seems to be conceded and if the right of the United States to tax includes the right to tax to any amount, or to take the whole where necessary, the result of holding that the federal tax should not be deducted before computing the state tax might be to impose a combined state and federal tax exceeding the value of the property. Let us suppose, for example, that the federal tax is sixty per cent of the estate and the state tax an equal amount. The result would be that the estate would owe in taxes twenty per cent more than its value, regardless of what that might be. While it may be argued that this situation would not be likely to arise, and indeed presents a very remote possibility, yet it shows the logical result of permitting two or more sovereign powers to levy a tax on the whole of a decedent’s estate. The fact that the right of succession is a state right and not within the control of the federal government does not give to the State the power to take away from the federal government the subject-matter of the tax, as was suggested in the opinion of the majority of this court in Kirkpatrick’s Est., supra, inasmuch as, under the federal law, the tax is on the estate <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>as a whole and not on the transfer to the beneficiary and the justification for the tax is the ending of the estate by death rather than the beginning of a new estate by succession: Knowlton v. Moore, <a href="/us/178/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="178 U.S. 41" data-case-ids="3612841" data-case-paths="/us/178/0041-01">178 U. S. 41</a>.</p>
    <p id="b294-5" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[299,574,1154,1065]]]'>The majority opinion holds exempt the land given to the City of Pittsburgh as a public park but imposes a tax of five per cent on the fund of $2,000,000 given for the purpose of taking care of the property. It is conceded the sum so given is not in excess of the amount necessary to properly improve and maintain the park and that, in absence of such gift, the city would be obliged to tax its citizens to provide for such maintenance. It is true the Act of 1919 refers in its exemptions only to “estates in any buildings, ground, books, curios, pictures, statuary or other works of art,” given for public purposes, and does not specifically mention funds left for maintenance of such objects. Any distinction between the gift of land for a park and the gift of a sum of money for its maintenance or for the purchase of property to be used as a park is but an arbitrary one and not based on a real difference in the purposes or objects of the gift. Granting the power of the legislature to make an arbitrary distinction if it sees fit to do so, the question is whether this has been done in the Act of 1919.</p>

The argument for such strict construction, however, is based on prior decisions rendered in cases involving, not the question of exemption of public property, but exemption of private property held for charitable or other purposes, bringing it within the laws providing for exemption from taxation. There is a clear distinction in the law applicable to these two classes of cases. Public property is never subject to tax laws and no portion of it can be, without express statutory enactment. Accordingly, no exemption is needed for public property held as such: Poor Directors v. School Directors, <a href="/pa/42/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="42 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="481491" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0021-01">42 Pa. 21</a>; Pittsburgh v. Sterrett Sub-District School, <a href="/pa/204/0635-01" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="204 Pa. 635" data-case-ids="927557" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0635-01">204 Pa. 635</a>, <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>641. Exemption is the rule and taxation the exception. In considering legislation of the character here in question it is always to be presumed that general language is used with reference to taxable subjects, and the property of municipalities does not fall within the ordinary designation of taxable subjects: County of Erie v. City of Erie, <a href="/pa/113/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="82" data-cite="113 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="457566" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0360-01">113 Pa. 360</a>. To levy a tax on such property would merely mean the assessment of new taxes to meet the liability which the city had imposed upon itself, and no benefit would accrue. On the contrary, an additional liability would result, measured by the expenses of imposing and collecting the tax. Hence, it is unreasonable to conclude that a law, however general, was intended to reach property held by-thfe public for public purposes. While such property may be taxed if the legislature sees fit to so provide, the intention must be clearly expressed or necessarily implied. On the other hand, as to private property, even though held for private charities and therefore exempt as such, a different rule applies. In such case liability to taxation is the rule and the person claiming exemption must point to an express statute granting relief from the burden. An illustration of this is found in Robb v. Phila., <a href="/pa-super/25/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="83" data-cite="25 Pa. Super. 343" data-case-ids="851976" data-case-paths="/pa-super/25/0343-01">25 Pa. Superior Ct. 343</a>, which followed the general principles established many years ago by this court. In the course of the opinion in the case just cited, it was said (page 346) : “There is this distinction for the purpose of taxation between property owned by a church and that owned by a municipality and devoted exclusively to public purposes. The church must show ground on which its property is exempt. The public property of a municipality cannot be taxed unless there is the clearly manifest legislative intention that it shall be subject to the imposition. Property belonging to the State and its municipalities, and which is held for governmental purposes, is presumed to be exempt, and is not included in any designation of property to be taxed however sweeping, unless the statute authorizing the tax expressly provides.” Citing <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>Pittsburgh v.

    <p id="b296-5" data-blocks='[["BL_296.4",296,[273,503,1150,371]]]'>It is also to be noted, as having an important bearing on this question, that the settled policy of the State is to exempt from taxation “institutions of purely public charities,” and that they “may be exempt by necessary implication of law”: Mattern v.

The purpose and spirit of the law applies to the money equally with the objects enumerated. Bearing in mind the principles above stated, showing the policy of our law, it seems to the writer of this opinion that the Act of 1919 should be construed to include money left by will to maintain the charitable objects there exempt.</p>
