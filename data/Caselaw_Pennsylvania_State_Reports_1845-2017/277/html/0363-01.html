The first two machines were to be delivered on or before February 15, 1920, and at least two machines each and every day thereafter until the contract was filled. Plaintiff advanced the ten thousand dollars as the contract stipulated, but none of the machines was made or delivered and because of such failure he wrote defendant, on May 19, 1920, rescinding the contract and then brought this suit for the ten thousand dollars advanced and also for a like sum claimed as liquidated damages. Defendant filed an affidavit of defense and later an amended affidavit setting up divers matters in defense, and also a counterclaim, to all of which plaintiff replied, raising legal questions only, as provided by the Practice Act of 1915. Thereupon the trial court entered judgment for the plaintiff for the ten thousand dollars advanced, with interest thereon, refused judgment for the ten thousand dollars claimed as liquidated damages and dismissed defendant’s counterclaim as insufficient in law; from which each side has appealed and we will here dispose of both.</p>

True, a railroad strike and one in defendant’s factory are averred as beginning in April 1920, but that was two months after defendant had breached the contract and of course could not excuse it: see Wigton, Receiver, v.

The affidavit avers generally extraordinarily severe weather conditions during the first quarter of 1920, causing delay in transportation and its affiant expresses the belief that defendant was substantially hindered thereby, but fails to state what transportation companies were blockaded by storms, or for how long, or of what material defendant was thereby deprived. Moreover, he who undertakes to perform a contract during the winter months in this northern country cannot be excused because of general severity of the weather: Texter v.

The affidavit also avers that, owing to the abnormal demand for rolling mill products, defendant was unable to obtain the required material “within any reasonable bounds of effort or expense”; but that is unavailing; mere hardship or difficulty is no excuse for failure to perform a contract: Com. v. Neff et al., <a href="/pa/271/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="271 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="295647" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0312-01">271 Pa. 312</a>; Corona C. &amp; C. Co. v.

As the trial court rightly held the contract was breached by defendant, its counterclaim, based on the theory that plaintiff breached the contract, falls. Furthermore, the counterclaim on its face is fatally defective in that it fails to state when, to whom, or for what the items comprising the lump sum were paid, or any sufficient facts to justify the claim for anticipated profits. It would be worthless as a plaintiff’s statement of claim and is equally so as a counterclaim, which must be stated with the same certainty: O’Neil v. Burnett, <a href="/pa/263/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="263 Pa. 216" data-case-ids="1047504" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0216-01">263 Pa. 216</a>, and see Frick &amp; Lindsay v.

    <p id="b393-3" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[113,459,1151,1957]],["BL_394.1",394,[294,343,1148,797]]]'>The contract contained a further stipulation as follows, “In the event the Exeter Machine Works, Inc., fail or neglect to comply with the terms and conditions of this contract, then it is agreed between the parties hereto, that the stipulated damages shall be fixed in the sum of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, that being agreed upon as the amount of damages which the said Max Gross would be entitled to as a result of the failure on the part of the said Exeter Machine Works, Inc., to carry out the terms of their contract; and also agree in addition thereto to return to the said Max Gross, the said sum of ten thousand ($10,000) dollars, which has been paid to the Exeter Machine Works, Inc., as an advanced payment.” This, plaintiff contends, entitles him to the stipulated ten thousand dollars as liquidated damages; but the trial judge properly held otherwise. Whether the parties have denominated the sum specified in any given case a penalty or liquidated damages is of little moment in determining its real character: Kunkel &amp; Jordan v. Wherry, <a href="/pa/189/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="189 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="903528" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0198-01">189 Pa. 198</a>. “The question......is to be determined by the intention of the parties drawn from the words of the whole contract, examined in the light of its subject-matter and its surroundings; and in this examination we must consider the relation which the sum stipulated bears to the injury which may be caused by the several breaches provided against, the ease or difficulty of measuring a breach in damages and such other matters as are legally or necessarily inherent in the transaction”: March v. Allabough, <a href="/pa/103/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="103 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="449086" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0335-01">103 Pa. 335</a>. The general rule is that, where the covenant embraces the performance of several acts and a single sum is named, it will be treated as a penalty, especially so where the damages for any breach or breaches may be ascertained. In other words, where the agreement contains several matters of different degrees of importance and yet the sum named is for the breach of any, even the least, it is to be <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>construed as a penalty and not as liquidated damages: Keck v. Bieber, <a href="/pa/148/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="148 Pa. 645" data-case-ids="981847" data-case-paths="/pa/148/0645-01">148 Pa. 645</a>; March v.

Brereton, <a href="/pa/51/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="51 Pa. 175" data-case-ids="999799" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0175-01">51 Pa. 175</a>. Here, defendant might commit minor breaches of the contract; for example, it might fail to deliver one of the five hundred machines, or one of them, when delivered might not be equal in efficiency to the Atwood machines, or defendant might fail to extend plaintiff credit for the full $45,000 specified. In each instance there would be a breach of contract, but it cannot be affirmed that such would entitle plaintiff to the $10,000, irrespective of the actual loss sustained. Hence the amount stated must be treated as a penalty. The question is one of law and there is no force in the suggestion that it was first raised in the amended affidavit of defense.</p>
