The bill then avers there are of record a mortgage and judgment aggregating $13,600, and also some tax claims, making the total liens against the property $14,138.02, and that plaintiff is prepared to pay the purchase money less these charges.</p>

This case does lay it down broadly, however, that in such a controversy as the one now before us, where the vendor contends the vendee must pay, either directly or indirectly, more than the named consideration money, he, the vendor, is “bound to show it to the satisfaction of the jury”; in other words, the burden of proof is on him: see also Tod v. Gallagher, 16 S. &amp; R. 260, 263; Roland v. Miller, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 390" data-case-ids="1854585" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0390-01">3 W.&amp; S. 390</a>, 395.</p>

Godfrey, <a href="/pa/254/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="254 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="1025396" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0099-01">254 Pa. 99</a>, 107.</p>
    <p id="b62-4" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[291,786,1150,1065]]]'>The case last mentioned (together with some of those before cited) was relied on by defendant to sustain his position; but, in so far as it has any bearing on the question before us, it supports a contrary conclusion. There, the vendor agreed in the sale to repurchase at- a certain price, within one year, at the option of the vendee ; then, on the exercise of the option, the vendor contended that his vendee should convey the property freed of a mortgage which he, the vendor, had placed on it before the original sale. Under these circumstances, in affirming, per curiam, the judgment of the court below, we held that “a covenant for the removal of the encumbrance......cannot be written into the agreement as a condition of the repurchase provided for by it”; that is to say, the original sale of the property without a covenant regarding a known, but unmentioned, encumbrance, did not serve, in the absence of any collateral obligation given by the original vendee for the purchase money, to relieve the original vendor of his responsibility for payment of such encumbrance.</p>

Richardson, <a href="/pa/28/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="28 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="981656" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0288-01">28 Pa. 288</a>, 293; Roland v.

    <p id="b63-5" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[123,459,1154,1135]]]'>In view of the principles stated (reference to which, with additional authorities, may be found in 27 R. C. L. 480, 481), the learned court below erred in deciding, as matter of law, that plaintiff, having failed to require a covenant for the payment by defendant of the present encumbrances, must bear the burden thereof himself. This is a case where all the facts should be brought forth and passed on, in the light of the principles to which we have referred, before a final determination is reached. If it develops there was an agreement between the parties that the vendee was to buy subject to liens or encumbrances, or take the risk of them, then, of course, his present tender would not be good. If, on the other hand, it should appear that the sale was clear of encumbrances, or that plaintiff had no knowledge of them and nothing was said about them, he would be entitled to specific performance of the contract; and, this would be the case also even though he knew of the encumbrances, unless additional evidence indicates that, on the exercise of his option of purchase, he, and not defendant, was to assume liability for them: cases cited, supra.</p>
    <p id="b63-6" data-blocks='[["BL_63.5",63,[128,1604,1149,374]]]'>Finally, on the present record, no question arises as to the adequacy of the tender, or the failure to produce the required money, since plaintiff alleges that, when he expressed a desire to settle for the purchase of the property, defendant “refused to accept any sum of money,” and entirely declined to carry out the contract: see Shrut v. Huselton, <a href="/pa/272/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="272 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1068418" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0113-01">272 Pa. 113</a>, 116.</p>
