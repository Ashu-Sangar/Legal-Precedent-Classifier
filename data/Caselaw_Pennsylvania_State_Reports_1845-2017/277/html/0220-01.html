This car stopped at Huntingdon Street, where the ladies were directed to transfer to a car in the rear, which they did, walking in the paved cartway by a second car and entering the third. While walking close to the side of the second car, its rear emergency folding doors opened and one of them struck Mrs. Swink’s arm and hand, and this suit was brought by her and her husband for the injuries thus sustained. The doors when opened projected six inches beyond the line of the car, but, as there was a space of eight feet between the car and curb and a sidewalk beyond, there was no occasion for a pedestrian walking close to the car. The doors in question were operated by a lever located <a id="p222" href="#p222" data-label="222" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*222</a>behind the motorman at the front end of the car, and it does not appear he could see plaintiff or knew where she was when they were opened, or that the manner of their opening was out of the ordinary. The trial court directed a verdict for the defendant and from ’judgment entered thereon plaintiffs have appealed.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[300,677,1150,1294]]]'>Mrs. Swink continued a passenger while walking from car to car (Keator v.

R. R. Co. v. MacKinney, <a href="/pa/124/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="124 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="563104" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0462-01">124 Pa. 462</a>; Farley v.

An injury to a passenger by the ordinary opening or closing of a car door, through the act of an employee of the carrier is not sufficient to charge the latter with negligence, as the presumption is such employee was acting within the proper line of his duty: L’Hommedieu v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R.

The opening of the door was of itself an innocent and proper act and the mot'orman was not bound to anticipate so unusual an occurrence as a person walking within less than six inches of the blind side of a car, when there was a wide open space beyond. Conceding the motorman opened the doors, a conclusion only inferentially drawn, there is nothing to show it was a negligent act on his part.</p>
