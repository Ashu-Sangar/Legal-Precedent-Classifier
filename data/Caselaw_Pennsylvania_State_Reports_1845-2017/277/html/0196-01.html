United States Express Co., <a href="/pa/225/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="225 Pa. 33" data-case-ids="965250" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0033-01">225 Pa. 33</a>, 38, 39; Flanigan v.

    <p id="b222-4" data-blocks='[["BL_222.4",222,[265,1095,1151,1286]]]'>There is nothing in the evidence to show how plaintiff came into this part of the street. All that we have is that he was seen just as he left the curb to cross from the north to the south side of City Line Avenue. He was next seen either being struck or underneath the front part of the automobile; no one saw him in the intervening space from the curb to the place 7&gt;f accident, nor, so far as the record shows, does anyone know just how the accident happened. Was he run down by the car, the driver of which could have seen him a sufficient length of time to have guarded against it? The accident occurring between crossings, did he suddenly run in front of the car; was he crossing the street heedlessly; was he crossing the street without regard to traffic, having his hand thrown over his head to keep the storm from his face; did he reach the south side of the street safely and suddenly dart back in front' of the car; or did the car suddenly swerve, striking him? All these circumstances are left to conjecture; defendants might have been responsible for one or more of the causes and not so as to others. In such cases, where it is equally probable the accident may have resulted from either cause, there can be no recovery: Alexander v. Pennsylvania Water Co., <a href="/pa/201/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="201 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="925690" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0252-01">201 Pa. 252</a>.</p>

As to this part of the cartway, vehicles, such as automobiles, have the right of way: Virgilio v. Walker Co., <a href="/pa/254/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="254 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1025399" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0241-01">254 Pa. 241</a>, 245; Anderson v.

Pedestrians, however, have the right to use the cart-way between crossings (Anderson v.

And while a child of tender years is not held, as an adult, to the strict rule of law, a vehicle need not be under instant control between crossings; and what would be negligence in reckless driving at a crossing may not be sufficient to establish negligence between crossings; further, in such cases drivers are not required to sound their horns, unless they see danger ahead or have reasonable apprehension to believe a child or adult will appear in their path.</p>

There is no evidence of excessive speed, and nothing to show how the boy happened in the cartway before he appeared in front of the car. It would seem, from the teacher’s evidence, he had time to cross the street in safety. To hold a driver of a car liable for a collision between crossings, the pedestrian must have been “on the cartway a sufficient length of time to be seen, the driver of the car being far enough away to bring his machine under control”: Anderson v. Wood, <a href="/pa/264/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="264 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1048577" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0098-01">supra, 101</a>.
