In part of its argument the city has assumed that the street was at the edge of high watermark, and has elaborately contended that the result of this was that all riparian rights were in the public and all accretions became vested in it.

Turning first to the plans, we find that the earliest in point of time is the Barbeau Plan, dated January <em>27, </em>1831, which does not show any street, but only an open space along the river, without any designation regarding its ownership. The next is the Remington Plan, made February 24, 1837, for official use in the opening of Perry Street. It shows a thirty feet wide street, “laid out by I. Gregg,” paralleling the river, but at some distance from it, and defendant’s property lines crossing the street and the tract beyond it, and running to the river. It is signed by the surveyor and the road jury, who were, we are told, thoroughly acquainted with the locality. The third is dated March 14, 1839, and was made by some unknown person for the purpose of showing the effect of plotting a street “100 feet plus [in width] to low watermark,” parallel with and skirting the river; the fourth, dated September 16, 1848, and made by R. E. McGowin, discloses what would have' resulted from the laying out of a street along the river “150 ft. wide more or less to low watermark”; and the fifth, also by Mr. McGowin, dated April 5, 1851, is in some respects like the fourth, its only additional purpose apparently being to designate the encroachment of the river at that time, and not to fix the actual line of the street, or the then ownership of the land between it <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>and the river. Finally, the Patterson Plan of October, 1872, prepared “in pursuance of the ordinance passed October 3, 1872,” shows the street as paralleling the river, not even adjoining its high watermark, but with the side lines of the property carried across the intervening tract between the street and the river.</p>
    <p id="b165-3" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[113,664,1152,371]]]'>None of these plans indicates that the street actually ran along high watermark, and none of them shows that the city had any title to the ground in dispute, or to any other ground in like situation. Several of them disclose a wish on the part of the borough to have the land, but this very fact point's to the conclusion that defendant’s record title had never actually been divested.</p>

The 14th Amendment-to the Constitution of the United States provides, inter alia, “nor shall any state deprive any person of......property, without due process of law,” and this cannot be obeyed unless the owners shall have been given “a fair opportunity for submitting the issue to a judicial tribunal for determination” : Ohio Valley Water Co. v.

So far as appears by the present record there was no attempt to comply with that constitutional requirement, save in one instance where, pending the assessment of damages, the Act of March 13, 1849, P. L. 159, rendered nugatory the attempt of the borough to take the <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>property now in dispute, under an ordinance dated August 13, 1848.</p>
    <p id="b166-4" data-blocks='[["BL_166.4",166,[278,458,1155,1507]]]'>These acts and ordinances disclose, however, certain facts which indicate that the city’s present contention is entirely an afterthought. For instance, the Act of March 28, 1836, P. L. 204, authorizing the opening of Perry Street through defendant’s property (and under which the borough did open it, as shown on the Remington Plan hereinbefore referred to), avers this property was bounded by the Monongahela River and not by Water Street. By an ordinance of the borough, dated May 28, 1856, it is recited that “Isaac Gregg, former proprietor......dedicated a portion of the ground along the bank of the Monongahela River for a public street, which said street so dedicated has not been located, or the boundaries thereof properly defined,” and then provided for the opening of Water Street, forty feet wide, at some distance from the river, and ordains that all of the ground between the street and the river “shall be improved and occupied as a public wharf or landing.” It is found and not denied, that at this time the borough had no statutory authority to take ground for a “public wharf or landing,” and “there is no evidence that Water Street, as located by the ordinance of 1856, was ever opened or improved.” From this ordinance two things are evident, both telling against the city: (1) At this date the street was not supposed to run to the river; and, (2) The borough did not then claim the space between the street and the river had theretofore been dedicated to a public use.</p>

When the borough undertook to appropriate this property under an ordinance dated August 13, 1848 (in connection with which the McGowin Plan of September 16, 1848, above referred to, was prepared), defendant’s predecessor in title filed a petition alleging he was the owner of the plot now in dispute, and applied for a jury of view. His <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>ownership was not challenged and he was awarded damages; but, pending his appeal alleging inadequacy of amount, the whole proceedings were overthrown, as already stated, by the Act of March 13, 1849, P. L. 159, which forbade the taking. So, also, in 1864, when the borough brought suit against one Ihmsen the owner of a plot similar to defendant’s, upon advice of its counsel, R. B. Carnahan, Esq., it discontinued the suit, because “the deeds called for low watermark and there is no dedication, so far as known, of said ground as a public highway by Mr. Gregg in laying out the plan of Sidneyville.” This is particularly significant since Mr. Carnahan was also counsel for the borough, and only a short time before won the appeals in, Borough of Birmingham v. Anderson, <a href="/pa/40/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="40 Pa. 506" data-case-ids="477852" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0506-01">40 Pa. 506</a>, and Same v.

All <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>of this testimony was produced by the city, and so far as it is clear, it relates to the river front between 10th and 16th streets, and not to the land in dispute between 16th and 17th streets, as will be made plain by a few sample quotations from it. The witnesses alleged that materials could have been hauled up to 17th Street if “they wanted to” do so; “they hauled some things up there”; “it was used, I am certain, from at least 11th Street up to 15th— to 16th Street — perhaps 17th”; the road extended “as far as 15th” Street, “I think there was boats landed there”; “above 15th or 16th street......I don’t think there were any rafts taken out”; “the beach in general [was used] from 15th and 16th down,” the materials “were landed at 15th and 13th”; the hauling across the open space would be “from 15th to 16th, and then they got into 16th Street”; the unloading was done “generally between 13th and 15th,” usually from “16th down to 12th.”</p>
