The answer to this is not free from difficulty, but in our judgment they were warranted in so doing. There can be no doubt but that testator desired his son to receive the $10,000 on the particular date specified, and hence is careful to say it shall “be paid as above specified and not by way of anticipation,” and also that it may be paid out of principal, if necessary. Perhaps he thought the accumulated income would be sufficient for the purpose, as in fact it would have been, if the accumulation had been legal; but this is a two-edged sword, for if he so believed why provide for a possible call upon principal. Perhaps the provision relating thereto was only inserted out of an abundance of caution; if so the event justified his forethought. Perhaps he knew he was providing for an unlawful accumulation, but hoped this would not be urged against his will.</p>
