After hearing, the commission made its findings of fact, among others, that the cost of performing the contract to the letter constituted an unjust burden upon the operating company, which its net receipts attributable to service in the borough would not warrant, and, instead of directing that the avenue be kept in repair from curb to curb, as requested by petitioner, the commission ordered that the Rapid Transit Company should “maintain and keep in repair that portion of Yale Avenue......which lies between its rails and to the end of its ties,” and directed that it should “not pave or maintain that part......outside of the railway strip.”</p>

Furthermore, appellants contend that, in the present case, the paving obligations, imposed in 1900 by the consent-ordinance before us, are illegal under present-day conditions, because unreasonable, unjust' and in effect discriminatory, and because their enforcement will prevent the operating company from furnishing and maintaining proper service at reasonable rates, as required by article II, section 1, paragraphs a and b, of the act. Finally, on the grounds stated and for the reasons specified, appellants say the powers given the commission were properly exercised in this case, and the Superior Court erred in deciding otherwise.</p>

To begin with, section 1, article V, of the Public Service Company Law' does not, as appellants at times seem to think, confer on the commission general authority to regulate public service companies; on the contrary, it states, in effect, that the commission shall have only the administrative powers and authority “provided in this act.” Next, when the legislation is read from beginning to end, there is no special authority granted the commission to make an order varying the terms of a consent-ordinance, like the one now before us, in the manner or to the extent here undertaken, and this power cannot be implied from any of the general provisions of the statute. There is no room to argue that the authority in question can be derived from the right of the commission to regulate service and facilities, since the terms “service” and “facilities” are particularly defined in art. I, sec. 1, of the act, and, without restating the definitions there found, we hold that the control over them (service and facilities) given by the statute does not comprehend such a power as here exercised. In contending to the contrary, appellants rely chiefly on the word “facilities,” but as this word is defined in and used throughout the act, it always means something either owned by or under the control of a public utility and actually employed in the service it renders the public; while the term “service” always refers to the service which such a corporation owes to its patrons, employees, and the public in the performance of its charter obligations. Until the law-making power directs otherwise, “the duty assumed [under a contract like the one before us, to keep a street in repair] is not to be evaded because the burden may reduce the income below a reasonable return on its investment;” that duty “must be complied with, no matter how onerous, unless stricken down by some proper legislative assertion of the police power” (Collingdale Boro v. Phila. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/274/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="274 Pa. 124" data-case-ids="1072915" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0124-01">274 Pa. 124</a>, 127), and no appropriate assertion of that power appears in the present case.</p>

In other words, the evil effects of not adhering to the rule, that the authority of all extrajudicial bodies must clearly appear, soon would reach beyond the confines of this controversy and might invade the whole field of public control. The only safe and proper roads for administrative bodies like the present commission to travel are those plainly marked by the acts of assembly defining their duties, and to these the courts must confine them, if the system represented by such commissions — to which our body politic seems committed — is to work out as intended by its creators, the legislature.</p>

The borough’s demand at this time would cost the company from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars immediately, with an annual maintenance charge of from two to five thousand dollars. When this agreement was written the traffic on the road was that of the normal vehicular (horse and wagon) traffic. To-day the road is traversed by heavy trucks, weighing from five to ten tons, and high powered automobiles, with little if any of the traffic that existed in 1900.

The legislature never intended the public service commission to be guardian over service companies, insure solvency, dividends, or prevent improvident acts of managers who act under a misconceived state of facts.

This intervention was built on the theory that the company had a paramount duty to the public that must not be frustrated. If such duty was interfered with by contracts that would ultimately destroy the company life, the good of the public would be to that extent injured. Included within this comprehensive purpose is, primarily, adequate service; then there are charter obligations, monopolistic and noncompetitive features, —the public have been taught to depend and rely for daily business and social intercourse on public service <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>instrumentalities, — and, lastly, discrimination; all of these matters, grouped under the general head of public good, force the state to declare that it will not permit rate contracts limiting the company’s right to adequate return to stand in the way of the general public good.</p>

In exercising the power given it by section 9 of article XVII of the Constitution, the city did so with section 3 of article XVI before it, giving it distinct notice that the police power of the commonwealth was, and would be, controlling. With this knowledge on the part of the municipality at the time it passed the ordinance, it is not now to be heard to complain that the State has struck down its contract or agreement with the street passenger railway company. The State has done nothing of the sort, but has merely enforced a condition written by the law into the ordinance at the time of its passage, that it would at all times be subject to the police power of the Commonwealth.”</p>

It never could have been intended, when the Constitution was framed and adopted, that the municipalities, creatures of the State, should have powers hamstringing it when it set out to exercise sovereignty. It was pointed out in the Scranton Case, that, in the prior case of Allegheny v. Millville, etc., St. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/159/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="159 Pa. 411" data-case-ids="850142" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0411-01">159 Pa. 411</a>, which held a street railway company cannot avail itself of consent given to it by a municipality to construct its railway, if it fails to perform the condition upon which the consent was given, that the question there “was solely between the City of Allegheny and the railway company; the Commonwealth was not a party to it.” In the case now before us, as in the Scranton Case, the Commonwealth acting through the agency created by it to speak in the public interest, the Public Service Commission, is the moving party in the litigation. Fares, facilities and service of public utilities are so intertwined that that which acts as a clog on one of them must affect the others. If a municipality cannot, in a consent-ordinance, fix the rate of fare, so as in the opinion of the State to interfere with <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>the “well-being of the State,” as we said it could not, and if the State, armed with the police power, can strike down a fare-fixing consent-ordinance, I fail to see why, in the exercise of the same power, the State may not strike down other conditions in such an ordinance, — the paving requirement in the one under consideration, — the effect of which is, to devote revenues of the company which should go to the reduction of fares, or the betterment of facilities or service, not to the advantage of the travel-ling public, but of those property owners who front the highway.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[249,951,1149,476]]]'>The fact, stressed in the majority opinion, that the Public Service Company Act grants no special authority to the commission to make an order varying the terms of a consent-ordinance such as the one in question, makes no difference, as I view the situation, if the exactions, loaded by the municipality, the State’s agent, on the company, are bound to be reflected in higher fares or lowered service, as the testimony establishes and the commission finds they will be.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[245,1437,1151,971]],["BL_517.1",517,[155,343,1151,1073]]]'>If the State’s police power is palsied by the municipal ordinance in the case in hand, it would be equally so, where such an ordinance, because of changed conditions and additional cost of paving, should deny the right of the utility to operate at all, because it could not meet the exaction and live. If the police power cannot relieve against such a situation for “the general well-being of the State” as determined by the agency created to guard and protect that general well-being and to declare the State’s public policy (Fogelsville etc. Co. v. Penna. etc. Co., <a href="/pa/271/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="271 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="295694" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0237-01">271 Pa. 237</a>), then the State’s police power is not supreme and one of its creations outmasters it in potency. In the Scranton Case, we expressly said “a municipality may not annex such terms to its consent as will deprive the Commonwealth of its inherent police power to see that a street passenger railway company is not prevented from serving the public by the municipality’s enforcement of conditions in a consenting ordinance that have <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>become impossible of performance......When such situation arises, as it has arisen and will arise again, there must be relief somewhere to the public, and it lies in the police power of the State, which is never to be abridged nor bartered away.” This forceful statement of principle by former Chief Justice Brown should in my opinion rule the case now before us. We are not dealing with a contract between the traction company and a private individual, such as for the purchase of cars or the like, which could not be abrogated because of the inhibition of the federal Constitution, but a contract made with an agent of the State, which certainly is within the State’s control when it exercises its sovereign police power. So viewing the important question submitted to us for decision, I would hold that the Public Service Commission has power to relieve the street railway company from the paving burdens placed upon it by the ordinance, and therefore, feel compelled to express my dissent from the conclusion of the majority of the court.</p>
