Without the consent of the court first obtained, defendant’s president, in the name of defendant, filed a cross-bill against appellant, praying for specific performance of a contract to deliver to appellee the total output of certain mines it operated. On hearing, the court below found defendant in default, <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>ordered partial performance, defendant to pay plaintiff $25,000, one-half to be paid by Lineaweaver, a stockholder and defendant’s president, and the other half, evidenced by a note, to be paid by defendant to plaintiff in one year.</p>

Defendant had both plaintiff and Lineaweaver as selling agents, and plaintiff and defendant each contributed $25,000, one-half the cost, to erect the “coal breaker.” It is the only plant or business with which defendant is connected. Charges of overreaching in plaintiff’s cost price for mining coal resulted in a serious dispute that reached the court for settlement. Some of these charges were eliminated, and the amount ordered paid was adjudged as the sum due plaintiff.

Lineaweaver, as defendant’s executive officer, being its president, claimed the right as such officer to file the cross-bill; but this could not be done under the decree appointing the receiver; as an officer, he had no rights, apart from those of the company, and its rights and effects were then in custody of the law.</p>

That its judgment was inaptly administered is not to be attributed to a desire on the part of the judge to exercise parental control over a purely business undertaking, but to a belief that the court was administering substantial justice, though abstractly, and in part at least to a belief that it was within the wishes of the parties; but in this the court was mistaken,</p>

It is generally confined to sales of real estate and chattels of a unique nature. There are exceptions to this rule, however, and illustrations may be found in the decisions of this court. Here we have a coal breaker erected on land owned and entirely surrounded by other land of plaintiff. It is built along the side of a mountain, where the coal is brought on a level, with the top at a height of ninety feet, and passes through various compartments to the bottom. The breaker is dependent on plaintiff’s mines to operate, as coal from other lands is not available. A way of necessity, even if obtainable to procure other coal, would be of no use from an economic point of view, as its cost would be prohibitive. It was placed in this position principally at plaintiff’s solicitation. Under this state of facts, the case would be squarely within the rule that where a peculiar and special reason exists, specific performance of a contract for sale of a chattel would be enforced.

The continuance of such conduct will shortly wrest the property from defendant and place it in plaintiff’s hands. But if this wrong was threatened, and the receivership created by plaintiff’s bill had not been in existence,' a stockholders’ bill might have been instituted by the Lineaweaver interests wherein these, circumstances could have been detailed, though the corporation itself was not insolvent. Because of these facts, and the dissension among the stockholders, its business could not be transacted except with serious loss. Indeed, equal ownership and disagreement would work the same end. The court should therefore appoint a disinterested party as receiver to conduct the affairs of the corporation. Favorable results might thus be brought about: Cowan v. Pa. Plate Glass Co., <a href="/pa/184/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="184 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="987928" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0001-01">184 Pa. 1</a>, 9. It is not to be expected the court would continue this condition indefinitely. It can very properly call the parties together and fix a reasonable time when the affairs of the corporation will be turned over to the stockholders for management. If it then transpires that the previous difficulties have not been eliminated, but would only be continued, and the company could not operate without loss, it will direct a sale of the property and distribution of the proceeds.</p>
