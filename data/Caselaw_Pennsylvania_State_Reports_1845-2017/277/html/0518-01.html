The surcharge of $9,087.60 covers losses on nonlegal securities, which were divided by the auditing judge into two groups. The first contains corporate bonds received by accountant, as trustee, from itself as executor, under the original schedule of distribution, at prices there named, and subsequently sold by it, at different times, ranging from ten to fifteen years after the date when such securities were taken over, at a total loss of $1,-967.60. The second group consists of certain securities, received by accountant, under the aforesaid original schedule, at considerable premiums, and which, instead of being sold, were carried by it, during periods of from five to twenty years, to their respective maturity dates, at losses aggregating $7,120. The other surcharge of $43,018.75 is made up of nonlegal securities purchased by the trustee; and which the auditing judge, in effect, ordered accountant to take over from the estate, at cost.</p>

Moreover, the will there involved particularly directed the fiduciary to so manage the estate “as to preserve and keep the same productive”; and, on adjudication of the second account, the auditing judge took the view that, in retaining the securities objected to, the trustee was endeavoring to carry out this direction, saying (p. 438), “under all the circumstances,” the fiduciary “was not bound to sell the investments of testator immediately after his death, but, as a trustee, had the right to exercise his best judgment and discretion [in that regard], and to do that which to him......seemed most advantageous and beneficial to the estate.” When the matter came to this court, it was stated (p. 448): “In determining not to convert immediately the stocks and other assets of the estate, which were investments made by the testator in his lifetime, the [trustee] acted in perfect good faith in the honest exercise of his best judgment, for a mistake in which [on the facts shown by the record] it would be wrong to hold him personally responsible.”</p>

The general rule, — in jurisdictions which, like Pennsylvania, limit the investment of trust funds, — is that ordinarily a fiduciary has no right to retain, beyond a reasonable period, investments made by the decedent in unauthorized securities, unless specially empowered so to do; that when a trustee continues to possess such nonlegal investments after a time when he could properly dispose of them, and a loss occurs, he may be held liable for a failure of due care, unless he shows that his retention of the securities in question represents, not a mere lack of attention, but the honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing conditions ; in other words, he is expected to be ordinarily watchful and to exercise normally good judgment.
