Decedent, the first to sign the paper, made a subscription of $100,000. The second subscription, that of Charles C. Harrison, was obtained at the same time and this was followed by others at various times from February 27, 1912, to February 19, 1915, the amount subscribed aggregating $305,000. Decedent paid during his lifetime, as requested by the treasurer, the following amounts: September 3, 1914, $20,000; February 6,1915, $20,000; April 29,1915, $20,000. He died September 20, 1916, there being at that time $40,000 of his subscription unpaid, which amount had not been called for by the treasurer. Subsequent to his death, a demand made for payment of the balance was refused by his executors, who claimed, in support of their refusal to pay, the subscription was not a binding legal obligation but merely a promise made without consideration and revoked by the death of the subscriber before actual payment. The court below declined t'o take this view of the law and directed a verdict for plaintiff for the full amount subscribed, with interest from the time demand for payment was made and refused. The executors appealed.</p>

For these reasons the treasurer delayed calling for the balance of the subscription. The proceeding mentioned being finally decided in favor of the University (<a href="/pa/251/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="251 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1019619" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0115-01">251 Pa. 115</a>) a notice calling for payment of the unpaid balance of subscriptions was sent each subscriber, which stated work on the building would be resumed at the earliest practicable time.</p>

This action on their part constituted a consideration which made the gift irrevocable and binding, not only upon the donors, but upon their representatives after their death (Board of Foreign Missions v.

This argument would be entitled to more weight if the legacies had been given for the same purpose the subscription was intended to accomplish, or if there were other circumstances indicating an intention on the part of testator to substitute the legacies for the balance due under his subscription. No such intention appears, however. True, the gift of $500,000 was for the benefit of the museum; the will, however, specified particularly the activities to which the income realized from the bequest should be applied. Nothing was said concerning the completion of the building, nor do we find any indication in the wording of the gift that testator had in mind the substitution of this fund or a part of it for his unpaid subscription for the erection of an additional building: Horner v. McGaughy, <a href="/pa/62/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="62 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1017265" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0189-01">62 Pa. 189</a>.</p>
    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[168,1967,1151,428]]]'>In holding the subscription to be a valid and binding contract and payable with interest from the date of demand, we deem it only fair to the executors to say their attitude in objecting to payment until t'he question should be passed upon by the courts is not one to be criticized but rather commended as a duty on behalf of those interested in the estate to see that funds of the estate were paid out only for proper purposes.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[215,2404,833,43]]]'>¡The decree of the court below is affirmed.</p>
