Subsequently, and before trial of the present suit, the first action of assumpsit was discontinued.</p>

Under this ruling, it obtained a <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>verdict, and from the judgment thereon these cross appeals were taken; both of them will be decided in this opinion.</p>

It is not necessary to decide how much of this proposed evidence would have been admissible if it had been offered in that case; the parties to the two controversies being the same, the conclusion there reached is res ad judicata, and cannot be reconsidered in the present suit because of facts which were, or might have been but were not, pleaded and proved in the previous one: Myers v. Kingston Coal Co., <a href="/pa/126/0582-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="126 Pa. 582" data-case-ids="968901" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0582-01">126 Pa. 582</a>; State Hospital for Criminal Insane v.

This is a matter of no moment, however, for defendant’s attempt to rescind by the letter of May 25, 1916, is pleaded in both cases; in each plaintiff alleges it “protested against such action on the part of the defendant and made demand upon defendant to honor its requisitions for the [monthly] delivery of said soda-ash;” and in it's affidavit of defense in the present case defendant avers “the cause of action set forth in [it] is the same cause of action for which” the prior suit was brought. It follows that even though the method for measuring the damages in the second suit may be different from that which would have applied to the first, this cannot result in depriving plaintiff of all damages, es<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>pecially where, as here, on defendant’s own showing, it is liable, as a matter of law, in exactly the way the trial judge ruled.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[303,517,1148,1075]]]'>Plaintiff’s first complaint is that although it did not give to the defendant, during any of the months prior to the cancellation of the contract, “at least 30 days’ notice,” before the beginning of the ensuing month, of its requirements for that month, yet as the latter, without objection, received the notices given, and made partial deliveries during each of those months, it cannot now be heard to allege it was not notified in time. The difficulty with this claim is that defendant was not required to object because the requisitions were sent too late, at no time actually accepted them as a compliance with the contract, and never fully honored any of them. Only a part of the quantity asked for was sent, and plaintiff did not complain of this until months afterward. Under such circumstances, it cannot be said that a mode of performance was established by the acts of the parties, by which this or any other requirement of the contract was waived; on the contrary, it only shows that defendant sent what it chose and plaintiff accepted what it could get.</p>
    <p id="b422-5" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[298,1604,1152,752]],["BL_423.1",423,[143,339,1148,92]]]'>Two other questions are suggested by plaintiff as to this phase of the case. (1) Was it necessary, in order to make the notices effective, that they should have been given at least thirty days before the beginning of the month to which they related? As admittedly defendant had the right to deliver at any time during the month, on the first day as well as on any suceeding one, it is clear the thirty days clause was properly applied to the first day of the month when delivery was to be made. (2) Is defendant precluded from objecting to the delay in giving the notices, because it did not so state in its letter of cancellation? The contract was not cancelled for these earlier months, however; during them it had already been fulfilled or was unfulfilled, and nothing but <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>an agreement, express or implied, could have affected that status.</p>
    <p id="b423-3" data-blocks='[["BL_423.4",423,[140,450,1162,1789]]]'>The final question raised is whether or not the court below erred in fixing the date of plaintiff’s first suit as the time when its damages should be measured? When, by its letter of May 25, 1916, defendant attempted to rescind the contract, plaintiff had the option of accepting or refusing to accept the tender thus made (Zuck v. McClure &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/98/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="98 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="496915" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0541-01">98 Pa. 541</a>; Barber Milling Co. v. Leichthammer Baking Co., <a href="/pa/273/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="273 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1070803" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0090-01">273 Pa. 90</a>), but could not do both. What it did was to bring that first suit, before the times fixed by the contract for the later deliveries, and in its statement of claim (after reciting the contract, and defendant’s failure to deliver the whole amount requisitioned during the months prior to the letter of May 25, 1916), averred that “by reason [thereof] plaintiff has and will sustain loss and damage in the sum of $150,000, being the difference......plaintiff has been and will be required to pay to secure [the soda-ash] upon the market.” It now says that thereby it only declared for the insufficient deliveries prior to cancellation; but if so why was this referred to, why was a gross sum claimed instead of the exact damages (which could then have been accurately measured), for the deficiencies during those earlier months, and why was the loss plaintiff <em>“will </em>sustain” and the amounts it <em>“will </em>be required to pay” to secure soda ash for the later months, referred to at all? No other answer is possible than that therein plaintiff sought to recover also, by way of an anticipatory breach, for the refusal to deliver during the months after cancellation, which effectually ended all right in defendant to deliver during that period, though the condition of the market might' have made it profitable to do so, and in plaintiff to demand delivery, no matter how great its needs might become.</p>
    <p id="b423-6" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[155,2245,1148,157]],["BL_424.1",424,[266,344,1152,846]]]'>Nor was there error in the manner of submitting this question to the jury. Plaintiff’s evidence was to the effect that, at the time of the breach, it could not have <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>made a contract for the balance of the term, but thereafter, from time to time, would have been compelled to purchase from jobbers the soda ash it needed, and hence claimed to recover the difference between the contract and market prices at the end of each particular month, producing testimony to enable this to be determined. Defendant’s evidence tended to show that, by the custom of this business, plaintiff could and should have made a contract with some manufacturer of soda ash for the quantity which was to have been delivered during the balance of the term; what it would have had to pay had it pursued this course; that some manufacturers would not sell to jobbers at all, and the rest only at greatly increased prices from those at which they would sell to users; and what was the market price at the end of each month.</p>

We see no error in this; parties are assumed to deal according to the customs of the business respecting which they are contracting (Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. Howell, <a href="/pa/274/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="274 Pa. 190" data-case-ids="1073020" data-case-paths="/pa/274/0190-01">274 Pa. 190</a>), and where it can be done, as here it could if defendant’s evidence is believed, it is “entitled to have damages assessed as at the date when a fresh contract might and ought to have been made” (Benjamin on Sales, 6th edition, 1106), for only in this manner can the damages be measured, as they must be, according to the lowest standard reasonably applicable: Arnold v. Blabon, <a href="/pa/147/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="147 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="829793" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0372-01">147 Pa. 372</a>; Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v.
