The affidavit of defense averred, as a matter of law, that plaintiff could not legally commence such an action; the court below sustained this contention and éntered judgment accordingly ; hence plaintiff appeals.</p>

L. 447, appellant “plants this right of action squarely and firmly” upon section 35 (b) of that statute, which provides as follows: “Executors or administrators shall have power to commence and prosecute ......all personal actions which the decedent whom they represent might have commenced and prosecuted, except actions for slander and libel.”</p>
    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[166,851,1149,807]]]'>Considering this section alone, without reference to the title of the act, it would be exceedingly difficult to reach any other conclusion than that contended for by appellant, for the present is a “personal action,” not for slander or libel, and, by the language quoted, “executors or administrators shall have power to commence and prosecute......[it, if] the decedent whom they represent, might have commenced and prosecuted” it, as unquestionably plaintiff’s decedent might have done. It is not necessary to decide this point, however, for, if so construed, the section offends against article III, section 3, of the Constitution of the State, which specifies that “No bill, except general appropriation bills, shall be passed containing more than one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title.”</p>

If, therefore, section 35 (b) is to be so construed as to authorize a new action by an executor or administrator, where such right did not theretofore exist, this fact is not “clearly, expressed in its title,” and hence the excess in the enactment would be unconstitutional. The conclusion thus reached is decisive of the present controversy, for appellant is claiming the right, under that section, to begin a new suit which, by prior laws, he would not have been permitted to do.</p>
    <p id="b236-5" data-blocks='[["BL_236.4",236,[258,1499,1149,466]]]'>This conclusion is in accord with the rule that statutes altering the common law are not to be extended beyond their obvious import (Diver v.
