        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nThe H. W. Walker Company, defendant, and its insurance carrier, appeal from a judgment of the court below affirming an award by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board to plaintiff, as the widow of William I. Hauger. There is no dispute in this court regarding the few controlling facts, and the only legal question is whether decedent was killed while \u201cin the regular course of the business\u201d of defendant.\nThe latter was a manufacturer of ice-cream and other dairy products, and had, as its factory foreman, one Marlin G. Miller, who, as appellants admit, \u201cwas charged with the duty of keeping the plant in operation,\u201d making \u201csuch small repairs as he could by himself, or, with the assistance of other men in the regular employ of the company, but when there was some major job of repairing to be done, he, as factory foreman, called in\u201d decedent, who was an expert machinist, to assist in doing this character of work, While engaged in the performance of his duty under such an employment, decedent was killed in plaintiff\u2019s place of business.\nSection 104 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1915, P. L. 736, provides that \u201cThe term \u2018employe\u2019 as used in this act is declared to be synonymous with servant, and includes all natural persons who perform services for another for a valuable consideration, exclusive of persons whose employment is casual in character and not in the regular course of the business of the employer,\u201d etc. It will be noticed that the last clause of this section is in form conjunctive, and hence inapplicable unless the employment is not only casual, as this was, but also \u201cnot in the regular course of the business of the employer.\u201d Defendant having made the repairing of its machinery a part of the \u201cregular course of [its] business,\u201d decedent was its employee by the very terms of this section, and plaintiff has the same right as the widow of any other employee who was killed or injured during the \u201cregular course of the business.\u201d\nThis conclusion is emphasized by section 203 of the Act (P. L. 738) which provides as follows: \u201cAn employer who permits the entry upon premises occupied by him or under his control, of a laborer or an assistant hired by an employee or contractor, for the performance upon such premises of a part of the employer\u2019s regular business entrusted to such employee or contractor, shall be liable to such laborer or assistant in the same manner and to the same extent as to his own employee.\u201d Under this also defendant became liable to plaintiff exactly as it would have been to the widow of Miller, had the latter been killed in doing this work, for defendant permitted the \u201centry upon [its] premises......of [decedent who was] an assistant hired by. ____[Miller] for the performance upon such premises of a part of the employer\u2019s regular business entrusted to\u201d Miller.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed.",

One who has been injured in the course of his employment will not be deprived of compensation merely because the employment was casual in its nature; in order that this result may follow it must also appear that he was not engaged in the regular course of business of the employer.\n2. Where the repair of machinery used in a business, is part of the work entrusted to a regular employee, such repairing is in the regular course of the employer\u2019s business within the meaning of sections 104 and 203 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736.\n3. Where a regular employee has the duty of repairing the machinery used by the employer in his business, and the former in turn employs a laborer or assistant to aid in making the repair, the latter is entitled to be compensated exactly as if he were a regular employee.\nArgued April 30, 1923.\nAppeal, No. 74, Oct. T., 1923, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Somerset Co., Dec. T., 1922, No. 472, affirming decision of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, in case of Elsie Pearl Hauger v. H. W.
