        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nThe Benton Township School District appeals from a judgment of the court below awarding a writ of peremptory mandamus, requiring it to furnish free transportation to relator\u2019s children, between the end of the private lane leading to his residence and the West Benton school, which they attend.\nThe facts in the case are not in dispute. Relator resides on a public road, about half a mile distant from a building, formerly occupied as the Franklin school; which is, in turn, one and nine-tenths miles from the West Benton school, where his children are pupils. The school district would not commence their transportation at the private lane leading to his home, but sent a hired wagon to convey them from the old Franklin school building to the West Benton school, and after school hours returned them to the former place. This the court below held was not proper, because section 1408 of the School Code, as amended by the Act of May 20, 1921, P. L. 1038, 1041, \u201crelied on, applies only to public or common carriers, not, as in this case, to service by a private carrier.\u201d Whether or not this conclusion is correct depends entirely on the proper construction of the proviso to that section, the whole of which is as follows:\n\u201cWhere, by the terms of this act, any distance is specified between the residence of any pupil and any public school to be attended by him, or any transportation is provided for within or beyond any particular distance, in computing such distance no allowance shall be made for the distance that the dwelling house of the pupil is situated off the public highway. All such distances shall be computed from the school building to which the pupil has been assigned, by the highway to the nearest point where a private way or private road connects the dwelling house of the pupil with said highway: Provided, That the free transportation of pupils, as required or authorized by this act, may be furnished by using electric railways, school conveyances or other public transportation, when the total distance which any pupil must travel between his residence and the school, in addition to such transportation, does not exceed one and one-half miles, and when stations or other proper shelters are provided for the use of such pupils where needed.\u201d\nThe contention below and here was and is that the words \u201cschool conveyances,\u201d being placed between \u201celectric railways\u201d and \u201cother public transportation,\u201d must necessarily be interpreted as relating only to conveyances of the same character as the others specified, that is \u201cpublic or common carriers\u201d; which the hired wagon provided by appellant was not. To this we cannot assent. The ejusdem generis argument, upon which this conclusion is attempted to be based, is inapplicable, not only because \u201cschool conveyances\u201d are not the general words in the sentence, these being \u201cother public transportation,\u201d but also because carriage by \u201cschool conveyances\u201d of this character are \u201cpublic transportation\u201d though their actual use, for the purpose stated, is limited to a part of the community only (Donohugh\u2019s App., 86 Pa. 306; Phila. v. Masonic Home of Penna., 160 Pa. 572); and because, further, \u201cschool conveyances,\u201d which were a well-known method of transportation before the passage of the act, were not and are not \u201ccommon carriers\u201d in any proper sense of the term. The latter may carry school children, but that alone would not make their cars \u201cschool conveyances\u201d; particular cars would have to be devoted to this use, before they would be so designated, and no one suggests there is any such requirement. Moreover, if the words \u201cschool conveyances\u201d were limited in meaning to \u201cpublic or common carriers,\u201d they would be surplusage, since \u201celectric railways......or other public transportation\u201d embraces everything in that class. The courts are not permitted, however, to so treat any words in a contract or statute, unless no other conclusion can reasonably be reached: Vulcanite Paving Co. v. Phila., 239 Pa. 524; Orth v. Board of Education, 272 Pa. 411.\nIt is clear to us that the \u201cfree transportation of pupils ......authorized by this Act,\u201d as referred to in the section under consideration, means that' specified in section 1404, by which \u201cThe board of school directors of any school district......may, out of the funds of the district, provide for the free transportation of any pupil to and from the public schools.\u201d Substantially similar language occurs in other sections, and nowhere does there appear any intention to limit the character of conveyance to those belonging to and used by \u201ccommon carriers\u201d; they may be any proper form of transportation'prescribed by the board, certainly, in the absence of a reasonably clear expression to the contrary, they may be by private carriers, which, as stated, was not uncommon prior to the act.\nSo far as appears, the old Franklin school building is a \u201cproper shelter\u201d within the meaning of the proviso quoted, and the hired wagon is not shown to be an inadequate vehicle for the carriage of the children; hence the school district performed its full duty when this was sent to carry relator\u2019s children between that \u201cshelter\u201d building and the West Benton school.\nA motion was made to quash the appeal, because appellant is in fact complying with the order of the court, and hence the question has become moot; but as the mandamus, which was granted, applies also to the future, and the school district may wish to return to its former practice, as herein approved so far as the existing law is concerned, it is clear that a challenge of the validity of a judgment which forbids this, cannot possibly raise only a moot question.\nThe motion to quash is dismissed, the judgment of the court below is reversed, and the writ of peremptory mandamus is set aside.",

Under section 1408 of the School Code, as amended by the Act of May 20, 1921, P. L; 1038, 1041, a school district may provide a private school conveyance to carry children to and from the school which they attend.\n2. If a private school conveyance is provided, it is sufficient if the children are carried between an appropriate shelter properly located, and the school they attend.\n3. The carriage of children by private school conveyances is public transportation, although they are used only by such children.\nContracts \u2014 Construction\u2014General words \u2014 Fjusdem generis\u2014 Surplusage.\n4. Tbe ejusdem generis doctrine applies only to tbe general words in a writing,, wbicb follow others specifically enumerated.\n5. In construing a contract or statute no words are to be treated as surplusage unless this is necessary in order to reach a reasonable conclusion as to its meaning.\nAppeals \u2014 Moot question \u2014 Future conduct of litigant.\n6. An order or decree which relates to the future conduct of a litigant cannot be held to raise only a moot question, because, pending the appeal, the defendant is complying with it.\nArgued February 20, 1923.\nAppeal, No. 251, Jan.
