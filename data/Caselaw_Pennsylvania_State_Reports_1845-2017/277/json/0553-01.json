L. 429, as amended by the Act of July 11,1917, P. L. 755. Notwithstanding the ingenious argument of Mr. Rumsey [counsel for claimant],......to award the widow the $5,000 would be in direct violation of the act of assembly, which provides that the allowance shall not apply to cases where the surviving spouse shall elect to take against the will of the deceased spouse: Mitchell\u2019s Est., 79 Pa.
