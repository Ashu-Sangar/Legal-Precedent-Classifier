        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nUpon a distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate, the court below decreed a portion of it to two mechanic\u2019s lien claimants, and the rest to a mortgagee ; the latter appeals because the whole amount was not awarded to it.\nAs authorized by the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 357, the sheriff made a special return regarding the price realized at the sale, advising that \u201caccording to the list of liens on the property sold as certified to [him] by the proper officers [the fund should be distributed conform-ably to] a schedule attached and made a part\u201d of his return. Appellant filed exceptions to this; an auditor was appointed, and the appointment vacated; whereupon all the parties in interest agreed that evidence should be taken before two ladies as commissioners, and thereafter \u201ca decree of distribution [should be] made by the court, without the intervention of an auditor, notwithstanding the proceeds of sale have not been paid into court.\u201d\nThe evidence was taken in the manner specified; on its being filed the parties presented to the court requests for findings of fact and conclusions of law, some of which were sustained and others dismissed; the rights of the litigants were discussed in an opinion, and distribution reported according to a schedule attached. To this also exceptions were filed, these were dismissed, a decree entered as suggested, and a bill of exceptions, \u201cto the entry of the decree\u201d only, was thereupon sealed at the request of the mortgagee appellant.\nIt will be noticed that the agreement of the parties, under which the proceedings were conducted, did not reserve the right of appeal from the decree to be entered; the effect of this was, therefore, to make the court below the final arbiter of the questions raised: Fuller v. Trevoir, 8 S. & R. 529; Hughes v. Peaslee, 50 Pa. 257; Com. v. Callahan, 153 Pa. 625; Pinkney v. Erie R. R. Co., 266 Pa. 566. It is said in the first of these cases, \u201cIf the parties think proper to submit their case to the opinion of the court of common pleas, they must be bound by its decision, unless it be agreed that it shall be subject to a writ of error\u201d; in the second, \u201cWhere a case was submitted by agreement to the president judge for decision upon the \u2018depositions and admitted facts,' which on writ of error were not certified [this being the situation in the instant case also], the court of error will not take notice of them, especially where the submission did not' stipulate for a writ of error to either party\u201d; and in Kline v. Guthart, 2 P. & W. 490: \u201cIt furnishes no objection to this conclusion that it prevents a decision of the law by the court in the last resort. Arbitrators are judges chosen by the parties, who resort to this species of tribunal voluntarily.\u201d\nIt follows that the appeal must be quashed; but since none of the litigants seem to have contemplated this as the effect of their agreement, we will now state, \u2014 without elaboration and as briefly as we can, \u2014 the reasons why the decree of the court below would have been sustained, if the right of appeal had been reserved.\n(1) The lien of the mechanics\u2019 claims took \u201ceffect as of the date [in June, 1918] of the visible commencement upon the ground of the work of building the structure\u201d: Section 13, Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, 437. The lien of appellant\u2019s mortgage took effect \u201caccording to the date of recording,\u201d on September 25, 1918: Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 631. Hence, the mechanics\u2019 liens, if valid, have the first claim on the fund.\n(2) The objection to the \u201clumped items\u201d in them is of no avail, because the claimants were not subcontractors, but did their work under contracts with the owners or their agent: Russell v. Bell, 44 Pa. 47; Murphy v. Bear, 240 Pa. 448. Nor does it make any difference that the contest is now between appellant and the lien claimants, for the statute deals only with the rights of owners, architects, contractors and subcontractors, and does not require a lien to give any information to subsequent encumbrancers.\n(3) The objection that \u201cseveral of the other items [in the liens] fail to designate the kind and amount of materials furnished,\u201d fails, because an examination of the bills of particulars attached to the claims, shows the items are sufficiently specific, being easily understood by those haying knowledge of the character of work done by the particular claimants.\n(4) The objection that the liens \u201cfail to state the date of the visible commencement of the work upon the ground,\u201d is answered by the statement that no statute requires this. If it is meant to suggest that this fact must appear in order to give priority of claim over the mortgage, it is sufficient to say the date may be proved by parol, where, on distribution, the dispute arises solely between claims which have been discharged by the sale: Reading v. Hopson, 90 Pa. 494.\n(5) The objection to the liens that \u201cthe ground described embraces more than the curtilage of the liened buildings,\u201d cannot prevail since, quoad the liens, section 23 of the Act of 1901, supra, furnishes the only method provided for objecting to the curtilage included, and of having it properly specified.\n(6) It is a matter of indifference that the mechanics\u2019 \u201cclaims as filed name as real owners the parties who were merely trustees of the church, and who held apparently nothing but the legal title to the real estate,\u201d whereas, by the sale on the bond accompanying the mortgage, the proceeds realized represented \u201cthe beneficial as well as the legal title, [and there was] no evidence of what portion of the fund, received from the sheriff\u2019s sale, arose from the naked legal title itself.\u201d It is sufficient to say in regard to this contention, \u2014 if it is necessary to say anything on the point, \u2014 that the unincorporated church congregation, which was the equitable owner of the property, knew the church and parsonage were being built, and, at a congregational meeting, held upon the property itself, expressly authorized the trustees to proceed with the work, thereby ratifying their action, and subjecting both the equitable and legal titles to these liens: Section 4, Act of 1901, supra.\n(7) The mistake of the prothonotary in his manner of indexing the liens, cannot avail appellant, since its mortgage was executed and recorded, and the money paid, long before the liens were filed; and hence it could not have been benefited by the constructive notice, which was the only purpose of the indexing.\n(8) The contention that the liens were bad, because of section 2 of the Act of 1901, supra, which provides that \u201cno lien shall be allowed......against any property held by the committee of a lunatic, the guardian of a minor, or a trustee under deed, will or appointment by the court, unless by virtue of a contract made under authority of the court, or of the power contained in the deed or will,\u201d is of no avail, because the section quoted has no relation to dry trusts (see Cannevin v. Gallagher, 62 Pitts. L. J. 559, 560); in these cases, the equitable owners, if sui juris, may consent to that which is done, and no one else has a right to control their action in this regard. The section is intended to prevent the interests of third parties, ultimately entitled to a property, from being subjected, by the person in possession, to lien and sale, except upon authority set forth in the deed or will, or by consent of the court. In Savoy v. Jones, 2 Rawle 343; Bickel v. James, 7 Watts 9; Holdship v. Abercrombie, 9 Watts 52, and O\u2019Conner v. Warner, 4 W. & S. 223, the titles in remainder were divested by sales, under liens resulting from contracts made by life tenants and tenants for years, because at those dates no statute forbade it.\n(9) Finally the obj ection that the liens were not properly established must also fail, since one, as supplemented by the agreement of counsel, was fully proved, and the assignments of error do not specifically raise this question as to the other.\nThe appeal is quashed.",

Where the parties to a litigation agree to submit its determination to a court or other tribunal, no appeal can be taken from its judgment or decree unless the right thereto is reserved; under such circumstances it will be quashed if taken when the right to it was not reserved in the agreement.\nMechanics\u2019 liens \u2014 Time\u2014Commencement of work \u2014 Sale of lien \u2014Act of June 4, 1901, section 18, P. L. 481.\n2. Under section 13 of the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, 437, a mechanic\u2019s lien takes effect as of the date of the visible commencement on the ground of the work of building the structure or other improvement.\nMortgage \u2014 Time\u2014Date of lien \u2014 Act of May 28,1915, P. L. 681.\n3. Under the Act of May 28, 1915, P. L. 631, the lien of a mortgage takes effect as of the date it is recorded.\nMechanics\u2019 liens \u2014 Items\u2014Subsequent encumbrances \u2014 Mortgage.\n4. Where a mechanic\u2019s lien claimant does his work under a contract made with the owner or his agent, it is not necessary to particularize the items making up the contract price, and this is so even as against a mortgagee of the property; the statute deals only with the right of owners, architects, contractors and subcontractors, and does not require a lien to give any information to subsequent encumbrancers.\n5. Items specified in a mechanic\u2019s claim, or bill of particulars attached to it, are sufficiently specific if they can be readily understood by those having knowledge of the character of work done by the particular claimant.\n6. It is not necessary to state in a mechanic\u2019s claim the date of the visible commencement of the work upon the ground; this may be proved by parol, whenever necessary so to do in order to determine the rights of claimants, whose liens have been discharged by the sheriff\u2019s sale.\nMechanic\u2019s lien \u2014 Curtilage\u2014Objection to curtilage \u2014 Act of June 4, 1901, section %8, P. L. 481.\n7. Section 23 of the Mechanic\u2019s Lien Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, 442, furnishes the only method by which one who objects to the curtilage, specified in a claim, can have determined what should have been included in it.\nMechanic\u2019s lien \u2014 Authority to work \u2014 Trusts and trustees \u2014 Dry trust \u2014 Act of June 4, 1901, section %, P. L. 4SI.\n8. Section 2 of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, 432, does not apply to the case of a dry trust. If work is done under authority of the trustee and cestuis que trust, a lien may be filed for it, though by the deed the trustee was given no authority to build.\nMechanic\u2019s lien \u2014 Indexing\u2014Mistake\u2014Mortgage.\n9. A mistake in indexing a mechanic\u2019s claim will not defeat its lien in favor of a mortgagee, if his mortgage was executed, recorded and the money paid before the lien was filed.\nAppeals \u2014 Assignments of error \u2014 Errors not specified.\n10. An appellate court will not consider alleged errors not specified in the assignments of error.\nArgued March 6, 1923.\nAppeal, No. 290, Jan. T., 1923, by plaintiff, from order of C. P.
