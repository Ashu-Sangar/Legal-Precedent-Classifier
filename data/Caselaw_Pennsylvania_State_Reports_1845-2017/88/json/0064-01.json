        "text": "Mr. Justice Mercur\ndelivered the opinion of the court, January 6th 1879.\nThis controversy is as to the sufficiency of the acknowledgment of the plaintiffs in error to bind the estate of the wife.\nThe certificate of acknowledgment before a notary public, after stating that George II. Hornbeck and Margaret J., his wife, personally appeared before him and acknowledged the indenture of mortgage to be their act and deed, and desired the same might be recorded as such, proceeded to declare \u201c she, the said Margaret J., being , of full age, and by me examined separately and apart from her said husband, and the contents of said indenture being first made fully to her, declared that she did, of her own free will and accord, sign and seal, and as her act and deed deliver the same, without any coercion or compulsion of her said husband.\u201d\nThree rules, applicable to the certificate of the acknowledgment of a deed or mortgage, are deducible from the authorities. 1. It is a judicial act, and in the absence of fraud or duress, is conclusive of the facts therein certified: Jamison v. Jamison, 3 Whart. 457 ; Hall v. Patterson, 1 P. F. Smith 289; McCandless v. Engle, Id. 309; Heeter v. Glasgow, 29 Id. 79; Miller v. Wentworth, 1 Norris 280; Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Rook et ux., 3 Id. 442. 2. The certificate may be impeached by proof of fraud or duress in the acknowledgment, except as against a good-faith purchaser without notice: Schrader v. Decker, 9 Barr 14; Loudon v. Blythe, 4 Harris 532; s. c. 3 Casey 22; Michener et ux. v. Cavender, 2 Wright 334; Heeter v. Glasgow, supra; Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Rook, supra. 3. A substantial compliance with the form of certificate prescribed by the Act of Assembly is sufficient: McIntire v. Ward, 5 Binn. 296; Shaller v. Brand, 6 Id. 438; Jamison v. Jamison, supra; Miller v. Wentworth, supra.\nThis case comes before us without any element of fraud or duress. No equities of third persons have intervened. The sufficiency of the form of the certificate is the only matter which we need consider.\nThe Act of Assembly, inter alia, directs the officer taking the acknowledgment, to \u201cread or otherwise make known the full contents of such deed or conveyance to the said wife.\u201d On the part of the plaintiff in error it is contended that this portion of the statute has not been complied with in the present case; the language of the certificate being \u201c the contents of said indenture being first made fully to her.\u201d\nThe omission of some of the words specified in the act, and the substitution in the certificate of other words carrying a similar meaning, have been held to be a substantial compliance with the act. Thus the act requires the wife to declare that she did \u201c seal and as her act and deed deliver;\u201d yet in Jamison v. Jamison, supra, it was held that a declaration in the certificate that she did \u201c seal and acknowledge\u201d was sufficient. So the statute requires her to declare that she executed it \u201cwithout any coercion or compulsion of her said husband;\u201d yet it was held that \u201cvoluntarily consenting thereto,\u201d in lieu of the statutory words, was a substantial compliance therewith : Shaller v. Brand, supra.\nThe certificate in the present case states the separate examination of the wife, and that she declared she signed, sealed and delivered the same without any coercion or compulsion of her said husband. To be valid as against her, it must also state, substantially, that the contents were made known to her. Does it do this ? \u201c The contents of said indenture being first made fully to her.\u201d We should so construe these words as to give some effect to them, rather than discard them as void of all meaning. It certainly was not a violent presumption to infer that the word \u201cknown\u201d was inadvertently omitted after \u201cfully,\u201d which the learned judge appears to have done. To rebut such presumption he admitted parol evidence to show that the contents were not made known to her, and that she did not know them. The correctness of this ruling is not now before us, and we indicate no opinion thereon. We prefer to sustain the certificate by giving full effect to the meaning of the language used, without the addition of a single word. The contents being \u201cmade fully\u201d to \"her, is equivalent to saying they were \u201cfully made\u201d to her.\nTo say they were fully made to her, clearly implies they were communicated to her. If communicated, they were made known to her. If the certificate stated that the contents were \u201c fully communicated to her,\u201d it would have removed all cavil as to their import. The words used are substantially of the same signification, and tantamount thereto. The language of the certificate is a substantial compliance with the requirements of the act, and the judgment is Affirmed.",

J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson and Trunkey, JJ. Woodward, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 2, of Allegheny county : Of October and November Term 1878, No. 131.\nScire facias sur mortgage, given by G. H. Hornbeck and wife to tne Mutual Building and Loan Association of Elizabeth.\nHornbeck and wife executed and delivered a mortgage on the property of Mrs. Hornbeck to secure the payment by her husband to said association, of $2000 in weekly instalments, dues on ten shares of the capital stock of the association, and such fines as might be imposed thereon. Suit was subsequently brought on the mortgage. The acknowledgment of the mortgage was taken by a notary. The certificate did not set forth that the contents were made \u201cknown\u201d to Mrs. Hornbeck, the word known being omitted therefrom, and at the trial, when the mortgage was offered in evidence, it was objected to for that reason. The court, White, J., however, overruled the objection and allowed the mortgage in evidence, which was among the errors assigned by Hornbeck and wife, who took this writ.\nJ. W. Over, for plaintiffs in error.\nThe Act of February 24th 1870, in relation to acknowledgments by married women, requires that the magistrate shall read or otherwise make known the full contents of a deed when acknowledged. The omission of the word known in this acknowledgment vitiated it: Barnet v. Barnet, 15 S. & R. 72; Graham v. Long, 15 P. F. Smith 383.\nM. W. Aeheson and John H. Kerr, for defendants in error.\u2014\nIt is not essential that the words of the act should be used by the magistrate; it is sufficient if its directions are substantially complied with; and therefore, if it appears from the whole certificate that the contents of the deed were known to the wife, it is as effectual as if the magistrate had certified that he read or otherwise made them known to her: McIntire v. Ward, 5 Binn. 296 ; Jamison v. Jamison, 3 Whart. 457."
