    "head_matter": "Livingston\u2019s Appeal.\nThe judge of a separate Orphans\u2019 Court has no power to hold the Orphans\u2019 Court of a county, in which a judge of the Court of Common Pleas presides by virtue of his commission. The Act of March4th 3875, does not apply to such a case, and has relation only to the judges of the separate Orphans\u2019 Court.\nNovember 22d 1878.\nBefore Agnew, O. J., Sharswood, Mercu-r, Gordon, Paxson and Trunkey, JJ. Woodward, J., absent.\nAppeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court of Washington county: Of October and November Term 1878, No. 330.\nThis case was as follows: Exceptions were filed in the court below to the account of Samuel Livingston, executor of Thomas Livingston, deceased, which exceptions were referred to an auditor for report.\nExceptions were filed to the auditor\u2019s report, and Hon. Geo. L. Ilart, president judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington county, called in the Hon. W. G. Hawkins, president judge of the separate Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, to hear and determine the questions involved. His honor, Judge Hawkins, after a hearing, filed an opinion and made a decree \u201cthat the proceedings in said matter be vacated and set aside from which decree Samuel Livingston took this appeal.\nWashington county is a separate judicial district, but has no separate Orphans\u2019 Court, the judge of the Court of Common.Pleas being judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court by the Act of May 19th 1874, Pamph. L. 206, sect. 2, Purd. Dig. 1933, sect. 2.\nThe Act of April 14th 1834, Purd. Dig. 230, 231, authorizes the holding of special Common Pleas courts in any county by calling in the president judge who may reside nearest for the trial of those cases wherein the president judge of the court in which the suit is brought is incapacitated for trying through interest in the cause; where title in dispute is claimed through him ; through kindred to the parties; or through having been concerned as coun-' sel. By the Act of April 4tli 1843, Purd. Dig. 1105, sect. 14, the provisions of the Act of 1834 were extended to the Orphans\u2019 Court, Register\u2019s Court, Quarter Sessions and Oyer and Terminer.\nThe Act of March 4th 1875, Purd. Dig. 2050, Pamph. L. 5, sect. 1, provides that \u201cwhenever, by reason of sickness, absence, interest or other cause, a judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in any judicial district in this Commonwealth, may be unable to sit in any matter depending in such court, it shall be lawful for him to call upon any other Orphans\u2019 Court judge, or judge of-any other Court of Common Pleas in this Commonwealth, to preside in and determine such matter, with the same force and effect as though he, the regularly commissioned judge of such district, if presiding, might do.\u201d \u2022 ; \u25a0\nThe question of jurisdiction was not raised in the court below, and no allusion was made to it in the paper-books furnished the Supreme Court. In the argument, however, a question as to the power of Judge Hawkins was suggested, as will appear in the following brief thereof. A like opinion was filed and judgment entered in Jane Neill\u2019s Appeal, which came up from Washington county at the same term, and in which Judge Hawkins had presided and made the decree. The same counsel were engaged in both causes.\nD. S. Wilson and Dougan Todd, for appellant.\n[Justice Pax'son. \u2014 Is there any act but that of 1875 by which it is claimed that Judge Hawkins had a right to hold this court ?]\nMr. Dougan. \u2014 No, Sir.\n[Justice Sharswood. \u2014 Under this act, a Common Pleas judge could only act in the stead of another Common Pleas judge, and an Orphans\u2019 Court judge only in the place of another Orphans\u2019 Court judge.]\nMr. Wilson. \u2014 We go further, and contend that no Allegheny county judge could hold Orphans\u2019 Court, because they are not Common Pleas judges with Orphans\u2019 Court jurisdiction.\n[Chief Justice Agnew. \u2014 Washington county has not a separate Orphans\u2019 Court?]\nMr. Wilson: \u2014 No, sir. We called in Judge Hawkins to hold our court for us in the absence of the regular judge.\n[Ohi\u00e9f Justice Agnew. \u2014 I understand that. I am looking at the power of Judge Hawkins. He has no power to hold the Common Pleas Court, and yet the Orphans\u2019 Court in your county must be held by a Common Pleas judge.]\nMr. Wilson. \u2014 We thought he had jurisdiction and every requisite power to hold the court.\n[Justice Sharswood, \u2014 You could not give *him jurisdiction. The Act of Assembly reads so as to apply only to Common Pleas judges.\nChief Justice Agnew.- \u2014 Well, we will take the case, and leave the argument as it stands, reserving the question of jurisdiction. Let us understand the case as if the court had jurisdiction.]\nBraden $\u25a0 Miller and Freeman Brady, Jr., for appellees.\nSee Commonwealth ex rel. Chase v. Harding et al., 6 Norris 343, as to this question of jurisdiction.- \u2014 Rep."
