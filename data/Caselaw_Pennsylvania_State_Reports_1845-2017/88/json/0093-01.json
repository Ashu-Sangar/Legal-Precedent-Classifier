It did not belong to or further the business of J. H. Smith, but was simply leased to his wife, at a rental, for her private benefit. The fact that the Act of Assembly of 13th May 1876 was passed to exempt pianos, melodeons and organs from levy and sale in such a case, is a legislative interpretation of the law as it stood before. We see no error.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Kleber et al. versus Ward et al.\n1. The property of a stranger found on demised premises, left for no purpose of trade or other purpose requiring protection, as a matter of public policy, is liable to distress for rent.\n2. Prior to the Act of May 13th 1876, a piano leased to a tenant\u2019s wife for her private use, was liable to such distress for rent.\nOctober 9th 1878.\nBefore Agnew, C. J., Sharswood, Mercur, Gordon, Paxson, Woodward and Trunkey, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, of Allegheny county: Of October and November Term 1878, No. 107.\nReplevin by Kleber & Bro., against William Ward and another, for a piano, distrained by defendants for rent due by J. II. Smith.\nAt the trial it appeared that the plaintiffs rented,\" the piano to the wife of Smith for her private use, with the privilege of purchasing at a certain price, in which case the payments of rent were to be credited on account.\nThe distress was levied before the passage of the Act of May 18th 1876, exempting pianos, &c. (See McGeary v. Miller, 6 Norris 461.)\nThe defendants submitted the following point, which the court, Bailey, J., affirmed: \u201cThat if the property in dispute was found upon the demised premises, it was liable to distress for rent; and that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover even if they owned it and had rented it to Mrs. Smith, as claimed.\u201d\nThe verdict was for defendants, when plaintiffs took this writ, and, inter alia, assigned for error the answer to the above point.\nA. M. Brown, for plaintiffs in error.\nThe bailment to Mrs. Smith was a reasonable, customary and legal business transaction, clearly consistent with public policy, and in the interest of trade and business, and the property, both on principle and authority, was exempt from distress for rent: Brown et al. v. Sims et al., 17 S. & R. 138; Briggs et al. v. Large, 6 Casey 287; Riddle v. Weldon, 5 Whart. 9; Karns et al. v. McKinney, 24 P. F. Smith 387 ; Cadwalader v. Tindall, 8 Harris 422.\nBruee JSTegley, for defendants in error.\nThe property in controversy, was, with other furniture, distrained on the demised premises, a dwelling-house, and if the law was as contended for by the plaintiffs in error, a tenant, by leasing or borrowing all his furniture, might defeat the landlord\u2019s right of distress. The property was not received in the course of business as a means of making a livelihood, and does not come within the exceptions of the common-law rule: Price v. McCallister, 3 Grant 248 ; Cadwalader v. Tindall, supra."
