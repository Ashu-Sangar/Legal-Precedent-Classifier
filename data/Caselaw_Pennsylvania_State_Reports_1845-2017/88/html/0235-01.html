He was not made competent by the Act of April 15th 1869, because being a person interested in the event of the suit, he was within the exception to that act, the action being against an executor. He was interested because he confessedly owed the whole debt, and if the plaintiff failed, all could be recovered of him.

F. Smith 180; Scheetz <em>v. </em>Hanbest’s Ex’rs, 31 Id. 100; Pratt <em>v. </em>Patterson, Id. 114. The witness Martin II. Philip would have been incompetent under the law as it stood prior to 1869. He might not have been incompetent for all purposes upon the mere ground of his being a partner. He was called, however, for the purpose of showing the partnership. The effect of his evidence, if received, would be to shift a portion of his responsibility upon some one else. He wTas thus directly interested, and for that reason incompetent under the authority of Bellas <em>v. </em>Fagely, 7 Harris 277; Purviance <em>v. </em>Dryden, 3 S. &amp; <em>R. </em>402; Heckert <em>v. </em>Fegely, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20142" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 142">6 W. &amp; S. 142</a>; Meason <em>v. </em>Kaine, 13 P. F. Smith 335. The case of Brewster’s Adm’x <em>v. </em>Sterrett, 8 Casey 115, was relied upon by the defendant in error as sustaining the opposite view. A careful examination of this case, however, shows that it is not seriously in conflict with the authorities above cited. It is true, Mr. Justice Woodward, in the concluding paragraph of his opinion, does say that the witness Mehaffey would be competent for whatever purpose called. He was not called to prove the partnership, and it is quite possible this point did not even suggest itself to the mind of the learned justice who wrote the opinion. There is nothing in the report of the case to indicate that it did. The testimony of Mehaffey was not furnished in the paper-books. <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>Justice Woodward supposed that the witness had been called to sustain an issue that had been withheld from the jury, which of course was not' an essential error.</p>
