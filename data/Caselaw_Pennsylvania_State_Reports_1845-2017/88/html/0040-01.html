By her will she directed all her real estate, which consisted alone of that devised to her by her father, to be sold by her executor, and the proceeds to be paid to certain of her children and grandchildren whom she designated by name. The question was whether this direction to sell was a valid execution of the power contained in her father’s will, and the court below, Ewing, P. J., being of the opinion that it was not, entered <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>judgment for the plaintiff for an undivided one-ninth part of the land in controversy, from which judgment this writ was taken.</p>

In England a power to appoint land in fee may be well executed by a devise to trustees to sell, and an appointment of the proceeds among the objects of the power : Kenworthy <em>v. </em>Bate, 6 Ves. 793; Bullock <em>v. </em>Fladgate, 1 Ves. &amp; B. 471; Fowler <em>v. </em>Cohn, 21 Beav. 360. If, however, she exceeded her power in directing the land to be sold and the proceeds divided, we contend that the power was well executed by the naming the children, and that each child would take an interest in the land equal to that which it would have received from the fund had the land been sold: 2 Wash. on Real Property 620, 621; 2 Sudg. on Powers 62, 75, 85, 93; Alexander <em>v. </em>Alexander, 2 Ves.

If there was an excess of power in regard to the grandchildren, then the shares given to them would have to be divided among all her children, or among all those named in the will, according to their respective interests.</p>

His children took his share as his heirs. But as there were eleven children, including Henry, the judgment must be modified to give the plaintiff one-eleventh instead of one-ninth.
