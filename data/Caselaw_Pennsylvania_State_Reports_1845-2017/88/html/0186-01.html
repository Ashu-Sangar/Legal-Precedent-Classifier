J., it appeared that on the 14th day of June 1870, John K. Ewing sold and conveyed to David M. Torrence, the surface of a tract of land situate in Tyrone township, Fayette county, containing ninety-eight acres j for $7000. Prior to this, in 1867, Ewing had sold the coal underlying this surface to William H. Brown, deceased, one of whose administrators is plaintiff in error. Before the sale by Ewing to Torrence, William H. Brown had erected coke-ovens on a portion of the surface sold from the original tract of which the Torrence purchase was a part, and was engaged in the manufacture of coke at the time of the sale by Ewing to Torrence, using coal from under the Torrence surface. On the 14th day of June 1870, David M. Torrence conveyed to John M. Cochran five acres and fifty-eight perches, from the western pai’t of his land, for the purpose, as the plaintiff in error alleged, of erecting coke-ovens thereon to be used in the manufacture of coke. For this he received $200 per acre. These five acres and fifty-eight perches John M. Cochran subsequently conveyed to Brown &amp; Cochran, a <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>firm of which the said William H. Brown was a member. Between two and three hundred coke-ovens were erected by Brown &amp; Cochran on these five acres, in 1871 and 1872, and they have since been almost continually used in the manufacture of coke. The first-mentioned ovens and improvement are known as Sterling Mines, the latter as the Jimtown Works.</p>

This was several years before the establishment of the colliery from which the water came that polluted Meadow brook. In the language of the opinion in this case, is not the one at bar exceptional in its surroundings and facts ? From necessity, must not the principles of that case be relaxed ? In our case the coal was sold out before Torrence purchased, to be mined. To mine it, was to discharge the sulphur-water held by the coal; if the right to discharge it was an incident to the grant, the natural flow of it after it left the pit’s-mouth could work no injury making Brown &amp; Cochran answerable in damages.</p>
