There was due him, for services or wages as brakeman, the sum of $4fi for the month of September. Prior to pay-day the wages due Bolton were attached at the suit of I). Patton <em>v. </em>John Bolton, in Ashtabula county, Ohi.o, and the Pennsylvania Company, also a corporation in the state of Ohio, were summoned as garnishees in the said attachment. Judgment was duly obtained, under the laws of Ohio, against Bolton, defendant, and the Pennsylvania Company garnishees, and the amount due Bolton paid by the company in pursuance of said judgment. After the judgment obtained in Ohio, Bolton brought suit before a justice of the peace, in Mercer county, to recover the amount due for wages for the month of September 1876, which had been attached and paid as before stated, and obtained a judgment for the full amount due him for said month. The company took an appeal from said judgment to the Common Pleas of Mercer county. The plaintiff filed his copy of claim, and entered a rule on defendant to file an affidavit of defence, to which rule the defendant answered by affidavit, wherein it was averred “that judgment was entered against the garnishees, a corporation under the laws of Ohio, duly incorporated therein, as well as of Pennsylvania, on the 1st day of December 1876.

    <p id="b261-7" data-blocks='[["BL_261.9",261,[178,1129,1169,939]]]'>The main question in this case was solemnly decided by this court in Morgan <em>v. </em>Neville, 24 P. F. Smith 52, that wages of labor earned and due to a citizen of this state may be attached for a debt in another state where no law exists prohibiting the attachment of'wages of labor. We are now asked by the counsel of the defendant in error to review and overrule that case. We see no reason for doing so. The non-attachability of wages of labor for debt no more enters into the contract than does the exemption from execution of certain articles or a certain amount. The laws for process of attachment and execution are part of the remedy, governed entirely by the <em>lex fori. </em>It is said, however, that the affidavit of defence did not allege notice by the garnishee to the defendant in the attachment. But the sole object of such notice is to enable the defendant to take defence against the plaintiff in the attachment. When, therefore, the defendant comes to sue the garnishee, if the attachment is pleaded in bar, he may reply that he was not indebted to the plaintiff, to which the garnishee may answer that he gave notice. The only effect of not giving notice is that the garnishee takes upon himself the risk of its appearing that his creditor had a just defence to the claim. It was not necessary that the affidavit of defence should anticipate such defence by averring notice.</p>
