Moore, the holder of ten shares of stock in the plaintiff company, made a proposition to defendant to trade said stock for an equal amount in value which defendant owned in the Central Refining Company of Pittsburgh. This the defendant agreed to do, provided the plaintiff company would apply the Moore stock towards the payment of his said note, at its par value, amounting in all to §1000 (each share of the stock being of the par value of §100), and accordingly, before closing the transaction, the defendant went to the plaintiff bank to make inquiry on the subject. He there saw W. A. Reed, the president and treasurer of the company, and told him of the negotiation, and thereupon Reed agreed that if defendant would trade for the stock, it should be received as a credit on the note at par. The trade was then accordingly consummated, and defendant, at the same timé, obtained from Moore an order for the transfer of the stock, under the arrangement agreed upon, a copy of which order was as follows:—</p>

He proposed, however, that defendant should waive protest of the note, promising to see Mr. Reed about it. The defendant accordingly waived the protest, and afterwards visited the bank on several occasions to close up the 'transaction, and in course of a few weeks, Mr. Ray stated to defendant that he had received orders to accept defendant’s check for the balance and deliver him the note. The defendant thereupon, in compliance with Mr. Ray’s request, returned to his office and made out his check for §250 (being the full balance of the note after deducting the value of the stock), <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>which he sent over to the bank by Thomas S.

The agreement, therefore, if made by Reed, to take the stock in payment of the note, would not bind his co-partners, unless sanctioned or ratified by them.

This association permits a new partner to be introduced through a transfer of its stock, but upon its own terms. By its rules and regulations the stock of each partner is made liable for the partner’s debts to the association, and its assignment is prohibited without the assent of the managing partners, called directors.
