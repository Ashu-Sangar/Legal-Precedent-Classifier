    <p class="headnotes" id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[182,572,1169,420]]]'>1. A steamship company made a special contract with a stevedore to unload and load its vessels at New Orleans. Neither the master of the vessel nor his crew had anything to do with the work, which was in the exclusive charge of the stevedore, who employed his own men and used his own machinery and cargo planks. A seaman on one of the company’s steamers, while on duty as a night watchman, having stepped on one of these planks, which tilted, he was thrown overboard and seriously injured. He brought suit against the company for damages, which he alleged was occasioned by the negligence of the company’s servants. <em>Held, </em>that the questions whether the stevedore was an agent of tho company or an independent contractor, and whether the plaintiff was a fellow-servant in a common employment, were properly submitted to the jury.</p>

J., it appeared that the plaintiff was a seaman on the steamship Tonawanda, owned by defendants. On September 8th 1874, the night of the accident, the vessel was lying at the levee in the river at New Orleans, partly unloaded, and partly loaded with the return cargo, her deck being about five feet lower than the level of the levee. Running from the deck to tho levee were two gangways, one forward and the other aft, used for loading and unloading. These gangways were composed of six or seven heavy planks, about a foot wide by thirty feet long, resting on the levee, their ends projecting out and over the deck of the vessel to her hatches, some four or five feet, and resting upon a bench or support erected on the deck of tho vessel for that purpose. Blocks were used to steady tho planks and to overcome the rise and fall' of the vessel caused by the rise and fall of the river. In order to keep the planks on a level with the levee, some of the blocks were taken out as the vessel rose, and additional ones were put in as she fell. When the vessel fell, there would be a space between the blocks and the ends of the planks, rendering them unsteady and liable to sink down if a weight came upon them. The vessel was being unloaded and loaded by a general stevedore, one Manning, whom the company employed under a special contract to pay him so much per day on the outward cargo, and by the package or barrel on the inward. The stevedore employed his own men, and he and they arranged the planks, gangways and blocks. None of the crew had <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>anything to do with the arrangement of the planks, or with adjusting them to the rise and fall of the river. The chief officer saw that the cargo was properly stored and the ship properly trimmed, but he had no other duty connected with the loading and discharging of the cargo. Neither the stevedore nor his men were in any way connected with the vessel or her employment. The stevedore employed and paid his own men, and he was paid by the agent of the company at New Orleans. The loading and unloading was entirely in his charge.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[269,793,1173,944]]]'>On the vessel’s arrival at New Orleans, plaintiff was asked by the master to act as night watchman on board, in consideration of having all day off to himself — to which he consented. It appeared that this was the customary way of watching steamers while in port, and the position of watchman was considered a desirable one by the seamen, on account of being thereby relieved from duty in the daytime, as otherwise they would be obliged to take their turn in watching at night, in addition to their regular duties during the day. As night-watchman, it was his duty to take general charge of the ship, keep her fasts from chafing, admit no one on board except the ship’s company, and see that nothing was stolen. On the night of the accident, the plaintiff, while thus acting as nightwatchman, heard a noise, and starting forward to learn the cause, stepped upon the second plank of the gangway, near the pilot-house, which, giving way by reason of the vessel having sunk during the night, the plaintiff tripped and fell over the planks into the water, breaking his leg and bruising himself in the fall. It was in evidence that when the stevedore and his-gang would leave the vessel after the performance of their day’s work, these cargo planks were in the charge of the officer of the deck at night; that plaintiff knew of the condition of the planks, and that it was his duty to have blocked them himself, or to have notified the officer of the deck.</p>

This is an action against the steamship company for alleged negligence on the part of their agents. Undoubtedly the general rule is, that a principal is responsible for an injury happening by the negligence of his agents. But this rule is subject to certain qualifications and limitations. In the first place, the plaintiff, in an action of this kind, must prove negligence on the part of the employer or his agents, and he must also prove that, the accident was occasioned by it. Again, it is a rule of law, that in a case of this kind, if the plaintiff has himself been negligent, then he cannot recover, although there may have been negligence on the part of the master also. Where the person injured is partially to blame himself, he cannot recover damages, although his employer also has been negligent. If there was contributory negligence, if his own acts assisted in producing the accident, he cannot recover.</p>

For example, if an employer has taken proper care in the selection of his engineer, and the engine or boiler explodes, and the engineer is hurt, he cannot recover. It is a risk which he took. So it is with a sailor. He takes the risk which is ordinarily incident to his occupation.</p>

He was a watchman, it is true, but he was watching as a sailor. It is his duty to go on watch when directed by the master, whether in port or on sea. The master is a sort of tyrant on board of his vessel. He has the right to give such orders as he pleases. If commanded so to do by the master, the plaintiff would have been obliged to watch the ship just as much in the port of <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>New Orleans as at sea. It seems by the testimony that the sailors regard the duty of watchman while in port as rather desirable. They enjoy certain privileges and exemptions from duty in consequence of it.</p>

If this accident was caused by the negligence of any person engaged in a common employment with himself, such as the captain and sailors, plaintiff cannot recover.</p>

The decision of this court in Mullan <em>v. </em>The Steamship Company, 28 P. F. Smith 25, was closely followed. It was left to the jury to find whether the chief stevedore, Manning, was a simple agent — with the instruction that if he was, the company was liable; but not if he was in an independent employment. If, however, the accident resulted from the negligence of the master or crew, then the company was not liable to another of the crew. There was no evidence in the cause that the company had placed the entire charge of its business in the hands of either the master or chief stevedore, so as to make the negligence of either their negligence. The entire case was properly submitted to the jury as presenting questions of fact for their decision. We must take the whole charge and answers together, and not separate parts by themselves.</p>
