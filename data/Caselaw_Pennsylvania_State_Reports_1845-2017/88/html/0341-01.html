In December 1874, the paper so held by the bank amounted to $21,508.70, part of which was then near maturity. The bank, at the request of. the Girard company, agreed to renewals of the paper, provided mortgages were given to secure them to the amount of $21,000. Accordingly, on December 31st 1874, a mortgage for $17,000 was assigned by the Girard company to the bank, secured upon certain wharf property on the river Schuylkill, near Arch street. The mortgage itself was given by Charles T. Murphy to the bank; but in point of fact the property itself belonged to the Girard company, and Murphy, who merely held it for them as trustee, afterwards executed a declaration of trust to that effect. This mortgage, with another of $4000 on No. 1427 Vine street, executed directly by Charles T. Murphy to President Eckert of the bank, made up the $21,000 security required by the bank, and the transaction was Consummated on January 4th 1875, by the de-livery of the papers.</p>

These renewal notes, it appeared, were always sent several days in advance of the maturity of the originals. There were three of these notes due on March 3d 1875, which were renewed for four months, with one note amounting to the aggregate, $5156.95.</p>

On the 9th of June, the company wrote that they desired to have the wharf property released from the mortgage. The negotiation culminated on July 3d, in an interview in Philadelphia, between President Eckert, of the bank, and Mr. Charles T. Murray, treasurer of the Girard company, at which Mr. Norris appeared as attorney for the bank. Before leaving Heading, President Eckert directed one of the clerks to make him a statement of the Girard company’s account, which he did, showing but the one note of §5156.95 due by them as makers, and omitting the note for §2371.69, on which they were liable as endorsers. Eckert swore that he did not then know of the existence'of the note omitted; he brought this memorandum with him to this city, and having no other knowledge on the subject but that furnished by the clerk, he assumed it to be correct, and acted on it at the interview with Murphy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b341-9" data-blocks='[["BL_341.9",341,[217,1652,1171,685]]]'>The result of the interview was, that Murphy gave Eckert two notes of the Pittsburgh Bolt Company, with the Girard company’s endorsement, in exchange for the $5156.95 note, the bank paying him the difference in cash, and receiving as security a mortgage for §4000 on another property. The §17,000 mortgage was then satisfied of record by the bank, and the second day thereafter the company failed and made an assignment to Mr. West, the appellant. The auditor found that the parties all concur that the adjustment of the 3d of July proceeded upon the declaration and assumption that but one note of the Girard company wras still held by the bank being about $5000. He further reported, “ It is impossible for the auditor, in the view he takes of the evidence, to conclude otherwise than that the mortgage of the bank was surrendered and satisfied by its chief officer through mistake and oversight, caused by the mis-infomiation of the clerk and the conduct of Mr. Murphy.</p>

Murphy does not testify that the other note was at all spoken of or considered at the interview, or that it was regarded by the parties as having been taken out of the protection of 'the $17,000 mortgage. The extent of his claim is that because the bank took and discounted the Geary, Tilton &amp; Colwell notes, shifting the Girard company’s debtors place from maker to that of endorser, that, therefore, there was no indebtedness to the bank on that account. He did not swear that the bank held no other liability of the company, only that they held none of the company’s paper for this amount, except their endorsement. He says he knew of this endorsement at the settlement, but considered that the Girard company was not liable because the bolt company was then good, and that while, as every one concedes, the unpaid note was not one of the notes (originally) secured by the mortgage, he goes the length of swearing that neither was it taken in lieu of one secured thereby — that is, not a renewal; because he says, <em>arguendo </em>, — the proceeds of the secured notes when discounted took the place of the original notes, and were placed to their credit. He does not aver any parol agreement to release the security and accept the new notes, nor does he pretend that the credit and standing of the new names of Geary, Tilton &amp; Colwell were known to the bank, or that they acted upon it.”</p>

Rut such is not the case in'hand, and .for the present the question is to be regarded as between the original mortgagor and mortgagee, and whether the mortgagee is bound absolutely and at all events by the satisfaction of record. I am of opinion that he is not, and that if a plain mistake of fact was made in satisfying the mortgage, that he is entitled to be heard in this controversy.</p>
