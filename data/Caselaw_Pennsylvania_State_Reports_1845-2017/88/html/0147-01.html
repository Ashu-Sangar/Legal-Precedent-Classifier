On the 21st of September 1875, while the loaded barges were lying at .defendants’ works, J. W. Grubbs, one of the defendants, filed his petition in bankruptcy; a few days prior, however, a number of creditors who had judgments before justices of the peace, had executions issued thereon and levied on the barges' of coal, but were restrained from proceeding therein by an injunction issued by the United States District Court. The barges not having been returned to plaintiffs, they, on the 16th November 1875, issued a writ of replevin and.the barges, with the coal therein, were delivered to them. Afterwards the execution creditors presented their petition to the court, praying leave to intervene, which was allowed.</p>

As to the coal, therefore, you should find that the property was in the defendants, and you will assess damages to the defendants for the detention of the coal by the plaintiffs from the 16th of November 1875, to the date of your verdict, and the measure of the damages will be the interest on what you may estimate as the value of the coal from November 16 th 1875, to the present time.</p>
