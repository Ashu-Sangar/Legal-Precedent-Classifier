In an action upon the policy for a loss, the assured testified, that his son was occupying the house, keeping bachelor’s hall, and the son testified, he occupied the house after his father moved, but was not at home the night of the fire. Two witnesses for defendant testified, that they had seen no signs of life in the house for several weeks before the fire.

The verdict was for plaintiff, and the court afterwards entered judgment for the defendant on the reserved point, <em>non obstante veredicto.

The last payment came due 1st October 1873. September 29th 1870, Chase and wife received on said contract $210, and conveyed, with plaintiff’s consent, to Amanda D. Birdsall forty by sixty feet, being the north end of the lot. April 15th 1871, Chase and wife received on said contract $200, and conveyed, with plaintiff’s consent, to John K.

Berry. This assignment was unqualified in terms as endorsed on contract, but at the same date Berry made and delivered an agreement or certificate to the effect that he held the assignment as security for a balance of account, stated as $75 due Berry, more or less; as further collateral security for any risks assumed by Berry in the postponement of claims due from plaintiff to others, in the event of Berry paying the same; and as further collateral and continuing security for any sums Berry might be thereafter called upon or induced to advance for plaintiff or his family. There was no evidence that after that date Berry ever assumed any risk or liability or advanced any money whatever for plaintiff, directly or indirectly. On April 19th 1872, plaintiff procured of the defendant the policy of insurance upon which this action is brought, by which defendant, for a premium of $10, insured the frame dwelling-house upon the remainder of the lot above mentioned for a period of one year, in the sum of $1000. Erom the time of insurance down to a few days before the fire the house was occupied by tenants. When they moved out plaintiff's son remained in occupancy with a lot of plaintiff’s goods. The fire occurred on the 30th of June, the house being totally destroyed. Due notice was given defendant’s agent, and August 19th, within the sixty days provided by the policy, proofs of loss were made out and sworn to before a notary and forwarded to the defendant. No objection or exception was made or taken by the defendant to the character or sufficiency of the proofs of loss. These proofs came to hands of defendant August 22d 1872, as is <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>shown bv the office stamp thereon in these words: <em>“ </em>Commerce Fire Ins.'

September 27th, Berry, in his own behalf and as attorney in fact for plaintiff, made an assignment of all their interest in the old contract from Chase, and the lot to A. J. Fox for §1000, and authorized Chase to make conveyance to Fox. Said §1000 was to be paid by Fox by discharge of certain liens and claims against the property, amounting in the aggregate to §322.98, which included §89.59 for a mechanic’s lien held by Fox himself; he was to pay §261.89 balance purchase-money to Chase. Fox did pay to Berry at the time of assignment §413.89 ; §263.89 by surrender of Berry’s overdue note to him, and §150 in two checks. Before receiving the power of attorney above mentioned, Berry never had nor claimed to exercise any control over the property in question. October 18th 1872, Berry gave plaintiff his judgment-bond for §1000, conditioned to pay and clear from record all liens against the real estate in question, estimated at that date at §587; the remaining §413, after receipting Chandler’s indebtedness, to be paid in four equal payments, at intervals of sixty days, with interest. This bond was satisfied June 27th 1873. October 22d 1872, Chase and wife conveyed to Fox, as shown by receipt of latter’s attorney, endorsed upon the original contract.

They were without exception of the sufficiency of the evidence. Whether there is any evidence of a fact which ought to be submitted to the jury is a question of law which may be reserved; but whether the evidence is sufficient is a question of fact which cannot be reserved: Wilde <em>v. </em>Trainor, 9 P. F. Smith 439. The first specification of error is to the judgment of the court below upon the reservation of the defendants’ second point, which was substantially the same as the eighth point and fifth specification, whether there was sufficient evidence that the premises wmre vacant and unoccupied at the time of the fire. Though the jury found for the plaintiff, judgment for the defendants was entered <em>non obstante veredicto. </em>The plaintiff testified, “ my son was occupying it, keeping bachelor’s hall.” The son testified that he occupied the house after his father moved, but was not at home the night of the fire. There were indeed two witnesses examined on the part of the defendants, who said that they saw no signs,of life about the house for several weeks before the fire. Here was certainly a question of fact for the jury, something more than a scintilla, and the court had no right to withdraw the case from that tribunal by such a reservation. An occasional absence for a single night, even though it, should so chance as to be the night of the fire, would certainly not make it a vacant or unoccupied house.</p>

The judgment denies the plaintiff’s right to recover on the ground of want of title under the terms of the policy. If the court meant to hold broadly that because the interest of the plaintiff was equitable, subject to the payment of a balance of purchase-money, it was not the entire, unconditional and sole ownership of the property, it was an error, as has just been decided in the Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Wilgus, ante 107. There was in this policy, as in those cases, no con<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>dition requiring a disclosure of encumbrances. But if it was meant to decide that the assignment of the Chase contract by the plaintiff to Berry deprived him of such ownership, it was equally wrong. The declaration of Berry as to that assignment was in evidence, in writing, and made it a mortgage merely, held as collateral security for a debt then owing to him and for further advances, and the power of sale did not change its character. The provision of the policy is, “ When property has been sold and delivered, or otherwise disposed of, so that all interest or liability on the part of the assured herein named has ceased, this insurance on such property shall immediately terminate.” It is clear then, we think, that the judgment for defendants on these two points, <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>was wrong.</p>
    <p id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[211,967,1166,518]]]'>The fourth specification of error is to the judgment on the reservation of the defendants’ seventh point. This is based upon the alleged insufficiency of the account of the loss furnished by the plaintiff to the defendants. The property insured was a two-and-a-half story frame dwelling-house. The account of loss was that the property insured was totally destroyed by the fire. It is not easy to see how the account under the circumstances could have been more particular. At all events, it was prima facie sufficient. If the schedules and papers annexed to the affidavit were insufficient, it was incumbent on the defendants to produce them. The same question was raised by the answer to the ninth point of the defendants, upon which there was a similar reservation and judgment.</p>
