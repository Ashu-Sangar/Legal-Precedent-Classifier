By receiving such a conveyance the grantee, according to the decisions in this state, makes the mortgage debt his own, both as regards the grantor and the mortgagee: Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, <a href="/watts/3/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 60" data-case-ids="1841271" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0060-01">3 Watts 60</a>; Blank <em>v. </em>German, 5 W. <em>k </em>S. 36; Hoff’s Appeal, 12 Harris 200; Burke <em>v. </em>Gummey, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Wright%20518" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Wright 518">13 Wright 518</a>;.

Smith 135; Metzgar’s Appeal, 21 Id. 330; Taylor <em>v. </em>Preston, 29 Id. 436. In Hoff’s Appeal it was held that the liability incurred by the grantee in such á transaction is not only a liability to the grantor by reason of the covenant, but that it is also a liability which .the owner of the mortgage may enforce by an action in his own name. ‘ It is of no consequence,’ said Woodward, C. J., in that casq, ‘ that -the mortgagee was not a party to the dealings between Hoff and Rey<a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>nolds, for it is a rudimental principle that a party may sue on a promise made on a sufficient consideration for his use and benefit, though it be made to another and not to himself.’ And again, ‘the money belonged to the mortgagee, and I hold he might have recovered it in assumpsit if not in covenant.’ This doctrine was expressly recognised in Lennig’s Estate, 2 P. F. Smith 135, where the present chief justice, in his opinion, quotes it with approval. The ruling in McCracken’s Estate, 5 Casey 426, proceeded upon precisely the same principle. In that case the estate of the grantee who had taken subject to an encumbrance was decreed to pay the amount of the encumbrance to the owners of it, although the grantee had devised the land and his devisees had sold it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.6",465,[277,944,1167,1416]]]'>“ The plaintiff then being the owner of the mortgage when the defendant took a conveyance of the land from Brownfield, ‘subject to the payment of the mortgage,’ the defendant is within these decisions, and he was not only bound by his covenant to his grantor, Brownfield, but he also came under a duty to the present plaintiff, the holder of the mortgage, for which, by the doctrine of the cases already referred to, the latter may maintain an action of assumpsit against him, which, under such circumstances, according to the authorities, is an equitable remedy to enforce a promise made upon sufficient consideration for his benefit. It makes no difference that here the consideration for the mortgage was not, according to the special pleas filed, a part of the purchase-money of the land originally, but certain advances made for building purposes, for which Brownfield, by his own previous covenants in the deed of conveyance made to him, had made himself responsible to his grantor, Keller, and to <em>the </em>Spring Garden Building Association, No. 2, which held the mortgage at the time of Keller’s conveyance to Brownfield. The principle is the same whatever the consideration of the mortgage may have been. There is, however, a well-settled distinction between taking subject to a mortgage and subject to a ground-rent: American Academy of Music <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 P. F. Smith 130; Walker <em>v. </em>Physick, 5 Barr 193. In the latter case the grantee’s liability continues no longer than the tenancy of the freehold, unless, indeed, he conveys with a fraudulent intent to avoid the payment of the ground-rent: 4 P. F. Smith 132. In the present case the mortgaged premises have by several mesne conveyances passed through several hands, each grantee in turn taking it under and subject to the payment of this mortgage. According to the principle of the cases cited every such grantee by taking a conveyance in this form incurred an immediate liability, which might be enforced, either by his immediate grantor in relief of his own precedent liability, or by the then holder of the mortgage for whose benefit the promise was made.</p>

It is plain, then, that the defendant cannot relieve himself from this promise.by a conveyance of the land, and for this reason his third special plea is bad. In Burke <em>v. </em>Gummey the defendant had done this and the title of his alienee, as in the present case, had been altogether divested by a sheriff’s sale at the time when his responsibility was enforced.</p>

F. Smith 139. And so is an agreement made to avoid responsibility for an encumbrance which is about to-be imposed upon the property, and which is to pass into the hands of third persons under forms which clearly fix upon the grantee of the estate a personal responsibility for it.</p>
