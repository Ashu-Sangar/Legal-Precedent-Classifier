H. Hastings, a broker, in Pittsburgh, who acted as agent for both parties. The attorney of Mills, in Pittsburgh, prepared a bond and mortgage upon real estate belonging to Wilson, situate in the city of Pittsburgh, and these papers which specified no rate of interest or place of payment were sent to Wilson in Kansas. He executed them there and mailed them to Hastings, who, upon receipt of the money lent by Mills to Wilson, delivered them to Mills. In 1876, Mills obtained a judgment against Wilson upon a scire facias issued on said mortgage after a return of two nihils. In liquidating the amount, interest was calculated at the rate of seven per cent., which rate Mills claimed to be correct, as that was the legal rate in Kansas. Wilson contended that only six per cent., the rate allowed in Pennsylvania, should be computed, but he paid the full amount of the <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>judgment as liquidated, and brought this action to recover back the excess of interest paid over six per cent., to wit, $85.60. The court entered judgment for the plaintiff on the case stated, and defendant took this writ and assigned this action for error.</p>
