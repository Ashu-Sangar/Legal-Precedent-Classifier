Other parts of her estate were similarly disposed of, in trust for three other sons.

The son may be said to have been a purchaser <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>as to his life interest, for, although at common law a devisee, who takes by the will precisely the estate, that would have been cast upon him by descent is in by descent and not by purchase, yet the case is different where there is a difference in quantity between the estate which the devisee would take as heir and that which he takes under the devise: Kinney <em>v. </em>Glasgow, 3 P. F. Smith, 143; Reading <em>v. </em>Royster, 1 Salk. 242. But as purchaser he only took an equitable life estate. He had nothing in it which could descend to his heirs. The fee remained in the trustees for the remaindermen, to whom it was given by the will, and these remaindermen are described as ‘ such person or persons as would, by the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, be entitled to the same if the said Samuel had died intestate, seised thereof in fee.’ What persons were intended by Mrs. Johnson by these words, for it is the intention .of the <em>testatrix, </em>and her intention alone which is to prevail ? We think those persons were intended who would have been entitled under the Intestate Act of 1833. That act is entitled ‘An Act relating to the descent and distribution of the estates of intestates.’ This is what is usually understood by the intestate law of Pennsylvania. It is commonly called the intestate law, sometimes the statute of distributions. It is in itself a complete code of laws upon the subject to which it relates. Its provisions are in accord with the general sentiment of the people of this state upon that subject, and are founded in nature and reason. It gives the property of an intestate to his kindred, commencing with the nearest in degree, and scrupulously confines the descent of real estate to those who are of the blood of the ancestor from whom it descended, or by whom it was devised. By this law any estate derived from the mother would, upon the death of any one of her sons, go to those of her own blood, to her surviving sons, and to her grandchildren and granddaughters, the children of her deceased sons. Can it be believed that' she intended that any part of it should go •to strangers to her blood, or, least of all, that it should go to an appointee of a son whom she had tied up by the most rigid trusts, whom she had deprived of the least control over both the corpus and income during his life, and of all disposition of it after his death ? Can she be supposed to have intended that her son should designate the heir wbo should succeed to her estate, when she deprived him not only of all power of appointment, but of any control whatever ? Could she have intended to commit the future disposition of the estate, or of any part of it, to her son’s discretion when she expressly deprived him of all discretion and power even over that which he was to enjoy himself, and subjected him absolutely, even as to the receipt of income, to the discretion and judgment of her trustees ? It is impossible for us to believe this, for it is contrary to the whole spirit and teno.r of her will.</p>

      <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>“But it is said that, however improbable this may be deemed, the testatrix must have intended that which she has said, that she has by express words limited the remainder to such person as would be entitled to the same by the intestate laws, if Samuel B. Johnson had died intestate, seised thereof in fee; that if Samuel B. Johnson had died intestate and seised thereof in fee, the complainant, his adopted daughter, would, under the Adoption Act of May 4th 1855, have been entitled to the estate. But the argument leaps to a conclusion which is totally unwarranted by law'. If Samuel B. Johnson had died intestate and seised in fee, it by no means follows that the complainant would have inherited this estate. It would have been necessary, in that event, to have inquired from whom the estate descended, or by whom it had been given or devised to him, for the ninth section of the Act of April 8th .1833 would have excluded from the inheritance all persons who were not of the blood of the perquisitor. There is not the slightest pretence to say that the Act of 4th of May 1855, relative to adoption, has repealed or modified in the least degree this fundamental rule of the law of descents, as fixed by the intestate law of this state. It would require the plainest and most express language, or the most absolute and necessary implication, to repeal a rule of inheritance so deeply imbedded in our law as this. There is nothing in the Act of 1855 which lend„s countenance to the supposition that it was the intention of the legislature to disturb in the least this long-established canon of descent. The act declares that such adopted child shall have all the rights of a child <em>and heir of the adopted parent. </em>It gives to the adopted child the right to inherit from the adopting parent, but always subject to the rules of inheritance laid down by the intestate law. It does not repeal the ninth section of the Act of April 8th 1883, w'hich demands the indispensable qualification of blood to enable her to inherit an estate coming to the adopting parent by descent or devise. As was said by Mr. Justice Strong, in Schafer <em>v. </em>Enue, 4 P. F. Smith 306, ‘ the statute of 1875 does not attempt the impossibility of making the adopted person the child of the adopted parent. It gives to such person the rights of a child without being a child.’ That is, the right to inherit from the adopting parent an estate of which he is the true <em>perquisitor. </em>But there is no ground to allege that an adopted child, not of the blood of the ancestor from whom the estate is derived, could inherit such an estate from his adopting parent.</p>

Johnson, had died intestate seised in fee, she would have taken from him, is founded in an erroneous conclusion. She could not have inherited an estate derived to him by descent or devise from <em>his </em>ancestor, unless she W'as herself of the blood of that ancestor. When Mrs. Johnson, therefore, by her will gives the remainder to such person or persons <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>as would by the intestate laws be entitled to the same, if her son Samuel had died intestate seised thereof in fee, her words must be construed with reference to the facts of the case, and the words had died intestate seised thereof in fee,’ must be taken to mean the same as if she had said died intestate seised thereof in fee of an estate derived from herself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[271,657,1168,1029]]]'>“That the Act of 1855 confers only a limited right upon an adopted child, and does not substitute him in' the place of a real child under the intestate laws, is proved by the decision in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Nancrede, 8 Casey 389, where it was held that a child by adoption is subject to the payment of the collateral inheritance tax, and Tharp <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 8 P. E. Smith 500, is to the same effect. There is an analogy between the Act of May 4th 1855, relative to adopted children, and the Act of 27th April 1855 (Purdon 810), which enables illegitimate children to inherit from their mother and <em>vice versa. </em>That act declares that they shall have capacity to take and inherit from each other personal estate as next of kin and real estate as heirs in fee-simple. In Grubb’s Appeal, 8 P. E. Smith 55, it was held that the next of kin of the mother could not under this act inherit as heirs of the child, in other words, the act was held to have no operation in altering the intestate laws b.eyond the letter of the statute. A like rule may with propriety be applied to the Act of May 4th 1855. The application of that rule, while it gives the adopted child the right to inherit from the adopting parent, would exclude the possibility of such child inheriting from an ancestor of the adopting parent, and preserve intact the rule always so zealously maintained in this state, that one who claims an estate descended to or devised to an intestate must show himself heir to him by whom it was devised, or from whom it descended as <em>perquisitor.</em>

That this was her true intention, and that she did not contemplate the possibility of its being diverted from her own kindred to a stranger by any act of the son, we think is plainly apparent from the whole will.

F. Smith 81, one who makes a will is presumed to act in view of the power of the legislature to legitimate a bastard and make it an heir, much more will it be presumed that one making a will acts in view of laws already made, by which a child may be adopted and thus made an heir.</p>
    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[271,612,1173,605]]]'>One of two things may be regarded as reasonably, certain in this case: either Mrs. Johnson did know and understand the intestate laws, to which she so distinctly and emphatically refers, and so must have known that her son had the power to introduce into the succession one not of her blood, or she' was indifferent as to what might become of the residue of her estate after her son’s death, and therefore intrusted the disposition thereof to those laws, without caring to inform herself particularly concerning their provisions. In the one case, she acted in view of the possible occurrence of what has happened, and in the other, she cared not what the result might be;' in either case, nothing remains but to give her words their legal and reasonable meaning and force, and thus invest the appellant with the title and possession of the property which rightfully belongs to her.</p>

Johnson, and which, “upon and immediately after his death, was to be assigned to such person or persons, for such estate or estates, and in such proportions, as would, by the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, be entitled to the same, if he had died intestate, seised thereof in fee,” be now conveyed in fee. by said trustees, to Ann B. E. Johnson, adopted child and heir of Samuel B. Johnson, deceased, and that any income on hand or securities held by said trustees, and which ought of right to pass to the guardian of the said Ann B. E. Johnson, be now transferred and paid over to said guardian. Ordered further, that the costs be paid by the appellees.</p>
