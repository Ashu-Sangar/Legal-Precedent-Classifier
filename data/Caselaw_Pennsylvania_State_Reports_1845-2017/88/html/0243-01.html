Douthet, by deed, wherein the recited consideration was one dollar, gave to tho defendant company a right of way over his land. The company further agreed, through its president, by parol, as a further consideration therefor, to furnish plaintiff with a pass for himself and family during his life. This agreement was carried out until 1874, when, upon the refusal of tho company to furnish him with the pass as usual Douthet brought this action.</p>

Clearly just what it would cost him to get his grain transported to the points agreed to be carried to by the railroad. Why should there be any difference ? The question is not one of injury but simply of non-transportation. Suppose, again, that the contract was for grain, and the plaintiff below one season raised no grain, consequently had none for transportation, could he say to the railroad, I had no grain for transportation, and you must pay me at the rate of $150 ? The contract is a continuing one and the defendants would be liable for every breach and the plaintiff could recover for every breach as it occurred, but certainly not for those which are in anticipation or the future. A pass is only of value when used.</p>

The breach was in refusing to furnish such a pass. The breach was final, and the damages must necessarily be so also. The question then arises whether the action should be for the whole breach and damages be given accordingly. This must depend upon the entirety of the contract: 3 Pars. on Con., p. 187. The contract in this case was entire, both in fact and in contemplation of law. A contract is entire if the consideration be single, whatever the number or variety of items embraced in its subject: Gootsman <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Ins. Co., 6 P. F.

The agreement of the defendants was to give the plaintiff a pass over their railroad for himself and his family for his lifetime, as the consideration of his release of the right of way over his land. The pass was given for awhile, and then refused, and this action was to recover damages for their breach of contract.</p>
    <p id="b243-13" data-blocks='[["BL_243.17",243,[221,2393,1117,44]],["BL_244.1",244,[288,406,1160,1108]]]'>The contract was not simply for a right to ride free upon the rail<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>road. Possibly if in those terms the plaintiff might recover damages for each refusal, or combine his claims for damages for each refusal in a single action to cover any period, as a quarter or a year. But the contract being for a pass, or in other words a free ticket, this document was the principal feature in the bargain. It is obvious that a mere contract to ride free of charge would subject both parties to inconveniences. The company of necessity must operate its road by agents, viz., conductors of trains, and would be liable to suits through the mistakes or ignorance of their servants. So, too, the plaintiff without the evidence of his right would be liable to be refused often when his business might be most urgent. But a pass or free ticket would relieve both parties from difficulty. The pass being the principal feature of the contract was therefore made its chief subject, for it was the document to be furnished as the evidence of the plaintiff’s right. Hence we see no other rule to be applied to the case but damages for the refusal of the pass, as the only cause of action, and this being single, to be-compensated by such damages, as a pass for life for himself and family would be worth. It is true it is difficult to estimate its value because of two uncertainties — one the length of life, and the other, the number of passages he and his family would probably demand. Still this uncertainty, like many others, must be made to approximate certainty as closely as the nature of the case will admit of. The burthen of proof lay on the plaintiff, who knew the number of his family, and the customary number of trips made by himself and them.</p>
