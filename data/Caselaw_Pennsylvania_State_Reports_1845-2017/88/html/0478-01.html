He left a will and after disposing of part of his estate gave the rest to trustees to divide the income into four equal shares, one-fourth part to b.e paid to each of the daughters, and the. other fourth to the grandchildren. When the grandchildren reached the age of twenty-one, each was to receive his share of the principal as represented by the income received. In regard to the principal given in trust for the daughters, he provided that each daughter might appoint, by will who should receive it after her death, and in default of such appointment by will, then the principal sum was to be paid to the child or children of such daughter in equal shares; but if either of said daughters should die without leaving issue, and without any last will, then the share of such daughter was to be continued under the same trusts as hereinbefore provided, “"for the use and benefit of my surviving children, in equal proportions, in the same manner as hereinbefore directed as to the residue of my estate.” The testator’s daughter Martha died without issue and without having made any appointment by will. The grandchildren, the children of Catherine, claimed, that they were entitled to participate in the portion of the residuary estate which was held in trust for their aunt Martha. <em>Held, </em>that upon Martha’s decease without children, and without having exercised the power of appointment as to the principal, the right to receive the income in equal proportions vested’ in her surviving sisters, Mary and Ann, and that each was entitled to appoint one-half of the principal by will.</p>

The distribution of Miss Ann Ryan’s share need not now be considered, as the controversy before the auditor turned entirely upon the distribution of Miss Martha Ryan’s share of the principal. The only reference in her will to this share and her power of appointment over it, is in the third clause, viz.: 8d. I give to my sister, Ann; all interest from- the estate of my late <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>father, in tne same way that I have received it during her life.” It was generally conceded by the counsel, at least no argument to the contrary was ever suggested, and it is the opinion of the auditor, that this gave to Miss Ann Ryan only a life-interest in her sister’s share, and consequently, except to this extent, Miss Martha Ryan failed to exercise the power of appointment given to her by the will of her father. The proper award of this share therefore was the question presented for the auditor to decide. Upon this two points arose :</p>

The words arc “ to receive the income and interest thereof, and to divide the said income and interest” into four equal shares, and to pay one-fourth “thereof” to his daughters. In default of issue, and upon any of the daughters dying without any will, “ then the share or portion of such daughter shall be continued [under the same trusts as are hereinbefore provided] for the use and benefit of my surviving children, in equal proportions, in the same manner as hereinbefore directed as to the residue of my estate.”</p>

Hypothesis (2) is that upon the death of Martha without disposing of this principal, the right to dispose of it immediately rested in Miss Ann Ryan and Mrs. Smith, while hypothesis (3), while admitting that no intestacy exists, is to the effect that the trust is continued, not only for the benefit of Mrs. <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>Smith and Miss Ann Ryan, but also for the children of Mrs. Reilly in equal proportions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[282,496,1170,952]]]'>“ On behalf of this view, as opposed to the other, it was argued, 1. That it is in accordance with the rule of law that the heir cannot be disinherited, but by plain and clear words to that effect, and the result of such a construction of this clause as will make the continuance of the trust only for the benefit of the surviving daughters of the testator to the exclusion of Mrs. Reilly’s children is practically to do this very thing. 2. That where any doubtful or ambiguous phraseology exists, the scheme of the whole will must be taken into consideration, and that, looking at this will as a whole, it is plain that the predominant thought in the testator’s mind was the division of his residuary estate into such shares' as would entitle all his children, and their representatives, to share alike, and have an equal portion of the residue; therefore upon the failure of any one of the beneficiaries to dispose of the principal when a re-division is ordered, it must be interpreted to mean a division upon the same principle, and with the same interest to each, relatively to the others, as was fixed upon the first division, unless the words plainly show a contrary intention. These two rules ought undoubtedly to govern if we find it impossible to discover the true intention from the word’s alone, or if standing alone they express a wish plainly at variance with the whole scope of the will, or even fairly doubtful. Now is this the ease ?</p>

In the same sentence, the further trust is provided to transfer immediately upon the death of either daughter the principal sum on which such daughter was entitled to receive the income, as she should appoint by will, and on failure to appoint, to her children; but in case of no appointment and no children, then it was the testator’s will that the share or portion of such daughter should be continued under the same trusts as were thereinbefore provided for the use and benefit of his surviving children, in equal proportions, in the same manner as before directed as to the residue of his estate. To hold, as is claimed by the counsel for Mrs. Reilly’s children, that this direction means that they are to share in this second distribution of income equally with the testator’s surviving daughters, it is necessary to assume <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>one of two things : either the trust for ‘surviving children’ referred to is taken to indicate a trust <em>similar </em>to that provided for his surviving children, in which all his heirs are to share equally, as directed in regard to the first division of the residue, and the kind of trust for the grandchildren be taken as included by the words referring only to the trust for the daughters; or else, if the term refers to the beneficiaries, as well as the kind of trust under which they are to take, grandchildren must be included under the term ‘ children.’</p>

But in one sense that which alone gives character to a trust, is really the duty devolving upon the trustee, and if these duties are different in trusts for two <em>eestuis que trustent, </em>the trusts can hardly be said to be identical in kind. Here the trust for Mrs. Reilly’s children was to pay the income to the father until each child should come of age, when a certain share of the principal would then be paid to that child, with no power of appointment or provision for remainder; while the trust for the daughters was limited upon the further trust to pay the principal as each daughter might direct, or to her children, and in default of both, to continue upon the same trust, as provided for his surviving children. Now, the word ‘ children’ being admittedly equivalent to daughters, it ought, if this argument be correct, to be possible to substitute the latter for the former, so that it would read, ‘upon the same trusts as are hereinbefore provided for the use and benefit of my surviving daughters.’ It appears to the auditor that this would fail to indicate the same <em>kind </em>of trust as that provided for the grandchildren. Or, again, if it be admitted that the trusts are so exactly alike that a reference to either will indicate the other, then the one term may be substituted for the other, without altering the meaning of the sentence, and we might read it thus, ‘ upon the same trusts as are hereinbefore provided for the use and benefit of my grandchildren;’ but it is very apparent that daughters could not claim a portion of the income from this new trust of this one-fourth or a power of appointment over any part of the principal, if such had been the language of the testator. The meaning would have been entirely intelligible had he simply said, ‘ upon the same trusts as are hereinbefore provided;’ if this was the intention, why should this limit be added, unless to distinguish between the trusts theretofore provided ? It is the opinion of the auditor, therefore, that, if taken merely as referring to the <em>kind </em>of trust, this term does not include the trust for the grandchildren ; and he is probably led to this conclusion the more readily, because he cannot but think that by this expression the testator intended specifically to point out the <em>lenefieiaries, </em>as well as to indicate the nature of the trust; <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>perhaps it may not be improper to add, that the fact that upon the first argument no other view seems to have been taken by counsel, confirms his impression that this is the natural and obvious reading.</p>

They are suffered to do so, principally, if not exclusively, in two cases: where the word is used evidently as co-extensive with issue, which is a, word of very general import; and where there are no children literally to answer the description, and then grandchildren are let in <em>utres magis valeat quam pereat,’ </em>or as was said by Rogers, J., in Hallowell <em>v. </em>Phipps, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20380" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Whart. 380">2 Whart. 380</a> : 4 Their being included in that term is only permitted in two cases, viz-.: from necessity, which occurs when the .will would remain inoperative, unless the word <em>children </em>were extended beyond its natural import; and where the testator has clearly shown by other words, that he did not intend to use the word <em>children </em>in the proper actual meaning, but in a more extensive sense.’</p>

But the words cannot be regarded without their context, and if, as in the opinion of the auditor is the case, the testator had already said that the daughters were to share the income equally, the reference to the former distribution of the residue is merely for the purpose of additional explanation as to the manner of distribution; it would be absolutely impossible to divide in the <em>same </em>equal proportions, because originally there were four shares, and after the death of <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>one of the beneficiaries, only three could be made, which of itself shows that the words are merely used as an explanatory reference, and not in their literal sense.</p>

It was argued first that Mrs. Smith never had control over any part of this fund under her father’s will, that therefore it could not be included in this trust created in her own will out of the funds derived from' her father’s estate. The words of Lewis Ryan’s will are, that the trustees shall pay over to the appointees of the daughters ‘ the principal sum on which such daughter so dying was entitled to receive the income or interest.’ It was urged before the auditor that the execution of a power must be strictly construed, and that unless the exercise of it came clearly within the letter of the authority, it is void; that as a matter of fact Mrs. Smith never for one moment during her life was actually entitled to receive a dollar of the income derived from Miss Martha Ryan’s share, because Mrs. Smith had died before Miss Ann Ryan’s life estate in it had expired. ' The auditor does not think that this view can be sustained. It is in accord with the principles laid down in all of the cases, to hold, that upon the failure to appoint on the part of Martha the share subject to her power of appointment, went as directed under the will of Lewis Ryan, and that the rights thus acquired vested in interest immediately upon the happening of the contingency contemplated by his will, <em>i. e., </em>the death of Martha without an appointment and without children. In Bristow <em>v. </em>Skirrow, L. R. 10 Eq. 1, 0. bequeathed a household estate after his wife’s death in default of her appointment to his next of kin living at the death of the survivor of himself and his wife. She only gave a life-interest in it to T., and it was held that it vested in the next of kin of the testator living at the death of the wife, subject to the life-interest of T. The same state of facts exists in the present ease, and the two surviving daughters were entitled upon the death of Martha to receive each one-half of the income derived from this share, in accordance with the will of the testator, subject to Miss Ann Ryan’s life interest. There is nothing in the will, it must be observed, which limits the exercise of the power of appointment to that part of the principal, the income from which the daughter was entitled to receive, and which she actually did receive during her. lifetime; it is simply a general right to dispose of all that from which she was entitled to receive the income, whether in the present or the future, so long as the right was an actual vested right and not a mere contingent remainder. This question is really one of great importance to the heirs, for unless the children of Mrs. Smith claim under her appointment they must seek a title through some other source. It is however unnecessary to discuss this question further, for the auditor is of the opinion that Mrs. Smith had the right to exercise her power of appointment over one-half of this share.</p>

It <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>will be remembered that in the statement of facts agreed upon, it is noticed that all of Mrs. Smith’s children were living at the death of Lewis Ryan.</p>

Otherwise, the rule might be applied to every case in which dominion over property is given to the devisee. Ilad the testatrix given this power of appointment to children not <em>in esse </em>at the time of the death of the original testator, then it would undoubtedly be a void execution of the power: Wollaston <em>v. </em>King, 8 Eq. 165. Not so, however, if, as was expressly admitted, all of the donees of the powers under Mrs. Smith’s will were alive at the time of the original testator’s death: Farwell on Powers 227, 257; Sugden on Powers 492; Phipson <em>v. </em>Turner, 9 Sim. 227; Slack <em>v. </em>Dakyns, L. R. 15 Eq. 307. In the last cited case, a testator gave certain property upon trust for his granddaughter for life, and after her death to such of her children as she should appoint. She appointed to each of five children (all of whom were living at the death of the original testator), and ‘after the death of each child, directed that the share in which the child had a life-interest should be held in such manner as the child might by will appoint, with limitations over, in default of appointment, in favor of the children of said five children : * * <em>Held </em>a good exercise of the power of appointment given by the will of the testator.’ The same principle certainly controls this case.”</p>

The children of Mrs. Reilly, appellants, claim that they are entitled to participate in the share or portion of the residuary estate which was held in trust for their aunt, Martha Ryan; while, on the other hand, the appellees contend that, by the terms of the will, they are excluded, and have no <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>interest therein; that the principal or capital sum, on which Martha received the interest or income, was continued for the use and benefit of the testator’s surviving children, in equal proportions, under the same trusts that are provided for them in the previous part of the residuary clause.</p>

It appears to us that this is the only construction of which the clause under consideration is fairly susceptible. If the testator had omitted the phrase “ for the use and benefit of my surviving children,” or had added thereto the words “ and grandchildren,” or if we were at liberty to construe the word <em>children </em>as including grandchildren, there would be no difficulty in giving effect to the will in favor of appellants; but there is nothing in the instrument that would justify us in striking out or supplying these words respectively, or in enlarging the meaning of the word <em>children </em>so as to embrace <em>grandchildren. </em>It is the well-established rule of construction in this state, as well as elsewhere, that the word children in a will does not include grandchildren, unless it appears from the context to have boon so intended by the testator, or such meaning is necessary to carry out his manifest intent, neither of which appears to exist in this case. Nor is the meaning of the will rendered so doubtful by antagonistic clauses or the use of ambiguous language as to justify a departure from the ordinary rule, requiring a testamentary paper to be construed according to its natural and ordinary import. If the will contained such clauses, or if such ambiguous language was employed as to render its meaning doubtful, it would be our duty to adopt that construction which would, as nearly as practicable, bring about equality of distribution, llut we fail to find in this will any such inconsistency or ambiguity as would justify the application of this principle.</p>

Then follow the words “in equal proportions,” indicating how the surviving daughters are to take.

These words would seem to indicate that as the original portions of the principal, the income or interest of which his daughters were to receive respectively, were subjected to the power of appointment vested in the daughters, so the quarter of the principal added in equal proportions to the shares of each of the surviving daughters should serve the purpose of increasing their income, and in the end be subject also to the power of appointment before given them respectively.</p>
