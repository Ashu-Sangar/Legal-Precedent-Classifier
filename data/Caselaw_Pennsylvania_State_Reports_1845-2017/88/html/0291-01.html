Under these circumstances, he tried, through the intercession of friends, to induce his wife to permit him to return to his house, and only a few days before the shooting, he went to see his wife, accompanied by a friend, Mrs. Haddon, but his wife refused to admit him, and as he went away, remarked to him that she would never have anything to do with him this side of the grave.

He entered the pew immediately behind that in which his wife and two sons were sitting, and remained-there until the conclusion of the services, in which he took part. As the congregation were about leaving the church, and while Mrs. Sayres, who had stepped from her pew, was speaking to a friend, he drew the pistol, fired it, and shot his wife in the back. He then dropped the pistol, and started rapidly from the church, but was arrested by some of the church members at the foot of the stairs. He made no resistance, and in reply to remarks while on the way to the station-house, complained of a pain in his head.

At present we shall confine your attention to the law of felonious homicide. At common law but two grades of felonious homicide existed, murder and manslaughter. Murder at common law is committed when a person of sound mind, memory and discretion, kills a reasonable creature in being, in the peace of the Commonwealth, with malice aforethought, express or implied. Manslaughter may be defined to be the unlawful and felonious killing of another without malice, express or implied. Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of another, without malice, on a sudden quarrel, or in the heat of passion. You will observe at once the vital distinction between murder and manslaughter. In murder there is the presence of malice, and the intent to kill or to do great bodily harm. In manslaughter there is the absence of malice and intent to injure, and the presence of passion. In murder there is especially malice. In manslaughter there is and can be no malice. Our legislature, in 1794, created a crime not strictly speaking known at common law, for they have divided the crime of murder into two degrees — murder in the first and murder in the second degree: ‘ All murder perpetrated by means of poison, lying in wait, or by any other kind of wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, or which shall be committed in the perpetration, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, rape, robbery or burglary, shall be deemed murder of the first degree; and all other kinds of murder shall be deemed murder of the second degree.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b292-7" data-blocks='[["BL_292.7",292,[258,1609,1172,343]]]'>“You will observe that under our statute, to constitute murder of the first degree, the act must be a voluntary one, that is, wilful. It must be thought of beforehand, that is, premeditated; and the judgment must also concur, therefore there must be deliberation. The great'distinguishing feature of murder in the first degree is the intent to kill coupled with malice. If the act of the defendant is not wilful, deliberate and premeditated, and also malicious, together with the intent to kill, the offence is not murder of the first degree.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b292-8" data-blocks='[["BL_292.8",292,[258,1954,1176,304]]]'>“ The presumption against the prisoner rises no higher than murder in the second degree until it is shown by the Commonwealth to be murder of the first degree.

Express malice is, where one kills another with sedate, deliberate mind, and formed design, which design may be evinced by external circumstances, discovering an inward intention, as by lying in wait, former grudges, menaces and plans to do groat bodily harm.

A homicide thus perpetrated is neither excusable nor justifiable, but the grade of the offence is reduced to voluntary manslaughter. Should one kill another suddenly, and without any or a considerable provocation, the law implies malice, and the killing is murder; if the provocation was great, the offence would be manslaughter, and not murder. To reduce the offence to manslaughter it is necessary that ‘ a quarrel should take place, and blows have been interchanged between parties in some measure upon equal terms of strength and condition for fighting, and this without regard to question of who struck the first blow.’</p>

The theory of the' Commonwealth is that this was not only murder, but that it was murder of the first degree. To sustain this position the Commonwealth refers to the testimony of, especially among others, the Rev. Dr. Stuart, and the two sons of the prisoner, to prove that the parties had lived upon bad terms; that this led to downright violence, for which the prisoner was arrested and punished; that after an arbitration and award, the prisoner and his wife did not live together; that at various times he attempted to be again introduced into the house, even up to the Friday before the 18th of November; that in July last he purchased a pistol of John Worth, after two former purchases had resulted unsatisfactorily to <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>him; and especially that to Mrs. Alice Haddon, after repeated attempts to be introduced into the house in which his wife resided, and from which introduction, she, the wife, shrunk with ‘ an exclamation of terror, and ran in her room and locked the door,’ he declared she would know better than to treat him badly again, for if she would he would break her neck.</p>

To establish this proposition the defence have called fourteen or fifteen witnesses, including one physician, and they testify, subject to cross-examination, to the insanity of the prisoner. One speaks of him as always queer, a man of peculiar habits; and another, that he was £as crazy as a bed-bug;’ and on cross-examination said, that his brain was shattered. Others refer to his crying because- his hands were stained; passed out of the door of the house without speaking, and complained of his head; asked questions and gave strange answers.

It was to prevent delay in the review of capital cases in this court. It became apparent soon after the present Constitution went into effect, that the section thereof above quoted, would seriously interfere with the efficient administration of the criminal law unless the exercise of this right should be regulated by legislation. The punishment of crime should not only be certain but speedy. The result was, that in practice, writs of error were usually delayed until the death-warrant had been issued. This, under the system of return-days then in force, involved an average delay of nearly or quite a year, to which an additional year might sometimes be added, in the absence of any rule advancing such causes upon our crowded lists. The evils of such a practice were pointed out by this court, in commenting upon the Act of 1870, commonly called the Schoeppe Act (Schoeppe <em>v. </em>Com., 15 P. F. Smith 51), in which case it was said, by Agnkw, J.: “The effect of this law seems not to have excited attention. It has changed the whole doctrine of the criminal law as to the speed and certainty of punishment, and left to the felon both the hope and a door of escape, not only from the law’s delay, but by prison breach, and all the various means of avoiding retributive justice. At this moment, two cases occur to my memory of convictions of murder in Allegheny county, delayed by dilatory motions, where the prison doors opened by unknown means, and the prisoners escaped for ever. Any murderer' may, under this law, though like Probst, he may have murdered a whole family, take out his writ of error without limitation of time or condition, whether in prison under sentence, or stepping upon the trap of the gallows, with cause or without it, and suspend his case until the next term of the Supreme Court. No one could condemn him if) the death-warrant not preventing, he should wait till the term of the Supreme Court be passed, and then take out his writ of error to delay the execution of his sentence for a whole year. That only security to the public, the examination of the case and allowance of the writ for cause, is repealed.” The incorporation of the principle of the Schoeppe Act into the fundamental law, did not tend to lessen the evils above referred to. To remedy them in part, this court adopted a rule in 1877, making the first Monday of each month a special return-day in capital cases, and requiring such cases *to be heard on the fifth Monday after the writ is taken out, provided the court be in session in any part of the state. This rule, in connection with the Act of 1877, prohibiting <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>the issuing of a writ of error or certiorari more than twenty days from judgment, would seem to provide against unreasonable delays. It remains to consider whether said act is constitutional.</p>

Com. 392. It was of grace not of right. But in the third year of Queen Anne ten of the judges expressed the opinion that in all cases under treason and felony it was not merely of grace but ought to be granted; not that it was of course, but that where there was probable cause it ought not to be denied: Rex <em>v. </em>Wilkes, 4 Burr. 2550. There has been no time in this state, at least not within the last one hundred and fifty years, when a party aggrieved could not have his writ of error. The Act of 22d May 1722, § 9, 1 Sm. Laws 138, provided “that if any person or persons shall find him or themselves aggrieved with the judgment of any of the said Courts of General Quarter Sessions of the Peace and Goal Delivery, or any other courts of record within this province, it shall and may be lawful to and for the party or parties so aggrieved, to have his or their writ or writs of error; which shall be granted them of course, in manner as other writs of error are to be granted, and made returnable to the said Supreme Court of this province.” The Constitution of 1790, as amended in 1838, recognises this right. Section 5, of article 5, provided that “the party accused, as well as the Commonwealth, may, under such regulations as shall be prescribed by law, remove the indictment and proceedings, or a transcript thereof, into the Supreme Court.” The Act of 13th April 1791, 3 Dall. Laws 94, is a substantial re-enactment of the Act of 1722. It expressly provides, however, that no such writ of error or certiorari shall issue unless the same be specially allowed by the Supreme Court or one of the judges thereof, or with the consent of the attorney-general. The Act of 8th February 1848, Pamph. L. 26, provided that writs of error and certiorari may be issued to remove all cases from the criminal courts of Philadelphia when specially allowed by any of the judges of the Supreme Court. The 33d section of the Criminal Procedure Act of 1860, Pamph. L. 439, is almost a rescript of the Act of 1791. It will thus be seen that this state has always had a system providing for the review of criminal cases by the Supreme Court. It commenced with the common law, was continued by the Act of 1722; then by the Act of 1791, passed immediately after the adoption of the Constitution, and later by the Act of 1860. -Every person convicted of crime had a right to his writ of error provided he were aggrieved. It is true the writ required a special allocatur, but “when such removal is requisite for the due administration of justice, an allowance by one of the judges of this court is grant-able to the defendant of right, and <em>ex debito justitice, </em>and no judge of this court can refuse it:” Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McGinnis, <a href="/whart/2/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Whart. 113" data-case-ids="1830517" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0113-01">2 Whart. 113</a>. It was not until the Act of 15th February 1870, Pamph. L. <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>15 (Schoeppe Act), that a writ of error could be sued out without cause, for the mere purpose of delay, upon the oath of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b305-6" data-blocks='[["BL_305.6",305,[211,537,1156,299]]]'>This was the condition of the law when the recent constitutional convention assembled. That body did not change the law as it then stood, but merely incorporated the principle of the first section of the Schoeppe Act into the Constitution. For what purpose was this done? Manifestly to prevent its repeal by the legislature. The debates in the convention show this, and there could have been no other object: vol. 4, p. 232.</p>
    <p id="b305-7" data-blocks='[["BL_305.7",305,[209,837,1158,935]]]'>The Constitution then, having given a writ of error with or without cause, in a certain class of criminal cases, as a writ of right, has the legislature the power to control and regulate it ? It is conceded that the right may not be denied, nor may its exercise be unreasonably obstructed or interfered with. But may not the legislature fix return-days, and provide for a speedy hearing ? This court has already done so, by virtue of its inherent power to control its business, and we have no doubt our action was in entire harmony with the Constitution. If the time of returning the writ, or of the hearing upon it, may be limited by rule of court or Act of Assembly, why may not the time be limited during which the writ may issue of course, provided such limitation be reasonable ? If the legislature may fix no limitation whatever upon the issuing of such writs, it is not too much to say that capital punishment cannot be hereafter enforced in Pennsylvania. A writ of error taken out when the prisoner is standing upon the trap of the gallows, suspends his execution. Upon the hearing, he may suffer a <em>non pros., </em>and then, when a second death-warrant issues, renew his writ of error, and so on to the end of the dreary farce. The convention which framed the Constitution, and the people who ratified it, intended no such result as this when they incorporated the right to a writ of error into the fundamental law.</p>

In the same line of authority, what are known as stay laws, have been held to be constitutional. A state law which suspends, for a reasonable time, execution of a judgment on a prior contract, is not unconstitutional: Chadwick <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 49" data-case-ids="483301" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0049-01">8 W. &amp; S. 49</a>; Breitenbach <em>v. </em>Bush, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20313" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="8 Wright 313">8 Wright 313</a>; Huntzinger <em>v. </em>Brock, <a href="/grant/3/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Grant 243" data-case-ids="229284" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0243-01">3 Grant 243</a> ; Thompson <em>v. </em>Buckley, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.N.C.%20560" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 W.N.C. 560">3 W.

A statute punishing the carrying of concealed deadly weapons, does not infringe the 21st section of the Bill of Rights, saving the right of the citizen to bear arms in his own defence and that of the state: Wright <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 27 P. F. Smith 470. These and many other instances that might be multiplied to an indefinite extent, show that the legislature may lawfully exercise its power for- the proper regulation of even constitutional rights. The Constitution is to some extent a declaration of rights. It neither enforces itself nor the privileges which it guarantees. It is the duty of the legislature to enforce its mandates, and to see that every citizen enjoys, or has the opportunity of enjoying, the immunities which it confers. But in providing for the enjoyment of individual rights, regard must be had to the welfare of the whole body of the people. A writ of error is a legal remedy, nothing more. Without legislation to carry it into effect, the constitutional provision in question would amount to nothing. It was said in Kenyon <em>v. </em>Stewart, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20179" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="8 Wright 179">8 Wright 179</a>, that “it cannot be doubted that it is as much the right of the legislature to restrict and limit legal remedies as it is their duty to furnish them.” This right is older than any of our constitutions, or even the common law.</p>

On the contrary, it is expressly provided, by art. 5, sect. 3, that the Supreme Court “ shall have appellate jurisdiction by appeal, certiorari or writ of error in all cases, as is now or may hereafter be provided by law.” The right to legislate is clearly implied from this language. In the case in hand, the Constitution gives the right to the writ, but it is <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>for the legislature to provide for issuing it.

Is the limitation as to time reasonable? Of this we entertain no doubt. By analogy with civil proceedings, it affords a defendant all the time needed to take his writ. He can as readily issue it within twenty days as within twenty months; and if for any sufficient reason the twenty days have been allowed to pass, any one of the justices of this court has the power to allow the writ.
