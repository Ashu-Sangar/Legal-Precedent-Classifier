From the bill and answer it appeared that one Reinstein had perpetually insured certain houses in the defendant company, which houses had been mortgaged to one Altemus and the policies transferred to him as collateral security. These policies contained the following conditions :</p>

Altemus assigned the mortgages and policies to Hollis, the plaintiff, who obtained judgment on writs of scire facias,, and the properties were sold by the sheriff for an amount which did not satisfy the mortgage debt. The bill prayed that the insurance company be decreed to pay to plaintiff the'deposited premiums less ten per cent., and offered to surrender the policies on payment of the money. Mrs. Rafsnyder, who was made a, party to the bill, also claimed these premiums. After argument upon bill and answer the court, Hare, P. J., delivered the following opinion :</p>

He then conveyed the houses to Mary L. Rafsnyder, and she also received from him an assignment of the policies. The mortgages and policies were subsequently assigned by Altemus to the plaintiffs, who issued writs of scire facias which were prosecuted to judgment, and the mortgaged premises sold by the sheriff for an amount which did not satisfy the debt. The question before us is, who is entitled to the premium or deposit which was the consideration for the insurance ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-6" data-blocks='[["BL_435.6",435,[193,795,1163,303]]]'>“ The fund in controversy is claimed by the plaintiffs as the assignees of the policies and of the bonds and mortgagees which the policies were assigned to secure, by Mary L. Rafsnyder as the purchaser of the premises covered by the insurance; and finally by the Spring Garden Insurance Company, who, while alleging that her right is better than the plaintiffs’, ask to set off a demand against her growing out of an independent transaction.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It results from what has been said that the controversy turns on the following point: Is a mortgagee, to whom a permanent insurance has been assigned as a security, entitled to the premium on a sale being made of the mortgaged premises which puts an end to his insurable interest and to that of the mortgagor ? There can be little doubt that the inquiry should receive an affirmative reply. It is well settled that an assignment carries with it every incident or accessory which is essential to the use or enjoyment of the thing transferred, or that will conduce to the attainment of the end which the parties have in view ; but the case before us hardly stands in need of this principle, because the right to rescind a contract and recover back the consideration is as much a part of the contract as the right to the amount which will be due if the contract goes into effect, and may equally well be exercised by one to. whom the contract is assigned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-8" data-blocks='[["BL_435.8",435,[187,1743,1167,688]],["BL_436.1",436,[274,412,1167,475]]]'>“ The soundness of this reasoning was virtually conceded during the argument, but it was alleged to be inapplicable to [the case in hand. Agreeably to the view taken for the defence, the assignment under which the plaintiffs claim, was designed to indemnify them as mortgagees against loss by fire, and their right under it ceased when the lien of the mortgage was divested by the sheriff’s sale. This argument might be entirely just if the insurance were of their interest as mortgagees, or if an insurance effected by a mortgagor became an insurance of the mortgage on being transferred to the mortgagee. It is, however, clear on authority and principle, that such a transfer does not alter the effect or nature of the policy, which remains as it was at first an insurance of the mortgagor’s estate as the equitable owner of the premises, and that what the mortgagee acquires is not an interest in the insurance as such, but a right to appropriate the amount which may become due under the contract, to the payment of the mortgage debt.

In other words the transfer is made to him as creditor as well as mortgagee, and the effect is nearly if not quite the same as if he were merely an obligee, and had no specific lien. Hence an assignment of a policy of insurance as collateral security for a bond and mortgage will not be invalidated by the discharge of the mortgage lien, so long as the bond remains and is unpaid ; and if this is true as between the assignor and assignee it must be equally so. of one claiming by virtue of a subsequent assignment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[272,885,1171,819]]]'>“ It is no small argument in favor of the conclusion above indicated that it does exact justice among all the parties who have any right or title to the fund in dispute. The money is not only paid to the plaintiffs on account of the amount confessedly due to them on the bond, but it will go to discharge the liability which Reinstein and Mary L. Rafsnyder incurred by buying £ under and subject to’ the mortgage. Parties who deal with each other on a common basis, or in a matter in which all are interested, may reasonably be supposed to intend that the fruits of the transaction shall be appropriated in a way to be mutually beneficial, rather than to a purpose in which one or more of them are not concerned; and when there is no countervailing reason a court of equity will be guided by this presumption in distributing the fund. Such is the principle on which securities in the hands of the creditor are used to exonerate the surety, and those held by the surety to pay the debt; and it applies <em>a fortiori </em>in the present instance where the motive for depositing the premium was to secure the mortgagee, as well as to indemnify the owner of the premises, and here both objects are accomplished by awarding the money to the plaintiffs.</p>
