There can be no doubt that the attempted written disposition by Conrad Schad of his policy of life insurance was testamentary in character: Erew <em>v. </em>Clarke, 30 P. F. Smith 170. It was not to take effect, by its terms, until after his death. Not having been proved in the mode prescribed by law, it was not admissible in evidence as a will. If it had been admissible, the testator being insolvent at the time of his death, the legatee would take nothing. But it is of value, indeed necessary, in explaining Schad’s declarations and the sense in which he used the word ‘ assigned,’ in respect of his policy. Those declarations refer to an act of disposition, and the testimony of the insurance agent sufficiently identifies this writing as being that act. That writing is therefore the best <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>evidence of Schad’s intentions. The evidence of his declarations is merely secondary and referential in character. It follows that he did not make an assignment, but a testamentary disposition. The word ‘assigned’ was used in the sense of ‘willed.’ This view is strengthened by Schad’s possession of the policy; by his personal interest in keeping the policy alive; by the testimony of the insurance agent, who was the only disinterested witness called on this branch of the case; and by the payment of premiums out of funds which otherwise should have been appropriated to the claims of creditors; and is consistent with an honest purpose. The written disposition must be presumed to have been made with deliberation and care, and without any intention other than that which appears on its face.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[206,954,1158,687]]]'>“ 2. The intention of Schad with respect to his creditors in his attempted disposition of this policy can only be inferred ; there is no direct evidence. If that disposition was testamentary, it was clearly without fraud; his beneficiary would take subject to their claims ; ii it was intended as an assignment, it was certainly not made ‘ bona fide’ so far as they were concerned ; it was the fruit of property to which they were justly entitled. He was totally insolvent at the time of the alleged assignment, and so continued to the time of his death. With the proceeds of this policy constituting part of the assets of the estate, a large number of creditors will got a dividend on their claims; without it, they will get nothing, although some of them, it is fair to presume, are in as needy circumstances as this widow'. It is impossible to see upon what principle of justice or equity their title to the fund can be denied. Mrs. Schad paid nothing for it; for she had no means with which to pay. She has therefore no equity as against these creditors.”</p>
