By his will, executed in February 1848, he devised the residue of his estate to trustees, who were directed to divide and pay one-fourth of the income for life to each of his three living daughters, for their sole and separate use, and after the death of his daughters, in trust to transfer the principal on which such daughter so dying was entitled to receive the income to such persons and for such uses, intents and purposes as she might appoint, and in default of appointment to her child or children, and in default of child, to be continued under the same trust for the use and benefit of the testator’s surviving children. Mary, one of the daughters of R., died in April 1876. By her will, made in March 1876, she gave all her estate, the estate derived from her husband and the estate derived from R., to trustees to pay and divide the income among her sons and daughters for life, without liability for their debts, and upon their deaths to transfer the principal to suclq persons and for such estates as they might by will limit and appoint, and in default of appointment, to the person or persons that would take under them if they had died intestate owning the same. The donees of Mary were all living at the time of the death of R. <em>Held, </em>that the appointment by Mary, under the power contained in her'father’s will, was transgressive of the rule against perpetuities and was wholly void, and that her share of the estate must be distributed under the' clause in her father's will, which provides that for want of a will on the part of Mary her share of said principal sum shall be paid to her children in equal shares or proportions.</p>

      <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>“ A perfect definition of a perpetuity,” says Chief Justice Gibson, in Hilliard <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 Barr 334, “has not been given, and the nearest approach to it is found in Lewis on Perpetuities, ch. 12, where it is said to be a future limitation, whether executory or by way of remainder and of real or personal property, which is not to vest till after the expiration of, or which will not necessarily vest within the period prescribed by law for the creation of future estates, and which is not destructible by the person, for the time being entitled to theitfbperty subject to the future limitation, <em>except </em>with the coucurreiapof the person interested in the contingent event.” In, analogy to the restriction imposed on the creation of contingent remainders, the law has fixed the limit to the creation of executoiy interests to commence within the period of a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years, allowing for the period of gestation. It matters not how many lives there may be so that the candles are all burning at the same time, for the life of the longest liver is but a single life. “ But every executory estate which might, in any event, transgress this limit, will from its commencement bo absolutely void:” Williams on Real Property 262. When a gift is infected with the vice of its possibly exceeding the prescribed limit, it is at once and altogether void both at law and in equity : <a href="/grant/3/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Grant 158" data-case-ids="229295" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0158-01">Id. 268</a>. Future estates limited upon a life-estate which are not sure to take effect within twenty-one years and the usual fraction, after the determination of the life estate, ai’O void in their creation : Davenport <em>v. </em>Harris, <a href="/grant/3/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Grant 164" data-case-ids="229131" data-case-paths="/grant/3/0164-01">3 Grant 164</a>.

    <p id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.6",493,[229,1523,1174,863]]]'>It remains to apply these well-settled rules to the facts of this case. For this purpose the will of Mr. Ryan and the appointment of Mrs. Smith under it must be regarded as one instrument. The appointment cannot carry the estate beyond the period when bylaw the original testator could have limited it. The obvious test of the validity of the execution of the power is to write that portion of Mrs. Smith’s will into the will of Lewis Ryan. We would then have a gift to Mrs. Smith for life, then to her sons and daughters for life, remainder to their appointees. Under the authorities this would clearly bo a bad gift, for the reason that it includes children bom after the death of Mr. Ryan. It is not a sufficient answer to this to say that in point of fact there were no such after-born children, and that all of Mrs. Smith’s donees were <em>in esse </em>when Mr. Ryan died. There might have been after-born children, and because of this possibility the law strikes down the appointment as being within the rule prohibiting perpetuities. Had the gift been to her sons and daughters <em>eo nomine </em>the case might have been different: Slack <em>v. </em>Dakyns, Law Rep. 15 Eq. 307; Phipson <em>v. </em>Turner, 1 Simons 227. This could have been done by Mr. Ryan in his will, for the parties were all living when he died.</p>
