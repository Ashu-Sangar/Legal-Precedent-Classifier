The petition was signed by nineteen citizens. Defendant became the owner of five shares of stock, and a member of the association. At a regular meeting held in pursuance of the by-laws and charter, $1000 was offered for sale to the members, and defendant bid forty-one cents premium, and being the highest bidder, became entitled to the loan at that price, which gave him $590 in cash, he giving security in $1000. He took the $590 and gave his judgment-bond in accordance with the regulations of the association, and judgment was confessed thereon, December 4th 1871, and this scire facias is issued to revive it. The defendant paid from time to time after the loan was taken, and the judgment entered up to 28th of November 1874, was for the sum of $418, of which $258 was on account of stock, and $160 on account of loan. Eines were duly charged against him for default of payment on stock and loan computed up to and including April 1878, $67.75; to December 1876, $51.75. [The defendant had paid up to 28th of October 1871, the time of loan, $108, which was for stock and fines, or stock alone, the evidence does not show which, but which fact we consider immaterial in this case.] His last payment to plaintiff was 28th of November 1874. The plaintiff claims $1000, with interest to date, crediting $160, the amount paid on loan, with the fines properly recoverable, and five per cent, attorney’s fee. And this he is entitled to recover unless the claim of usury is sustained. We are of the opinion that the plaintiff was incorporated under the Act of 12th of April 1859, which allows any amount of interest to be taken without becoming usurious, and the defence fails ■ upon that ground, and therefore plaintiff is entitled to have judgment for $1000, with interest, less $160, the amount paid, the amount of fines properly collectable, and five per cent, attorney’s fees for collection. Evidence was given of fines assessed to December 1876, $51.75, and to and including April 1878, $67.75. It seems to me that neither is the proper period, but that there should be no fines on either stock or loan allowed, after the period when plaintiff was <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>entitled to sue for the whole unpaid balance of loan and unpaid balances of stock subscription, that is six months from the last payment made by defendant on his stock or loan, to wit: six months after the 28th of November 1874. My reason for this view is this : <em>1 </em>By-Law’ No. 7, entitled Borrowing Stockholders, and subject to which this loan is specially taken, provides, when default in payment of stock, or interest or either has continued for six months, credit on the obligation shall cease, and the whole amount become due and payable, and legal proceedings shall at once be commenced to enforce payment of the obligation, fines, indebtedness and all other changes.</p>

This association has no provision of that kind, and is unlimited in duration. The first section of the second article of this association provides, “ that any member wishing to withdraw from the association, shall be entitled to receive from the treasurer the amount he has paid in as dues, first deducting his fines, if any, and his proportion of the expenses and losses that the association may have sustained during his membership, and provided that he gives at least two weeks’ notice to the board of directors of his intention to withdraw.” The second section of the Act of 1859 provides: “Any stockholder wishing to withdraw from the said corporation, shall have power to do so, by giving thirty days’ notice of his or her intention to withdraw, when he or she shall be entitled to receive the amount, paid in by him or her, and such proportion of the profits as the by-laws may determine, less all fines or other charges.” The first section of the eighth article of this association provides: “Any member who shall fail to pay his dues and interest, if any, shall pay a fine of ten cents in each case for each and every share for every regular meeting so failing, and when the amount of such fines and dues shall equal the amount he has paid in on such share or shares, shall be forfeited to the association.”</p>

    <p id="b214-8" data-blocks='[["BL_214.10",214,[245,976,1174,1289]]]'>. A building and loan association, organized under the Act of Assembly of April 12th 1859, Pamph. L. 544, is a species of partnership for dealing in money. The borrower has often to pay very large interest, and if he fails so as not eventually to secure the advantages of his contract, it seems very hard, even cruel, to exact so heavy a forfeiture. Yet he became a member of the association in view of the large profits expected to accrue from these heavy discounts to the common fund. Had he continued to pay, when the association wound up he would have received his full share of his own discount as well as those of others. It would require $5 per' annum to pay off $100 in twenty years, and the interest during the same period, crediting each payment on the principal, would be $77. Our building associations often wind up in six or eight years, that is their common fund becomes equal to $200 a share, to be distributed to the members or applied in discharge of their loans. Thus it will be seen that the borrower at usury is himself also a lender at usury, and if he can, by economy and self-denial, manage to make his payments, is sure to come out in the end a large gainer. It would be very unjust to those who thus make their payments' regularly, if the court, from sympathy for those who have fallen behindhand, should refuse to enforce the obligations. Thousands of these associations have been organized and been wound up without their names ever appearing on the docket of the court, and millions of dollars have been accumulated from the savings of scanty wages. However it may be elsewhere, Philadelphia has become emphatically a city of comfortable homes for the poor by means of these organizations. The question in this case was submitted to the learned judge below under the Act of 1874, without the intervention of the jury. He has reported the facts with his opinion, and we affirm the judgment for the reasons he has stated.</p>
