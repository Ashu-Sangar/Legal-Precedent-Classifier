Bentley, is the life-tenant of a tract of land containing 100 acres, situated in Union township, Washington county, Pennsylvania, and on the line of the road between Pittsburgh and Monongahela City.' The company, by its agents, .engineers, &amp;c., entered upon this land in June 1872, and located their road, and completed its construction some time during that year. They occupy 2.7 acres by their, appropriation, and run through <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>it a distance of 1970 feet. The road divides the farm, leaving 20 acres of bottom land between it and the river, upon which is erected the mansion-house, spring-house and other necessary buildings; and 77.3 acres across the road, from the river, part of which is bottom land. The county road is located above the railroad, and runs nearly parallel with it, at a distance of about 200 feet. The barnyard and barn of the plaintiff are situated on this part of the land lying between the county road and the railroad. The mansion-house is situated probably 100 yards, and the barn probably 50 yards from the line of the railroad. The frontage of the tract on the river is not very great, and the twenty-acre tract lies in the shape of a parallelogram, the distance along the river being from one-half to two-thirds greater than the distance from the river to the railroad, which ranges from 500 to 700 feet. The road passes through the farm by means of a “cut,” the extreme depth of which is nine feet, ranging from that to grade. The company have constructed a good and substantial crossing at the point where the road crosses the lane which leads from the mansion to the county road and to the barn, the .lane remaining the same as before the location of the railroad.</p>

The court entertained the petition and appointed viewers, who subsequently reported that the land appropriated amounted to 2.7 acres; that the annual value thereof was $8.15 per acre, and the aggregate value during the lifetime of the petitioner was $440, and that the petitioner had sustained a total damage, including the value of the land taken, of $900. From this award the defendant appealed. On the trial of the appeal the plaintiff testified that her age in June 1872, the date of the entry, was 52 years, and life-tables showing that her expectancy of life was 18.4 years, were offered in evi- - dence. She claimed the annual value per acre of the land appropriated for this period of time, and in addition the sum paid by her for the building of the fence along both sides of the appropriation, which she said amounted to $500. She also claimed damages for the inconvenience of “crossing at the lane,” stating, “We have to cross a great many times a day; cows are fed and kept at the barn and have to be brought to the house in the morning and evening to be milked. Trains have to be watched.” Also, for the cutting off of -water from one of her fields which fronts on the Monongahela river, and for the loss of drainage from the barnyard. She produced evidence that “six passenger trains passed each day;” that it would be “quite a difficulty and disadvantage to bring the cows to milk,” and that “the delay caused by having to halt or stop in crossing” the railroad was a great inconvenience, &amp;c. The estimates upon these several items varied somewhat, but the average <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>amount fixed by her witnesses upon this last item — “ the danger of ! .crossing the track”-^-was $25 to $30 per annum.

Could not feed straw in barnyard.” The 'defendants requested the court to say to the jury that this element of possible loss could not enter into and form part of their verdict.

Now, this affords only an imperfect standard, by which to judge of the injury done to the plaintiff’s life estate, or of the advantages accruing to it from the railroad.

As tenant for life, Mrs. Bentley held a peculiarly valuable interest in this land,- inasmuch as it was precisely commensurate with her need, and was identified with all the accumulated comforts and advantages of a lifelong home. For all these we are well aware she could recover no damages. But under her tenancy, she could either rent the land, house, &amp;c., and pursue some other occupation to add to her means of living, in which case the rental value of the land would have been her measure of damage perhaps, leaving her lessee to recover for injuries to his use and enjoyment of it: Ripka <em>v. </em>Sergeant, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="481743" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0009-01">7 W. &amp; S. 9</a>; injuries to crops, fences, &amp;c., and by occupation of land: Plank Road <em>v. </em>Thomas, 8 Harris 91; Turnpike <em>v. </em>Brosi, 10 <a href="/watts-serg/7/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="481743" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0009-01">Id. 29</a>; loss of term, &amp;c.: North Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Davis, 2 Casey 238. Or, she could — as in fact .she did— <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>retain the land, employing upon it the necessary capital in agricultural implements, teams, cattle, and other stock; hiring labor of others and using her own capabilities in carrying on business, and thus realize for herself the profit of the tenant in addition to that of the landlord, and be entitled to corresponding damages for loss of both.</p>

Hence it wras proper for the court to lay down a rule as to the valuation of the life-estate in this case as an independent interest entitled to damages. Wo cannot say that the net annual value of the premises multiplied by the years the life-tenant’s expectancy of life, and reduced by calculation to a present cash value is an incorrect mode of determining the value of the life-estate as compared with the value of the remainder in fee. This is all we understand the court did in the answers to the points. But the court gave the true rule for valuing the damages as a whole, which is the difference between the property before the making of the road and its value after the road is made, and as affected by it. Of this difference the life-tenant is entitled to the proportion of the whole which the value of the life-estate bears to the whole dif<a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>ference.

Clearly permanent injuries arising from severing parts that have a necessary relation to each other, inconveniences and other matters, are elements in considering the value of an entire farm.</p>
