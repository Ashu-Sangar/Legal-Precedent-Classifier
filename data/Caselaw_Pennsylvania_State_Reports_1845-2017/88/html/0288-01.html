In the hurry of trial, the learned judge appears to have overlooked the effect of this alleged payment by the maker, and failed to submit the question to the jury. It is true the court charged that if the plaintiff purchased the notes he could recover their full amount; but if he held them as collateral he could recover only the amount due him on the original debt. So far as this goes it was correct under the authority of Appleton <em>v. </em>Donaldson, 3 Barr 381. But those two questions both found against the plaintiff were insufficient to defeat a recovery against the defendant. The plaintiff having obtained the notes in good faith he might maintain an action on them in his own name, although the right of property therein had again passed to the payee. Whether the plaintiff sued for himself, or as trustee for the payee, constituted no defence for the maker, unless he was thereby deprived 'of some equitable defence which he may have had as against the payee: 2 Pars. on Notes and Bills 437; Whiteford <em>v. </em>Burckmyer, <a href="/gill/1/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Gill 127" data-case-ids="1016718" data-case-paths="/gill/1/0127-01">1 Gill. 127</a>; Mauran <em>v. </em>Lamb, 7 Cowen 174; Dean <em>v. </em>Hewit, <a href="/wend/5/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Wend. 257" data-case-ids="2145724" data-case-paths="/wend/5/0257-01">5 Wend. 257</a>; Brown <em>v. </em>Clark, 2 Harris 469; Pearce <em>v. </em>Austin, <a href="/whart/4/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Whart. 489" data-case-ids="1835038" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0489-01">4 Whart. 489</a>; Holmes <em>v. </em>Paul, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Am.%20Law%20Reg.%20482" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="6 Am.

It therefore follows the learned judge erred in instructing the jury, that if the notes were held as collateral, the plaintiff could recover only the amount he showed to be due on the original debt, without adding that they must also find the defendant had paid the excess, due from him on the notes, to the payee.</p>
