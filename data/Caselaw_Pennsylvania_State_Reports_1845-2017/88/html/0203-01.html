In a second ejectment against him, he sought to avoid the effect of this decision, by showing that he had not participated in a certain act of his co-executor in returning the land for appraisement, and that he had not in fact accepted the deed vesting title in himself when said answer was made. The court ruled the case on the authority of the first decision, and directed a verdict for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that this was not error.</p>

Bruner treated it as a conveyance, and as soon as the plaintiff in error requested it was delivered to him. Substantially then we think he stands on no firmer ground than on the former trial. Judgment affirmed.</p>
