Plumley and John A. Franks, holding forth as members and officers, and acting under color of the name and style of the Humano Fire Company of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia, and also the Humane Fire Company of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia,” to recover two shares, to which they alleged themselves to be entitled as members in the property, real and personal, of the defendant corporation, which it was further set forth had in part been converted and divided among the other members thereof.</p>

The answer of the defendants denied that plain tiffs were members of the corporation. The case was referred to a master, who reported that Smith was a member of the corporation at the time of the above-mentioned distribution, and that he was entitled to a distributive share thereof, and made a decree that defendants should pay him $2713.38. The court dismissed the exceptions filed to this report and confirmed the same. From this decree this appeal was taken. It appearing that Jordan never was a member, the bill as to him was dismissed.</p>

Smith, one of the complainants, is now and was, at the time of the distribution above mentioned and set forth, a member of the Humane Fire Company, and as such entitled to a distributive share of its estate and property, and thereupon reported the following decree which was adopted by the court, to wit: “ That of the assets distributed by the Humane Fire Company of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia, there is due the plaintiff the sum of $2713.38. That the defendants, the Humane Fire Company of the City and Liberties of Philadelphia, John M. Melloy, George W. Plumley and John A.

Now if this assumption be correct, then is the conclusion also correct; but if it be so that this property belonged to the company and not to its memhers, then is this conclusion wrong and the decree founded upon it is also wrong. This is not a trading corporation designed to make money for its shareholders, whose money has purchased its property and in which property every such shareholder has a right, proportioned to the amount of his contribution, but it is a charity, incorporated as a public benefaction, and it consequently holds its property, which has been contributed by the public, in trust for that public. There are no shareholders in companies of this kind, and if any contributions have been made to this company by the members thereof, they were made as gifts and donations for the public good, and these members themselves are but <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>trustees and agents to carry into effect this charitable organization. That a voluntary association of individuals, who have contributed funds for a purely public purpose, will be regarded as a charity was ruled in Thomas <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, 1 Pars. 98; and that such association has been incorporated alters neither its design nor nature, but only gives it a legal status which it would not otherwise possess. Such being the case, it is very clear that when the members of this company undertook to divide among themselves the corporate property, they did so without right. At that time they had no shadow of title in that property, and but for the act passed May 28th 1872, Pamph. L. 1171, never could have such title. That act, in effect, donates the property of the corporation to such as may be members thereof when it is dissolved, but in order to produce this result the terms of the statute must be complied with, and without such compliance, the corporate members acquire nothing. It follows that Smith had no property in the assets of the Humane Eire Company, and if the respondents, wrongfully and without right, appropriated such assets, the wrong done was to the corporation and not to him, and so he has no personal redress. The company is in full life and ought to be both able and willing to take care of its own affairs. If there were no other obstacle in the way of the plaintiff, this would be an insuperable one, for he is endeavoring to set up and enforce a corporate right in his own favor and for his own purposes; this cannot be done. Neither can he, as he now stands, maintain this bill for the company; for as is said in Grant on Corp. 73, it is a rule in equity that a suit by an individual shareholder of an incorporated company complaining of an injury to the corporation, cannot be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff has the means of procuring a suit to be instituted in the name of the corporation itself; and this rule is held to apply equally whether the subject-matter of complaint be an act or transaction which is merely voidable at the discretion of the majority of shareholders, or an act or transaction absolutely illegal and incapable of being confirmed by a majority. Of course, the rule here announced must apply with equal or greater force to public charities where the individual member has no personal interest in the corporate assets. Now, from the bill, which we have under consideration, it does not appear that the plaintiff ever attempted to procure the corporation to move in this matter, or ever required it to take the necessary steps to recover the property of which it was despoiled: yet, as we have seen, this was a <em>sine qua non </em>to the plaintiff’s right to act for it.</p>

This would apply, in some cases, with much force to trading corporations, but not to a <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>charity, for a charity has no property which it can thus dispose of. It is but a trustee for the public and to give its assets to its members would be a perversion of such trust.</p>
