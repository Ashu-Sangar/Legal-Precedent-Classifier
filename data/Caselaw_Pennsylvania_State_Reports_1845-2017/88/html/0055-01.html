That pursuant to said act park commissioners were duly appointed by the councils of said city, who proceeded to convert the common grounds in said city, in the years 1867 . and 1868, into public parks, and, inter alia, did, under the sections thereof aforementioned, cause plans of the city as it then was to be furnished by the recording regulator, with the lots and their size marked thereon, as in the eighth section of said act is directed, and ' the said commissioners then did assess on the lots and lands within the boundaries of said city, an amount equal to the interest on bonds <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>issued for said park improvement, and payable the first year thereafter, and twenty thousand dollars in addition thereto, as by the seventh section of said act directed, and, it is believed, the said commissioners prepared a schedule of assessments so made, graduating the amounts to be paid by the several classifications of property in said city at said date, which said taxes in the year 1869 were collected by the treasurer of said city. That the plans and schedules aforesaid at said date, to wit, on the first day of January 1869, did not include any part of the plaintiffs’ said lands, or Tenth Ward aforesaid, and that under the provisions of the act aforesaid, the said commissioners, having made their first assessment of said tax according to the plans and schedules aforesaid, and returned the same for collection to the treasurer of said city, as was done prior to said first day of January 1869, could not lawfully thereafter enlarge the plans and basis of assessments, or extend the same over lands thereafter annexed to said city; neither could the treasurer of said city include in his assessments land annexed to the city after the first assessment made by the commissioners aforesaid, and extend said assessment over the lands of the plaintiffs annexed to said city in the year 1873. That under the provisions of said act the plaintiffs’ said lands cannot be legally assessed with said tax, inasmuch as the turnpike and plank-roads aforesaid owned by incoi'porated companies aforesaid, to wit: the Allegheny and Perrysville Plank-road Company, and the Saw-mill Valley Plank Company, are not streets of said city, and further because the said tax is not assessed on the foot frontage of plaintiff's’ lands on the streets, lanes and alleys of said city, but upon each tract, lot or farm at -per acre, without regard to the frontage thereof. And that they are informed and believe, that the tax aforesaid, assessed for park purposes for the year 1876, was not assessed by the treasurer of said city in accordance with said act, but that the amount of said tax to be collected was returned to him for collection with other city taxes, and that the pretended assessment thereof is illegal and void under any aspect of the case.</p>

    <p id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.8",57,[234,497,1170,1212]]]'>The object of this bill was to restrain the collection of municipal taxes levied on lands of the complainants. The territory in which these lands are situate, was annexed to, and brought within the city of Allegheny, under the Act of 10th March 1871, Pamph. L. 304. The eighth section of the act declares “ that when, at any time, the two-thirds of the property holders of said district shall petition the councils of said city to be admitted into and become a part thereof, such described territory may be admitted into said city by resolution of the councils thereof, and shall thereafter be subject to all laws and ordinances governing the same.” In pursuance of the act and according to its provisions, more than two-thirds of the property owners of the district, then called “North End,” petitioned the councils of the city to be admitted into and become a part of the same. By resolution of the councils and proclamation of the mayor, the district was duly admitted into said city. That the substantial forms of law were complied with, cannot be successfully denied. Tho slight technical objections made are insufficient to affect the regularity of the proceedings annexing the territory. In fact, they were not pressed on the argument. The strong ground of objection was, that the territory was not improved city property, but was composed of suburban and rural lands; and that “ the lands and occupants thereof enjoy no city conveniences; and in return for the taxes levied and collected, they receive no appreciable benefits, beyond what they enjoyed before.” Therefore it is claimed that the taxes are illegally assessed, and the collection of them is contrary to equity and the provisions of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, prohibiting tho taking of private property for public use without rendering due compensation therefor.</p>
    <p id="b57-7" data-blocks='[["BL_57.9",57,[231,1710,1172,735]]]'>All the objections made to municipal taxes, levied on property of like character, were most carefully considered, after being twice argued, in the recent case of Kelly <em>v. </em>City of Pittsburgh, 4 Norris 170. The authorities on which the counsel for the appellant now relies, were there cited and examined. This court, nevertheless, held the taxes valid. The conclusion at which we then arrived, remains unshaken. It is unnecessary to repeat tho many sound reasons therefor, given in the opinion of our brother Gordon. Any other conclusion would be a denial of that discretion which the Constitution gives to the legislature. An act extending the limits of a municipal corporation, and subjecting the property thereby included, to taxation, is clearly within legislative power. Its wisdom or discretion ■we cannot review. Possessing the whole taxing power, we cannot interfere with its exercise unless it be so grossly perverted as to be in manifest violation of the Constitution. The authority to the city, to impose municipal taxes, on all the lands within the district in question, is no such violation.</p>

A further answer to that part of the bill is this. The 3d sect, of the Act of 25th March 1878, cured all irregularities and defects in the taxes theretofore levied for park purposes. If the legislature has antecedent power to levy a tax, it can, by a retroactive law, cure an irregularity, or want of authority in the persons levying it: Grim <em>v. </em>Weissenberg School District, 7 P. F. Smith 433. So a statute which makes valid a municipal ordinance, void for want of jurisdiction, and the contract made under it, is constitutional: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Marshall, 19 Id. 328.
