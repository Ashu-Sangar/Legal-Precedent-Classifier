It is some evidence that Cochran, this insured, had a right to suppose his policy had not been forfeited by the company. It gave thirty days in which that 1874 assessment might have been paid. The loss at that time would not excuse the company from receiving that assessment, nor would it excuse them from paying the loss. Hence we say these points defendant asks us to charge you on we deny. We refuse to take the case away from the jury. We submit it upon these two matters. You will take notice you will not find a verdict against the evidence. Take into consideration this 1873 assessment. If Cochran, at this interview in the summer of 1873, simply told Bemis to go and pay this ninety cents to the insurance company — in other words, made him his agent of transfer to pay this money to the insurance company— that is not a good payment, and Cochran must suffer for submitting his business to Mr. Bemis. But if Cochran paid Bemis anything, even paid by work, as I understand this payment of ninety cents, if Bemis was the agent of the company, well known, Cochran having got this policy from him, we say that was a good payment, and the waiver, if you believe that, does not enter into the case.”</p>

Within two or three days after the fire, the defendant in error went to the office of the company, and informed the secretary of the loss, and offered to pay some previous assessment. The evidence is conflicting as to whether it was to pay both the previous assessments, or the earlier one only. The secretary refused to accept the sum offered. Hampson, a witness on the part of the defendant in error, testified that the secretary “ said the policy had been forfeited; there was no use in coming there; would not look at the money ; would not look at the assessment; said the policy was forfeited, and the company would not pay it, and there was no use bothering anything about it.” This interview was at the office of the company and with its principal officer. If this evidence is believed, there was a distinct declaration that the company would not pay the loss, by reason of the forfeiture of the policy. It was fairly within the province of the jury to say whether the declaration, “ there was no use bothering anything about it,” did not reasonably import that it was useless to make any proofs of loss. The company already had notice of the fire, the only remaining act was to make the formal proofs. A jury might well find that both parties underderstood the language used referred to proofs of loss. If the objection to pay was then put solely on the ground of forfeiture, and the defendant in error induced to make no formal proofs of loss, the company could not, afterwards, successfully plead the absence of such proof.

The company may waive the right of avoidance, and then the contract relation is not wholly dissolved ; but the protection of the policy is suspended until the default of non-payment is removed. No recovery can, therefore, be had for a loss sustained during the continuance of such default: Hummel &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 28 P. F. Smith 320; Columbia Ins.

As long as the assessment remained unpaid beyond thirty days after duly demanded, so long the protection of the policy continued suspended. The assessment of April 1873 was demanded soon after it was made. An acceptance of its payment at any time before the fire would have restored the former efficacy of the policy. If the holder thereof was in default when the loss was sustained, the company was not' bound to afterwards accept payment of the assessment. There was, therefore, no evidence that the company, before the fire, waived any right which it had acquired by reason of default in the payment of the assessment made in April 1873.</p>
    <p id="b232-8" data-blocks='[["BL_232.8",232,[261,1909,1167,346]]]'>The remaining question is, was the assessment paid before the fire occurred? It appears by the evidence that in June 1873, one Keiling was at work on a house for Bemis. Part of the time the defendant in error worked there for Keiling, and afterwards for Bemis. Bemis was authorized to act as agent for the company “in taking insurance in said company; receiving fees for the same; collecting six per cent, of the premium-note at the time it is given, and receipt therefor.”</p>

In this there was error. As already shown, Bemis was an agent with limited powers, having no authority to collect assessments even in money. It does not appear that he ever assumed or exercised any such power. The fact that the policy was procured by him created no legal presumption that he was authorized to receive assessments subsequently made. The notice given of the assessment directed that the money be remitted by draft or post-office order, or paid at the office of the company. This gave no color of excuse to pay to an unauthorized agent. Cochran did no work for the company. It is not pretended that Bemis had any specific authority from the company to receive the payment in that manner. He did not account for it to the company in any maimer. There was no ratification of his agreement. The company never received the money, and there was no offer of payment until after the fire. If Bemis had been authorized to receive payment of assessments in money, an attempted payment in labor to Bemis personally would have been no payment to the company. One partner cannot discharge a debt due to the firm of which he is a member, in consideration of work rendered for his individual benefit. Equally as great mischief, and more confusion, would result from holding that a debtor to an insurance company may pay an assessment levied to pay losses, by an individual trade, exchange or barter with an agent. It cannot be done. The second point of the plaintiff in error should have been affirmed, and the second and fourth assignments are sustained.</p>
