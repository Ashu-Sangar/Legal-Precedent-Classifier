    <p class="summary" id="b129-12" data-blocks='[["BL_129.12",129,[215,1477,1165,982]]]'>Margaret Foster died in Iowa in 1875. In her lifetime she had sold certain real estate in Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, and had taken a mortgage thereon upon which there was due, at the time of her death, a balance of $485. The register of Allegheny county granted letters of administration to James Evans, who collected this balance, and duly accounted therefor. On the 20th of September 1876, this account was taken to the Orphans’ Court for audit, the balance for distribution being $380. Before the auditor, Ellen Barry, a resident of Iowa, presented a claim founded upon two promissory notes given by the decedent, Margaret Foster, which aggregated $500. A commission was issued and testimony taken in Iowa, and the cause was continued until 3878, when it was heard and held under advisement. No other claims were presented to the court. On the 2d day of February 1878, after the hearing, and without notice to the claimant or her counsel, the court allowed to be filed a certificate that letters of administration had been granted on the decedent’s estate, on the 8th of April 1875, at Dubuque, Iowa, to A. K. Foster.' It appeared from this certificate that the claim of appellant under the law of Iowa was barred by reason of its not having been presented to the administrator in Iowa, within the prescribed time after his appointment. The promissory notes, which were made in Iowa, were valid under the laws of that state.</p>

Foster, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the fund in the hands of James Evans, administrator, after deducting costs of audit, &amp;c., be paid to Alexander R.

This may sometimes operate hardly, as it seems to do on the appellant in this case, who fears that she is barred by not having put in her claim in time to the foreign administrator. That she must impute to her own mistake or neglect. But the general rule is a just and wise one. On any other we might give preference to one creditor over another, and debar, perhaps, those interested in the decedent’s estate from availing themselves of a legal defence to the claim. The matter of the first assignment does not seem to have been made an exception in the court below ; if it had been, no doubt the required authentication of the record of the grant of administration in Iowa could have been obtained.</p>
