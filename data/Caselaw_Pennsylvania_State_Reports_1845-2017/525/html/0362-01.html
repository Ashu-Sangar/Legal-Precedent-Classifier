Kellington’s testimony was quite lengthy and very detailed regarding the circumstances which led to the death of Thomas Sacco, the victim herein. According to Kellington, the murder was the culmination of a conspiracy orchestrated among William “Eggy” Prosdocimo, Miles Gabler and appellant.</p>
    <p id="b615-5" data-blocks='[["BL_615.5",615,[165,604,1150,686]]]'>To set the stage for the events surrounding the actual killing, Kellington gave the jury certain background information about the relationship of Sacco and himself to the conspirators in order to establish a motive for the murder. Kellington told of his own lengthy relationship as a distributor for Eggy Prosdocimo, a man who made his living as a drug dealer, specializing in the illicit sale and distribution throughout Pittsburgh of dilaudid. Sacco, whom Kellington had known all his life, also worked for Prosdocimo as a distributor of drugs. Kellington testified that he had only met the appellant a few months before the murder. Kellington believed that appellant was also involved in distributing drugs for Prosdocimo.</p>
    <p id="b615-6" data-blocks='[["BL_615.6",615,[164,1308,1150,678]]]'>The relationship between Sacco and Prosdocimo began to deteriorate over the issue of money. Sacco was in debt to Prosdocimo in excess of $4,000 for drugs Sacco was to have sold on consignment. As their business relationship soured, the personal animosity between the two men escalated. A series of events involving name-calling and threats to each other of personal violence erupted. During one of these incidents shortly before the murder, Prosdocimo offered Kellington $1,500 to “mess up” Sacco. The final act by Sacco, precipitating Prosdocimo’s desire to eliminate him, was Sacco’s threat to give information about Prosdocimo’s drug network to a particular Pittsburgh police narcotics detective.</p>
    <p id="b615-7" data-blocks='[["BL_615.7",615,[164,2012,1150,312]]]'>Two weeks before the murder, appellant introduced Kellington to the last member of the conspiracy, Miles Gabler.

According to Kellington, it was appellant who suggested to Prosdocimo the idea of using Gabler to murder Sacco.</p>

    <p id="b616-5" data-blocks='[["BL_616.5",616,[270,560,1151,414]]]'>At some time prior to this meeting, appellant had provided Kellington with a .357 magnum which Kellington kept at his apartment. During the discussion of how to kill Sacco, Kellington told appellant where he kept the weapon and how many bullets were presently in the gun. The murder weapon was never recovered, but the bullets that killed Sacco were the same caliber as those that Kellington stated he knew were in the gun when it was handed to Gabler.</p>
    <p id="b616-6" data-blocks='[["BL_616.6",616,[268,994,1151,466]]]'>An initial plan was reached to attempt to “hit” Sacco that evening, as they believed he would be at the Red Door night club in Pittsburgh. After appellant and Prosdocimo left the apartment, Gabler expressed ddubts to Kellington about actually having to kill Sacco. Kellington advised him that if he did not want to kill Sacco, he could just shoot him in the leg and pretend that he had tried to kill him. Kellington arrived at the Red Door later that evening and learned that this first attempt had failed.</p>
    <p id="b616-7" data-blocks='[["BL_616.7",616,[266,1479,1149,467]]]'>A few days later Thomas Sacco was fatally shot while standing on the sidewalk in front of an after hours club frequented by all the players in this particular crime network. Kellington arrived at the club, known as Butchie’s, prior to the shooting. As he approached the entrance he saw appellant sitting in a car in 'front of the club. Appellant asked him if he would be around that evening. When Kellington responded affirmatively, appellant said, “I might need you.”</p>

According to Kellington, appellant had lured Sacco to this location by offering to sell him drugs. While Kellington was talking on the telephone, he observed Sacco and two other men go outside. Immediately thereafter, Kellington heard what sounded like a firecracker. Kellington emerged from the club and saw Sacco lying on the <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>ground. He bent over the body and ascertained that Sacco was still alive, but quickly went back into the club as the police approached.</p>

Learning that Sacco was not dead, appellant instructed Kellington to obtain further information and then meet him in Hazelewood at another club known as the Chasmar. Shortly thereafter, Kellington discovered that Sacco was dead and proceeded to the Chasmar lounge where he met appellant, Prosdocimo and Gabler.</p>
    <p id="b617-6" data-blocks='[["BL_617.6",617,[207,923,1151,314]]]'>The four men met alone in a back room with the gun allegedly used in the murder on the table before them.

Rossi testified that he had known appellant for fifteen years prior to the shooting and that over a six month period appellant told him two or three times that a man named Gabler had killed Sacco and that appellant was going to kill Gabler when it was all over. Appellant also indicated to Rossi that appellant had been paid for the killing.
