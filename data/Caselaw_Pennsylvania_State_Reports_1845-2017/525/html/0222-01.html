Act of March 4,1971, P.L. 6, No. 2, art. VI, § 602 as amended, 72 P.S. § 7602. Stewart Honeybee, the taxpayer herein, claimed that it was entitled to the manufacturing exemption for the years 1980 and 1981, and sought review before Commonwealth Court of the decisions of the Board of Finance and Revenue, which denied the manufacturing exemption. The cases for 1980 and 1981 were consolidated, and a panel of Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board’s denial of the manufacturing exemption. 118 Pa.Cmwlth. 430, <a href="/pa-commw/118/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="545 A.2d 468" data-case-ids="1375465" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/118/0430-01">545 A.2d 468</a> (1988).

Skill involves education, learning, experience or knowledge one acquires in a particular business, trade or profession; while labor is the physical characteristics and methods utilized to employ one’s skills. When labor is used in conjunction with skill to produce a different product than the original, one with a new identity, manufacturing has occurred.</blockquote>

The unrefined honey is first tested for moisture content. It is then placed over a stainless steel batch tank in a room where the temperature is raised to 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The raw honey then becomes partially liquified. Next, the honey is pumped into a mixing tank where it is blended with diatomaceous earth. In the fourth phase, the honey is placed in a heat exchanger which destroys bacteria and microorganisms and reduces moisture content. The pasteurized honey is then pumped through an elaborate filtration system which removes foreign matters (beeswax, wood chips, bee body parts, etc.). After filtration, the honey is pumped through a stainless steel plate cooling exchanger. Finally, the honey is transfer<a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>red to an automatic packaging line used to fill and cap plastic containers.

These substances “exert a very great influence on the properties of honey,” including its color, aroma, viscosity, and flavor. Root, <em>The ABC and XYZ of Bee Culture </em>at 350 (1947).
