Specifically devised property is plainly within the range of property subject to sale. Also, it cannot <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>be said that Paragraph 8 is inconsistent with the existence of specific devises, for it is possible for both specific devises and broad executors’ powers of sale to coexist.

This case does not, however, involve a dispute over the source from which debts are to be paid. The property at issue was not sold for the purpose of paying debts. The majority’s emphasis is clearly misplaced. By inferring from Paragraph 5 that Decedent might have preferred that the property not be sold, the proper focus of this case has been distorted. We are called upon to decide what Decedent <em>authorized, </em>not what Decedent in hindsight might have <em>preferred.</em>

The decision reached, however, undermines this purpose by making it impossible for executors, and for purchasers of estate property, to rely upon express statements of executors’ powers set forth in wills.
