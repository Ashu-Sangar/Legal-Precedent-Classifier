    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[208,883,1156,961]]]'>Since the Rules of Civil Procedure are inapplicable to statutory appeals, rules of practice and procedure did not have to be enacted in strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 239. Rather, our trial courts have had the right to enact rules and publish these to cover practice in this area of the law. Where they have not created and published such local rules, then each trial court has been vested with the full authority of the court to make rules of practice for the proper disposition of cases before them and that we have enforced those rules unless they violated the Constitution or laws of the Commonwealth or United States, or our state-wide rules. The general, inherent power of all courts to regulate their own practice, without control, on the ground of expediency, has been recognized by this court for almost one hundred and eighty years, (see <em>My tin’s Estate, </em><a href="/watts/7/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="7 Watts 64" data-case-ids="1846795" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0064-01">7 Watts 64</a> (1838); <em>Vanatta v.

We also glean a willingness on the part of our brethren to seize the technical designation of “post-trial relief” as a weapon to impale innocent members of the bar who have resorted to that designation when they really meant to file “exceptions,” and we are disappointed that the court has not been willing to look behind the technical designation to see the filing for what the parties and the trial court understood it to be.</p>

Our precedents have recognized the practice of inviting exceptions in tax assessment cases, and it is interesting to note that we have never imposed this step on the trial courts but have merely recognized that if they feel that such a practice is beneficial to them, who are we to interfere with the trial court’s regulation of the practice before it.</p>

    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[234,838,1160,1105]]]'>I am not persuaded that our prior decisions in <em>Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company’s Assessment Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/225/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="225 Pa. 272" data-case-ids="965254" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0272-01">225 Pa. 272</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=74%20A.%2065" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="74 A. 65">74 A. 65</a> (1909), <em>Thompson’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/271/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="271 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="295667" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0225-01">271 Pa. 225</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20A.%20774" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="114 A. 774">114 A. 774</a> (1921), and <em>Chester Holding Corp.

In <em>Lehigh, </em>the issue was whether the lower court, sitting en banc, had erred in refusing to consider the exceptions filed from the trial’s court’s decision. The en banc court had refused to hear the exceptions on the ground that there had been no valid trial or proceeding by the board of revision. The dispute centered' only oh the deficiencies in the proceeding before review was sought in common pleas court. The en banc court had concluded that the assessment and records in the office of the county commissioners were so irregular that an appeal would not lie to the common pleas court. We held that the appeal in the proceeding was taken properly and that the lower court had a duty to review the issues raised. The question of the proper procedure in the appeal before the common please court was not in issue.</p>
    <p id="b340-5" data-blocks='[["BL_340.5",340,[231,1971,1155,312]],["BL_341.1",341,[227,255,1157,935]]]'>In <em>Thompson’s Appeal, </em>an appeal was taken from the board of revision’s tax valuations to the court of common pleas. It was the practice for the. entire court of three judges to hear all of the cases. After all of the evidence was submitted, one of the judges was designated as a reviewing judge to analyze the evidence and make findings <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>of fact. The reviewing judge did so and nisi decrees were then filed. Exceptions were filed to the three judge court, a majority of which disagreed with the findings of the reviewing judge. The unsuccessful party then argued on appeal that the reviewing judge’s findings should be treated as though made by a master or auditor, and should not be set aside unless obvious error was committed or where the entire evidence preponderated against such finding. It was in this context that we addressed the purpose of filing exceptions from the reviewing judge’s decision to the court sitting en banc. The issue we resolved in that case was the proper scope of review of the decision of a majority of judges sitting en banc, all of whom had heard the evidence and participated in the hearing, after action was taken by the reviewing judge. Again, the issue of the proper procedure for taking an appeal from the common pleas court decision in tax assessment cases was not raised.</p>

We found that the appellant’s contention that an order entered by a single judge who heard the assessment appeal was not a final order was without merit.</p>
    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[225,1590,1157,706]]]'>The issue presented in this case was not addressed by this Court in the three cases relied upon by the majority. Although the lower courts have spoken on this issue, this case presents us with our first opportunity to squarely resolve the issue. I believe the better approach would be to establish one procedure, rather than to defer to a trial judge’s discretion. This would eliminate the unfairness inherent in a procedure that treats litigants differently depending upon the judge who is assigned to hear the matter. Even through the elimination of the exceptions procedure, a trial judge would still have the authority to entertain a petition for reconsideration to correct any errors in the proceeding or in his decision.</p>
