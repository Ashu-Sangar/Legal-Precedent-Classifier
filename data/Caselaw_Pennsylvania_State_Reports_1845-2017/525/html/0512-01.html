Appellant, who had previously been employed at the Riverfront as a pantry worker but had been fired in November of 1986, entered the restaurant by removing the slats from a window in the men’s room in the rear of the building. After entering the building, Appellant placed a chair under the window and used a homemade hook device to lift an acetylene tank, an oxygen tank, a cutting torch, martial arts weapons<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and other equipment (a wrench, safety goggles and a striker which is used for lighting torches) into the building. Appellant confronted George Weiss, an elderly security guard who was working the “graveyard shift” at the Riverfront, in the reservation office where Weiss was watching television. Appellant brutally attacked and murdered the deceased who made an <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>effort to defend himself, but proved no match for Appellant and his martial arts weapons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b767-4" data-blocks='[["BL_767.4",767,[183,387,1158,568]]]'>Appellant then dragged the body into the sales office of the Riverfront where a safe was located. Appellant used a cutting torch, fueled by oxygen and acetylene, to burn a hole into the top of the safe. The content of the safe caught fire and was doused with water. Appellant took from the safe money and imitation gold coins inscribed with the name of the company that owned the restaurant (Tabas Enterprises) which were sold as gift certificates, and fled the premises. In fleeing, Appellant left behind the murder weapons, the acetylene and oxygen tanks and the aforementioned other equipment.</p>

The deceased was found lying on his back with his legs spread apart, a chair resting on top of him and his clothing pushed up under his arms exposing his chest and stomach. A bloodstained knife was found entangled in the clothing. In the sales office the police also discovered the acetylene and oxygen tanks, the homemade ten-inch spear, made of a wooden pole with a martial arts throwing knife attached to one end with black electrical tape, and a martial arts throwing star attached to the other end with yellow synthetic <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>rope. Charred currency was found near the safe along with charred boxes that had previously contained the “gold coins gift certificates”. In the reservation office the police found a wrench, safety goggles, and a striker which is used for lighting welding torches. In the men’s bathroom (the point of entry) a chair was discovered underneath the bathroom window. Under the chair was a mesh-type sling made from yellow synthetic rope held together with black electrical tape. In the hallway at the north end of the building the police discovered a curtain rod with a hook device taped to one end with silver duct tape.</p>
    <p id="b768-5" data-blocks='[["BL_768.4",768,[256,893,1154,698]]]'>The police initiated their investigation by tracing the serial numbers from the fuel tanks to the Woodland Oxygen Company, a retail store which sells cylinders, gasses, welding supplies and equipment. The business records and receipts at the Woodland Oxygen Company showed that Appellant purchased acetylene bottles on November 24, 1986, and an oxygen tank on December 10, 1986, which he brought back to the store on December 11, 1986, for repair. The police also traced the martial arts weapons found at the Riverfront to the Asian Martial Arts World store. Employees from both the Woodland Oxygen Company and Asian Martial Arts World stores picked Appellant out of a photo array and later identified him at trial as a customer.</p>
    <p id="b768-6" data-blocks='[["BL_768.5",768,[253,1623,1155,688]]]'>A search warrant and an arrest warrant were authorized and executed at Appellant’s residence. Appellant was present in the residence when the police arrived but diverted their attention by stating that he was the boyfriend of Appellant’s sister and that the last time he saw Basemore (Appellant), Basemore was sleeping on the living room couch at 3:00 a.m. TT., April 27, 1988, p. 290-291. The police ascertained Appellant’s identity after noticing a distinguishing scar on his left forearm and placed him under arrest. Appellant then blurted out that “he worked at the Riverfront and there’s lot of shit going down there and he wanted to tell [the police] about it”. TT., April 27, 1988, p. 294.</p>

      <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>While executing the search warrant, the police found two shoe boxes hidden in Appellant’s bedroom under a bureau, containing all but four of the “gold coin gift certificates” missing from the Riverfront. (The gift certificates were identified by serial number.) Located in a bureau drawer was a receipt dated December 10, 1986, from the Woodland Oxygen Company listing Appellant’s name and indicating the purchase of a “set for oxygen service” and an adapter. A wallet hidden under a bed contained a twenty-five dollar ($25.00) “gold coin gift certificate” and identification cards belonging to Appellant. A footlocker in the bedroom contained ninety dollars ($90.00) in charred United States currency. In Appellant’s mother’s bedroom under a mattress the police found several knives wrapped in newspaper. Attached to one of the knives was yellow cord similar to the cord used on the sling device and spear found at the Riverfront. Some of the knives were wrapped with black electrical tape in a manner similar to the weapons found at the Riverfront. In the basement at Appellant’s residence the police discovered numerous martial arts weapons including a homemade spear made of a wooden pole with a martial arts throwing knife attached to one end with black electrical tape, and a martial arts throwing star attached to the other end with yellow synthetic rope — a replica of the spear found at the Riverfront. The police also found blood stained overalls which were later tested and showed the presence of blood consistent with the blood type of the victim, George Weiss. (Weiss’ clothing was also tested and showed the presence of blood consistent with the blood type of Appellant.)</p>

The trial judge explained to Appellant that he could return to the courtroom at any time, provided that he agreed not to disrupt the proceedings. The trial judge at this time encouraged Appellant to participate in his trial calling to mind the seriousness of the charges. Upon Appellant’s continued refusal, the trial judge determined that the trial would continue in his absence and, in an abundance of caution, directed the sheriff’s department to bring Appellant to the courtroom each day. The trial court also ordered the sheriff’s department to have a sheriff’s deputy with Appellant at all times so Appellant could notify the court in the event that he wished <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>to return to the courtroom. The trial judge also directed defense counsel to meet with Appellant each morning and each afternoon to determine whether he wished to return to the courtroom. The trial judge also made arrangements so that Appellant could view the trial court by closed circuit television. Appellant monitored the trial each day and was brought into the courtroom briefly on several occasions for identification purposes.

Additionally, as the Commonwealth points out in its brief, Appellant was not removed in the presence of prospective jurors and none of the jurors who served on the jury witnessed Appellant’s disruptive behavior. Moreover, the court advised prospective jurors that Appellant’s absence was unrelated to his guilt and questioned each juror to ensure that Appellant’s absence from the courtroom would not impact on their ability to be fair.

The defendant, by electing to submit such a mitigating circumstance is in effect making his character an issue and must expect the rebuttal which normally follows. Counsel could not forecast the law being otherwise and, I believe, was not ineffective in not taking such a risk.</p>

It is my belief, therefore, that in enacting mitigating circumstance (e)(1), the legislature intended to provide a defendant the opportunity to argue to the jury that he or she has no <em>significant </em>criminal history. Similarly, as Mr. Justice Zappalla notes in his dissent, mitigating circumstance (e)(8) was intended to afford the defendant an opportunity to inform the jury of some “positive qualities” in his or her life that should be considered in the jury’s determination of whether a sentence of death is appropriate. While both sections technically deal with the character of the defendant, it is clear that the legislature intended each section in a “specific” manner and did not intend that, by presenting this type of evidence in mitigation, a defendant would be placing his or her character at issue, thereby opening the door for the Commonwealth to rebut on the issue of character.</p>

The issue in <em>Goins </em>was whether a single felony conviction for a crime involving the use or threat of violence to the person may suffice to establish aggravating circumstance (d)(9). We held therein that such conviction would not suffice; finding that the Legislature intentionally used the plural form “convictions” to exclude a single conviction. The dissent would have us find that based upon our holding in <em>Goins, </em>the plural term “convictions” as used in (e)(1) should be construed to mean that a single prior conviction alone could not be used in <em>rebuttal </em>where a defendant asserts that he has no significant history of criminal convictions. However, I do not believe that the legislature intended that the aggravating and the mitigating circumstance of “no significant history” be interpreted in the same manner.</p>

To extend our rationale in <em>Goins </em>to the facts of the instant case would clearly lead to an absurd result. Initially, I would note that the language employed in these two sections differs significantly. Aggravating circumstance (d)(9) employs the terms “felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person,” while mitigating circumstance (e)(1) employs the terms “prior criminal convictions.”</p>

The verdict must be a sentence of death, however, if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstance. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(c)(l)(iv). Thus, because one aggravating circumstance alone may mandate the imposition of the death penalty, the legislature in its wisdom, placed a higher burden on the Commonwealth to prove that the imposition of the most severe penalty possible is appropriate. In my view, therefore, our holding in <em>Goins </em>was correct; albeit not for the technical reason of its use of the plural “convictions,” but because it is in keeping with the intended meaning of the statute and the legislative desire to ensure that a person with only one violent act in his past not be subjected to aggravating circumstance (d)(9).</p>

It was created in order to provide the defendant with a potential life saving argument.

The legislature could not have intended to afford a defendant who has a single prior conviction for rape, attempted murder or kidnapping for example, the opportunity to stand before the jury and inform them that he has “no significant history of criminal convictions” and thus, imply that he has a crime free past when, in fact, his prior history includes a single heinous crime. It would neither be reasonable to conclude that a defendant with two, three or five minor, non-violent convictions, be <em>precluded </em>from arguing to the jury that he or she has “no significant history of criminal convictions” based on the number of convictions alone. Rather, it is more reasonable to conclude that what the legislature intended was for the jury to determine what is and what is not “significant” when being offered a mitigating circumstance for its consideration. Because (e)(1) is not limited to prior convictions involving violence or threat to the person as is (d)(9), it is only reasonable to conclude that it was intended to provide a defendant who has a prior record the opportunity to argue in mitigation that he or she has no <em>significant </em>criminal history. However, in so doing, a defendant must bear the natural and reasonable consequence of his or her decision. Section (e)(1) could not have been designed to defraud the jury where a defendant in fact has a prior conviction. Therefore, the Commonwealth should be permitted to rebut with proof of the defendant’s prior convictions, irrespective of whether the defendant’s criminal history includes only a single conviction or more than one.</p>

Following this precept, it is important to note that the statute reads “a significant history of felony convictions” rather than <em>“a </em>history of significant felony convictions.” The pertinent rule of grammar to be followed is that that modifier should be placed, if possible, next to the word to be modified. If the legislature had intended that the seriousness of the prior felonies be the measure of the aggravating circumstance, the latter construction would have been correctly used. The use of the former construction instead clearly demonstrates the intention that it be the defendant’s “history of felony convictions which is significant.” <em>In this context it appears that the plural form </em>“convictions” <em>is intentionally used to the exclusion of the singular form </em>“conviction. ”</blockquote>

The phrase which appears in 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1) as the mitigating circumstance is that the defendant has no “significant history of prior criminal convictions.” Again, it is clear that the Legislature intentionally used the plural form “prior criminal convictions” to the exclusion of the singular form “conviction.”</p>
