The Board is also free to “establish its own composition,” “play it by ear.” “make it up as it goes along,” and “keep doing it over until it gets it right.” At least, these are the complaints brought to us by Mr. Justice Larsen and three of his colleagues maintain that all such alleged misconduct is interlocutory and reviewable only after a recommendation for sanctions has been filed with this Court. These three do not explain how they will exonerate any violations of the respondent-jurist’s constitutional rights, especially the constitutional right to confidentiality, once the skunk is left out of the bag.</p>

However, the issue regarding the composition of the Board which will review the report of the hearing committee and prepare its own findings and report, is, in my view, a jurisdictional issue and reviewable as a matter of right, although interlocutory in nature. At least, this is true in every court in America except in our court, it appears, when it involves a colleague of ours.

An evidentiary hearing on those two charges commenced on August 23, 1988, before a three-member Hearing Committee. On October 3, 1988, after thirteen days of hearings, three new, separate and unrelated charges were filed against Petitioner. At the Board’s order, the three new charges were joined with the two original charges and a hearing <em>ab initio </em>on all charges was ordered commenced before a newly constituted six member Hearing Committee, composed of all six non-recused members of the Board — essentially comprising a committee of the whole. (Two members of the Board at that <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>time, Judges Ross and Rowley, had recused themselves from any participation in these matters.) Two of the Hearing Committee members, the Honorable Bruce W. Kaufman and Mr. James H. Higgins, took positions on the Hearing Committee even though each of their terms as members of the Board were fixed to expire on November 14, 1988. There is some dispute, not currently relevant, as to whether the hearing on the combined charges commenced before or after'<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> November 14, 1988. Respondents take the position that the hearing commenced prior to November 14, 1988. The Hearing Committee was subsequently expanded to nine members (again, a Committee of the whole) and hearings were held at various times up to and including June 10, 1989. Following the conclusion of the hearings, Petitioner and the Board prosecutor submitted proposed findings of facts and conclusions of law and orally argued their respective positions on July 25,1989. During the proceedings and while the Hearing Committee was deliberating, Petitioner filed various motions and petitions including: 1) Motion for Recusal of Antonia L. Scarlata; 2) Supplemental Motion for Recusal of Antonia L. Scarlata; 3) Petition to the Governor for the Removal of Antonia L. Scarlata; 4) Petition for Disqualification and Removal of Judge Charles L. Durham; 5) Motion for Recusal of Chief Justice Robert N.C. Nix, Jr.; 6) Motion for Recusal of James H. Higgins; 7) Petition to the Governor for the Removal of James H. Higgins; 8) Motions for the Recusal of Bruce W. Kaufmann; and 9) Petition to the Governor for the Removal of Bruce W. Kaufmann. Some of these motions and petitions were denied; some of them have not been acted upon and are not being considered herein. On January 31, 1990, while deliberations at Board Matter No. 140 continued and various petitions and motions filed by Petitioner were pending, the term of Antonia L. Scarlata as a member of the Board expired.</p>

On April 24, 1990, Petitioner, through his counsel, presented to the undersigned, a Petition for an Immediate Stay of All Proceedings at Judicial Inquiry and Review Board Matter No. 140. Also, on April 24, 1990, Petitioner received a document styled “Rule 9 Report” in Board Matter No. 140. That “Rule 9 Report” was joined by Judge Robert T.J. Kelly, Jr., Judge Frank J. Montemuro, Jr. and Judge Jessamine S. Jiuliante. On April 25,1990, Petitioner received a document styled “Dissenting and Joining Report” in Board Matter No. 140. That “Dissenting and Joining Report” was authored by Judge James M. Munley. On April 26, 1990, this writer entered an order staying all proceedings and actions at Board Matter 140. On April 30, 1990, this Court entered a per curiam order directing that this matter be listed for argument on Friday, May 11, 1990, the argument “being limited to the single question raised by the Petition for Writ of Prohibition and Complaint in Quo Warranto, of the proper composition of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board for the purposes of these proceedings in accordance with the Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. V, Section 18(b) and Rules 5 and 9 of the Rules of Procedure Governing the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board.” Petitioner, Mr. Justice Rolf Larsen, did not participate in this matter,' which is presently before us for resolution.</p>

Our Rules make a definitive distinction between the Board itself and hearings to be conducted by a Committee of the Board. Participation in a hearing as a committee member does not entail continuation as a Board member as well. The two functions are separate and distinct under our Rules. The Hearing Committee (composed of at least three board members — not necessarily a committee of the whole) holds a hearing and transmits their report to the full Board which, after further proceedings, must make their own independent findings and report. It is hard to see how the language of our Constitution and Rules can be interpreted in any other way and, indeed, the system so established is consistent with similarly bifurcated procedures common in business, legislative and judicial bodies across the country. Robert’s Rules of Order, Revised, which is commonly applicable to deliberative bodies, defines and classifies committees at § 49 thereof and committees of the whole at § 55. It is clear from a perusal of those Rules that an assembly is legally distinct from a committee composed of some or all of its members. Likewise, it is common in adjudicative matters disposed of by administrative agencies today to separate the hearing function from the decision making function and to provide that hearing examiners make an initial <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>report of findings or recommendation to a review board or panel that is responsible for the ultimate decision.

The writ of prohibition is one which, like all other prerogative writs, is to be used only with great caution and forbearance and as an extraordinary remedy in cases of extreme necessity, to secure order and regularity in judicial proceedings if none of the ordinary remedies provided by law is applicable or adequate to afford relief. It is a writ which is not of absolute right but rests largely in the sound discretion of the court. It will never be granted where there is a complete and effective remedy by appeal, certiorari, writ of error, injunction, or otherwise: see <em>First Congressional District Election, </em><a href="/pa/295/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="295 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1115163" data-case-paths="/pa/295/0001-01">295 Pa. 1</a>, 13, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20A.%20735" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="144 A. 735">144 A. 735</a>, 740, and cases referred to in the dissenting opinion in <em>Philadelphia County Grand Jury Investigation Case, </em><a href="/pa/347/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="347 Pa. 316" data-case-ids="1217356" data-case-paths="/pa/347/0316-01">347 Pa. 316</a>, 330-334, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20A.2d%20199" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="32 A.2d 199">32 A.2d 199</a>, 206-208; also <em>Roche, U.S. District Judge, v.

A review of this Court's decisions since 1968 (the year of the adoption of our present Constitution) shows that we have <em>never </em>ordered that a Judicial Inquiry and Review Board appointee continue to serve as a <em>Board </em>member after his or her term thereon expires. In the case of Judge McEwen, in an order dated December 30, 1986, we specified that Judge McEwen’s term of service expired on January 25, 1987, and that he continue "to participate in any hearing in progress at the end of his term." This is entirely consistent with this opinion.</p>
