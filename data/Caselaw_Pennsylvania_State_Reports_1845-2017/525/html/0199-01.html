The Appellee is the Honorable Louise Bishop (“Bishop”), the incumbent Democratic Representative in the General Assembly for the 192nd District.</p>

In the Objection, Campbell challenged the circulator’s affidavits of five named individuals. The challenged affidavits were attached to sheets bearing four hundred and fifty-one signed lines, leaving three hundred and fifty seven names. The Objection also set forth general allegations that ‘many’ signatures were not of persons qualified to sign or were forged. However, the Objection did not identify a single signed line of the Nomination Petition as to which <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>such general allegations were directed. The Objection contained the following paragraphs:</p>

    <blockquote id="b450-5" data-blocks='[["BL_450.6",450,[323,826,1109,96]]]'>Paragraph (g) states: The signatures of many of the alleged signers of the petition were forged.</blockquote>

    <p id="b450-7" data-blocks='[["BL_450.8",450,[278,1111,1152,529]]]'>At the hearing in the Commonwealth Court on March 20, 1990, Bishop presented a motion to quash and dismiss the Objection. Campbell orally moved the court for leave to amend the Objection by adding thereto seven pages containing objections to specific signatures as to which Campbell intended to present evidence in support of invalidation. Campbell provided to the court a copy of the proposed amendment and stated that she had handed a copy to counsel for Bishop at the time he presented her with a copy of the motion to quash.</p>

The pertinent section of the Election Code provides as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[227,381,1108,43]]]'>Sec. 2937. Objections to nomination petitions and papers.</blockquote>

    <p id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.7",451,[183,822,1155,833]]]'>Based on the clear language of the statute, we agree with the ruling of Judge Colins of the Commonwealth Court and hold that the allegations contained in paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of the Objection filed by Campbell did not comply with the requirements of the Election Code, as they were merely boilerplate, rather than specific objections. These improper objections could not be remedied by the attempt to file a more specific set of objections at the time of the hearing. The Election Code is clear; the specific objections to the Petition must be filed within the seven (7) day time period. There is nothing in the Code that permits the challenger to file a general set of objections and then supplement those objections with more detailed claims after the time limit has run. Were we to rule otherwise, we would be eviscerating the clear meaning and intent of the statute.</p>
