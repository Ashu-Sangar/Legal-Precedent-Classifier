Agent Becker, dressed in plain clothes, flashed the red siren on his unmarked car. Appellee Galloway pulled off the road and Agent Becker used a bullhorn to order him out of the truck to the rear and to remain still. The agent then removed the truck’s keys, presented his badge to Galloway, gave some type of <em>Miranda </em>warning, and stated that he was under arrest (H.T. 3-4, 9). Agent Becker then radioed the State Police and Trooper Robert Frederick responded to the call and took Galloway into custody, administered a breathalyzer test which showed a reading of .17 percent, and signed a criminal complaint charging him with driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. § 3731). Trooper Frederick’s affidavit states his knowledge of the crime was based on information received from “Charles V. Becker,” and another witness, William L. Kelly, as well as the “odor of alcohol” and “breathalyzer test administered.”</p>

As it was stipulated to by the parties that this was not a private citizen’s arrest, Special Agent Becker must be statutorily authorized to make arrests.

    <p id="AuI" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[250,379,1162,1495]]]'>Having determined that this state officer is governed solely by the Act, we turn next to the Commonwealth’s contention that “inherent in the authority to investigate and prosecute is the authority to arrest.” (Brief, p. 23). We agree that the Attorney General and his agents are empowered to apply for warrants and to make arrests in those instances where an investigation or prosecution is undertaken pursuant to § 732-205. Obviously, that arrest power is designed to facilitate the investigative and prosecutorial aims of the Attorney General’s office. But the power is limited thereby, and we will not read the statute to expand the scope of that power beyond the bounds of the legislative intent underlying it. The specific issue to be decided here is whether those arrest powers, invested in a “law enforcement” officer for purposes of investigating and prosecuting offenses listed in § 732-205, are also of a general nature in the same sense by which municipal police officers and the State Police are authorized by statute to arrest as “police officers.” Neither the language of the Act itself, its legislative history,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> nor case law convinces us that there is any reasonable interpretation of the Act which allows the Attorney General to arrest for offenses outside of those contemplated by the primary purpose behind the statute. The power of arrest under the Act is limited to those actions which fall within the “scope of employment” as defined and circumscribed by the specific offenses in § 732-205. The Attorney General is a “law enforcement officer” and not a “police officer.”</p>

Under 75 Pa.C.S. § 6304 (cited at footnote 2 above), a state police officer does not have the authority to arrest for motor vehicle code violations without a warrant where he was not present when the offense occurred. This is consistent with the general principle that warrantless arrests for offenses committed outside the presence of the arresting officer may only be made where there is probable cause to believe that a felony, not a misdemeanor, has been, or is being, committed. See, <em>Commonwealth v. Gallagher, </em><a href="/pa-super/242/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="242 Pa.

    <p id="b269-8" data-blocks='[["BL_269.8",269,[199,649,1154,747]]]'>As the majority concedes, the Attorney General’s agent could have made the arrest in this case as a private citizen. This fact was also acknowledged by defense counsel. R.R. 12. Notwithstanding the Assistant District Attorney stipulated that the agent had acted as a police officer, not as a private citizen. R.R. 16. I concede the interest that the Attorney General may have in determining the extent of his agents’ authority, conferred under the Commonwealth Attorneys Act, Act of October 15, 1980, P.L. 950, No. 164, 71 P.S. §§ 732-101 through 732-504. However, I cannot accept the legitimacy of securing this clarification at the expense of quashing an information for conduct posing a serious threat to the lives and well-being of all who may have come into contact with appellee on that occasion.</p>
    <p id="b269-9" data-blocks='[["BL_269.9",269,[198,1420,1155,746]]]'>The theory justifying the use of an exclusionary rule to exclude evidence damaging to a defendant is that the illegality in procuring that evidence offends our collective concept of fundamental fairness. We have made the societal judgment that it is better to relieve the culprit of responsibility for the act rather than condone law enforcement officers in conduct of such nature. In this case, the agent did what he had a right to do as an ordinary citizen, which he indeed was. The fact that he purported to act as an agent, under the mistaken view that he was so authorized, does not establish the type of “illegal conduct” which would justify the invocation of an exclusionary rule. Indeed, there was no illegality since the agent, as a citizen, had the right to act in the manner he did.</p>
    <p id="b269-10" data-blocks='[["BL_269.10",269,[199,2189,1154,98]],["BL_270.1",270,[271,240,1152,201]]]'>Nor can I accept the majority’s ingenious argument that the subsequent warrantless arrest by the State Trooper was <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>valid. If it is accepted that the detention of appellee by the Agent, which was made under the color of law, was an illegal one, it would necessarily infect the subsequent “warrantless arrest” of the trooper.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[270,460,1152,141]]]'>I, therefore, concur in the result because the facts presented do not justify the invocation of an exclusionary rule.</p>

    <p id="A4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[714,663,201,42]]]'>dissenting.</p>
    <p id="b270-7" data-blocks='[["BL_270.7",270,[266,725,1155,472]]]'>While I agree with the majority that the Attorney General is not clothed with the arrest powers otherwise possessed by a police officer, I cannot concur in that portion of the opinion which so swiftly blinds itself to the patent illegality of the State action that brought about this arrest, cleansing it with the appearance of a State Police officer who is permitted to arrest Appellee on the basis of the “untainted” information supplied by the same Deputy Attorney General whose actions were chastised just a few paragraphs before.</p>
    <p id="b270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[262,1216,1155,685]]]'>There can be no dispute that the actions of the Attorney General’s agent here are state action. As such, inasmuch as it is held that those actions were not within the power of the agent, those acts were violative of Appellee’s Constitutional rights, under both the Federal (Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments) and State (Article 1, § 8) Constitutions. The tactics utilized to apprehend Appellee were stipulated on the record as being performed under color of State authority. As such, their use in the later arrest by State Police, was no less “fruit of the poisonous tree” than any other violation subject to the exclusionary ruje where evidence obtained illegally through state action must be suppressed.</p>
    <p id="b270-9" data-blocks='[["BL_270.9",270,[259,1920,1152,364]],["BL_271.1",271,[206,236,1155,685]]]'>To hold otherwise renders meaningless the primary holding of this case. The effect would be to allow these agents to continue to “arrest” and detain any citizen so long as the ultimate arrest is conducted by a police officer with the proper authority acting on information supplied by the illegally acting Agent. This result is ludicrous and flies in the face of the principles we established in <em>Commonwealth </em>
      <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>
      <em>v. Corley, </em><a href="/pa/507/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="507 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="1792340" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0540-01">507 Pa. 540</a>, <a href="/pa/507/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="507 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="1792340" data-case-paths="/pa/507/0540-01">491 A.2d 829</a> (1985), wherein this Court set forth an exhaustive examination of the principles of state action and the application of the exclusionary rule. Those considerations, ignored by the majority today, require a court to determine the relationship of the individual committing the wrongful action and his relationship to the state. Under the <em>Corley </em>principles, it is clear that the agent’s actions were inseparable from the State and the evidence obtained therefrom must be suppressed. The majority has, however, completely ignored the precedent established in <em>Corley </em>in favor of an ad hoc ratification of illegal state action to validate the prosecution of an otherwise illegally detained person.</p>
    <p id="b271-5" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[206,938,1156,789]]]'>As a reading of <em>Corley </em>would establish, the instant situation must be viewed in a different light than that of a private individual attempting a citizen’s arrest. In that instance the citizen is not acting, nor holding himself out as acting, as an agent for the state. As such, responsibility for his actions must rest solely on that citizen. Indeed, the record indicates that the Agent was not making a citizen’s arrest, but was acting solely upon powers he felt he possessed as an agent of the Attorney General. (Opinion, p. 1046). The flaw in the majority’s reasoning is in ignoring this distinction. Either the arrest was effectuated by a private citizen or a duly authorized agent of the state. Since neither applies to the facts of this case, the arrest was illegal ab initio and no subsequent action can erase the taint.</p>
    <p id="b271-6" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[207,1753,1153,257]]]'>In the present case, were we to ratify and allow illegal State action by likening it to a citizen’s arrest, we would also, as a secondary and unwanted effect, open the state up to untold civil liability were the effects of these “citizen's arrests”, less than correct or successful.</p>
    <p id="b271-7" data-blocks='[["BL_271.6",271,[206,2030,1154,257]],["BL_272.1",272,[258,243,1150,150]]]'>Instead, I think the more prudent path is to emphasize to the Attorney General that he has specific, enumerated powers and to act ultra vires those powers will only frustrate the law enforcement scheme which has already been legislatively and constitutionally established. This is the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>primary purpose of the exclusionary rule and that purpose is no better served nor its application less warranted than upon the facts presently before us.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[258,417,1147,151]]]'>I therefore dissent from the majority’s validation of the arrest of Appellee based upon information supplied by the agent for the Attorney General.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b272-6" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[298,629,894,44]]]'>LARSEN, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>
