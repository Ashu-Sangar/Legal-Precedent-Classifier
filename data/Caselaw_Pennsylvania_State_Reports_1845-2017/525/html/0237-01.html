    <blockquote id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[245,531,1112,927]]]'>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has unequivocally established that a corporation “regularly conducts business” in the county in which the corporation obtains materials, goods, and supplies essential for the corporation to accomplish its corporate objectives. In the case before us, the “materials, goods and supplies” essential to the operation of Bryn Mawr as an institution providing quality medical care includes the care which its doctors who are participating in the “Jefferson-Bryn Mawr Education Program” are able to provide Bryn Mawr’s patients. The long-standing relationship between Bryn Mawr and Philadelphia County medical schools/hospitals as well as the depth of interaction between those institutions with regard to their affiliation underscores the fact that the relationship exists to further the primary corporate goals of Bryn Mawr, and consequently constitutes a regular part of Bryn Mawr’s “business.”</blockquote>

The rotation and use of medical personnel is essentially an educational process which does not amount to the quality of business activity which we contemplated in <em>Shambe </em>and its progeny. Our conclusion would be different if, for example, Bryn Mawr established a branch clinic in Philadelphia where paying customers would be diagnosed or treated on the premises in Philadelphia, just as there can be no question that Bryn Mawr does business in Montgomery County. That is not the case on record. The relationship sponsored here is unique in the sense that it is predicated upon educational exchanges, thereby removing it from the characteristic quality of business contacts which we envision as being <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>encompassed by Rule 2179(a)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

    <p id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.6",496,[245,582,1157,1008]]]'>We stress the fact that medical enterprises engage in both educational and service activities. Our great teaching and research centers attract students and physicians from all corners of this State, this nation, and from around the world. Patients in need of treatment travel endlessly across varied boundaries in search of relief, and frequently hospitals furnish lifeflights without regard to political lines drawn on a map. We are mindful, as well, of the fact that the vast majority of our counties are rural, and of necessity the ill must journey to wherever the best treatment is available. The great medical centers located in our metropolitan areas perform advanced treatment, including transplant surgery on patients from Ohio to Texas to Saudi Arabia, often done in the context of teaching students and scientists who speak with accents foreign to the different regions of Pennsylvania. Even where the lifeflights are regular, or where educational programs are formalized, we have not anticipated, and we decline to do so now, that such contacts could form the bases of venue for legal action.</p>

Although venue and jurisdiction are different legal concepts, we have applied the same procedural tests in order to determine when both exist. <em>County Construction Company v.

Venue is the place in which a particular action is to be brought and determined; it is a matter for the convenience of the litigants.
