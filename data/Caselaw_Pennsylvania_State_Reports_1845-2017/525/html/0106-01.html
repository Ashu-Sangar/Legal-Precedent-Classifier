    <p id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.8",356,[256,978,1155,908]]]'>Appellant, Potamkin Chevrolet (“Potamkin”), was granted a zoning variance by the Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment (“Board”). On appeal, the variance was affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The Commonwealth Court reversed, however, on the grounds that the Board lacked jurisdiction to grant the variance because the proposed change from residential to commercial use constituted a rezoning. We granted Appellant’s petition for allowance of appeal because we were persuaded that there may be some confusion and uncertainty in our law with respect to a zoning board’s jurisdictional power to grant relief, by a hardship variance, from zoning restrictions which, as a practical matter, preclude <em>any </em>use of the land, as opposed to relief that must be sought exclusively by rezoning through curative amendment. After a careful review of the record, we have concluded that Potamkin’s appeal must be dismissed because of mootness.</p>

The two contiguous tracts (totaling 7.7 acres) which are the subject of this appeal were zoned R-3 and R-4 residential under Sections 14.204 and 14.205 of the Philadelphia Zoning Code. They are owned by the City of Philadelphia and, of course, located within its boundaries. Because they lie within the flight path controls for nearby Northeast Philadelphia Airport, however, residential devel<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>opment is prohibited by both federal and local aviation regulations. The tracts, which are wooded and completely unimproved, are bordered on the south by Potamkin’s car dealership. Potamkin leased the tracts from the City of Philadelphia in a lease dated December 23, 1983, contingent upon receiving zoning approval of the contemplated commercial uses connected with its dealership. Potamkin planned to use the tracts for outdoor parking, display, storage and sale of its motor vehicles and as parking for its customers and employees. .</p>
    <p id="b357-4" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[173,813,1158,905]]]'>The fact that this lease was automatically terminated under its own terms, because final zoning approval was never received within the time period specified, renders this appeal moot. The issue is fully discussed immediately below. Once Potamkin entered into its lease with the City, it promptly applied to the City’s Department of Licenses and Inspection for the relevant use and zoning permits. Following denial of its application, Potamkin appealed to the Board for a variance. Witnesses for Potamkin, as well as witnesses who included individuals and representatives of neighborhood groups opposed to the variance (Appellees), testified at a public hearing before the Board. The Board subsequently granted the requested variance, subject to conditions, under Section 14-1801(l)(c) of the Philadelphia Zoning Code. Appeals were taken and, as noted, the Commonwealth Court ultimately reversed in an opinion dated July 28, 1986.</p>

What the parties, in fact, agreed to in this lease was a condition and not a covenant. Compare, <em>Williams v.

While one party to a covenant may decline to enforce it, either by a suit for damages or equitable relief, and hence waive any rights he or she has under such an agreement, a condition operates quite differently. Here, by its expressed language, this lease was drafted so that it would terminate automatically if final unappealable zoning approval did not occur within one year from the date the lease was signed. That event obviously did not occur within the necessary one year and, indeed, has not occurred yet.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">3</a>

    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[251,1252,1158,1058]]]'>Before us for review in this appeal is a Commonwealth Court order that reversed a Philadelphia Common Pleas Court order sustaining a variance. The lower court decision, overturned by the Commonwealth Court, upheld an order of the Zoning Board of Adjustment (Board) that granted a variance to appellant Potamkin with respect to two contiguous parcels of land located adjacent to Potamkin’s business operations. Potamkin proposed to use the subject parcels to expand its automobile business. The two-pronged question to be resolved in this appeal is: was the evidence sufficient for the Board to find (1) that the zoning classification unduly burdened the subject property thereby creating an unnecessary hardship peculiar to that property, and (2) that the granting of a variance for commercial use was not contrary to the public welfare. Upon a review of the record, I find that the Board’s decision granting a variance was supported by substantial evidence. I, thus, would reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court that affirmed the Board’s action.</p>

The subject property is bordered on the north by Academy Avenue, on the south by Torresdale-Frankford Country Club, on the east by Potamkin’s existing business facilities, and on the west by additional unimproved acreage owned by the City of Philadelphia.

Without taking any additional testimony, the Common Pleas Court sustained the Board’s decision and dismissed the appeal. From the Common Pleas Court order, appellees appealed to the Commonwealth Court. A three judge panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that Potamkin’s petition for a variance actually amounted to a request for a rezoning that should be addressed to City Council.

The Commonwealth Court held that the hardship created in this case by the airport flight path restrictions is not an appropriate subject for a variance request in that such hardship “is not caused by the physical characteristics of the subject property or the characteristics of the surrounding area ...” I disagree. As Potamkin argues, the location of the land is as much a physical characteristic of the property as is any topographical feature. Thus, the location of the subject property in the flight path control area of the Northeast Philadelphia Airport is a physical characteristic that prevents residential development, and creates an unnecessary hardship justifying a variance. <em>See H.A.
