PMA appealed the decision, and continued to withhold payment, allegedly in order to impose extreme financial hardship on the appellee without any legal justification. The Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (W.C.A.B.) reversed that part of the referee’s decision which concluded that PMA had had no reasonable basis to contest the compensation claim.

The appellant argues that permitting a tort action would be inconsistent with the fact that the compensation statute provides a comprehensive system for adjudicating workers’ compensation disputes, including specific remedies for the alleged injury. The statute provides for ten percent interest on due and unpaid compensation, 77 P.S. § 717.1, as well as for penalties up to ten percent for violations of the act, for violations of rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or for violations of rules of procedure, and the penalties may be increased to twenty percent in cases of unreasonable or excessive delay, 77 P.S. § 991. The statute allows attorneys fees and costs to be assessed against an insurer which contests, without a reasonable basis, a compensation claim. 77 P.S. § 996.

For instance, a worker who loses a foot is entitled to receive only the following: two-thirds of his wages for two hundred fifty weeks and disability benefits during a healing period not to exceed a maximum of twenty-five weeks, 77 P.S. § 513(4) and (25), though such damages might seem paltry recompense for the dismemberment.

Kuney, herein.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> “Unreasonable” conduct is conduct that is not rational, “not guided by reason or sound judgment.” The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 2084 (2d ed. 1987) Appellee has not alleged that appellant, PMA Insurance Company, acted unreasonably or without sound judgment. Rather, appellee has alleged bad faith, misrepresentation, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and outrageous conduct arising “outside the course of [appellee’s] employment.” Complaint — Civil Action of Plaintiff (Appellee) at ¶¶ 24, 25, 27, 41, 42, 44. Surely, such conduct does not fall within the ambit of conduct that is merely “unreasonable.”</p>

Rather, the defendant (appellant) is a third party. The injury that has been alleged is a separate matter of bad faith, misrepresentation, fraud, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and “outrageous conduct between the insurance carrier and the claimant, <em>not the employer. </em>As appellee has alleged intentional wrongdoing <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>on the part of appellant, the employer’s compensation insurance carrier, I would find that he is not precluded from maintaining an action in trespass for the separate injury he has incurred.</p>
