    <p id="b314-10" data-blocks='[["BL_314.8",314,[221,851,1154,251]]]'>This direct appeal has been brought from an order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing Petitioner-Appellant’s objections to the nominating petition of John V. Kersten. The facts, as gleaned from the opinion of the court below, are as follows.</p>
    <p id="b314-11" data-blocks='[["BL_314.9",314,[218,1133,1157,628]]]'>John A. Zanella (Zanella) filed timely objections to the nomination petition of John P. Kersten (Kersten), who is a candidate for the Republican nomination for the office of Representative in the General Assembly for the 107th Legislative District, which is located in Northumberland County. Zanella is a registered Republican elector residing in the 107th Legislative District. To be placed on the ballot, Kersten had to submit a nomination petition containing the valid signatures of 300 Republican electors within the 107th Legislative District. The petition submitted by Kersten was found by Commonwealth Court to contain 417 signatures.</p>
    <p id="b314-12" data-blocks='[["BL_314.10",314,[215,1792,1155,528]],["BL_315.1",315,[215,271,1153,96]]]'>Zanella objected to Kersten’s nomination petition on various grounds. A hearing on the objections was held by the Commonwealth Court on March 22, 1990 in Harrisburg. At the hearing, Zanella was successful in challenging seventy-seven (77) of the electors’ signatures. In addition, Zanella challenged pages one and two of Kersten’s petition on the basis that the circulator of those pages also notarized them, that is, she notarized her own signature. Pages one and two of the petition contain at least seventy-four (74) signatures, eighty-four according to Zanella, and if the defect on <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>pages one and two could not be amended, Zanella’s objections would have to be granted.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[215,385,1153,736]]]'>At the hearing, Kersten presented the testimony of Martha Millbrand, the individual who circulated and notarized pages one and two of the petition. Ms. Millbrand testified that she personally observed each of the electors identified thereon sign the petition. In notarizing pages one and two of the petition, Millbrand stated that she neither knew nor thought that she was doing anything improper since she did not have a financial interest in the outcome of the election. If she had such an interest, her notarization would have been prohibited under 57 P.S. § 165(e). Kersten then offered into evidence amended affidavits attached to copies of pages one and two of the petition. Ms. Millbrand is the circulator identified on the amended affidavits and Frederick Reed is the stated notary.</p>
    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[213,1141,1155,687]]]'>Zanella contends that our opinion in <em>Citizens Committee to Recall Rizzo v. Board of Elections of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/470/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="470 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1723785" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0001-01">470 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/pa/470/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="470 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1723785" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0001-01">367 A.2d 232</a> (1976), required the Commonwealth Court to disallow pages one and two of the petition and to prohibit the amended affidavits. The Commonwealth Court properly disagreed. Although it is true that <em>Rizzo </em>discussed the propriety of disallowing those portions of a recall petition which were both circulated and notarized by the same individual, the <em>Rizzo </em>opinion did not discuss whether such a petition could be amended, and under Section 977 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. § 2937, which is applicable to this case, amendments of defects in the petition are permitted in the court’s discretion.</p>

In other words, Zanella argues that not only was the amendment itself improperly allowed, but that the new notarization was ineffective because it cannot be read back to the date of Ms. Millbrand’s original signature in order to au<a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>thenticate it. We think this argument exalts form over substance because Ms. Millbrand did appear in open court and swore to the authenticity of her own signature. This, however, in essence constituted an amendment to the nominating petition and the issue at the heart of this case is whether such an amendment should have been permitted in the exercise of the court’s discretion under 25 P.S. § 2937, which provides:</p>

On the day fixed for said hearing, the court shall proceed without delay to hear said objections, and shall give such hearing precedence over other business before it, and shall finally determine said matter not later than fifteen (15) days after the last day for filing said nomination petitions or papers.

We held that the objector’s motion to amend his petition to challenge additional signatures to the nomination petition, filed after the seven day period set in the election code for challenging signatures, was properly denied by the Commonwealth Court. This case is distinguishable, of course, because here, we are dealing with an attempt to correct the nomination petition itself, and not to amend the objector’s petition in order to raise additional challenges. Also, unlike <em>Wagner, </em>we are not dealing here with unfair surprise to either party. Ms. Millbrand’s testimony in open court clearly cures the defect in the original nomination petition.</p>
