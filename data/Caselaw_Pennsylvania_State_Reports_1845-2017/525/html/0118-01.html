Accordingly, the Chancellor entered a Decree Nisi directing that this special shareholders meeting would be held within ten (10) days of the entry of a final order, and invited the parties to submit post-verdict motions.</p>

This writer granted an ex-party temporary stay on March 13, 1990, and immediately invited arguments by conference call or in person, in chambers.

Section 724 of the Judicial Code provides that discretionary appeals may be sought in this court from final orders of the Commonwealth and Superior Courts, but as noted in our Rule of Appellate Procedure 1702(c) an appeal, petition for allowance of appeal or petition for review does not lie to review the action of the intermediate court’s decision to grant or deny a stay. Rather, because of the nature of the review involved in such cases, the proper procedure is to file an application with this Court under Rule of Appellate Procedure 3315 seeking to review the action of the intermediate appellate court.</p>

The affirmance of this action depends on the legality of the stockpooling agreement and because Mr. Tornetta’s votes could “swing” any decision to Petitioners’ side or Respondents’ side, equity was invoked to determine the legality of the stockpooling agreement.
