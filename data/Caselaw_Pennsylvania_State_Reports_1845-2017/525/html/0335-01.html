A separate penalty hearing was held, after which the jury found two aggravating circumstances which it determined outweighed the one mitigating circumstance, thus, fixing the penalty on appellant’s first degree murder conviction at death. Thereafter, the trial court heard and denied appellant’s post-trial motions and imposed the sentence as decided by the jury. Additionally, the trial court sentenced appellant to a consecutive term of ten to twenty years imprisonment on the robbery conviction and a <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>consecutive term of two and one-half to five years on the possession of an instrument of crime conviction.

Appellant knocked on the door and asked for “Cat”, referring to Violeta’s husband, Jose Carrasquillo, who was not at home at that time. Violeta’s one-year-old son and her brother, Raymond Cintron, the victim, were at home with her. Violeta knew appellant as an associate of her husband, and, therefore, permitted him into her home <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>while appellant’s companion remained outside.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Upon entering, appellant announced that he wanted a “sixteen” or a gram and a half of cocaine. After Violeta had measured the requested quantity of cocaine, appellant announced that he wished to trade “meth” (methamphetamine) for the cocaine rather than pay cash. Violeta refused and appellant left, apparently to obtain more money in order to purchase the cocaine. He returned a few minutes later, pointed a forty-five automatic handgun at Violeta and demanded the cocaine. Her brother dropped Violeta’s son, whom he had been holding, and began wrestling with appellant in an attempt to seize appellant’s gun. Several shots were fired and Raymond fell to the floor. Appellant then picked up the victim and fired at least two more shots into his body. Violeta threw some cocaine at appellant and he left. During the entire incident, Violeta’s son was present.</p>

Dalia, who lived several houses away from her sister, saw appellant and several other men arrive in a burgundy car and watched appellant and a second man exit the vehicle and begin walking toward Violeta’s house. Dalia saw appellant enter her sister’s house and return approximately five minutes later to where the second man was standing and witnessed the second man hand appellant the gun. She saw appellant re-enter Violeta’s house after which she heard the shots. Dalia then ran into the street and came face-to-face with appellant as he was leaving her sister’s house. Appellant pointed the gun at Dalia and began running down the block and jumped into the burgundy car.</p>

On January 25, 1986, at approximately 8:30 in the evening, appellant and a companion appeared at the home of Richard Campbell. Mr. Richard Campbell’s younger brother, Dennis Dantzler, answered the door and called to Richard, who at that time was upstairs. Immediately thereafter, Dennis again called to Richard to tell him that appellant had a gun whereupon Richard grabbed a loaded shotgun out of his bedroom closet. When Richard reached the top of the stairs, appellant, who was standing at the bottom of the stairs, pointed a forty-five automatic at him. The two men exchanged fire after which appellant and his companion fled. Appellant, who was injured, was then observed standing along the sidewalk by a pedestrian. The police arrived and transported appellant to Einstein Hospital. Richard Campbell, his girlfriend Sharon Williams and Dennis Dantzler later identified appellant as the person involved in the incident. Spent cartridges and fired projectiles from both incidents were examined by ballistics and determined to be from the same gun. Appellant was subsequently arrested and charged with the murder of Raymond Cintron and the related offenses.</p>

Moreover, the record contains several referenced to the fact that appellant was at the home of Jose on the night of the murder for the <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>specific purpose of buying and/or exchanging drugs. Even prior to the introduction of Jose’s testimony regarding appellant’s and Jose’s prior drug dealings, the jury had heard evidence that appellant knew that there would likely be cocaine at Violeta and Jose’s home. Violeta testified that when appellant arrived, he asked for a “sixteen” and then asked how much a “sixteen” would cost. Appellant then watched while Violeta weighed and bagged the cocaine. In addition, Violeta testified that she was arrested the night of the murder and charged with possession of cocaine. Thus, given the overwhelming evidence as to the drug involvement on the part of most of the witnesses, admission of the challenged evidence resulted in no actual prejudice to appellant. Having concluded that no prejudice resulted therefrom, we also conclude that counsel can not, therefore, be deemed ineffective for failing to object to the admission of this evidence. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Pierce, supra.</em>

The crimes to which appellant refers include a conviction for simple assault and a conviction for unauthorized use of an automobile, both of which constitute misdemeanors of the second degree.

Having placed appellant’s character in issue, the prosecutor would then be free to bring out appellant’s prior convictions although neither were felony convictions. <em>Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/511/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="511 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1798674" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0299-01">511 Pa. 299</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0299-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="511 Pa. 299" data-case-ids="1798674" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0299-01">513 A.2d 373</a> (1986). The defense, therefore, introduced the evidence first, in the hope that it could be used more favorably.

When appellant first exhibited the gun, he pointed it at Violeta and demanded cocaine. Raymond Cintron, who at that time was holding Violeta’s one-year old son, then dropped the child and began wrestling with appellant in an attempt to seize the gun. In his attempt to shoot the victim, appellant shot a stereo speaker, a lamp and the wall. After appellant shot the victim, he pointed the gun at Violeta, who was now holding her child in her arms, and demanded the cocaine. Appellant then returned to where the victim laid, picked up the body and, again, shot the victim. Based upon this evidence, it is clear that the jury was justified in finding this aggravating circumstance. <em>See, Commonwealth v.
