Both men were subsequently charged by criminal complaint with Theft by Unlawful Taking<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and Criminal Conspiracy<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>. Prior to appellee's trial on the above stated charges counsel for the prosecution exercised one of her peremptory challenges to strike the sole black member from the jury venire. The challenge was contested by counsel for the defense on the basis of the United States Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em><a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">476 U.S. 79</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">106 S.Ct. 1712</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">90 L.Ed.2d 69</a> (1986). The trial court sustained the challenge after counsel for the prosecution stated her reasons on the record for the challenge. The appellee was then tried and was found guilty of all charges. He subsequently filed timely post-trial motions in the nature of a motion for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. The trial court dismissed his motion in arrest of judgment, in which a Rule 1100 violation was alleged, but granted him a new trial pursuant to his assignment of error as to the striking of the prospective juror. Both the Commonwealth and the appellee filed Notices of Appeal to the <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>Superior Court which consolidated the appeals and then affirmed as to both of the trial court’s orders. <a href="/pa-super/374/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="374 Pa. Super. 493" data-case-ids="698113" data-case-paths="/pa-super/374/0493-01">374 Pa.Super. 493</a>, <a href="/pa-super/374/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="374 Pa. Super. 493" data-case-ids="698113" data-case-paths="/pa-super/374/0493-01">543 A.2d 579</a>. We then granted the Commonwealth’s petition for allocatur to determine whether or not the lower courts had properly relied upon <em>Batson v. Kentucky, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">supra,</a> </em>in deciding to grant the appellee a new trial. The issue before us is not a complaint that the Commonwealth indulges in invidious collection of prospective jurors. The complaint is that selection of jurors for the appellee’s trial, i.e., the petit jury, called from the general venire for his immediate trial, were excluded by purposeful discrimination by the use of peremptory challenge. <em>Batson </em>has réduced the issue to the closer question of whether the use of peremptory challenges in an individual case to purposely remove prospective jurors for reasons of race represents a constitutional violation of equal protection. <em>Batson </em>holds that the Commonwealth cannot do indirectly what it cannot do directly, which is to say, that in selection of a petit jury they cannot achieve a prejudice denied them in the general collection of jurors.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[217,1352,1158,894]]]'>
      <em>Batson </em>has altered the proofs required under Swain<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> to bring such complaint to a sharper focus. The <em>Swain </em>standard was addressed in essence to the larger question of whether the Commonwealth systematically and consistently excluded a racial group from jury service. The burden of proof of such exclusion required the defendant to prove more than was generally possible. <em>Batson </em>centers its attention directly to the immediate scene of trial in which one may complain that in “his case” discrimination is afoot by the use of peremptory challenge. <em>Batson </em>does not prohibit the use of peremptory challenge, nor does it require that an accused receive trial from any given proportion of members of his racial origin. It provides for inquiry into the use of peremptory challenges not their abolition. Within the limit of the numbers of peremptory challenges allowed at trial, their use has been sanctioned by long experience as a source in the balance of fairness.</p>

To do so, <em>Batson </em>arms the defendant with the presumption that peremptory challenges may permit “those to discriminate that are of a mind to discriminate” and that the defendant, being a member of a “cognizable racial group”, which group the prosecutor has removed by peremptory challenge, raises a <em>prima facie </em>case of purposeful discrimination. When a defendant has satisfied this burden the state is then required to forward a neutral explanation for its decision to challenge the juror. As the court in <em>Batson </em>noted:</p>

The record here reveals that prior to trial the appellee elected to pursue the defense of alibi as evidenced by the fact that a Notice of Alibi was filed. The alleged witness was a woman by the name of Michelle Ferguson whom both the appellee and the co-defendant maintained they were visiting, at her home, at the operative time. During the selection of the jury panel, counsel for the prosecution discovered that one of the prospective jurors, Mary Savage, lived in close proximity to Ms. Ferguson. This together with the fact that Mrs. Sav<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>age has ten children living with her prompted counsel for the prosecution to exercise one of her peremptory challenges.

Against these concerns defense counsel advanced the argument that yet another juror resid<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>ing in the same locale was not challenged, and that he, being white, should have been excluded by peremptory challenge as well, which he was not. This failure is alleged by the appellee to demonstrate that the Commonwealth’s motives were therefore of the type which the Supreme Court sought to eliminate by its holding in <em>Batson.</em>

There was, however, a trait other than race which distinguished the two. That trait is parenthood. Without the benefit of children this mutually agreed upon juror, Mr. Kaufman, would not be subject to the same network of possible intrusive information as would Mrs. Savage, a parent of ten. When the trial judge initially evaluated the Commonwealth’s exercise of peremptory challenges he found no indicia of deliberate racial prejudice. It was when he re-evaluated his decision and presumed that race was the only articulable reason for the challenge, that he fell into error. As our review reveals, here there were reasons beyond race which occasioned the challenge and therefore the rule in <em>Batson </em>remains inviolate.</p>

Nowhere in the majority opinion is there ever mentioned the existence of a white male prospective juror who appears to have the same infirmity, living in proximity to a witness, as did the black female prospective juror. Without reference to this critical factor, it would be easy to embrace the reasoning of the majority writer, for it would appear that the Commonwealth’s explanation, while somewhat out of the ordinary, could overcome a prima facia showing of discrimination. Viewing in context <em>all </em>the facts together with the inferences drawn by the trial and Superior Courts, however, leads one to the unmistakable conclusion that the analysis of the majority is patently one-sided, myopic and in error. Where it is inescapable, as here, that the original determination is based upon cogent reasoning derived from the facts of record, I see no reason for this court to interefere with that decision.</p>

I emphatically concur with that reasoned determination and would not disturb it on appeal.</p>
