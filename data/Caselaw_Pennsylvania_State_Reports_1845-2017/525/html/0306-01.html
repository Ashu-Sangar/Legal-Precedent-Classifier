The agent then determined that this misrepresentation was not material and merely exchanged the previous answer on the application with the information provided by Mr. Miller. Metropolitan made no further inquiries or investigation regarding this inconsistency. The policy was then issued on December 18, 1984.</p>

The plurality opinion, authored by Mr. Justice McDermott and joined by one other Justice, held that the legislature, through its enactment of such a pervasive and encompassing regulation, intended to foreclose any previously held common law right not set forth in the'Act. Therefore, the insurer was precluded from rescinding the policy <em>ab initio </em>as provided by common law contract principles.

At a later inquiry the appellee, Mr. Miller, informed a Metropolitan agent that he had suffered a minor loss to a shed amounting to a $2,000 claim.

      <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>Without the benefit of § 1171.5(9), Miller is not entitled to thirty days notice prior to cancellation and the insurance carrier would be entitled to avail itself of remedies it reserved in its policy. In this appeal, the Appellant specifically reserved the right to void the insurance contract if procured through the use of fraud or misrepresentation. Exercising this right, the Appellant ¡voided Miller’s contract retroactive to the date the policy was issued. Since I see no basis for prohibiting the Appellant from exercising rights reserved under its contract and not contrary to UIPA, I concur in the majority’s reversal of the Commonwealth Court Order affirming the actions of the insurance commissioner.</p>

Insurance Commissioner (“Bonnie Beck ”), </em><a href="/pa/517/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="517 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1809881" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0218-01">517 Pa. 218</a>, <a href="/pa/517/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="517 Pa. 218" data-case-ids="1809881" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0218-01">535 A.2d 588</a> (1987) (plurality opinion). In <em>Bonnie Beck, </em>we were asked to review Act 78 and determine whether the General Assembly had effectively abrogated the right of rescission with respect to automobile insurance. Unlike UIPA, Act 78 was amended to read as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.6",562,[250,1475,1111,97]]]'>No insurer shall cancel a policy except for one or more of the following specified reasons:</blockquote>

Thus, the General Assembly made it clear in Act 78 that even if an insurance carrier could establish a material misrepresentation in the procurement of that insurance, the exclusive remedy was cancellation of the automobile insurance policy. Prior to this amendment, material misrepresentation was not included in Act 78 as a basis for <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>termination of the policy. With this amendment, the Legislature clearly preempted and limited the available remedies to an automobile insurance carrier. It also appears that the amendment was in direct response to the judiciary’s refusal to restrict an automobile insurance carrier’s remedies without a clear legislative intent. <em>See Safeguard Mutual Insurance Company v. Huggins, </em><a href="/pa-super/241/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="241 Pa.
