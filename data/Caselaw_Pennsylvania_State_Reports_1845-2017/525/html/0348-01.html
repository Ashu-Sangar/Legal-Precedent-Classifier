Tameka M., who was born on January 21, 1981, was adjudicated dependent by the Juvenile Court and placed under the supervision of CYS in March, 1983. Tameka M. was placed with a foster family who had earlier received Tameka’s younger brother, Brian. The natural mother failed to follow through with a rehabilitation program and, hence, the permanent plan put into effect for both children was adoption.</p>

      <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>Juvenile Court’s review of Tameka’s placement with the foster parents was held on August 31, 1984. During the hearing, the issue of payment for Tameka’s attendance at preschool was considered. Testimony presented at the hearing revealed that in August of 1983 Tameka had been referred to the Parent-Child Guidance Center (Guidance Center) because of self-abusive behavior such as picking at her arms, nose and upper lip until they bled. After an evaluation, the Guidance Center recommended that she be placed in the South Hills Therapeutic Preschool where she was enrolled in September of 1983. The South Hills preschool was funded through Mental Health/Mental Retardation and involved no cost or expense to CYS. In December of 1983, the foster mother removed Tameka from the South Hills preschool because, according to her, Tameka’s behavior had deteriorated; for example, her screaming and tantrums had escalated. The foster mother also believed that Tameka was spending too much time at the school, causing her sleeping pattern to be interrupted. The foster parents then enrolled Tameka in a Montessori preschool in an effort to provide a more structured program for the child. The foster mother testified that Tameka’s behavior improved after the transfer. The cost of the Montessori program was originally $70.00 per month, but had been increased to $80.00 per month at the time of the hearing. The foster parents had been paying the tuition for the Montessori school. At the review hearing, the foster parents sought reimbursement from CYS for Tameka’s attendance at Montessori. Because CYS would receive no reimbursement from the Department of Public Welfare for Tameka’s attendance at Montessori, the agency opposed paying her tuition there.</p>

Although the Court acknowledged the finan<a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>cial limitations of CYS, the Court found that Tameka’s masochistic behavior demonstrated that she had both special problems and special needs. The Court noted that her behavior had deteriorated in the South Hills program, but had improved in the Montessori one and therefore that the Montessori program was best suited for her special needs. The Court concluded that the highly structured program at Montessori was therapeutic as well as educational and that enrollment there was in Tameka’s best interest. A direct appeal to the Superior Court followed. That court held the order appealable and affirmed, Judge Tamilia dissenting in an opinion joined by Judges Del Sole and Popovich. <a href="/pa-super/368/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="368 Pa.

CYS maintains that the question only arose at the instance of the foster parents, and that they have no standing to raise the question. CYS relies on <em>In Re Adoption of Crystal D.R., </em><a href="/pa-super/331/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="331 Pa.

That case held that foster parents did not have standing under the Adoption Act, 23 P.S. § 2101, <em>et seq., </em>to petition for the termination of the parental rights of natural parents because the foster parents did not stand <em>in loco parentis. </em>CYS would read the Juvenile Act to be subject to the same standing requirement.</p>

They held that the argument need not be considered because it was the Juvenile Court order being reviewed and that that order was entered after an evidentiary hearing, and not as a result of the foster parents’ actions. The Juvenile Court maintains a continuing plenary jurisdiction in dependency cases under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6351 (set forth at n. 1 above, and see, <em>In Re Lowry, <a href="/pa/506/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="506 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1790981" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0121-01">supra,</a> </em>discussed below) and has the power to review the circumstances of dependent juveniles and to question both the legal custodian, CYS, and the foster parents concerning the condition and the needs of the dependent child. This case is unlike that of <em>Crystal D.R. </em>There, the foster parents began an independent proceeding to affect the parental rights of the natural parents. That kind of proceeding properly requires that <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>taking the initiative be limited to the party <em>in loco parentis. </em>Here, there was no problem of standing either at the outset of the proceeding or during its course because Juvenile Court acquired continuing jurisdiction under § 6351(a)(2) once that court found Tameka M. to be a dependent child.</p>
    <p id="b601-5" data-blocks='[["BL_601.5",601,[216,545,1154,794]]]'>CYS also argues that the Superior Court erred in holding that the Juvenile Court has power under § 6351 of the Juvenile Act to order CYS to fund a dependent child’s attendance at what they characterize as a non-therapeutic pre-school which was neither licensed nor funded by the Department of Public Welfare. This argument turns, at least in part, on the language of § 6351(a) which gives the Court authority to make disposition orders for dependent children which are “best suited to the protection and physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child.” Section (a)(2) goes on to permit the court to make orders for the custody of the child “subject to conditions and limitations as the court prescribes.” The argument also concerns the reach of the court’s authority to impose conditions and limitations under our decision in <em>In Re Lowry, <a href="/pa/506/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="506 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1790981" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0121-01">supra.</a></em>

This case, however, involves the very general language “subject to conditions and limitations as the court prescribes.” CYS argues that this very general language should not be construed broadly to allow the Juvenile Courts to exercise completely independent discretion in disregard of the exper<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>tise and the budgetary limitations of public child care agencies.</p>

It is agreed that at some point the Juvenile Court has the power to impose orders for the protection of the interests of dependent children. The question is whether the court is to exercise independent judgment concerning the program for each dependent child, or whether it is to sit <em>in review </em>of the adequacy of the decisions of the public child care agency to which the court assigns the care and legal custody of the child.</p>

This is correct. In <em>In Re Lowry, </em>we held that “[i]n ordering a disposition under Section 6351 of the Juvenile Act, the court acts not in the role of adjudicator reviewing the action of an administrative agency, ... rather the court acts pursuant to a separate discretionary role with the purpose of meeting the child’s best interests.” <a href="/pa/506/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="506 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1790981" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0121-01">506 Pa. at 127</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="506 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="1790981" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0121-01">484 A.2d at 386</a>.</p>

In his dissent, Judge Tamilia offered two reasons for distinguishing <em>Lowry. </em>First, he noted that the law establishes the local agencies and charges them with providing treatment and services, including services as legal custodian of dependent children under the Juvenile Act. As governmental agencies clothed with significant discretion and expertise, their statutory role should be respected. Second, he argued that the resources of local CYS agencies are limited. They cannot afford to do everything for the dependent children in their care which might benefit them, and that the allocation of scarce resources is much more a matter of legislative and administrative discretion than of judicial discretion. The agencies and the county boards which support them have much better access to the big picture of the needs of all of the children served by the agency, he argues, than does a <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>judge who is attending to a single case involving a single child.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.5",603,[205,401,1154,891]]]'>The real point at issue is whether the Juvenile Court abused its discretion by not taking into account or finding decisive the fact that CYS would not be reimbursed by the State for the cost of the Montessori school approved by the court. (It is hard to see how, on these facts, and considering the direct welfare of Tameka M., it could be argued that the trial court abused its discretion in any other way.) This, in turn, raises the question of whether the Juvenile Court, in order to vindicate the fundamental statutory right of a dependent child to her own “protection and physical, mental and moral welfare,” may order assistance that a county agency, and ultimately the County itself, will have to pay for through the raising and/or expenditure of tax revenues. We find that the Juvenile Court has authority to enter such an order under the Juvenile Act and that that court did not abuse its discretion by doing so in this case.</p>
    <p id="b603-6" data-blocks='[["BL_603.6",603,[203,1320,1154,463]]]'>This point was addressed, at least in part, in <em>Lowry. </em>In that case, the homes into which the Juvenile Court placed the dependent children had not received prior approval as foster care homes in compliance with Department of Public Welfare (DPW) regulations.

However, Section 2305 of the Public Welfare Code, 62 P.S. § 2305, provides that “[t]he local authorities of any institution district shall have the power, and for the purpose of protecting and promoting the welfare of children and youth, it shall be their duty ..., to provide in foster family homes or child caring institutions adequate substitute care for any child in need of such care and, <em>upon the request of the court, </em>

Thus, the imprimatur of a court entering a dispositional order pursuant to its authority under Section 6351, in conjunction with the duty placed upon the institution district under Section 2305, <em>supra, </em>mandates CYS participation. Again, this result is contemplated by Department regulations which set forth the required services of the county agency, including the provision of “any services and care ordered by the court under provisions of the Juvenile Act ...,” 55 Pa.Code § 3130.38(a) and “other required services, including services or care ordered by the court____” 55 Pa.Code § 3130.34(4).</blockquote>

This bestows on a dependent child the legal right to such care and treatment to be paid for by CYS. Were the choice here between two equally effective schools, both suited to the child’s special needs, the costs of one of which was reimbursable by DPW and the other not, we would have no hesitancy in holding that it would be an abuse of discretion not to direct that the child be sent to the school the expenses of which were reimbursable.

Here, the facts show that the school whose <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>expenses were reimbursable was not adequate while the non-reimbursable Montessori school would provide adequate treatment. It was clearly not error to ignore reimbursability in this situation. The Juvenile Act, as reinforced by our case law, was passed for the <em>benefit </em>of dependent children and is based on humanitarian ideals. Once the state intervenes in an individual’s life there is the corresponding obligation to provide adequate treatment services to the person affected. <em>Welsch v.

It has been proven that a child will not receive adequate treatment at one school (expenses to be reimbursed by the state) but will receive adequate treatment at a non-reimbursable Montessori school. To order Tameka M. to attend a school where she would not receive proper treatment would be to deprive her of due process and of her fundamental rights under the laws of Pennsylvania. Consideration of expense must give way under such circumstances particularly where the relevant governmental agency (here, CYS) has an expressed legal duty to provide and pay for such care.</p>

    <p id="b607-10" data-blocks='[["BL_607.11",607,[218,912,1154,198]]]'>I join in the opinion of the majority, but write separately to address two specific points. Before reaching them I wish to note that both the trial judge and the foster parents should be lauded for their efforts in this difficult case.</p>
    <p id="b607-11" data-blocks='[["BL_607.12",607,[215,1138,1156,584]]]'>First, it should be emphasized that the foster parents recognized the special needs of Tameka and repeatedly asked for assistance and guidance from Children and Youth Services (CYS) in addressing those needs. Prior to having the child undergo a psychological evaluation as requested by the foster parents, CYS recommended placing the child in the South Hills Therapeutic Preschool. When the foster mother complained that this program was not addressing Tameka’s specific problems, she was informed by CYS that she could make alternate arrangements for the child but, they would not be paid for by CYS.</p>
    <p id="b607-12" data-blocks='[["BL_607.13",607,[213,1741,1153,312]]]'>The foster mother chose to do exactly that. She enrolled Tameka in the Montessori School, selecting that program because it was highly structured. Once there the child did improve. The foster mother so strongly believed that the Montessori preschool was the best program for Tameka that she paid the tuition herself.</p>
    <p id="b607-13" data-blocks='[["BL_607.14",607,[212,2075,1154,260]],["BL_608.1",608,[238,290,1152,303]]]'>By the time the requested psychological evaluation finally occurred, Tameka had been in the Montessori school for over four months. Dr. Harway’s evaluation concluded that the child needed a well structured preschool environment and that she seemed to be doing well at the time she was <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>evaluated. The report did not make a selection as to which preschool would best suit the child. A fair reading of the entire report supports the trial judge’s conclusion that the school in which the child was enrolled at the time of the evaluation was the preferred place to continue her education.</p>
    <p id="b608-5" data-blocks='[["BL_608.5",608,[236,620,1153,518]]]'>The second point I which to make is to emphasize the difficult task facing the trial judge. He was forced to decide whether the child should remain in the preschool environment that clearly seemed to be in her best interests, and refuse to order compensation for a foster parent who had been so diligent in seeking the best care for this child; or, to accept the recommendation of CYS and refuse payment for Tameka’s schooling unless she was returned to the less desirable program at South Hills Therapeutic Preschool.</p>
    <p id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.6",608,[234,1166,1153,583]]]'>In reaching his decision, the trial judge obviously took great care in adhering to the philosophy that decisions affecting dependant children such as Tameka, should be made on the basis of what is appropriate and needed for the child; not on the basis of financial considerations alone — as recommended by CYS. This decision should not be taken as a means to allow Juvenile Court Judges to ignore the financial restraints of agencies such as CYS; but as only what it is, a decision resting on its own particular facts. Again I reiterate, the efforts of the foster parents and the trial judge in this particular case must be applauded.</p>

I write separately to emphasize that the decision here should not be interpreted as authorizing foster parents to seek, or judges to order, payment for “non-funded” services in routine placement situations. The decision of the juvenile court was based on the highly unusual set of facts presented at the hearing in this matter, which is virtually sui generis. The court determined that the state-funded therapeutic pre-school was inadequate and ineffective in addressing this child’s extreme masochistic <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>behavior and other behavioral problems, while the non-funded program had proven beneficial. This determination was consistent with the assessment provided by the psychologist to whom CYS had referred the child. The order, which was subject to review in six months, was both reasonable and necessary for the protection and welfare of the child.</p>
