On February 9, 1973, counsel for John McHugh, Joseph Boardman, Esquire, filed a writ of summons in trespass and assumpsit against Mr. McHugh’s employer, Interstate Oil Company, and Mobil Oil Company, under the provisions of general maritime law and the Jones Act (46 U.S.C.A.App. <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>§ 688).

Saybolt, Inc., and sometime thereafter, Attorney Boardman referred both cases to Appellee Litvin, which entered its appearance for the McHughs on July 5, 1974.</p>

This action was dismissed as to E. W. Saybolt on April 9, 1980, and as to the other defendants on May 19, 1980, by the Honorable James McDermott, now a Justice of this Court, for failure to serve the complaint on the defendants properly.

Saybolt, Inc. Appellees filed for summary judgment in its favor as to any claims Mrs. McHugh was alleging, because her only allegation of damage was one for loss of consortium. Appellees argued that no cause of action had been recognized in Pennsylvania on February 12, 1971, permitting a spouse to maintain a loss of consortium claim. Therefore, Appellees could not have breached a duty <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>to prosecute a hitherto unknown cause of action on her behalf and could not be found responsible to her on a legal malpractice claim.

Thus, to argue that we did not understand that we were applying the case retroactively to a matter which arose even before the enactment of the Equal Rights Amendment is in error.</p>
    <p id="b259-6" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[185,1252,1157,900]]]'>We did no more in <em>Hopkins </em>than to apply the law to a case that was in our judicial system at the time <em>Hopkins </em>was handed down and by implication extend that ruling to all other cases pending before our courts at that time. Appellees had in fact filed a law suit on Mrs. McHughs behalf which was pending at the time <em>Hopkins </em>was issued and even filed a complaint in 1979 raising her loss of consortium claim. Why did they do this if she had no cause of action? Obviously, because Appellees believed that the <em>Hopkins </em>decision was applicable to them. This was reasonable conduct on their part and demonstrates the truth of the general understanding that changes in the law are applied to cases in the system at the time the change is announced. To argue now that no duty existed is to fight the facts which imposed a duty on Appellees, because they in fact responded to <em>Hopkins </em>and filed a consortium claim for Mrs. McHugh.</p>
