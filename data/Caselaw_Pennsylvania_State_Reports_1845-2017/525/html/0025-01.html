The Superior Court affirmed the lower court’s award of alimony, alimony pendente lite, counsel fees, and expenses to Mrs. McCabe, but vacated the court’s scheme for equitable distribution of marital property. It remanded for a redetermination of equitable distribution on the ground that the lower court erred in determining a value for Mr. McCabe’s partnership interest in a law firm. Both parties petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal. We denied the petition of Mr. McCabe seeking review of the award of alimony, alimony pendente lite, counsel fees, and expenses. The petition of Mrs. McCabe, however, raising the issue of equitable distribution, was granted.</p>

He was earning approximately $150,000 per year from his law practice when marital separation occurred. He contributed substantially to the maintenance of his wife’s lifestyle during the marriage. Mrs. McCabe has never been employed, but nevertheless contributed to the marriage by being supportive of her husband’s work, taking care of their household, and devoting considerable time to raising their five children. Mrs. McCabe has several hundred thousand dollars worth of non-marital property, obtained through inheritance, and receives approximately $30,000 per year in income from this property and from trusts established by her father and grandfather.</p>

The answer is dependent upon which of two alternative valuation methods is employed.</p>
    <p id="b276-5" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[232,669,1157,740]]]'>The method employed by the Superior Court utilized a formula that the Rawle &amp; Henderson partnership agreement set forth for the purpose of computing the sum that is subject to withdrawal when a partner terminates his association with the firm. The agreement has not been significantly changed since 1963, and provides that a withdrawing partner is entitled only to his share of the capital account (minus the amount of any indebtedness to the firm) and, if 90 days notice is given, his share of undistributed profits to date.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the time of marital separation Mr. McCabe had already received distributions of profits in the form of monthly draws.

    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[228,1429,1157,578]]]'>In contrast, the valuation method employed by the Court of Common Pleas disregarded the terms of the partnership agreement entirely and instead appraised the firm as a “going concern,” attributing to Mr. McCabe his percentage ownership therein (6.3%), valued at $286,276. This method was the one advanced by an expert witness for Mrs. McCabe. Included in the “going concern” value were all of the firm’s assets (equipment, books, cash, etc.), accounts receivable (minus accounts payable and an allowance for bad debts), and work-in-progress (services rendered but not yet billed). Goodwill was not included in the appraisal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Accordingly, we affirm.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[231,649,1155,421]]]'>If Mr. McCabe were able to sell, liquidate, or otherwise realize the “going concern” value assigned to his partnership interest, it would be evident that the approach followed by the Court of Common Pleas should prevail. However, it has been clearly established in this case that the “going concern” value cannot be realized in any manner. It would be unrealistic, therefore, to assign this value to the partnership interest for purposes of equitable distribution.</p>

Furthermore, Rawle &amp; Henderson is not an entity with shares that can be traded publicly or privately. There is no market to which a partner can refer to ascertain the value of his partnership interest. Nor can the firm be sold or liquidated at the behest of a partner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

These provisions do not allow a partner to remove from the firm a proportionate share of the accounts receivable, work-in-progress accounts, or other accounts included in the “going concern” value. Under no circumstances can a partner liquidate his share of the partnership and receive a proportionate share of the firm’s total value, including its <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>equipment, accounts receivable, etc. Rather, as discussed supra, a partner is strictly limited to receiving his capital account, and his share of undistributed profits, in the event he wishes to liquidate his share in the firm. Further, a partner is not permitted to sell his partnership interest to another individual. Nor does a partner have a right to retire from the firm and continue to receive a share of the firm’s profits. Under these circumstances, it would be inequitable to apply a “going concern” value to the partner’s share.</p>

Indeed, the agreement must be viewed as the preeminent factor in valuing a partner’s rights.

Some may be governed by partnership agreements that allow them to realize values corresponding to some or all of the elements that enter into the computation of a firm’s value as a “going concern.” Such is not, however, the case here. Certainly, where an agreement imposes strict limits on the value that can be realized by a partner, the agreement places the continuing welfare of the partnership as a whole above the interests of any particular member of the <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>firm.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This results in a true diminution in the distinguishable value of any given partner’s individual interest, and it would be a fiction to appraise such an interest as though the limitations were not in effect.

The husband now says that effort could only be realized if the partnership is dissolved. Despite long life, everyone and everything is mutable, subject to change in person, place and condition. The partnership in question, has long prevailed, but yet must rely upon agreement to continue. It can be dissolved by its members for their own reasons and what was, upon a given day, will no longer stand. Meanwhile, what the wife contributed remains an asset of that partnership, but appellee contends it is subject to his agreement with others. ' The partnership’s net worth has been calculated and appellee’s share is known. How and why he cannot get what he helped create is from his own choice. What the wife gave to help his effort is between him and her. Appellee’s agreement with others ought not deprive her of what exists from their common effort. Appellee owes to her what she helped him obtain. He used her effort to get what he has. She ought not be defeated because he encumbered it by agreement with others. I believe his calculable share is an asset for purposes of equitable distribution. I pass no judgment here upon how it should be apportioned between them.</p>
