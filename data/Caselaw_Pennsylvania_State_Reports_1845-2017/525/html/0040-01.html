In July, 1987, the FOP declared an impasse in the negotiations. Accordingly, it invoked the mandatory and binding arbitration provisions of section 4 of Act 111 which are available when an impasse is reached between a public employer and its police personnel during the collective bargaining process.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[195,621,1156,915]]]'>A board of arbitration was appointed, and it held four evidentiary hearings and received sundry documents. Based on this evidence, the arbitrators awarded increased benefits to the state police. Among other things, an across-the-board pay raise of $2,000 per annum was to be implemented over the two-year contract. A substantial increase in pension benefits was ordered; conjoined with this term, it was ordered that if the pension increase were to be judicially overturned or held to be void, it would be replaced by an across-the-board base pay increase of $1,000. The arbitration award also permitted police officers an election of remedies when charged with offenses subject to court-martial proceedings — the officers were henceforth to be permitted to select grievance arbitration as an alternative to a court martial. Finally, the award included all ranks of police officers up through lieutenant colonel as part of the bargaining unit which benefitted from the new agreement.</p>

A divided <em>en banc </em>panel of the court vacated portions of the award due to perceived transgressions of the statutory limitations on collective bargaining agreements under Act 111. The appeals now require us to decide whether the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that: (1) the Retirement Code, 71 Pa.C.S. § 5955, precludes Act 111 arbitration over pension benefits; (2) the Commonwealth Court had jurisdiction to rule in the first instance on the appropriateness of the bargaining unit; and (3) the election of remedies provision, providing grievance arbitration as an alternative method for challenging offenses subject to court-martial proceedings, was invalid and unenforceable.</p>

Title 71 Pa.C.S. § 5955 states, in pertinent part: “Pension rights of State employees shall be determined solely by this part or any amendment thereto, and no collective bargaining agreement between the Commonwealth and its employees shall be construed to change any of the provisions herein.” At the time of its passage, the State Employees’ Retirement Code contained a repealer, section 2(d) of the pamphlet law, which stated:</p>

    <p id="b292-7" data-blocks='[["BL_292.7",292,[288,1569,1154,299]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that this repealer obviously precludes bargaining, pursuant to Act 111, over pension benefits, which, pursuant to the Retirement Code, cannot be changed by collective bargaining agreement but shall be determined solely by the Retirement Code or amendments thereto.</p>
    <p id="b292-8" data-blocks='[["BL_292.8",292,[286,1896,1153,307]]]'>We are not persuaded by this argument.

Neither does the procedure inhibit the Commissioner’s ability to prefer charges and recommend discharge. The arbitration award merely adds the alternative of a hearing before an impartial arbitrator to the remaining alternative of accepting a court martial. Like the Public School Code, there are no provisions in the Administrative Code which preclude such a procedure.</p>
    <p id="b299-4" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[209,898,1154,1167]]]'>We must be careful to avoid inappropriate connotations which might be derived from military courts martial. Although the term “court martial” justifiably emphasizes the paramilitary aspects of uniformed service in the generally-regarded prestigious Pennsylvania State Police, serving as a state trooper is more akin to holding a civilian job than true military service in the national defense. The fundamental distinction derives from the indentured nature of military service such that a soldier may be impressed into service and may not resign at will. A state trooper, on the other hand, may decide on a whim to abandon his job and never return to work. He would be subject to “court martial,” but the ultimate sanction would be discharge from employment. A soldier would theoretically be exposed to the ultimate sanction of execution by firing squad if he abandoned his job under circumstances which could be characterized as desertion in the face of the enemy. Bearing in mind this distinction, we do not deem state police “court-martial” proceedings to be sacrosanct, but rather to involve employment-related disciplinary matters which may appropriately be referred to grievance arbitration.</p>
