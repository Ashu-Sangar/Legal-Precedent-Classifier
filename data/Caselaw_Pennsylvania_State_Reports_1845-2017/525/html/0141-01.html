On January 12, 1987, the trial court entered an order which adopted the master’s recommendations. Neither party appealed from the order.</p>

A rule to show cause was issued and made returnable on April 21, 1987, at which time the trial court held a hearing. The trial court found that the husband had willfully failed to comply with the court’s order and entered an order directing, inter alia, that <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>the husband’s wages be attached forthwith in the amount of $493.25 per month for a period of sixty months.</p>

The Superior Court acknowledged that a literal reading of Section 401(b) and 401(c) indicates that the trial court does have the power to attach wages, but applied the principles of statutory construction to find otherwise. We conclude that Section 401(b) does vest authority in the trial court to issue wage attachments to enforce equitable distribution orders.

In analyzing the relevant provisions, the Superior Court concluded that Section 8127 was the special provision which prevails.

To hold otherwise would excise that explicit grant <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>of authority in Section 401(b) and defeat the intended purpose of that provision.</p>

Section 401 of the Divorce Code was amended in 1988 to add subsection (k), which permits the trial court to effect compliance with an order of equitable distribution by nine enumerated methods, including wage attachment. This amendment was adopted after the trial court’s order in the instant case. We reject the husband’s argument that the amendment indicates that the language of Section 401(b) was insufficient to grant the trial court authority to attach wages to enforce equitable distribution awards. The amendment delineates additional powers not specified in subsection (b), but does not alter the specific grant of authority contained therein.</p>
