Appellees alleged that by the terms of the labor agreement with the unions, all members of the union were to be referred to employment opportunities as the opportunities became known to appellants, a practice commonly termed a “hiring hall.” Appellees alleged that, contrary to this agreement, the Union discriminated against Ms. Driscoll because of her sex by assigning her little or no employment since she became a journeyman carpenter in June 1983. Appellees further alleged that when Mr. Dailey protested the treatment of Ms. Driscoll, his daughter, appellants retaliated by refusing to refer him for employment opportunities.

After conducting a thorough examination of the interests protected by both the PHRA and the NLRA, the Superior Court concluded that the claims under the PHRA were not preempted by the NLRA. The court used a two-prong analysis and considered, first, whether a finding against preemption would frustrate congressional objectives; and second, whether the matter touched “deeply rooted local concerns” and was only of peripheral concern to the federal law. The court found that a finding against preemption would not frustrate Congressional intent because Congress had not explicitly removed jurisdiction from the states in this area of law, and because federal statutes evince a general intent to accord parallel or overlapping remedies for discrimination. It further determined that sex discrimination was merely a peripheral concern of the NLRA, which focuses on unfair labor practices generally, while such discrimination is a central focus of, and therefore “deeply rooted” in, the local concerns codified in the PHRA.

In <em>Schena </em>the Court distilled the reasoning of the several Supreme Court cases dealing with preemption and created a two-prong test: first, the court must inquire whether the state has a strong interest in redressing the alleged injury, and second, the court must determine whether it can adjudicate the action without deciding the merits of the underlying labor controversy. In the <em>Schena </em>case the claim of a discharged employee against a union, seeking damages for the union’s failure to pursue the employee’s claim before the NLRB, was found to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the NLRB. The Court concluded that, although the state had strong interest in redressing the injury, it could not adjudicate the claim without deciding the merits of the underlying labor controversy.

The “specialized knowledge and cumulative experience” of the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission, therefore, is peculiar to problems arising from and related to employment discrimination. It is consistent with the legislative intent of Title VII to permit claims of employment discrimination, in whatever context they may arise, to be pursued via the procedures established by the Civil Rights Act. In fact, the Act specifically prohibits labor organizations from engaging in discriminatory employment practices, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>
