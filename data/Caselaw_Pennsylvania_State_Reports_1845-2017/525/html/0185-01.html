    <p id="b436-7" data-blocks='[["BL_436.7",436,[231,549,1153,416]]]'>The facts are as follows. Relying on a tip that an Hispanic male was selling drugs on the corner of Howard and Somerset Streets in Philadelphia, undercover Police Officer Freddie Chaves went there about 4 p.m. on April 21, 1986. A male later identified as Charlie Garcia approached Chaves and asked him what he wanted. Chaves replied that he wanted a $10.00 bag of cocaine, and Garcia indicated he had to get it.</p>
    <p id="b436-8" data-blocks='[["BL_436.8",436,[229,982,1153,301]]]'>Garcia walked to 2749 North Howard Street and knocked on the door. Appellant, Sergio Lopez, came to the door, looked toward Officer Chaves, then handed Garcia a clear plastic packet. Garcia gave the packet to Chaves, who gave Garcia a prerecorded $20.00 bill. Garcia returned $10.00 to the officer.</p>
    <p id="b436-9" data-blocks='[["BL_436.9",436,[227,1309,1152,300]]]'>Chaves then drove around the block, notified his back-up that the exchange had occurred, and returned to 2749 North Howard Street. Appellant’s back-up, Corporal Murphy and Officer Brosnan arrested Garcia at the corner. Officers Wilbert Kane and Mack McDonald arrested appellant in the house.</p>
    <p id="b436-10" data-blocks='[["BL_436.10",436,[222,1635,1154,522]]]'>Officer Wilbert Kane testified that the house at 2749 North Howard Street had a wooden door and either a screen door or steel grating on the outside. As the officers approached the house, the screen door was ajar and the wooden door was open about a foot. Before entering the premises, the police observed appellant repairing the ceiling while standing on a board balanced between two ladders, and a second man repairing a window. Officer Kane testified that he did not have to open the door any further. The police entered the premises and announced their identity.</p>

One of the items cleared away was a brown paper bag which had been folded outward, and which Kane believed to contain nails. As he moved it, however, he noticed it was filled with money. When Kane removed the money, there were clear plastic packets containing white powder underneath. Kane then frisked appellant and removed a wad of money from appellant’s pocket. The total money seized was $1,575.00 from the paper bag and $614.00 from appellant’s pocket. The prerecorded twenty dollar bill was found in the money taken from appellant’s pocket. There were also five Ziploc plastic bags, each containing ten smaller plastic bags, which were filled with white powder. Police also confiscated twelve loose packets which, with the packet purchased by Officer Chaves, totaled sixty-three.</p>
    <p id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.6",437,[236,1170,1152,199]]]'>The Commonwealth contends on appeal that the suppression court erred in ruling that police were not presented by exigent circumstances justifying appellant’s warrantless arrest. For the reasons which follow, we agree.</p>
    <p id="b437-6" data-blocks='[["BL_437.7",437,[235,1385,1153,307]]]'>Our first inquiry in determining the lawfulness of a warrantless arrest is to ascertain whether probable cause existed at the time of the arrest. <em>Commonwealth v. Wagner, </em><a href="/pa/486/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="486 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1757576" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0548-01">486 Pa. 548</a>, <a href="/pa/486/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="486 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1757576" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0548-01">406 A.2d 1026</a> (1979). In the present case, the suppression court found that probable cause did indeed exist, and this determination is not challenged on appeal.</p>
    <p id="b437-7" data-blocks='[["BL_437.8",437,[235,1710,1153,618]]]'>We must next ascertain whether there were exigent circumstances sufficient to justify appellant’s warrantless arrest. In <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/483/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="483 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1751172" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0293-01">483 Pa. 293</a>, <a href="/pa/483/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="483 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1751172" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0293-01">396 A.2d 1177</a> (1978), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court enumerated the following relevant factors to be considered when determining whether exigent circumstances existed: 1) the gravity of the offense; 2) a reasonable belief that the suspect is armed; 3) a clear showing of probable cause; 4) strong reason to believe that the suspect is on the premises; 5) likelihood that the suspect will escape if not quickly apprehended; 6) the time of the entry; and 7) whether the entry is peaceable.</p>
    <p id="b438-5" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[244,313,1154,365]]]'>
      <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>The suppression court specifically noted that police “had sufficient information to warrant a reasonable man in the belief that a crime had been committed and the defendant was involved,” suppression court opinion at 4, but it did not analyze the factors enumerated in <em>Williams. </em>Instead, it found generally that there were no exigent circumstances present in this case.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[240,696,1157,474]]]'>Our review of the record compels the conclusion that the application of the <em>Williams </em>factors weighs in favor of finding appellant’s warrantless arrest proper. Initially, the gravity of the offense was severe. Possession with intent to deliver is a felony, punishable by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen years or a fine not in excess of $250,-000.00, or both. <em>See Commonwealth v. Miley, </em><a href="/pa-super/314/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="314 Pa. Super. 88" data-case-ids="83930" data-case-paths="/pa-super/314/0088-01">314 Pa.Super. 88</a>, 97, <a href="/pa-super/314/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="314 Pa.

    <p id="b438-7" data-blocks='[["BL_438.7",438,[235,1187,1155,632]]]'>We previously noted that probable cause was shown, thereby satisfying the third factor in <em>Williams. </em>The fourth criterion, a strong reason to believe that the suspect is on the premises, is clearly present, as appellant was observed by several officers at the residence. Next, the entry was shortly after 4 p.m., in the daylight hours. Further, the entry, and therefore the arrest, followed the commission of the crime by mere minutes. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Williams, <a href="/pa/483/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="483 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1751172" data-case-paths="/pa/483/0293-01">supra</a> </em>(homicide pre-dated date of arrest by three years, so little need of swift apprehension); <em>Commonwealth v. Wagner, <a href="/pa/486/0548-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="486 Pa. 548" data-case-ids="1757576" data-case-paths="/pa/486/0548-01">supra</a> </em>(no need of swift apprehension as theft occurred six months earlier).</p>
    <p id="b438-8" data-blocks='[["BL_438.8",438,[232,1838,1154,476]],["BL_439.1",439,[227,327,1152,97]]]'>The second <em>Williams </em>factor, whether or not police held a reasonable belief that the suspect was armed, was not investigated during the suppression hearing. However, we agree with the Commonwealth’s observation that experienced narcotics officers may have expected that appellant, engaged as he was in observable drug selling, was indeed armed. The fifth criterion enumerated in <em>Williams, </em>the likelihood of appellant’s escape if not quickly apprehended, is certainly present here. Tied with this factor is the <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>likelihood that the drugs and marked government money might disappear.</p>
    <p id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.6",439,[226,440,1154,367]]]'>Finally, <em>Williams </em>requires that we examine the nature of the entry. Officer Kane testified that both the outer and inner doors of the residence were open. He estimated that the inner wooden door was open about a foot, and stated that he did not have to open the door any further. When Kane ordered appellant to climb down from the scaffold, he cooperated; the entry was certainly peaceable.</p>
    <p id="b439-6" data-blocks='[["BL_439.7",439,[225,824,1154,689]]]'>In reviewing the ruling of a suppression court, our standard of review is limited to ascertaining whether the factual findings are supported by the record and whether the legal conclusions drawn from those facts are in error. <em>Commonwealth v. Morgan, </em><a href="/pa/517/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="517 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1809873" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0093-01">517 Pa. 93</a>, <a href="/pa/517/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="517 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1809873" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0093-01">534 A.2d 1054</a> (1987). It is clear that the suppression court’s conclusion, that “the record is absent any facts” which would have allowed the court to conclude that police were presented with exigent circumstances justifying appellant’s arrest, is not supported by the record. Further, as appellant’s arrest was legal, the officers were lawfully in a position to observe the opened paper bag containing money and drugs. <em>Commonwealth v. Pytak, </em><a href="/pa-super/278/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="278 Pa.

The police could have maintained their vigil until a search warrant was obtained. There was, in this case, no indication that the occupant of the dwelling was making any effort to leave the premises; thus there were no exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless entry and arrest. Regrettably, I can find no basis for the precipitous action taken here and the grant of the motion to suppress should be reinstated.</p>

Viewing these facts in the light most favorable to the Appellant as the prevailing party, it appears that on April 21,1986, at 4:00 p.m., Officer Chaves, an undercover policeman, was approached by Charlie Garcia regarding the sale of $10.00 worth of cocaine. Garcia informed Officer Chaves that he would purchase the drugs for the Officer. Garcia then walked to 2749 North Howard Street, knocked on the door, and while remaining outside the screen door received a small package. In return, Garcia gave the male occupant, now identified as the Appellant, a pre-recorded $20.00 bill and received a $10.00 bill in change. This whole transaction was observed by Officer Chaves. Garcia then proceeded back to where Officer Chaves was parked and gave him the packet and a $10.00 bill in change. Officer Chaves then drove around the corner and informed his back-up units surrounding the house to move in.</p>

The outside door was opened a couple of inches while the inside door was opened about a foot. Officer Kane observed the Appellant in the living room fixing the ceiling while standing on a board that was laying across two ladders. Without knocking and identifying themselves or otherwise receiving any permission to enter, the police officers entered the premises and placed Appellant under arrest. At that time, the Appellant had a hammer in his hand and was surrounded by other equipment. Officer Kane ordered the Appellant to put down the hammer, which he did, and then Officer Kane cleared the board of the equipment. On that board was a brown paper bag which Officer Kane believed contained nails. When he removed the bag, Officer Kane noticed that it contained money, removed the money and discovered clear plastic packets of a white powder later identified as cocaine. Officer Kane then frisked the Appellant and found a wad of money, which contained the pre-recorded $20.00 bill.</p>

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>The <em>Williams </em>test was relied upon by both lower courts in disposing of this matter. Having considered these factors in light of the testimony, the suppression court suppressed the physical evidence finding that exigent circumstances did not exist to excuse the lack of a warrant for either the arrest or the search. The Superior Court, however, viewed the evidence differently and based upon <em>Williams </em>justified the warrantless search. Reviewing the record in light of <em>Williams, </em>I cannot agree with the Superior Court. It is clear that the crimes involved were not crimes of violence. Furthermore, there was no testimony establishing that the Appellant was armed. Although Officer Kane did testify that he believed that the equipment surrounding the Appellant could be used as a weapon, this observation occurred <em>after </em>entry and arrest and not <em>before. </em>In discussing this factor, the Superior Court concluded that since the Appellant was engaged in observable drug selling it was reasonable to believe that he was indeed armed. Under this record this speculation is not sufficient to satisfy the second factor.</p>
    <p id="b445-5" data-blocks='[["BL_445.6",445,[206,1403,1157,826]]]'>The suppression court did find that probable cause existed for Appellant’s arrest and the record appears to support its conclusion that there was a clear showing of probable cause. Although there was no question that the Appellant was in his residence, there was no evidence to support the contention that the Appellant was likely to escape. Like the second factor, the Superior Court concocted a contrary conclusion on the basis of its own assumptions. Finally, it is arguable as to whether the entry was accomplished through peace or force. The purpose of the sixth factor is to give the suspect the opportunity to surrender prior to an invasion of his privacy. In this instance, the police did not knock and announce their presence, but rather “squeezed” through an opening in the Appellant’s screen door and front door. Once again, under this record, satisfaction of the sixth factor is questionable.</p>

Although the suppression court did not specifically cite to the <em>Williams </em>test, it is clear from its discussion on the record that it evaluated the Commonwealth evidence in light of <em>Williams </em>and determined that the weight of the evidence supported suppression because exigent circumstances did not exist for seizure without a warrant. As such, the Superior Court erred in substituting its own judgment for that of the suppression court.</p>
