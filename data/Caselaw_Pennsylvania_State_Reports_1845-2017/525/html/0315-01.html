Her subsequent petitions for modification of sentence and for a new trial based upon after discovered evidence were dismissed.

The contents of the report were not used in evidence at trial. The meaning attached by the appellant and argued here was not discovered until the appellate process was under way. She contends that had it been available it would have aided her defense, that she was a first time, non-participating visitor to a virtual drug factory in a house in the Poconos. The appellant appealed to Superior Court and that court held that the use of the material in the police report was in fact a denial of her rights to the disclosure of Commonwealth evidence. They, nonetheless, held that the error under <em>Commonwealth v.

The evidence of the Commonwealth showed that on an early morning in April, 1985, the police raided the home of Sicoli. Prior to entry, the police had observed three people moving about the house through a window, the other windows of the house were covered with various types of materials. The house emitted a strong odor described as cooking methamphetamine, and the occupants were coming out of the house, including the appellant, who came out to a balcony, apparently to escape the odors of the cooking drugs. When the police executed their search warrant and entered the house, they found the appellant in the kitchen where drugs were found cooking on the kitchen stove. They also found numerous portable camping stoves on which pots of methamphetamine were boiling. Since the presence of someone was required to monitor the drug cooking process and the appellant was in the kitchen, a jury could deduct her participation in the process. While mere presence is not enough, presence at a stove with pots bubbling drugs in a house, permeated with <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>the odor not only from the kitchen, but from camp stoves throughout the house, is sufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth’s theory that she was an active participant. One need not own premises to actively or constructively participate in criminal enterprises therein. The jury could find that a person in a kitchen with cooking drugs, in a house, a veritable cookery of drugs, was involved in their manufacture and was exercising knowledge, control, and dominion over the process. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b568-5" data-blocks='[["BL_568.5",568,[227,918,1152,258]]]'>Against this evidence, the appellant offered no evidence, apparently relying on the testimony of John Meo, who was found by the police hiding on a shelf in a closet, that he and the appellant, his girlfriend, were visitors who came for other reasons and stayed the night.</p>

It is upon this point her complaint that she was denied the police report became pertinent. The police report was that of Trooper Marchetti, who participated in the surveillance of the house prior to the issuance of the search warrant. During his surveillance, he observed Sicoli arrive with a woman and deliver material to the house. In his report he identified the woman as Mrs. Sicoli, the wife of the co-defendant and the owner of the house. Trooper Marchetti was not called to testify. The trooper who did testify referred to the woman who accompanied Sicoli as an “unidentified woman.” Appellant complains that since the woman was unidentified at trial, but was, in fact, Mrs. Sicoli and not the appellant, the jury was led to believe that the “unidentified woman” was her, putting the lie to Meo’s evidence that he and appellant were first time visitors. Were that all, it would indeed argue that appellant is correct and entitled to clarification by new trial. To determine the question, the Superior Court remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the failure of the <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>Commonwealth to supply Trooper Marchetti’s report was error. The trial court found error but found the error harmless and reinstated the judgment of sentence. The trial court found the evidence that was denied was neither exculpatory or incriminating. Indeed at trial the only reference to an “unidentified woman” was by Trooper Kutch, and when asked if he ever saw the appellant before, he said the only time he ever saw her was in the kitchen when he entered on the morning of the raid. Appellant’s contention that she was compromised by any ambiguity was dissolved. Further, Trooper Kutch’s testimony concerned matters observed days prior to the raid and the reference to an “unidentified woman” was the Tuesday prior to appellant’s visit to the house. Who that person was, was sufficiently established to be other than appellant.</p>
