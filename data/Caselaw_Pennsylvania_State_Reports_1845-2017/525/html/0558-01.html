During the procedure, the patient struck or kicked Ms. Viscichini, whose skin was accidentally punctured by the needle which she had used to take blood from the patient. When Ms. Viscichini learned that the patient was a carrier of hepatitis and other diseases, she immediately sought treatment from Doctors Giunta and Alwine, appellants herein. The appellants advised her that if she remained symptom free for six weeks, she would not have been infected by the hepatitis virus.

The trial court granted appellants’ preliminary objections and dismissed appellee’s complaint with prejudice on the ground that the appellants owed appellee no duty of care because there was no privity between appellee and the appellants.

Building on this, we stated in <em>Guy v. Liederbach:</em>

The more a professional knows about his client’s or patient’s situation, the more likely he is to be able to render valuable services, but also the more likely it is that he will learn things which may affect third parties. If liability were imposed for harm which might befall one or more of these third parties, a professional would be forced to analyze each client or patient situation with respect to potential third pariy risk and to speculate as to the nature, seriousness, likelihood, frequency of risk, the patient’s circumstances which might trigger the risk, and the third parties who might be exposed to risk. Obviously, such an undertaking would require much more information from the client or patient, would be very costly and time consuming, and would inevitably result in the sort of narrowing of inquiry referred to above.</p>
