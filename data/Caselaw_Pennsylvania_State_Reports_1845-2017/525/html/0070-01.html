Zuba of the Edwardsville Borough (Luzerne County) Police Department. Sgt. Zuba completed an Involuntary Emergency Examination and Treatment application pursuant to Section 302(a) of the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. § 7101 <em>et seq. </em>In accordance with the prescribed procedure for involuntary admissions under the Act, Sgt. Zuba asserted, in the application, • that Geiger was severely mentally disabled and posed a clear and present danger to himself and others. In describing the specific behavior to support his assertions, Sgt. Zuba advised that he had encountered Geiger carrying a hunting knife and threatening to use it on himself if he did not receive immediate help. The officer also noted that Geiger had told him that one week earlier Geiger held a loaded .357 Magnum to his head while contemplating suicide because he was so distraught over the termination of his relationship with his girlfriend of five (5) years, Marie Collins, one of the appellants herein.</p>

This conclusion is reinforced by the provisions of Section 4(a) of Act 1978, Sept. 28, P.L. 788, No. 152, which was adopted in conjunction with 1 Pa.C.S. § 2310 and the former 42 Pa.C.S. § 5110, the predecessor of the current Sovereign Immunity Act. Section 4(a) lists certain statutes, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the Mental Health Procedures Act, which either affect or are affected by the Sovereign Immunity Act. The affected statutes “are repealed insofar as they waive or purport to waive sovereign immunity inconsistent with this act, but are saved from repeal insofar as they provide defenses or immunities from suit.” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Since the Sovereign Immunity Act contains a medical-professional liability exception, it is not inconsistent with the immunity section of the Mental Health Procedures Act, i.e. 50 P.S. § 7114; therefore, the latter statute has not been repealed. Indeed, by applying the second portion of the above-quoted language, it is clear that the legislative intent is to provide the Commonwealth with the additional protections of 50 P.S. § 7114, i.e. no civil or criminal liability <em>except </em>in a case of willful misconduct or gross negligence.</p>

Or, in other words, to whom is the duty owed? For guidance we must look to the language of the statute.

      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> (Emphasis supplied).
