Present during the viewing of the film were the child’s mother, Cindi Snoke, and the mother’s boyfriend, William Leed.<a class="footnotemark">1</a> The child became visibly upset during the film and confided in her mother that her father, Lynn Snoke, had “touched” her around the Halloween season of 1984. The child described an incident which occurred on a night her mother was working and she was left in the care of her father. She testified that during the night she and her father watched a “Snoopy” cartoon. She said her father had told her to come into his bedroom; once there, he told her to disrobe and he then proceeded to perform oral and vaginal intercourse. The victim also testified that her father rubbed his penis until he caused a “white cream” to discharge. Following the assault, she and her father took a bath together and he told her that this would be “their little secret” and not to tell her mother. Lynn Snoke was later <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>charged with indecent assault and the corruption of a minor.</p>

The Commonwealth also produced Cindi Snoke’s employer, who testified that Mrs. Snoke was working from 5:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. on the night of October 26, 1984. Finally, the Commonwealth presented the volunteer from Rape Aid and Prevention who played the film for the children at Clay Elementary School in March, 1985 in order to describe how the film explained to the children of the elementary school the difference between “good touching” and “bad touching”. The film gave the children instructions on what to do if someone assaulted them.</p>
    <p id="b547-6" data-blocks='[["BL_547.6",547,[187,1139,1158,839]]]'>The appellant presented the testimony of Doreen Pavone, an employee from The Lancaster County Children and Youth Agency who interviewed Melanie shortly after the film. The appellant asked the witness to read into the record the statement of Melanie as documented by the employee in a report, in an attempt to establish inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony. On cross-examination the Commonwealth was permitted to question the employee about what recommendation she included in the report after the interview with Melanie. Pavone testified that as a result of her interview she was able to gather information that substantiated that there was sexual contact between the victim and her father. Defense counsel objected to this testimony on the basis that it was beyond the scope of direct examination and irrelevant. This objection was overruled.</p>

    <p id="b551-5" data-blocks='[["BL_551.5",551,[144,385,1157,958]]]'>The present case is distinguishable from <em>Lane. </em>In <em>Lane, </em>an eight-year-old victim was violently assaulted by a neighbor. The trial judge excused a juror for cause because of his inability to ignore the year long delay in reporting the incident. This Court held that the trial judge erred by excusing the juror. In the present case, a five year old was the victim of an assault by her father. After the assault, he told her this would be “their little secret.” The child at such a tender age would have had no reason to question her father. The child victim revealed the incident five months later after viewing a film at her elementary school dealing with sexual assault. The film explained to the children the difference between “good touching” and “bad touching.” The mother of the victim took the child to seek counseling at the Children and Youth Agency. After an interview with the child, a counselor stated in her report that the assault was substantiated and referred the matter to the police for a criminal complaint to be charged.</p>
    <p id="b551-6" data-blocks='[["BL_551.6",551,[145,1362,1156,953]],["BL_552.1",552,[276,268,1151,87]]]'>Where no physical force is used to accomplish the reprehensible assault, a child victim would have no reason to promptly complain of the wrong-doing, particularly where the person involved is in a position of confidence. Where such an encounter is of a nature that a minor victim may not appreciate the offensive nature of the conduct, the lack of a complaint would not necessarily justify an inference of a fabrication. As the testimony reveals in this, case, the child had no reason to question the character of the conduct until her subsequent viewing of a film depicting this type of conduct. It is also significant that the party involved in the behavior was her father whom she would naturally trust and accept his judgment as to the propriety of the act. The encouragement by the father to maintain the confidence as to this incident also dilutes any inference drawn merely from a delayed complaint. In this setting the absence of an immediate outcry would not in and of itself warrant an inference that the event was a recent fabrication and, <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>therefore, a charge to that effect was properly denied by the trial court.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.5",552,[274,382,1152,465]]]'>The trial judge in this case refused to instruct the jury with a charge specifically addressing the implications of a delay in making a complaint. The trial judge properly reasoned that the facts of this case did not necessitate the specific instruction on delay. The trial judge did instruct the jury thoroughly upon the general subject of credibility in accordance with the suggested instruction for witness credibility, PA Suggested Standard Jury Instructions (Crim.) § 4.17.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">2</a>

      <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>The appellant's second claim of error asserts that the trial judge improperly permitted the Commonwealth to cross-examine the appellant’s witness concerning her conclusion in the report made after an interview with the victim. This claim has no merit. The witness had testified on direct examination to the contents of the statements made by the victim. The Commonwealth, on cross-examination questioned the witness as to the category in which she placed this incident. The witness testified that as a result of the interview with the victim she considered the incident substantiated and forwarded the information to the State Welfare Department and to the police. The appellant’s counsel objected to this testimony and the trial judge overruled the objection.</p>
    <p id="b553-5" data-blocks='[["BL_553.5",553,[186,1023,1157,745]]]'>The generally accepted rule in the Commonwealth is that cross-examination should be limited to matters testified to on direct examination. <em>Woodland v.

However, this is broadly defined to include inferences, deductions or conclusions which may be drawn therefrom, which explain or destroy the effect of the direct testimony. <em>See, e.g., Martin v.
