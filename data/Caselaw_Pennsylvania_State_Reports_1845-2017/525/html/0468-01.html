Testimony offered at the hearing revealed that enforcement <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>of Plan 87 would result in an immediate diminution of benefits to members of the Union compared to the benefits provided under the existing Plan J (H.T., 1/30/86, pp. 13-18). Based on this, the trial court inferred that the Union would sustain a permanent membership loss resulting from the City’s unilateral diminution of benefits. The trial court further inferred that the loss would be both immediate and irreparable because neither current nor future union members would have any use for a union powerless to enforce its current collective bargaining agreement. Given the evidence presented at the hearing and the trial court’s reasonable inferences, there are “apparently reasonable grounds” for the trial court’s conclusion that the Union would sustain immediate and irreparable harm as a result of the City’s enforcement of Philadelphia Ordinance 1107.</p>

The Commission was charged with formulating and recommending the passage of legislation that would mandate actuarial funding standards and would establish a recovery program for municipal pension systems determined to be financially distressed. The report of the Commission revealed the approximately 2,300 local government retirement systems in the Commonwealth had a combined unfunded liability of approximately $3,000,000,000.00 and, unless extensive intervention by the Commonwealth was forthcoming, funding crises for municipal government retirement systems were inevitable. Specifically, in the City of Philadelphia, as of July 1, 1985, the unfunded liability of the Philadelphia Board of Pensions was $1,731,000,000.00. The City has been amortizing the liability by paying a percent higher than the payment made the previous year. This process is spread over a thirty-year period begun in 1979 and ending in 2019. In 1986 the City paid $95,000,-000.00 towards the unfunded liability. If the City does not receive special relief under Act 205, by complying with its mandatory provisions, the Act requires “level dollar amortization payments” which in the case of 1986 would amount to $177,000,000, a difference of $82,000,000.</p>

In <em>City of Allentown </em>we held that 1) the Municipal Retirement Law permits a municipality to require enrollment of one group of police or firemen in the Retirement system, while leaving for vote of the members of another group — those enrolled in an existing pension fund — the decision whether or not to join the Retirement System, and 2) the unilateral decision by the City to initiate new pension terms for some members of the bargaining unit constituted a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. <em><a href="/pa/511/0275-02" class="citation" data-index="122" data-cite="512 A.2d 1175" data-case-ids="1798739" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0275-02">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/511/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="511 Pa. 275" data-case-ids="1798673,1798739" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0275-01,/pa/511/0275-02">511 Pa. at 286, 287</a>, <a href="/pa/511/0275-02" class="citation" data-index="124" data-cite="512 A.2d 1175" data-case-ids="1798739" data-case-paths="/pa/511/0275-02">512 A.2d 1175</a>.</p>

The Opinion In Support of Affirmance completely misperceives the relevance of the mandatory aspect of certain sections of Act 205 in this analysis. The second distinction between City of Allentown and the case <em>sub judice </em>set forth in this opinion, devolves from the enunciated legislative intent to use its power to unilaterally alter a bargained contract, which did not exist in City of Allentown. Here, once the municipality elects to seek revenue aid under Act 205 and is determined to be Distress Level III, the municipality is mandated to utilize three remedies, one of which is the "establishment of a revised benefit plan for newly hired municipal employees pursuant to section 607(e).” Section 607(e) uses language which directs "consultation” rather than "bargaining” when developing the newly revised benefit plan. Section 607(e) also indicates the revised benefit plan "shall be within the scope of collective bargaining pursuant to the applicable law subsequent to the establishment of the revised benefit plan.” Clearly the legislature’s intent to use its power to alter a bargained <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>contract, present here, was not present in City of Allentown, a significant distinction.</p>

It would destroy our union, because what would happen is, we would have disgruntled workers because <em>eventually over the years </em>you would have half the people with one type of pension and the other people with the other type of pension and the other people with the other type of pension and before you know it, we would have people dropping out of the Union because they would accuse the Union of not negotiating in good faith when we were negotiating. And we will not permit that to happen. Just like with the sick leave, and with the vacation, they asked us to include just the people that was coming in, the new people, and we say no on the same grounds, because there would be disgruntled employees in the bargaining unit and we were not going to go for that because we seen the chance there that the City had that they would divide this Union and tear it apart, which they are trying to do all the time.
