    <p id="b663-11" data-blocks='[["BL_663.11",663,[211,1431,1155,684]]]'>On June 24, 1987, Appellant, M. Russell Buchanan, was arrested and charged with statutory rape, corruption of a minor and endangering the welfare of a child. A preliminary hearing was held before District Justice Edward Verbonitz, Luzerne County. At the hearing the Commonwealth, over defense counsel’s objection, presented the hearsay testimony of the investigating police officer, who recounted the alleged criminal incident as it was alleged to have been related to him by the victim, a seven year old child. The victim did not testify, nor was any other evidence presented at the preliminary hearing. The district judge ruled that the Commonwealth had established a prima facie case and bound Buchanan over for trial.</p>

No additional evidence was presented. The trial court entered an order denying habeas corpus relief and upon the motion of Buchanan, refused to amend its order to include certification language, to provide permission to appeal the interlocutory order (Pa.R.A.P. 1311). Buchanan filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court which was transferred to the Superior Court. The Superior Court denied the petition for review, and Buchanan petitioned the Supreme Court for allowance of appeal. We granted allocatur and now reverse.</p>

Third, trained counsel can more effectively discover the case the State has against his client and make possible the preparation of a proper defense to meet that case at the trial. Fourth, counsel can also be influential at the preliminary hearing in making effective arguments for the accused on such matters as the necessity for an early psychiatric examination or bail.</blockquote>
