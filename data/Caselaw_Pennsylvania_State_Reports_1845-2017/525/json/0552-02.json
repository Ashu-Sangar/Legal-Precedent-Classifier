        "text": "ZAPPALA, Justice,\ndissenting.\nI must dissent from the decision of this Court to dismiss this matter as improvidently granted. Appellant Girlie Singh was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime following the shooting death of her husband, Frankie Singh. Throughout the trial of the case, the Appellant had maintained that the killing was done in self-defense after the deceased threatened to harm her with a knife.\nWe granted allocatur to address the Appellant\u2019s contention that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction to the jury advising that prior acts of spousal violence could be considered by the jury in support of her claim of self-defense. The Superior Court had rejected the Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim on the basis that she was permitted to present evidence regarding the husband\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and prior acts of violence against her. Indeed, a portion of this evidence involved testimony of two of the children of the Appellant and deceased that gave an accounting of a turbulent and violent relationship between their parents which \u00e9scalated during the. last year of marriage to weekly episodes of physical abuse by the husband.\nThe Superior Court addressed the relationship as follows: Likewise the appellant\u2019s recitation of her marriage depicted a woman locked into a verbally and physically offensive relationship which heightened in intensity when the victim became intoxicated and this occurred every day during-the last year of marriage and culminated in the appellant retrieving a gun to protect herself. We read the appellant\u2019s marriage to be one held together out of fear of reprisal from the victim if she left, the need to have financial assistance in- raising her three children and the hope that the victim would change his abusive ways.\nCommonwealth v. Singh, 372 Pa.Super. 512, 518, 539 A.2d 1314; 1316-1317 (1988). Citing its decision in Commonwealth v. Tyson, 363 Pa.Super. 380, 526 A.2d 395 (1987), the Superior Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s self-defense charge and request that the jury utilize \u201ccommon sense\u201d in deciding the facts before reaching a verdict was sufficient in light of the extensive testimony of spousal abuse. The Superior Court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request an instruction relating to the victim\u2019s pattern of abuse and Appellant's belief that deadly force was necessary to defend against her husband.\nThe Superior Court\u2019s analysis misses the point. Although the jury heard lengthy testimony about the victim\u2019s violent nature and the abusive relationship between the Appellant and the victim, the jury was never given guidance as to the legal significance of the history of the abuse in determining whether the Appellant reasonably believed that she was in danger of death or serious bodily injury. The jury was required to address the relevance of the husband\u2019s prior acts of violence against the Appellant in a vacuum.\nAs I stated in my concurring opinion in Commonwealth v. Stonehouse, 521 Pa. 41, 66, 555 A.2d 772, 785 (1989), in which this identical issue was raised, \u201cTrial counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction was inimical to his client\u2019s interests. No more harmful omission is conceivable.\u201d I would hold that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request such an instruction and grant a new trial to the Appellant.",
