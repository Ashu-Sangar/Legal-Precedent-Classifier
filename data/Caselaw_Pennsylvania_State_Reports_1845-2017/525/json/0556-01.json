If that issue was not raised in post-trial motions, it is to be deemed waived on the authority of Commonwealth v. Gravely, 486 Pa. 194, 404 A.2d 1296 (1979); and the Superi- or Court shall then proceed to decide on the merits those issues raised on appeal which were first raised in post-trial motions. If the Superior Court finds that the suppression issue was raised in any post-trial motions filed with the trial court, the petition for allowance of appeal is granted. Jurisdiction is retained.",
