Failure of a designated standing committee to notify the commission of its disapproval within ten days shall constitute its approval of the agency’s report.

However, if the commission is <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>prevented from transmitting notice and the report to the General Assembly within the time period provided for in this subsection because of recess or adjournment, it may transmit notice and the report on the first subsequent session day. Failure of the commission to transmit the agency’s report within the time period provided by this subsection or on the first subsequent session day shall constitute approval of the revised final-form regulation, (d) Whenever the designated standing committees of both Houses of the General Assembly have received the report of an agency pursuant to subsection (b), or the notice and the agency’s report pursuant to subsection (c), or the notice pursuant to section 6(c) [§ 745.6(c) ], one or both of the designated standing committees may within 14 days report to the House of Representatives or Senate a concurrent resolution and notify the affected agency which shall be the official notice to the agency. During the 14-day period, the agency shall not be permitted to promulgate the regulation. If, at the expiration of the 14-day period, both of the designated standing committees fail to act on the agency’s report, then the regulation is deemed approved and the agency may proceed to promulgate the regulation as provided in the act of July 31,1968 (P.L. 769, No. 240), referred to as the Commonwealth Documents Law. A final order adopting the regulation shall not be published for 30 calendar days or ten legislative days, whichever is longer, from date of reporting the concurrent resolution. If both the House of Representatives and the Senate agree to the concurrent resolution within the allotted time period, which is 30 calendar days or ten legislative days, whichever is longer, from the date of reporting of the concurrent resolution, then the adoption of the concurrent resolution shall constitute a bar to publication until presentment to the Governor and final disposition of the regulation. The resolution shall be presented to the Governor in accordance with section 9 of Article III of the Constitution of Pennsylvania. If the Governor does not return the resolution to the General Assembly within ten calendar days after it is pre<a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>sented to him, it shall constitute approval of the resolution. If the Governor vetoes the action of the General Assembly, the General Assembly may, within 30 calendar days or ten legislative days, whichever is longer, override that veto by a two-thirds vote in each house; [sic] and that override shall constitute a permanent bar to publication. Failure of the House of Representatives and the Senate to act on the concurrent resolution or veto within the allotted time periods shall constitute approval of the final-form regulation. In addition, notice as to any final disposition of any concurrent resolution considered in accordance with this act shall be published in the Pennsylvania Bulletin. The General Assembly may, at its discretion, adopt a concurrent resolution disapproving the regulation to indicate the intent of the General Assembly, but permit publication of a final order adopting a regulation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

First, the lower court misapplied <em>Chadha </em>to the facts of this case. In <em>Chadha, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States was reviewing a statute which gave one House in Congress the power, by resolution, to overrule an Attorney General’s decision not to deport an illegal alien. The alternative remedies available to Chadha allowed him to raise defenses at his <em>subsequent </em>deportation hearing. <em><a href="/us/462/0919-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="462 U.S. 919" data-case-ids="6196077" data-case-paths="/us/462/0919-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/462/0919-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="462 U.S. 919" data-case-ids="6196077" data-case-paths="/us/462/0919-01">at 936</a>, <a href="/us/462/0919-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="462 U.S. 919" data-case-ids="6196077" data-case-paths="/us/462/0919-01">103 S.Ct. at 2776</a>.

Failure to submit a proposed regulation on the first subsequent session day shall constitute approval thereof. Pending the review of a regulation by the General Assembly, the commission may continue an order barring publication of a final order adopting a regulation, issue such an order if none was previously issued, or withdraw its order. If the General Assembly disapproves a regulation, the disapproval shall constitute a permanent order barring publication, or shall rescind a regulation for which a final order was published pending review of the regulation by the commission or the General Assembly. The General Assembly may at its discretion, however, disapprove a regulation to indicate the intent of the General Assembly, but permit publication of a final order adopting a regulation.</blockquote>

This subsection replaced Section 7(b) of the Regulatory Review Act of 1982, 71 P.S. § 745.7(b), which did not include any provision for presenting the resolution to the Governor for his veto. It is this previous section that the Commonwealth Court held unconstitutional.</p>
