The question of the criteria to be applied when vacating an automatic supersedeas was addressed in <em>Department of Public Welfare v.

In that case the Department of Public Welfare (“DPW’) asserted an automatic supersedeas in connection with an appeal from an order denying preliminary objections, and defendants had the supersedeas vacated by the lower court. Subsequent orders reinforcing earlier orders of the common pleas were also appealed to the Commonwealth Court and an automatic supersedeas asserted. The lower court again vacated the automatic supersedeas. The DPW again appealed to the Commonwealth Court and requested, not a reinstatement of the automatic supersedeas as in this case, but a stay to be entered. The request for stay was denied, and an appeal of that ruling, together with an appeal from a denial of a Writ of Prohibition, was taken to this Court. This Court ruled that those who moved to vacate the supersedeas were effectively granted a stay.</p>

Here, DER is attempting to represent the interest of the people of this Commonwealth and in this respect has no greater standing than the other branches and agencies of government.

The Commonwealth Court, on this issue, retreated from the requirements established for a stay, and by holding “this Court perceives a greater harm in <em>not </em>lifting the automatic supersedeas” (slip mem. op. at 3 Commonwealth Court 1989), improperly applied <em>one </em>of the five tests applicable when issuing a preliminary injunction: will greater injury result by refusing the preliminary injunction than by granting it.

This it did not do. The deadline DER seeks so vigorously and aggressively to follow is self-imposed and not mandated by federal law. The DER may resubmit its regulations for federal review once publication occurs. We recognize the issue of damage to the environment by the presence of ozone, through gasoline emissions in the air we breathe, is a matter of grave public concern. However, the judgment of the DER here cannot be deemed the sole indication of the public interest when there are other agencies equally responsible for protecting this interest, that have differing views. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted a gasoline volatility standard of 10.5 pounds per square inch (“psi”) RVP for Pennsylvania, less stringent than the DER’s proposed standard of 9.0 psi RYP. The mere rejection of the DER’s more stringent standard for the 1990 summer ozone season cannot supply the irreparable harm.</p>

On the other hand, amicus, the Sun Company, has shown it will be considerably harmed if required to speed up its pipelining process to meet the DER’s standards by the summer of 1990. We take judicial notice of the fact that other petroleum companies within the Commonwealth would be similarly affected. The DER has failed to consider these facts with any persuasive argument. Further, this Court was assured by both counsel for the Senate and counsel for amicus, the Sun Company, that objections to publication in 1990 for an effective date at the beginning of the 1991 summer ozone season would not be made, since the petroleum companies will have achieved the capabilities required to meet the standards.</p>
