The appellee’s <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>averments, which are not purely conclusions of law, are contradicted by the averments contained in appellant’s complaint and therefore, appellant’s reply could not surprise appellee or prejudice appellee in his defense. On the other hand, if the appellant is denied permission to file a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>reply to appellee’s new matter and the averments in appellee’s new matter are deemed admitted, obvious prejudice will result to the appellant. Based upon the record in this case, fairness and judicial economy dictate that, on remand, the appellant be granted a reasonable time to file a reply to appellee’s new matter.</p>
