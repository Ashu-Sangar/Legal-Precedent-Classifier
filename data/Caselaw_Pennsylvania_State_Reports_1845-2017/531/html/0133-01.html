    <p id="b264-15" data-blocks='[["BL_264.14",264,[243,1791,1164,419]]]'>On October 4, 1988, appellants James and Joanne Gaus and Kenneth and Catherine Bushman filed a Petition for Appointment of Viewers, in which they alleged a taking of their property by the Township of Indiana. The alleged taking occurred following the grant by the Township of an easement for utility lines and accessories over land alleged to be in the ownership of appellants through operation of the Act of May 9, 1889, P.L. 173, No. 192, Section 1, 36 P.S. § 1961 (Act of 1889).</p>
    <p id="b264-16" data-blocks='[["BL_264.15",264,[242,2235,1164,150]],["BL_265.1",265,[176,323,1158,627]]]'>On November 23, 1988, the Township of Indiana filed preliminary objections to the Petition for Appointment of Viewers. On December 16, 1988, the adjacent landowners for <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>whose benefit the easement issued, David H. Patterson, Mary M. Patterson, Robert L. Marsh, Sr. and Robert L. Marsh, Jr., filed a Petition to Intervene, which petition was granted. The trial court dismissed the Township’s preliminary objections based upon its interpretation of the Act, holding that the subject land had not been open to or used by the public for twenty-one years after it was laid out, that it reverted back to the abutting property owners (appellants), and therefore the Township was required to provide compensation. This decision was reversed by the Commonwealth Court. <a href="/pa-commw/132/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="132 Pa.

    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[177,968,1159,413]]]'>The record discloses that the subject lot plan, the Ottawa Hills Plan of Lots, was recorded by the then owner of the property on January 31, 1955. Two of the intersecting streets in that plan, Indian Drive and Ridgeland Drive, were dedicated for use as public roads. Thereafter, on September 25, 1955, the Board of Supervisors of Indiana Township accepted the Plan subject to court approval, which approval was granted by order of court during the same year.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[176,1401,1159,630]]]'>From November, 1955, Indian Drive, which runs north/ south was open to the public and maintained by Indiana Township, as was the westerly portion of Ridgeland Drive. The current dispute covers the easterly portion of Ridgeland Drive which runs from its intersection with Indian Drive to the intervenors’ property, and between the properties owned by the appellants: a distance of approximately 163 feet. Although this portion of Ridgeland Drive was dedicated and formally accepted by the Township, the Township never installed curbing or paved the street, nor was the road placed in any condition for vehicles to drive on or through; in fact, the right of way was not used for vehicles at all.</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[176,2050,1157,95]],["BL_266.1",266,[259,310,1160,205]]]'>The trial court found that there was no evidence presented which established that the easterly portion of Ridgeland Drive <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>was “open to and used by the public.” This finding was based on the fact that the evidence presented by the Township was found by the trial court to be insufficient to meet the Township’s burden of proof.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[257,539,1164,313]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding first that the formal acceptance by the Township was sufficient to toll the statute, and second, that the easterly portion of Ridgeland Drive had been graded open and that chips were placed down and that this was sufficient public activity to support a conclusion that the street had been opened.</p>
    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[250,875,1167,691]]]'>The latter holding was dependent upon the Commonwealth Court making findings of fact directly contrary to those of the trial court. Clearly, the trial court was in a better position to assess the credibility of witnesses, and to make factual determinations than was the Commonwealth Court. <em>See generally, Pidstawski v. South Whitehall Twp., </em>33 Pa.Cmwlth. 162, <a href="/citations/?q=380%20A.2d%201322" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="380 A.2d 1322">380 A.2d 1322</a> (1977). On this point we must therefore reverse the Commonwealth Court’s determination that there had been a physical opening of the easterly portion of Ridgeland Drive. We turn our attention then to the more difficult issue, i.e. whether the Township’s action in accepting the dedication, which acceptance was court approved, was sufficient to avoid application of the Act of 1889.</p>
    <p id="b266-7" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[247,1600,1166,412]]]'>The appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court erred in determining that the statute of limitations set forth in the Act of 1889 did not apply to this case due to the Township’s formal acceptance of the dedication. In response the appellees argue that the appellants’ reliance upon the Act of 1889 is misplaced, as the express acceptance requirements of the Second Class Township Code obviate the applicability of the Act of 1889.</p>
