The doctrine is applicable only where there is more than one method of accepted treatment or procedure. In specific terms, however, we are called upon in this case to decide once again whether a school of thought qualifies as such when it is advocated by a “considerable number” of medical experts or when it commands acceptance by “respective, reputable and reasonable” practitioners. The former test calls for a quantitative analysis, while the latter is premised on qualitative grounds.</p>

Chidester. In order to create a bloodless field for the surgery, the surgeon employed a tourniquet which was elevated and released at various intervals. Because of subsequent problems with the leg, the patient was referred to a neurosurgeon who determined that Jones had suffered <em>nerve </em>injury to the leg. Additional examinations by other doctors confirmed that the nerve injury had resulted in a condition known as “drop foot.”</p>

First, the qualitative standard is the preferred choice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court as well as most sister jurisdictions.

Third, in spite of this apparent blurring, our recent decision in <em>Brannan </em>seems to have drawn a bright line between the two tests, although the opinion itself employed the language of both tests. Last, it is obvious that the fork in the legal road, splitting off the law in the two directions enumerated herein, was provided by <em>Remley </em>itself because subsequent interpretations depended on which paragraph in Remley was adopted as the rule of the case.</p>
