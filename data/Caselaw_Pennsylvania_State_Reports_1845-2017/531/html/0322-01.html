    <p id="b454-8" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[212,1077,1165,637]]]'>Between February 2 and August 25, 1987, four elderly women in the Borough of Homestead, Pennsylvania, were sexually assaulted in the bedrooms of their homes. The unique pattern of these crimes indicated that the assaults were the work of a single perpetrator since all the victims ranged in age from 65 to 85 years old and lived alone within a densely populated two and one-half block area. These early morning attacks, which occurred after the victims had gone to sleep, began with the assailant covering the victim’s head with a blanket, tying the victim’s hands and feet with clothing, bedclothes or other objects found in the house, sexually assaulting her, and then burglarizing the residence.</p>
    <p id="b454-9" data-blocks='[["BL_454.8",454,[208,1737,1165,473]]]'>In early September, 1987, an Allegheny County Police Detective received information from a confidential informant that Appellant was in possession of a shotgun which had been stolen from one of the victims. The detective was informed that Appellant shortly would arrive at a pawn shop to retrieve the stolen weapon. The police waited at the shop until Appellant arrived, and after Appellant obtained the gun, he was placed under arrest on the charge of receiving stolen property.</p>
