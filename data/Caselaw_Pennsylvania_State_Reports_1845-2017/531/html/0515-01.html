On that date, Thomas Sherk was on duty and was dispatched to respond to and investigate a report of a suspicious person described in the report as a white male with a gun. Approximately one-half hour after embarking on the investigation assigned to him, officer Sherk encountered and arrested Mark A. Jordan (Jordan) who had a history of suffering from mental illness. While officer Sherk was attempting to control and subdue Jordan, a scuffle erupted during which Jordan gained possession of officer Sherk’s weapon. Jordan fired a shot from that weapon wounding officer Sherk in the right thigh. Jordan then fled the scene taking officer Sherk’s gun with him. Shortly thereafter, Jordan committed suicide by shooting himself with the gun he had taken from officer Sherk.</p>

By order dated December 6, 1988, Harrisburg State Hospital’s demurrer was denied by the trial court. Subsequently, the question of sovereign immunity was certified by the trial court as a controlling question of law and an appeal to the Commonwealth Court was filed by Harrisburg State Hospital.

In <em>Goryeb, </em>a Commonwealth party (Clarks Summit State Hospital) discharged a psychiatric patient who had been diagnosed as “severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment”, and who met the statutory criteria <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>for an involuntary emergency admission under the provisions of the Mental Health Procedures Act, 50 P.S. § 7301(a).

The released patient shot all three of them, seriously wounding his former girl-friend and her current boy-friend, and killing the male friend, Emil Goryeb. The injured plaintiffs in <em>Goryeb </em>filed suit against the Commonwealth parties (Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Public Welfare; Clarks Summit State Hospital; and Yao C. Wang, M.D.) alleging, inter alia, gross negligence and willful misconduct in releasing the psychiatric patient when it was known or should have been known that the patient was a danger to himself and to others. The Commonwealth Court, citing and relying on <em>Mascaro, </em>and also citing <em>Chevalier </em>and <em>Moore, </em>held in <em>Goryeb </em>that the shootings carried out by the released psychiatric patient constituted third party criminal acts for which immunity of the Commonwealth was not waived. The Commonwealth Court described that case as “factually indistinguishable” from the instant case and concluded that “the medical-professional liability exception must be limited to injuries suffered by patients, and does not include injuries inflicted upon others by those patients.” On appeal, we reversed. <em>Goryeb v.

We are not persuaded that this difference precludes <em>pari materia, </em>construction of the two acts. “The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921. One of the rules which the Legislature has provided to ascertain and effectuate its intention is the rule that statutes in <em>pari materia </em>shall be construed together.

    <p id="b659-7" data-blocks='[["BL_659.9",659,[165,1187,1160,743]]]'>Although this Court’s decision in <em>Mascaro v. Youth Study Center, </em><a href="/pa/514/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="514 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1804564" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0351-01">514 Pa. 351</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="514 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1804564" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0351-01">523 A.2d 1118</a> (1987) involved an interpretation of governmental immunity under the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, it is instructive on the issue of whether the acts of third parties may impose liability upon a Commonwealth party by imputing the negligence of the third party to the Commonwealth party. <em>Mascaro </em>emphasized the importance of analyzing the precise language of the immunity statute itself in determining whether the legislative intent was to expose a governmental entity to liability. The statutory language is critical because exceptions to the rule of sovereign immunity must be narrowly interpreted given the expressed legislative intent to insulate Commonwealth parties from tort liability. See, <em>Mascaro, </em><a href="/pa/514/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="514 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1804564" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0351-01">514 Pa. at 361</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="514 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1804564" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0351-01">523 A.2d at 1123</a>.</p>

[A]ny harm that others cause may not be imputed to the local agency or its employees.” <em>Mascaro, </em><a href="/pa/514/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="514 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1804564" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0351-01">514 Pa. at 363</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="514 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="1804564" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0351-01">523 A.2d at 1124</a>. Thus, acts of third parties will not impose liability upon a local agency even though those acts fall within the exceptions to the statute. It is only the acts of the local agency or its employees that will make the local agency amenable to suit.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[233,698,1165,578]]]'>The general rule governing sovereign immunity is that immunity is not waived except as provided in the statute. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8521(a). The legislature has waived sovereign immunity in only nine specific instances for damages arising out of a negligent act where damages would be recoverable under the common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person to whom sovereign immunity did not apply. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8522. Subsection (b) of § 8522 specifically provides that liability may be imposed on the Commonwealth for the <em>“acts by a Commonwealth party </em>” that fall within the specific exceptions.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[231,1296,1164,632]]]'>As in the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, the sovereign immunity statute does not include any exception to the statute for the acts of others. The statute clearly limits the Commonwealth’s liability solely to acts by a Commonwealth party. The medical-professional liability exception provides that the defense of sovereign immunity shall not be raised to claims for damages caused by “[a]cts of health care employees of Commonwealth agency medical facilities or institutions or by a Commonwealth party who is a doctor, dentist, nurse or related health care personnel.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8522(b)(2). This exception does not permit liability to be imposed on the Commonwealth due to the criminal conduct of a third party.</p>

I agree with the Commonwealth Court that the medical-professional liability exception was intended to impose liability on the Commonwealth only for injuries suffered by patients and does not extend to injuries inflicted upon others by those patients. The majority’s expansive interpretation is at odds with our holding in <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>
      <em>Mascaro </em>that exceptions to the immunity statute must be narrowly interpreted. I would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
