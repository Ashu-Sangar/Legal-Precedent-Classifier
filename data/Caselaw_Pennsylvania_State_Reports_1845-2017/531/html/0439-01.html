Because the issue of disproportionate taxation has not been raised in this suit, Appellants are not precluded by collateral estoppel from raising this issue in another case. If this issue is raised at some time <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>later in the present suit, Appellants are not precluded from petitioning to intervene at that time. To the extent that Appellants suggest that their views are too important to be ignored in this action, Appellants can petition the Commonwealth Court to be heard as <em>amicus curiae. </em>Both the Pennsylvania State Education Association and the Pennsylvania School Boards Association have been granted leave by the Commonwealth Court to participate as <em>amici.</em>

We have, in essence, found that the Commonwealth Court's decision to deny intervention cannot be said to have been "manifestly unreasonable with the result of partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will”, and therefore, the Commonwealth Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellants' petition for intervention.</p>
