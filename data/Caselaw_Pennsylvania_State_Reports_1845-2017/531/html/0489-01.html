(Once the Cooperation Agreement was signed, submission of a budget depended upon approval by the Authority).

Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(a). The stated purpose and intent of PERA is “to promote orderly and constructive relationships between all public employers and their employes subject, however, to the paramount right of the citizens of this Commonwealth to keep inviolate the guarantees for their health, safety and welfare.” The statutory bargaining procedures established by sections 801 and 802 of PERA were enacted by the Legislature to help achieve that stated purpose.

The PLRB points out that in the twenty-two years since the enactment of PERA, parties to the collective bargaining process authorized by that statute have regarded the time frames of sections 801 and 802 to be unrealistic and “remote in time to the dynamics and realities of actual negotiations.” (Brief of PLRB, p. 10). The PLRB explains that, “in practice ... employers and unions have initiated negotiations well beyond the time period for the initiation of collective bargaining, and have not complied with Section 801 of PERA which requires both parties in writing to call in the Bureau of Mediation no later than 150 days prior to budget submission.” (Brief of PLRB, p. 10). The City of Philadelphia acknowledges that strict compliance with the time frames of Sections 801 and 802 is not critical to the collective bargaining process between public employers and public employees. The City notes that had fact-finders been appointed in April or May instead of June 26, 1992, that fact-finding would have been expedited and completed before June 30, 1992, the end of the fiscal year, even though such appointments would have likewise been beyond the timetable prescribed by Sections 801 and 802 of PERA. (Brief of City of Philadelphia, p. 20). Philadelphia’s principal objection is not so much that the fact-finding was ordered beyond the time strictures of PERA, but that it was ordered four days before the expiration of the old collective bargaining agreement and the start of a new fiscal year.</p>

In drafting PERA, it was the declared intention of the drafters to provide for the protection of the rights of the public at large along with the rights of the public employer and public employees. The majority’s construction of Sections 801 and 802 which makes strict compliance with the time strictures contained therein absolutely mandatory produces a result which is demonstrably at odds with the stated intention of the Legislature.</p>
    <p id="b629-6" data-blocks='[["BL_629.4",629,[89,864,1163,1017]]]'>In this case, the fact that bargaining was not initiated and mediation not requested within the time frames prescribed by Sections 801 and 802 is as much the result of the City’s failures as it is of AFSCME. The City, who did nothing to initiate negotiations or to avoid a delay in negotiations, ostensibly will benefit from the majority opinion which short circuits the bargaining procedures provided in PERA and which forever forecloses compliance with those procedures, contrary to Legislative intent and to the rights of the parties and the general public which the statutory procedures are designed to protect. The majority opinion is another reactionary step in the transformation of this great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from the cradle of workers’ rights to the coffin of those hard fought for earned rights. <em>See Masloff v. Port Authority of Allegheny County, </em>— Pa.-, <a href="/pa/531/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="613 A.2d 1186" data-case-ids="1834431" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0416-01">613 A.2d 1186</a> (1992). I would hold that the exercise of discretion and the appointment of fact-finders by the PLRB in this case is consistent with the intent of PERA, and I would dismiss the City’s application for extraordinary relief.</p>
