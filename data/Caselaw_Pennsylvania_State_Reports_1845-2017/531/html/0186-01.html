The few cases in which the Commonwealth Court has affirmed the WCAB’s modification of an award on the basis of WCAB’s view of the disfigurement all involved an absence or paucity of factual findings by the referee regarding the appearance of the disfigurement. <em>See, e.g., Nabisco, Inc. v.

This assumption is doubtless due to the unique provision regarding disfigurements which permits a referee to award compensation in any amount up to two hundred seventy-five weeks depending upon the severity of disfigurement. 77 P.S. § 513(22). For the loss of, or the permanent loss of use of, any bodily member, the statute prescribes specific periods of compensation for each type of loss. 77 P.S. § 513(1) — (21). When a referee makes a <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>factual determination that a claimant has lost a bodily member, the amount of the award follows as the night the day. It is clearly a question of law — -the straightforward award of the statutory period of compensation applicable to the specific loss — and as such is fully reviewable by the WCAB. The amount of the award in a disfigurement case is likewise a legal determination or is at least a mixed question of fact and law, and as such is subject to review by the WCAB. The fact that a specific period of compensation is not prescribed for every facial disfigurement should not totally insulate the amount of the award from appellate review.</p>
    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[168,923,1162,791]]]'>In appellant’s case, the referee made what appears to be a highly detailed and accurate description. Yet it is the physical appearance of the claimant himself and the unsightliness of the disfigurement which constitutes the evidence considered by the referee. It is impossible to preserve this evidence with total accuracy in the record. Even if photographs, proverbially worth thousands of words, are included in the record, their accuracy depends on lighting, camera quality, skill of the photographer, and other factors which affect the truth they convey. A detailed description such as that provided by the referee in this case is helpful, but is still woefully inadequate to preserve the evidence visually perceived by the referee when he faces the claimant. This raises an important distinction between disfigurement and loss of use cases. As the Commonwealth Court has noted:</p>
    <blockquote id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[209,1737,1118,471]]]'>The referee in a loss of use case does not rely as exclusively on visual evidence as in a disfigurement case. Even if care is taken to develop detailed and accurate descriptions of disfigurement in the record, words alone seldom capture the subjective elements fundamental to the referee’s decision. While we can describe the length, location and color of a scar, can we adequately verbalize the impact of these factors which combine to create a degree of “ugliness,” if you will, for which a claimant should receive a certain compensation?</blockquote>

    <p id="b322-4" data-blocks='[["BL_322.4",322,[250,559,1167,1349]]]'>Permitting this scope of review by the WCAB also serves the salutary end of promoting a reasonable degree of uniformity in disfigurement awards. The Commonwealth Court’s holding in this case would permit one referee to view a scar and award one week of compensation and a second referee to award two hundred seventy-five weeks for the same scar; the awards would be totally insulated from review by the WCAB so long as both referees gave a detailed verbal description of the scar. We do not think such a result is just: uniformity is an essential component of justice. In this case, the WCAB ingenuously stated: “The evidence does support Finding of Fact # 2 and the scar described in that Finding of Fact in our opinion would have been a 40 (low) to 60 (high) week scar by a preponderance of the Referees of Pennsylvania. Seventeen weeks is significantly low.” The board then held that the award of 17 weeks of compensation was a “capricious disregard of competent evidence,” and awarded 50 weeks to achieve uniformity. This is not an isolated problem. <em>See, e.g., Wyoming Sand &amp; Stone, <a href="/citations/?q=464%20A.2d%20617" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="464 A.2d 617">supra,</a> </em>where the Commonwealth Court rejected the WCAB’s note that “a majority of the referees would give, in the Board’s opinion, a substantially higher award in the instant case.” 76 Pa.Cmwlth. at 460, <a href="/citations/?q=464%20A.2d%20617" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="464 A.2d 617">464 A.2d at 618</a>.
