In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must view the evidence, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, and must determine whether there is sufficient evidence to enable the jury to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Bryant, </em><a href="/pa/524/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="524 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1822831" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0564-01">524 Pa. 564</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="524 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="1822831" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0564-01">574 A.2d 590</a> (1990). Accordingly, we find the following evidence sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt to support the jury’s verdict of murder in the first degree.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[147,1062,1162,903]]]'>On September 1, 1988, appellant participated in a scheme to kidnap and hold for ransom sixteen year old Alexander Porter. Appellant and three other individuals set up a purported drug transaction with Porter, in order to lure him to a meeting, whereupon they bound and gagged him, confiscated his keys, and stuffed him in the trunk of his car. One of the conspirators, a “friend” of Porter’s, allowed himself to be tied up in front of Porter, so that Porter would not realize his involvement. He was “released” after Porter was locked in the trunk, then taken home so that Porter would later believe that he had been murdered. The remaining conspirators drove Porter’s car, with Porter in the trunk, to the garage of one of the individuals and parked it there. They proceeded in another car to Porter’s mother’s house, and using Porter’s key, burglarized the dwelling. They then used Porter’s key to burglarize his father’s house, whom they believed to be very wealthy.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[147,1986,1157,419]],["BL_348.1",348,[286,352,1167,360]]]'>Upon their return, they discovered that Porter had loosened his restraints. Before restraining him again, one of the individuals demanded to know how much Porter was worth to his father, and insisted that he disclose his mother’s and father’s telephone numbers. They told Porter that they had killed his friend and if he did not cooperate, they would kill him too. Porter provided them with his mother’s telephone number and his father’s beeper number. The captors then <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>decided to abandon their ransom plan, in favor of eliminating Porter. To keep Porter from moving around while they drove, they wedged two milk crates into the trunk, further restricting his movement and forcing his body to bounce off of these objects, as they drove around in search of a place to kill him. Unable to find a place to effect the killing, they returned to the garage to await nightfall.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[282,731,1166,678]]]'>Under cover of darkness, appellant and one of his cohorts, set out to dispose of the victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">1</a> They drove to a wooded area, removed the stiff body from the trunk, and placed Porter face-down on the side of the road. Uncertain as to whether Porter had expired from strangulation as a result of the gagging, appellant’s cohort shot him four times in the back of the neck with a .25 caliber automatic handgun. The two of them then abandoned Porter’s car and discarded his keys into a sewer. The gun was later discovered in appellant’s car. Appellant was arrested and confessed his part in the scheme to set up Porter in order to obtain money from his father. Appellant denied that he ever intended to kill Porter; rather he placed the blame on one of his cohorts.</p>
    <p id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[283,1428,1160,148]]]'>Based upon the foregoing, we find that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury’s verdict of murder in the first degree.</p>

The jury found the existence of the following aggravating circumstances: (1) “[t]he victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceeding involving such offenses,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(5); (2) “[t]he victim was being held by the defendant for ransom or reward”, 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(3); (3) “[t]he offense was committed by means of torture,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(8); and (4) “[t]he defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(6). As a <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>mitigating circumstance, the jury unanimously found “other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8). Six jurors found as a mitigating circumstance that “the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal convictions.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(1).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The jury then unanimously found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and sentenced appellant to death.</p>
    <p id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[180,817,1159,469]]]'>Appellant argues that three of the four aggravating circumstances found by the jury were unsupported by the evidence.

Although this may have been a partial motivation for the killing, it is not inconsistent with the jury’s finding that appellant was also motivated by a desire to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding. The direct evidence introduced by the Commonwealth clearly supports the jury’s finding.</p>

There is nothing in our statute that supports appellant’s contention that the captors must convey their ransom demand to a third party. All that is required is that “[t]he victim was <em>being held </em>by the defendant for ransom____” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(3). An overt act toward execution of that purpose is sufficient to sustain the jury’s conclusion that the victim was held for ransom. The acts of appellant and his cohorts, of kidnapping Porter, then questioning his value to his parents and demanding his parents’ telephone numbers, were suffi<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>cient for the jury to conclude that Porter was held for ransom.

When he was able to free himself, his hands and feet were re-tied, the gag was tightened, and milk crates were stuffed into the trunk to prevent him from moving. For twenty-four hours, the victim remained bound, gagged, and immobilized in the trunk of his own car, terrorized by the fact that his friend had been killed and that he too would be killed.
