On April 3, 1989, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of forty-five days to twenty-three months and twenty-nine days for pleading guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. On May 26, 1989, appellant was granted parole and was released from custody on May 30, 1989. One <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>of the conditions of appellant’s parole was that he “abstain absolutely from the use of alcohol....” Parole Order, May 26, 1989.</p>

Appellant was subpoenaed to testify at his brother’s preliminary hearing. When called to testify, appellant initially invoked his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. The district attorney offered appellant use immunity in exchange for his testimony. In reliance upon the district attorney’s statements, appellant testified.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> During the course of his testimony appellant admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the day of the shooting. On December 29, 1989, the Bradford County Probation Office filed a Petition for Reconsideration of Parole, alleging that appellant had been “observed” consuming alcohol in violation of his parole. On March 6, 1990, a <em>Gagnon II </em>hearing was held.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Based upon evidence obtained <em>independently </em>of appellant’s preliminary hearing testimony, appel<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>lant’s parole was revoked and he was remanded to the Bradford County Correctional Facility on the original sentence.

Specifically, he claims that the court erred in rejecting his affirmative defense of “estoppel of prosecution.” See, <em>Commonwealth v. Kaye, </em><a href="/pa-super/232/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="232 Pa. Super. 506" data-case-ids="6772785" data-case-paths="/pa-super/232/0506-01">232 Pa.Super. 506</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=335%20A.2d%20426" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="335 A.2d 426">335 A.2d 426</a> (1975). (Superior Court indicated estoppel of prosecution defense may be recognized in certain situations). Appellant contends that the immunity promised him, albeit defective, should estop the Commonwealth from prosecuting his parole violation. However, we need not decide whether a defective grant of immunity would estop the Commonwealth from prosecuting a parole violation because, in this case, even a perfect grant of immunity would not preclude the Commonwealth from prosecuting appellant <em>with evidence wholly independent </em>of his compelled testimony.</p>
    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[150,1429,1164,798]]]'>It is generally recognized that there are two types of immunity, transactional and use immunity.

      <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>In Pennsylvania the witness immunity statute provides for only use immunity. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 5947. All that the district attorney offered appellant in this case was use immunity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Since use immunity permits prosecution for the same transaction if the evidence is obtained wholly independently of the compelled testimony, the Commonwealth is not barred from prosecuting appellant for his parole violation, because the evidence the Commonwealth presented at appellant’s <em>Gag-non II </em>hearing was not derived directly or indirectly from the immunized testimony or its fruits. In fact, there was no mention of appellant’s preliminary hearing testimony at the <em>Gagnon II </em>hearing. At the <em>Gagnon II </em>hearing, Pennsylvania State Trooper Anthony Morelli testified that while investigating the shooting incident, he observed petitioner consuming alcohol on three occasions on December 5, 1989. (N.T. 3/6/90, p. 4-6). This knowledge of appellant’s parole violation was obtained, not only independently of appellant’s testimony at his brother’s preliminary hearing, but was also obtained prior <em>to </em>the testimony. Appellant cannot now complain that the Commonwealth is estopped, on due process grounds, from prosecuting him with independent evidence, regardless of the fact that he relied upon the district attorney’s promise of immunity, since his purported immunized testimony was not used against him. Appellant is in no worse position now than if he had never testified.</p>
