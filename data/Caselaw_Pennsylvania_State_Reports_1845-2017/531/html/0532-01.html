Both Appellant and the driver of the other vehicle, Guy Truscello (Truscello), were residents of Bucks County.

In response to a Rule to File a Complaint, the Appellant filed a complaint alleging that the accident was caused by the Township’s failure to provide adequate traffic signals or to properly design and maintain traffic signals at the subject intersection.

In making its determination, the jury found Truscello and PennDOT not negligent and the Appellant not contributorily negligent, but concluded that the sole cause of the accident was the Township’s negligence. The trial court then molded the verdict from $800,000.00 to $500,000.00 as required under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 8553(b); awarded delay damages of $279,907.50 and entered a verdict in Appellant’s favor in the amount of $779,907.50.</p>

In that case, suit must be commenced in the County in which the political subdivision in located, where the cause of action arose, or where a transaction occurred out of which the cause of action arose. However, when a political subdivision is one of several defendants in a lawsuit, Pa.R.C.P. 1006(c) applies and a complaint may be filed in any county in which any of the defendants is subject to venue.

Upon consideration of preliminary objections to venue, the trial court and Superior Court relied upon Pa.R.C.P. 1006(c) and concluded that since venue was proper in Philadelphia County with respect to the Commonwealth, the Township and Authority could be sued in Philadelphia County. The rationale for this determination was that when the Commonwealth was included as a party defendant, an action could not be commenced in a county where any one of several defendants resided, but only in the county where the Commonwealth could be sued. Since venue was proper in Philadelphia County with respect to the Commonwealth, the authority of Pa.R.C.P. 1006(c) permitting venue in any county where any one of the defendants was found was inapplicable. Thus, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County was not required to transfer the matter to Lancaster County. Finally, it is important to note that the Superior Court apparently was not asked and therefore did not consider the interplay of Section 333 with Pa.R.C.P. 1006(c).</p>

On appeal, Commonwealth Court held that the proper venue for a lawsuit against a political subdivision under Section 333 is the home county of that political subdivision.

Support for this conclusion was found in Pa.R.C.P. 2103(b) when this Court provided authority to the Legislature to expand the locations where venue may be proper when a political subdivision is sued. By including the language “or when otherwise provided by an Act of Assembly” in Rule 2103(b), we permitted the Legislature to designate other locations other than a home county where a political subdivision can be sued. Under Section 333, the Legislature designated two other locations as a proper location for venue when a political subdivision is a defendant, where the cause of action arose or where the transaction or occurrence took place out of which the cause of action arose.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>
