Crowell, his wife Linda Crowell, and their three year old son, Marc Ethan Crowell, were travelling in their car. They were proceeding west on University Avenue, which is located in the western section of Philadelphia. Henry Lewis was also travelling in his car, but he was proceeding east on University Avenue. The respective lanes were separated by a low rise concrete medial strip.</p>

The curve turned to the right for eastbound traffic and to the left for westbound traffic. Facing Mr. Lewis’ vehicle was a large directional arrow directing traffic to turn left. Unfortunately, the directional arrow was wrongly placed, for the road turned to the right. Mr. Lewis nonetheless followed the arrow, thereby crossing into the Crowell’s lane of traffic, striking their vehicle, and causing injuries which eventually resulted in the death of Marc Ethan Crowell.</p>

The universal rule is that when two or more contribute by their wrongdoing to the injury of another, the injured party may recover from all of them in a joint action or he may pursue any one of them and recover from him, in which case the latter is not entitled to indemnity from those who with him caused the injury.</blockquote>

The Commonwealth Court refused to permit the suit against the City, reasoning that plaintiff’s action was based primarily on the failure of the city to supervise and inspect the acts of another, rather than any actions described within the exceptions to the immunity statute.

We recognize that the attachment of liability to an employer based on the action of his employee, commonly referred to as <em>respondent superior, </em>involves the imputation of negligence from the employee/servant to the employer/master. However, in this category of cases, involving the liability of governmental units, the governmental unit can only act through its employees. Moreover, the General Assembly has legislatively declared the identity of employers to their employees when said employees are acting within the scope of their employment.
