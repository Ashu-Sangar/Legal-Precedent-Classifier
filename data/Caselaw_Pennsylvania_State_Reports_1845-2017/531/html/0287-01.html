(Bethenergy). Following his death, his widow filed a claim for death benefits. The claim was granted by a referee. The referee relied upon deposition testimony given by claimant’s expert medical witness, Dr. Joshua Perper, who concluded that Skirpan suffered from coal worker’s pneumoconiosis or anthracosilicosis which arose from workplace exposure to coal dust. Dr. Perper testified that this was a substantial contributing factor in SMrpan’s death. Bethenergy presented extensive deposition testimony from medical experts who disagreed with Dr. Perper’s opinion, but the referee found Dr. Perper’s testimony to be more persuasive, and, accordingly, awarded benefits. An appeal was taken to the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Board), whereupon the referee’s decision was affirmed. An appeal was then taken to the Commonwealth Court. The Board’s order was affirmed on the basis that the referee’s decision was supported by substantial evidence.</p>

The referee relied upon deposition <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>testimony given by claimant’s expert medical witness, Dr. Nathan Alpern, who opined that Strube was totally and permanently disabled by coal worker’s pneumoconiosis. Consol presented deposition testimony to the contrary from a number of other medical experts, but the referee expressly found that Dr. Alpern’s testimony was “more credible” than that of Consol’s witnesses. An appeal was taken to the Board, whereupon the referee’s decision was reversed on the basis that the testimony from Consol’s witnesses was “more substantial and equally as competent.” The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the referee’s finding was supported by substantial evidence and, thus, that it should not have been overturned by the Board.</p>

Such evidence was what a “reasonable mind might accept as adequate,” see <em>Skirpan, </em>supra, to support the referees’ decisions. See also <em>Peak v.

I believe the proper standard to be applied to appellate review of workmen’s compensation cases is “competent evidence.” The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act provides that: “In any such appeal the board may disregard the findings of fact of the referee <em>if not supported by competent </em>evidence.... ” (emphasis added). Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, <em>as amended, </em>Act of March 29, 1972, P.L. 159, NO. 61, 77 P.S. § 854. The statute gives great authority to referees as fact-finders. Thus, I believe a higher standard set by the majority would usurp the referee’s function as the ultimate fact-finder. Additionally, it would be anomalous to hold, as the majority does, that on appeal from a referee’s decision, the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board can reverse a referee’s findings of fact only if those facts are not supported by competent evidence. But, on further appeal to <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>the Courts, the Courts can (per the majority) reverse, even if the referee’s findings are supported by competent evidence, if the Courts find that the findings of fact are not supported by “substantial evidence.” Thus, we have different standards of review at different stages of appeal. I find this untenable.</p>
