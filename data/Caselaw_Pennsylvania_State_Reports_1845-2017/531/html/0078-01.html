    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[275,480,1169,1116]]]'>In enacting PEPFA, the legislature sought to promote integrity in public employment by imposing a forfeiture provision that would deter acts of criminal misconduct, thereby encouraging public employees to maintain standards of conduct deserving of the public’s trust. At the same time, however, the legislature regarded pensions as important property interests that deserve a certain measure of protection. Indeed, it has long been recognized in this Commonwealth that pensions for public employees are not mere gratuities provided by the employer, but rather are deferred compensation for services rendered in the past. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Zimmerman v. Officers and Employees Retirement Board, </em><a href="/pa/503/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="503 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1785947" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0219-01">503 Pa. 219</a>, 222, <a href="/pa/503/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="503 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="1785947" data-case-paths="/pa/503/0219-01">469 A.2d 141</a>, 142 (1983) (plurality opinion compiling cases). The legislature sought to ensure that individuals who have saved for retirement by accumulating pension rights will not be unjustly foreclosed from receiving benefits. In pursuit of these interests, PEPFA was designed to assure uniformity in the forfeiture of benefits where allegations of criminal misconduct are concerned, requiring <em>conviction </em>as a condition precedent to forfeiture. See 43 P.S. § 1313(b), supra.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[272,1617,1165,740]],["BL_215.1",215,[147,321,1159,203]]]'>In PEPFA, the legislature comprehensively addressed the subject of when public employees are to be denied their pension benefits in connection with criminal misconduct related to public employment. Upon entering pleas of guilty or no defense, or upon being convicted, employees forfeit their benefits. 43 P.S. § 1313(b), supra. Employees charged with crime but later relieved of the charges, or tried and found not guilty, are, under PEPFA, entitled to benefits. <em>Id. </em>Thus, PEPFA invokes only very narrow and clearly defined grounds for forfeiture, thus reflecting the tenor of our law which disfavors provisions broadly imposing forfeiture.

The forfeiture provision is a safeguard for the public intended to deprive a public official or public employee of the benefits of his position when the position and public trust have been abused. Forfeiture acts not only as retribution for such misconduct, but also as a disincentive.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[261,1415,1163,621]]]'>The pension forfeiture statute mandates that the public official or public employee shall not receive benefits upon conviction or a plea of guilty or no defense for any crime related to his office or employment. The Philadelphia ordinance further prohibits the payment of benefits when the individual who has been dismissed from his position following such criminal charges has not been reinstated. Unlike the majority, I do not interpret the pension forfeiture statute as a directive that benefits shall be paid when individuals have been acquitted or absolved of criminal charges. Nor do I interpret the Philadelphia municipal ordinance as imposing restrictions inconsistent with the forfeiture statute.</p>

The pension forfeiture statute was intended to impose an additional civil penalty for criminal conduct involving a public office or public employment. In instances in which a criminal conviction has been secured, the civil penalty is mandatory. In instances in which there has not been a criminal prosecution or conviction, a municipality should not be foreclosed from producing evidence of criminal conduct in a collateral civil proceeding that will affect the public officer’s or public employee’s right to receive retirement benefits. Yet, that is the result of the majority’s holding. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>
