The events taking place after the individuals were separated resulted in appellee<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> being arrested and charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, resisting arrest, criminal conspiracy and disorderly conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Officer Welsh pulled these four individuals away from the person being beaten, a black male, and attempted to determine the cause of the altercation. Appellee and her three companions told the Officer that they had been attacked by a group of young men, including the individual whom they were beating, after appellee shouted at the group to stop harassing a couple at a nearby bus stop. Officer Welsh and the three police officers who had arrived on the scene in the interim were told by the individual being beaten that he was walking along the street on his way to catch a bus when he was attacked by appellee and her three companions; he denied that he was involved in harassment of anyone. The officers determined that the individual did not wish to press charges and allowed him to leave. Appellee and her companions were also ordered to leave. At that point, the four refused to leave and began shouting obscenities at the <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>officers. The boyfriend of appellee’s sister then called Officer Welsh a “nigger lover” and punched him in the face. When Officer Welsh returned the punch, he was in turn, punched in the face by appellee’s boyfriend. The officers subdued both men and placed them under arrest. Officer Welsh then ordered appellee, who was still shouting obscenities at the officers, to leave or face arrest. Appellee responded with another obscenity and punched Officer Welsh in the face, after which she was arrested.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellee also testified that after Officer Welsh and the other three officers arrived on the scene, they used nightsticks to strike her boyfriend in the ribs and on the back of the head. Appellee stated that one officer had his foot on her boyfriend’s throat and was “choking him to death” and that the officers ignored pleas from her sister’s boyfriend to stop before they killed appellee’s boyfriend. Appellee also testified that “when they [the police] wouldn’t stop and I seen him starting to turn colors, I turned around and hit Officer Welsh.” The testimony of appellee’s co-defendants was consistent with her testimony.</p>

Because the Commonwealth has the burden of disproving the defense of justification, you may find Miss French guilty only if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt either that French did not reasonably believe that her intervention was necessary to protect Moran or that she did not reasonably believe that the force she used was immediately necessary to protect Moran then and there against the force used by Officer Welsh.</blockquote>

Both English and American courts considered the assertion of arbitrary authority as a provocation to resist arrest.

    <p id="b178-5" data-blocks='[["BL_178.10",178,[252,1249,1167,581]],["BL_179.1",179,[188,328,1162,672]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that the prohibition on resisting arrest as set forth in § 505(b)(1)(i) nullifies the right of an arrestee to use force in self defense regardless of the level of force used by the arresting officer. The Commonwealth also argues that an arrestee who is subjected to more force than necessary to effectuate the arrest can sue the arresting officer. That the remedy of a future lawsuit fails to address the exigent nature of a situation in which one’s life and limb are in danger, focuses our inquiry on the critical aspect of this issue: while an arrestee’s liberty interest can be adequately protected through legal channels when there has <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>been an unlawful arrest, one’s bodily integrity is not adequately protected by those same means when an arresting officer uses excessive force. This distinction between resisting an arrest and resisting the use of excessive force by an arresting officer is sufficiently compelling for us to conclude that the use of excessive force by an arresting officer may trigger the right to use force in self protection under § 505 (or, by virtue of § 506, in protection of others)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>. In determining the circumstances under which an arrestee may use force against an arresting officer, guidance is provided in the Official Comment to § 505, which states, “Under Subsection (b)(l)(i) the actor may use force if the arresting police officer unlawfully uses or threatens deadly force.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Consequently, an arresting officer’s use of deadly force to which a justification does not attach under § 508 is unlawful. Hence, under §§ 505 and 508 of the Crimes Code, an arrestee’s use of force in self protection is justified when the arrestee reasonably believes that such force is immediately necessary to protect against an arresting officer’s use of unlawful and deadly force, i.e., force which is readily capable of causing death or serious bodily injury. An arresting officer’s use of excessive force capable of causing less than serious bodily injury or death can be vindicated by recourse to subsequent legal remedies. Superior Court’s analysis of this <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>issue was correct as far as it went; although that analysis stopped short of including a discussion of unlawfulness, the result reached by Superior Court was correct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The trial court conducted an in camera review of the IAD file and ruled that the Commonwealth was not required to produce the witnesses’ statements contained therein.

The Commonwealth's objection to admitting into evidence the witnesses’ statements contained in the IAD file was based upon nothing but a bald assertion of privilege. The Commonwealth now argues in its brief to this Court that it is an open question in Pennsylvania whether statements to police internal affairs departments are privileged. There is no statutory or common law privilege upon which the Commonwealth can rely in making this argument. Maintaining public confidence, not only in police review procedures, but in the administration of the criminal <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>justice system requires that the public not be denied its right to the information contained in court records. Public trials, so deeply ingrained in our jurisprudence, are mandated by Article I, Section 11 of the Constitution of this Commonwealth: "All courts shall be open.” Similarly, Article I, Section 7 provides in pertinent part: “The printing press shall be free to every person who may undertake to examine the proceedings of the Legislature or <em>any branch of government </em>and no law shall ever be made to restrain the right thereof.” (emphasis added). Public trials include public records.</p>

    <p id="b183-10" data-blocks='[["BL_183.12",183,[150,1211,1157,476]]]'>It is the duty of arresting authorities to arrest, and the duty of the citizenry to yield until their authority is determined. Reasonable force may be used by the authorities before, or during an arrest, but no force is ever justified after an arrestee has submitted; and there can be no defense for trained professional police to inflict their version of a penalty because of prior resistance. Thus, authorities are only empowered to use that reasonable force which is necessary to effectuate their legitimate purpose.</p>

When such unnecessary force is used <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>one may use such force as appears necessary to protect life or limb and not be guilty of the offense of resisting arrest.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[273,435,1165,528]]]'>There is a distinction, however, between resisting arrest initially and thereby raising the level of police force necessary to effect arrest, and protecting oneself from initial or subsequent illegal force; and one may raise the level of necessary police force, by continued resistance, to a level which would be illegal force were it used initially. In other words, one cannot find justification, if by their own acts, they exacerbate what they are required to do peacefully into a dangerous condition for themselves and others; hence, one is never authorized to resist a legal arrest or profit by their resistance.</p>
