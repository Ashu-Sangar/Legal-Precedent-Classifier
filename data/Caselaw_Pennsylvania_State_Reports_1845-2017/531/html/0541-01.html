On entering the company’s premises, the armed actors seized two employees, Adrian Crosby and Thomas Dolan. Mark Mitchell alone was wearing a ski mask. Appellant and Joseph proceeded to a second floor room with Dolan in front of them at gunpoint in order to open a safe. The company’s owner, William Gambrell, was sitting in his second-floor office where Appellant <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>fatally shot him twice.

A transcript of the confession was read to the trial corut. In his statement, Appellant pointed to an unspecified other “guy” as the killer: “As I got past him, I was looking inside and he put the gun over my shoulder and began firing.” (T.T.

At trial, the police officer testified that Appellant carefully read all seven pages. (T.T. September 28, 1984, p. 4.71.) There is no dispute that it is Appellant’s signature on the document. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 44, acknowledges that he signed it but denies that it was done voluntarily and knowingly.) On these facts, and given the refusal of the Suppression Court to silence the statement, no hard evidence appears on the record to support Appellant’s allegation of error. We find neither threats, promises, physical force, nor coercion in this record. Where a defendant is informed of his rights, and he understands them and still makes a voluntary and knowing confession, the statement is admissible in a murder prosecution. <em>Commonwealth v.

In the first array, Dolan selected a photo which was not Baker’s. On the second display, however, he selected Baker and stated that the photograph looked like the shortest one of the three actors more so than the other pictures. Picking out Baker as the killer, Dolan then told the police, according to his testimony at the suppression hearing, that, “I said that’s one that looks like him to me.” (S.T., September 12, 1984, pp. 192-193).</p>

The court’s charge correctly stated the two instances in which death was required, and charged that in “all other cases,” the verdict must be life imprisonment.
