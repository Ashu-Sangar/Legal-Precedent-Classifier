After using the bathroom, Updegraff asked Appellant if he could get Updegraff some drugs. Appellant refused. Nevertheless, Updegraff persisted and subsequently returned to Appellant’s house several times seeking drugs. Updegraffs ploy was to play on Appellant’s sympathy by explaining that he was addicted to drugs because of domestic problems and that he could not buy drugs in appellant’s neighborhood because each time he tried he was “ripped off” and beaten. Appellant, however, continued to refuse to buy any drugs for Updegraff.</p>

Subsequently, Updegraff offered to introduce Appellant to his boss and Appellant eagerly accepted the opportunity.

For the following reasons, I would affirm the lower court.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[185,461,1159,530]]]'>The facts are that Detective Domenic Pelino was approached by a reliable paid police informer, Timothy Updegraff, with an offer to arrange a meeting between Pelino and Appellant Frantz Borgella for the purpose of drug dealing. Two meetings took place in February, 1987, at which time Borgella sold drugs to the undercover officer, followed by arrest and conviction. Appellant contends that he was entrapped by Updegraff into proceeding with the criminal acts. Consideration of his claim, therefore, turns on the facts of the relationship between Updegraff as police agent and Borgella.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[184,1018,1162,477]]]'>That relationship began in November, 1986, when Updegraff appeared at Appellant’s home asking to use toilet facilities. Over the following weeks and months, Updegraff often visited Borgella. An apparent friendship ensued to the point where the informer repeatedly requested Borgella’s help in securing drugs for himself. Borgella refused at all times inspite of a growing relationship as drinking partners and forays for women. In this particular time frame, Updegraff purchased drugs for himself <em>without </em>the aid of Borgella.</p>
    <p id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[183,1521,1158,531]]]'>A critical point, for purposes of this review, is that Updegraff represented himself as employed with a good salary and, on that basis, offered to introduce Borgella to his “employer.” For his part, Borgella had articulated to Updegraff his own discontent with his present job. The three ultimately met in a parking lot; the “employer,” of course, was undercover Officer Pelino and there Borgella sold drugs to Pelino for cash. Detective Pelino also got Borgella’s telephone number with a promise to call in the event of an employment opportunity. Appellant, nevertheless, was arrested on December 7, 1987.</p>
