As a consequence he went off the road, struck a utility pole, and was impaled on a fence. He filed suit against the Commonwealth Department of Transportation (DOT), the respondent herein, alleging that his injuries were due to a defectively designed roadway. A settlement of $65,000.00 was offered prior to trial by DOT and rejected by the appellant. Ultimately the matter was tried to a jury and the jury returned a verdict of $1.5 million dollars which thereafter was molded by the trial court to enforce the $250,000.00 statutory cap on damages as contained in the Sovereign Immunity Act,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> 42 Pa.C.S. § 8528(b).</p>

This <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>motion, which went unopposed by DOT, was denied by the trial court and damages for delay were calculated not upon the jury’s award but upon the $250,000.00 statutory cap. Appellant, therefore, received the $250,000.00 statutory cap plus damages for delay in the amount of $103,731.15. Had the delay damage award been based upon the jury verdict as rendered, the appellant would have received delay damages in the amount of $622,386.95.</p>

In support of that position appellant argues that a computation of delay damages on the cap rather than upon the verdict is (1) contrary to the clear and unambiguous language of the Rule; (2) contrary to the intent of the Rule; and (3) will provide a disincentive to settlements thereby increasing rather than decreasing the litigation burden on the judicial system.</p>

We are unswayed by these arguments, and, for the reasons stated below, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>

    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[229,1222,1164,94]]]'>Turning to appellee’s second argument, in relevant part Rule 238 provides as follows:</p>

In relevant part they provide that: “Words and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage ...” Pa.R.C.P. 103; that “[T]he object of all interpretation and construction of rules is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the Supreme Court” and that “[E]very rule shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>all its provisions. When the words of a rule are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” Pa.R.C.F. 127(a)(b). Moreover, a fundamental tenet of interpretation is that the rules “shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable ...” Pa.R.C.P. 126.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[182,721,1161,805]]]'>With these interpretative guides in mind we turn to the Rule at issue. Firstly, Rule 238 provides that delay damages shall be added to the <em>“verdict of the jury, </em>... the decision of the court in a nonjury trial or ... the award of arbitrators appointed under section 7361 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. § 7361, and shall become part of the verdict, decision or award.” (emphasis added). This language is clear and unambiguous and is indicative of the intent to have damages apply to the verdict or award itself, which represents the actual factfinder’s assessment of the plaintiffs damage, as opposed to the amount the plaintiff is legally entitled to recover. The drafters could have chosen to use the phrase “amount recoverable” or some such limiting language; they chose not to. We are not now free to add that language “under the pretext of pursuing [the Rule’s] spirit.” Pa.R.C.P. 127(b).</p>

The same disincentive would encourage the prolonging of litigation as well as the filing of appeals. Additionally, the plaintiff who statutorily has already been denied the full compensation due him or her would be once again deprived of money to which he or she would be otherwise entitled, with only a minimum sanction being imposed on the defendant.</p>

Thus, in the context of statutory cap cases, the obligation for the payment of delay damages would cease at the time the statutory cap was tendered, and appellee’s argument on this issue is without foundation.</p>
