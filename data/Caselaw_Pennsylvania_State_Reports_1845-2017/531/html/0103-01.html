In response to a request for his driver’s license, appellant produced a Social Security card. Additionally, Officer Dull noticed a case of beer on appellant’s car seat and an open can of beer spilling on the floor of the driver’s side of the car.

Nowhere does the Motor Vehicle Code prevent a driver from changing his mind to revoke his implied consent. The statute clearly states that “if a person ... is requested to submit to chemical testing and refuses to do so, the testing shall not be conducted----” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1547(b). Because his consent is implied until the person actually refuses, under subsection (a) of Section 1547, his actual consent would be no different from his <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>remaining silent. Thus, under the Implied Consent provision, Section 1547(a), testing is allowed absent an affirmative showing of the subject’s refusal to consent to the test at the time that the testing is administered. Moreover, his initial consent does not preclude him from revoking his consent to the test. The statute grants an explicit right to a driver who is under arrest for driving under the influence to refuse to consent to chemical testing. The relationship between the Implied Consent provision of Section 1547(a) and the suspension for refusal under Section 1547(b) is such that a driver may revoke his Implied Consent under Subsection (a) by refusing. The sanction of the one year suspension for refusing to consent to the chemical testing is used as an incentive to induce a driver to submit to the test, provided the probable cause requirements of subsection (a) are met. The issue of an unconscious driver or a driver whose blood is removed for medical purposes is not before us today, but is currently pending before this Court in another matter. <em>Commonwealth v.
