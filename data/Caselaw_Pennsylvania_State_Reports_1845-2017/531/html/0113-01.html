During their marriage, two significant events occurred giving rise to the first two claims of equitable distribution. In 1970, Kathleen became a beneficiary of an irrevocable trust created by her father, and in 1973, the parties purchased Pin Oak Lane Farm where William established an equine clinic and horse breeding business. Kathleen subsequently filed a complaint in divorce on July 30, 1984. The parties separated in April of 1985, and on July 16, 1985, a master was appointed <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>with respect to the claims of alimony and distribution of property.

Both parties filed exceptions to the report and recommendation of the master. On June 2, 1988, the trial court issued an opinion disposing of all exceptions, and entered an order of equitable distribution which, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) rejected the finding of the master that the total increase in value of Kathleen’s interest in the trust qualified as marital property; and (2) accepted the finding of the master that William’s business had no good will value.</p>

The trial court reasoned that Kathleen must have actually acquired the trust assets before they could give rise to an increase in value qualifying as marital property. Thus, since Kathleen did not acquire any right to withdraw the principal of the trust until she attained age thirty-five, the trial court held that any increase in value prior thereto was not marital property. On the other hand, because Kathleen was entitled to withdraw up to one-half of the principal of the trust when attaining age thirty-five, the trial court found that Kathleen had acquired this portion of the trust, and held that any increase in the value of this portion of the trust from the date of acquisition until the date of final separation was marital property. Finally, since the parties separated before Kathleen attained age forty on August 4, 1986, when she became entitled to withdraw the remaining one-half of the principal of the trust, the trial court found that Kathleen had not acquired this portion of the trust during the marriage, and held that any increase in value of this portion of the trust was not marital property.</p>

In reaching its decision the Superior Court relied upon <em>Sutliff v.

We note that the Superior Court opinion does not reference the exact date that the trial court held such hearing, and a review of the record does not indicate that the trial court actually held a hearing on this equitable distribution claim. Therefore, Kathleen argues that the Superior Court compounded its error because, in the absence of a hearing by the trial court, the Superior Court should have used the date of the final hearing by the master, which occurred on March 13, 1986, before Kathleen attained age forty and obtained complete ownership and control of the trust. We do not believe resolution of this discrepancy controls the outcome of this case. It is unlikely that the Superior Court would have changed its result as Kathleen nevertheless acquired a complete interest in the trust prior to the equitable distribution order entered by the trial court on June 2, 1988, and to the extent this claim has merit, it merely provides further support for our decision herein.</p>

As noted above, 23 P.S. 401(e) was amended in 1988 during the pendency of this action and subsequently repealed in 1990 after the trial court issued the final equitable distribution order.

However, since the substance of the definition of marital property relevant to the issue before us was unchanged by the 1988 amendment, we choose to apply the provision in effect at the time of the commencement of the proceedings herein, as did the Superior Court.</p>

        <em>. </em>It is important to note the distinction between the income generated by the principal of the trust and the appreciation of the principal itself. We are concerned only with the appreciation of the principal itself, which is the "increase in value” that potentially qualifies as marital property. In the case <em>sub judice </em>this is essentially appreciation of stock. We are not concerned with any dividend or interest income generated by the trust that was received by the parties prior to or during the marriage, or any dividend or interest income generated by the trust after the date of final separation, which would clearly belong to Kathleen. However, while neither of the parties have specifically raised such a claim, if there had been any dividend or interest income that was not paid to the parties, but remained in the trust, as in the nature of any investment during the marriage, such would necessarily be deemed marital property, and it together with any income generated thereby, would be subject lo equitable distribution.</p>

We note that in applying this concept to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court would be necessarily compelled to take into consideration any change in value of the portion of the trust determined to be marital property, which occurs after the date of final separation through the date of distribution. This only involves consideration of the change in value of the marital assets during the period of delay pursuant to our mandate in <em>Sutliff, </em>and thus, does not include any change in value of either the non-marital principal of the trust itself or that portion of the increase in value of the trust determined to be non-marital property.</p>
