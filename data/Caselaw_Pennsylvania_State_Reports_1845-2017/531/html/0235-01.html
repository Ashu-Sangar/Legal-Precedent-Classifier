In this direct appeal, he alleges various errors in his trial, jury instructions, and sentencing hearing. Following a meticulous review of the proceedings and the legal arguments, we affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b371-16" data-blocks='[["BL_371.15",371,[187,2061,1160,205]]]'>Appellant was tried jointly with three co-conspirators, all of whom were convicted of murder, kidnapping, conspiracy, and other felonies. Evidence at the trial revealed that the murder occurred under the following circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b371-17" data-blocks='[["BL_371.16",371,[189,2290,1157,97]],["BL_372.1",372,[241,324,1166,581]]]'>The victim was sixteen-year-old Alexander Porter. It was allegedly “common street knowledge” that his father was a <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>drug dealer with substantial assets. Sometime in January or February of 1988, appellant, together with Henry Daniels, a co-defendant, and Daniels’ cousin, Stacey Torrance, also a co-defendant, conceived the idea of kidnapping Porter for money. Torrance was dating Sarita Porter, the. victim’s sister, and he provided information about Porter’s parents and their assets. In July and August of 1988, the plan began to take shape, centered around a fake drug deal. It was agreed that Daniels would pose as a drug dealer named “Harry” who would supply Porter with cocaine. Appellant and Daniels enlisted a neighbor, Eugene McClure, the final co-defendant, in August, 1988.</p>
    <p id="b372-5" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[237,925,1168,903]]]'>The plan was placed in action on Friday night, September 1, 1988, around 10:00 p.m. Appellant and Daniels met the victim and Torrance, purportedly to consummate the drug deal, and went to appellant’s house, where Daniels was also living. Daniels and Torrance left appellant’s house as if to pick up the cocaine. When they returned to appellant’s basement, Daniels was escorting Torrance, bound with ropes, pretending that Torrance had blundered and the deal had gone haywire. This charade was to justify an assault on Porter. They held a gun on him, forced him to he on the floor, hog-tied him, gagged him, then placed him in the trunk of his own car, pretending that they considered him a participant in Torrance’s purported bungling of the deal. While Porter was being bound, Torrance was led outside, supposedly to be punished, but actually to be released. Porter was later told that the conspirators had killed Torrance, and that the same thing would happen to Porter if he did not cooperate with the kidnappers.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.5",372,[234,1848,1166,529]],["BL_373.1",373,[150,306,1159,739]]]'>Faced with such threats, Porter yielded the keys and telephone numbers of both of his estranged parents’ separate apartments and information as to where they kept their valuables. In response to the kidnappers’ questioning, he predicted that his father would probably pay whatever amount of ransom the kidnappers demanded. Twice during the next twenty-four hours while Porter was kept in the car trunk, the kidnappers used Porter’s car on excursions, returning each time to McClure’s garage which was five doors away from appellant’s house. First, they used the vehicle to get to <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>Porter’s parents’ apartments to commit burglaries. After they returned, they discovered that Porter’s ropes and gag had come loose. They retied the athletic sock used to gag him and the ropes securing his wrists and ankles, then stuffed the trunk with milk crates and sofa cushions to prevent him from moving around and loosening his fetters. Later they sallied out to dispose of him. On this expedition, they were chased by a neighborhood crime watch group and failed to find a secluded place to leave Porter, so they returned to McClure’s house to wait until after dark. Appellant and Daniels went home, slept for a few hours, then took Porter to a park, shot him four times in the neck and back with a .25 caliber handgun, and left him by the roadside where his body was discovered the following day.</p>
    <p id="b373-5" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[149,1065,1156,148]]]'>The jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder and, following a sentencing hearing, returned a verdict of death. This direct appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[145,1237,1164,632]]]'>Appellant raises seven allegations of trial errors, improper jury instructions, and errors during the sentencing phase. First, he claims error in the admission of certain evidence whose prejudicial effect allegedly outweighed its relevance. Three photographs, seized from the basement of appellant’s house, were admitted into evidence. The photos depicted five young men, including appellant and co-defendant Daniels, dressed in army fatigues. Appellant argues that the only reason to introduce these pictures was to imply to the jury that appellant and Daniels were part of a paramilitary group. He claims that the prejudicial effect of such an implication far outweighs the relevance of the photographs.</p>
    <p id="b373-7" data-blocks='[["BL_373.6",373,[144,1889,1160,472]],["BL_374.1",374,[283,310,1164,149]]]'>The photographs, however, though introduced in evidence, were never shown to the jury. It is therefore unlikely that they could have engendered prejudice in the minds of the jurors. The Commonwealth introduced the photos through the testimony of the police sergeant who had seized them pursuant to a warrant in the basement of appellant’s house, for the purpose of showing the association between appellant and Daniels. <em>See Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[279,479,1166,621]]]'>Because army fatigues are common attire, it is unlikely that the jury would have drawn the inference that appellant and Daniels were part of a “paramilitary group.” To forestall such a possibility, however, the court permitted the defense to introduce a magazine photograph of the rap group, Public Enemy, dressed in fatigues, to substantiate that the defendants’ dress style merely imitated the group which, according to testimony at trial, advocated nonviolence. The photographs of appellant and his friends were relevant to show his association with Daniels, and would not have created a bias in the minds of the jurors which would have deprived appellant of a fair trial.</p>
    <p id="b374-6" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[276,1132,1168,683]]]'>Appellant argues similarly that it was error to admit into evidence a .380 automatic pistol seized from appellant’s house, due to its alleged irrelevance and prejudicial impact. The pistol was introduced to substantiate the Commonwealth’s proof that the conspirators had access to and used a second weapon during their criminal venture, in addition to the murder weapon, which was a .25 caliber handgun. Appellant’s defense to his admission that he shot the victim was that Daniels held a gun to his head and forced him to shoot Porter; he argues that Daniels’ gun was a .38 caliber revolver, not an automatic, and that the two bear no resemblance to each other. Thus, he concludes that the .380 automatic admitted in evidence was irrelevant, and that it was clearly prejudicial.</p>
    <p id="b374-7" data-blocks='[["BL_374.6",374,[272,1836,1169,524]],["BL_375.1",375,[165,315,1158,261]]]'>At the time of their arrests, appellant and all three co-defendants gave written statements, redacted versions of which were introduced at trial. Co-defendant Torrance described the abduction of Porter, in which Porter was made to lie on the floor while threatened with what Torrance thought was a .38 revolver. Appellant’s statement alleged that Daniels later told him to shoot the victim while pointing “a gun” at his head, but appellant did not describe the weapon. Thus, instead of testimony definitely identifying the second weapon as a .38 revolver, which, appellant argues, “does not remotely <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>resemble a .380 automatic,” the record contains only speculative identification of the gun by Torrance, and no identification by appellant, who was not even sure of the type of weapon he himself used to shoot the victim. Admission of the challenged weapon, therefore, was not error.</p>
    <p id="b375-5" data-blocks='[["BL_375.4",375,[163,606,1160,423]]]'>Appellant’s next allegation of trial error concerns the Commonwealth’s display of a chart throughout the trial in order to outline police testimony identifying numerous items of evidence and the locations from which they were seized. Appellant claims that the use of the chart was tantamount to note-taking by the jury, an activity not permitted in Pennsylvania. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1113; <em>In re Thirty West Broad Street Corp., </em><a href="/pa/425/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="425 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="1906687" data-case-paths="/pa/425/0036-01">425 Pa. 36</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20827" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="227 A.2d 827">227 A.2d 827</a> (1967).</p>
    <p id="b375-6" data-blocks='[["BL_375.5",375,[161,1053,1161,684]]]'>The chart in question was exhibit C-15. It listed across the top the five addresses from which relevant evidence was seized, and under each address, the evidence seized from that location, grouped according to eleven different property receipts. Visual aids may be used to assist the jury in understanding the evidence in appropriate cases, and permission to do so is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em><a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">514 Pa. 539</a>, 552, <a href="/pa/514/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="514 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1804600" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0539-01">526 A.2d 334</a>, 340-41 (1987). Use of such visual aids is not equivalent to jury note-taking, and appellant does not allege that the trial judge abused his discretion nor suggest that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced in any way. Accordingly, we reject this argument.</p>
    <p id="b375-7" data-blocks='[["BL_375.6",375,[158,1776,1162,421]]]'>Appellant’s next two arguments relate to allegedly improper jury instructions. The first claim is that the trial judge improperly expressed his opinion that the victim died of gunshot wounds, taking away the fact-finding function of the jury, which might otherwise have found that the victim died of strangulation prior to the shooting. Appellant supposes that, without this expression of opinion, the jury would have found him guilty of the lesser offense of second degree murder.</p>
    <p id="b375-8" data-blocks='[["BL_375.7",375,[159,2220,1160,150]],["BL_376.1",376,[258,320,1169,1333]]]'>Appellant fails, however, to identify any statement in the record where the court expressed an opinion as to the cause of death. In the jury instructions, which we have reviewed in <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>their entirety, the only comment arguably supportive of appellant’s claim is the statement: “There is evidence in this case that the killing was caused by a gun.” The assertion is perfectly correct, based on the expert testimony of the medical examiner during the trial. It is within the province of the trial court to summarize evidence, so long as the court makes no material misstatements. <em>Commonwealth v. Irwin, </em><a href="/pa/494/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="494 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1769161" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0277-01">494 Pa. 277</a>, 282, <a href="/pa/494/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="494 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1769161" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0277-01">431 A.2d 257</a>, 259-60 (1981). Summarizing evidence is not the equivalent of expressing an opinion as to the conclusions to be drawn from conflicting evidence. The court’s statement was not the expression of an opinion on the cause of Porter’s death. Moreover, the jury was instructed to decide whether Porter died of gunshot wounds and, if so, who inflicted those wounds. The instruction was: “It will be your duty in this case to determine whether Alexander Porter died as a result of gunshot wounds----” Furthermore, the court instructed the jury that it was not bound to accept the expert’s opinion that Porter died from gunshot wounds, and that the jury was the sole judge of the facts. Finally, the charge did not undermine appellant’s defense, which was that malice was lacking because appellant thought the victim was dead when he shot him. The jury was free to find appellant guilty of second degree murder on this basis regardless of whether the gunshots actually killed Porter. That the jury rejected this possibility does not render the instructions improper.</p>
    <p id="b376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_376.4",376,[259,1676,1164,419]]]'>Appellant also claims that the court improperly refused to give an instruction on duress. His defense was based in part on his post-arrest statement, read into evidence at the trial, which contained his account of shooting the victim. He admitted firing the shots wounding Porter’s neck and back, but claimed that he did so only because Daniels pointed a gun at his head and told him to shoot Porter. Appellant requested a charge on duress based on 18 Pa.C.S. § 309, which provides:</p>

As a matter of law, then, the defense of duress was not available to appellant. His own assertions defeated any claim of duress, and there was no other evidence supporting the defense, so it was proper for the trial court to refuse to charge the jury on duress. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The medical examiner testified that Porter suffered more than forty abrasions on his face, forehead, abdomen, ankle, and calf before he died. He also testified that death was caused by both the strangulation and gunshot wounds. He gave his opinion, however, that after the strangulation, Porter remained alive until he was shot. The killers had several guns at their disposal. Rather than simply killing Porter, they chose to lock him in the trunk of his car for twenty-four hours, suffocating and terrorizing him, to drive him around, battering him, and to strangle him.
