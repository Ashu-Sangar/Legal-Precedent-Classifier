The general provision, section 5601, begins with the acknowledgement that the listed powers, which may lawfully be delegated in writing, are “[i]n addition to all other powers that may be delegated to an attorney-in-fact”. It further states that the grant of any of the listed powers shall be construed according to section 5603 “unless the power of attorney expressly directs to the contrary”. From this we conclude that the statute does not limit the subjects that may properly be addressed by powers of attorney, nor does it confine the way such powers may be defined. Likewise, the prefatory paragraph of section 5602(a) does not fix an invariable form for powers of attorney.

First, we do not think it necessary for the legislature to alter the law when it chooses to enter a field theretofore occupied by the common law.

Second, the statute can be given meaningful application without resorting to the restrictive interpretation of the court below. Simply put, general language <em>can </em>“show a similar intent on the part of the principal” to empower the attorney-in-fact to do one or more of the listed things if the general language, according to its common usage, would be understood as encompassing such power or powers. Often, the very purpose of using broad language is to avoid the limiting effects of specific language, to address all aspects of a class of activity without the need to anticipate and identify each individually. And when an attorney-in-fact performs one of the activities listed in § 5602(a) under authority of general language, section 5603 provides the definitions and limitations that circumscribe his activity.</p>

      <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>The legislative requirement that the surviving spouse file such an election is essentially a notice provision to assure that the executor or administrator properly disposes of the assets of the estate. The purpose of filing the election is no different when the election is made by the surviving spouse or an attorney-in-fact on behalf of a surviving spouse. The inquiry then is whether § 5603(d) was intended to require that an attorney-in-fact obtain court approval before giving notice to the executor.</p>
    <p id="b159-4" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[168,808,1159,686]]]'>There is no statutory requirement that a petition seeking court approval be filed within a six-month period. The appellee nevertheless contends that § 5603(d) should be construed to require an attorney-in-fact to obtain court approval prior to the expiration of the six-month statutory period of limitation for election. The filing of written notice to elect to take against the will by an attorney-in-fact would be a redundant act, however, when an executor has received notice previously that a petition for court approval of the filing of the written notice has been filed. Not only would such an interpretation render the act of filing the election meaningless, it would impede the ability of the attorney-in-fact to exercise his authority under the power of attorney.</p>

Section 5603(d) was not intended to limit the authority of an attorney-in-fact under a power of attorney; rather, it was intended to ascertain the existence of his authority. The intent of the legislature was not to establish a pro forma requirement that the attorney-in-fact obtain leave of court to file a written notice of election. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the attorney-in-fact is authorized under a valid power of attorney to make the election on behalf of the principal.</p>
