At the core of the general rule is what Wigmore termed “a peculiar Anglo-American solicitude for the accused.” I J. Wigmore, A Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law § 194 at 646 (3d ed. 1940). It is essential, both to the accused and to our system of criminal justice, that an accused obtain a trial on the specific charges against him and that he not be convicted on grounds that he possesses a criminal nature. Balancing these considerations with the concern that important probative evidence not be excluded out of hand, the courts have carved out numerous exceptions to this general rule. Thus, evidence of other crimes may be admitted where there is a legitimate evidentiary purpose for such evidence.</p>

Instantly, the evidence of appellant’s prior convictions was offered to show “a common scheme, a common motive, that being pedophilia.” (N.T. 12/4/89, p. 9). With respect to this common scheme, plan or design exception, Superior Court held that the crimes were not so related to each that proof of one naturally tended to prove the other. In reaching this conclusion, the court cited the sparse testimony regarding appellant’s prior offenses'. However, Superior Court did hold that the evidence was relevant “to a showing of appellant’s motive/intent in committing the instant crimes.” (Memorandum Opirnon, 3/11/91 at p. 5).</p>

It must be determined first if the inference sought to be raised by the evidence <em>bears upon a matter in issue in the case, </em>and, second, whether the evidence renders the desired inference more probable than it would without the evidence, (emphasis added) (citations omitted).” <em>Commonwealth v. Thornton, </em><a href="/pa/494/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="494 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1769124" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0260-01">494 Pa. 260</a>, <a href="/pa/494/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="494 Pa. 260" data-case-ids="1769124" data-case-paths="/pa/494/0260-01">431 A.2d 248</a> (1981).

Moreover, appel<a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>lant did not predicate his defense at trial on grounds that any physical contact with the victim was innocent or accidental; rather, appellant denied that the criminal conduct in question ever took place.</p>
    <p id="b727-5" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[119,580,1163,1235]]]'>With regard to the admissibility of evidence of other crimes to show present motive, such evidence must logically relate to the defendant’s reason or purpose in committing the crime charged. Thus, in <em>Commonwealth v.

The connection between the prior acts and the charged offenses is clear in both of these cases since the prior acts shed light upon the possible motive in committing the crimes charged. Here, Superior Court found that evidence of appellant’s prior crimes was relevant to show appellant’s motive of receiving sexual gratification from young girls in the six and seven year age range. While sexual gratification is a common motive to both the prior crimes and the instant crimes, the requisite causal connection is absent. Accordingly, the evidence of the prior crimes was inadmissible to prove motive.</p>
