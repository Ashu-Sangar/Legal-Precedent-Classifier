During argument, counsel were questioned as to the scope of review of the lower courts’ conclusion of the legal effect of the letter of February 18, 1986. In response thereto, counsel for Appellant has filed an Application to Submit Memorandum on Scope of Review pursuant to Pa.Rule of Appellate Procedure 2501(a), which we grant. Our case law has long held that questions of law are accorded full appellate review and are not limited to abuse of discretion review. In this case, the courts were called upon to interpret the legal effect of a writing. This entails reaching a conclusion of law. <em>Cowen v.

Thus, in interpreting such a writing and determining whether or not the writing constituted an offer, the chancellor was passing on a question of law. (Citations omitted). His conclusion, therefore, is subject to our review, and we rule it was erroneous.</blockquote>
