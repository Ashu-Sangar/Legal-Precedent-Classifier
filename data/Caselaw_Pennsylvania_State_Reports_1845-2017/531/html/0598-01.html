While numerous Appellants challenge the Plan on multiple and varying grounds, the threshold issue to be resolved is whether the Plan as submitted legally represents a legitimate plan of Rehabilitation or whether the Plan, in reality, is a <em>de facto </em>liquidation plan, filed by the Rehabilitator lacking any rehabilitative purpose, thus constituting an abuse of her discretion. Should this Court find that the proposed Plan represents a liquidation instead, the numerous appeals herein, which challenge specific provisions of the Plan of rehabilitation, would be rendered moot.</p>

Grode, then Commonwealth Insurance Commissioner, sought, with the consent of Mutual Fire’s officers and directors, appointment as Rehabilitator of Mutual Fire, Section 515(a) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 221.15(a), and submitted a rehabilitation plan. Prior to this petition, Com<a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>missioner Grode had placed Mutual Fire under his supervision. Section 510(d) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 221.10(d). At the time the petition was filed, Mutual Fire reported assets of $99.4 million and total liabilities of $260.1 million, with a negative policyholders’ surplus of nearly $161 million.</p>
    <p id="b735-4" data-blocks='[["BL_735.4",735,[145,599,1160,683]]]'>When it became apparent to the Commonwealth Court that adequate notice had not been given to policyholders and other creditors on whom the original plan would have a direct and substantial impact, hearing on the Plan’s approval was continued generally. At the same time, the Court directed the Insurance Department to prepare a notice of hearing to be sent to all known policyholders and creditors indicating the procedure for obtaining the plan and raising objections prior to a Court hearing on its approval. Thereafter, many objections were made. These objections were drawn from individual policyholders, claimants against policyholders, reinsurers doing business with Mutual Fire, creditors and agents of Mutual Fire.</p>
    <p id="b735-5" data-blocks='[["BL_735.5",735,[142,1323,1158,529]]]'>In early 1987, upon application of several policyholders, also objectors to the plan, the Commonwealth Court formed a Committee of Policyholders (Policyholders Committee), whose purpose was to “consult with the statutory rehabilitator on the administration of this matter and advise those represented as to the proposed plan.” The Commonwealth Court formed the Policyholders Committee with the express intent of assuring that policyholders <em>first and foremost </em>suffered the least amount of harm resulting from the unfortunate series of events culminating in this insurance company’s reorganization effort.</p>
    <p id="b735-6" data-blocks='[["BL_735.6",735,[138,1883,1160,477]],["BL_736.1",736,[268,312,1161,95]]]'>The Rehabilitator, now Commissioner Foster, thereafter filed her responses to the objections to the proposed rehabilitation plan. The Policyholders Committee and numerous other parties strenuously objected to this proposed plan on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Rehabilitator had released no financial information or documentation to substantiate the projections of 100% payment to policyholders contained therein. Hence, the court ordered the Rehabilitator to allow the Policyholders Committee and all interested persons access to <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>Mutual Fire’s books and records. A hearing date was then set for June 3, 1987.</p>

    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.5",736,[262,731,1167,1008]]]'>Several months later, the Rehabilitator, pursuant to the court’s Order approving the proposed plan, filed a report on the progress of the rehabilitation for the period from December 8, 1986 (the date on which the statutory Rehabilitator was appointed) to October 26, 1987. At the same time, the Rehabilitator sought additional time to evaluate the feasibility of its implementation. The court granted the Rehabilitator’s request for additional time and directed her to submit to the court a schedule of tasks to be performed in order to complete the evaluation. Among these tasks were the engagement of litigation counsel to investigate possible causes of action by the Rehabilitator on behalf of Mutual Fire, Section 516(c) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 221.16(c); the appointment of a professional firm to perform actuarial analyses of Mutual Fire’s loss reserves; and the engagement of auditing and claims settlement services, Section 516(b) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 221.16(b). At that time, the Rehabilitator opposed the Policyholders Committee’s motion to appoint an independent manager to oversee the rehabilitation on site.</p>

After close consultation, pursuant to Section 515(c) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 221.15(c), the court and Commissioner Foster determined that any viable rehabilitation of this magnitude would necessarily demand sufficient legal, managerial, financial and technical resources. It was therefore decided that initially a deputy rehabilitator would be appointed, Section 516(a) of the Act, 40 P.S. § 221.16(a), and legal counsel would be retained to investigate possible sources of recovery through litigation where litigation was deemed fruitful to <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>collect the recoverables comprising a significant portion of this estate’s assets.</p>

The plan was to include a provision to trigger applicable state insurance guarantee funds (both in Pennsylvania and other states) and a provision for proportionate periodic payments of policyholders’ claims. Additional counsel was hired to assist the Rehabilitator in formulating a modified plan.</p>
    <p id="b737-5" data-blocks='[["BL_737.5",737,[148,957,1157,253]]]'>Thereafter, the Rehabilitator applied to the Commonwealth Court for approval to suspend payment of certain loss adjustment expenses incurred under Mutual Fire’s obligations to defend its insureds.

    <p id="b737-6" data-blocks='[["BL_737.6",737,[147,1253,1160,482]]]'>The Rehabilitator submitted a new Plan of Rehabilitation on January 31, 1989. After notice was issued to policyholders and all known creditors and was published in periodicals of general and industry circulation, numerous objections were filed. The Commonwealth Court, over the course of four days, heard testimony and argument in support of and against certain provisions of the Plan. The Commonwealth Court (Crumlish, P.J.) approved the Plan with certain modifications, and the instant appeal followed.</p>

Accordingly, the delegation of such caretaking authority necessarily includes exercising a direct role in the rehabilitation of insolvent insurers. Subsection (c) of Section 515 of the Insurance Act, 40 P.S. § 221.15, authorizes the Insurance Commissioner in her capacity as Rehabilitator “to take possession of the assets of the insurer ... and to administer them under the orders of the court.”</p>

This mandate explicitly defers all actions to the skill of the Rehabilitator and implicitly recognizes her expertise in these matters.

In overseeing the course of rehabilitation to check any abuse of discretion by the Commissioner, the Commonwealth Court is authorized to “approve or disapprove the plan [of rehabilitation] proposed, or may modify it and approve it as modified. If it is approved, the rehabilitator shall carry out the plan.” 40 P.S. § 221.-16(d).

However, they fail to recognize the fundamental language of 40 P.S. § 221.32(a). That section begins by stating that the setoff provisions <em>apply to any action or proceeding “under this article. </em>” 40 P.S. § 221.32(a) (emphasis added).

Additionally, the provision of the Plan expressly prohibiting a premium setoff in a <em>rehabilitation </em>context, ensures that the creditors herein, at a minimum, will fare at least as well under the rehabilitation as they would in a liquidation proceeding as mandated by the holding of <em>Neblett, supra.</em>

Furthermore, the significant interest on behalf of the state to regulate the fiscal affairs of its insurers for the welfare of the public would still render the Plan permissible should impairment be found to exist. It is also worthy to note that the objectors to the Plan are members of a highly regulated industry and as such were well aware of the powers of a Rehabilitator. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court properly dismissed Appellants’ challenge to the setoff provision of the Plan under the federal constitution. As our impairment of contract provision, Art.

We are aware of decisions from other jurisdictions which do not recognize the McCarran-Ferguson Act as barring the federal government from obtaining first priority status in insolvency proceedings. <em>Matter of Union Indemnity Ins.

Instantly, the primary federal presence <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>regarding claims against Mutual Fire concerns claims made by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC”) and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ("FSLIC”). However, as the FDIC has been held not to be an integral part of the government scheme, FDIC claims have not been held to be a "claim of the United States Government,” <a href="/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203713" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="31 U.S.C. § 3713">31 U.S.C. § 3713</a>, which would therefore be entitled to priority. <em>Lapadula &amp; Villani, Inc. v.

The FSLIC, has been held, in terms of its function, as identical to FDIC. <em>See In re Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, </em><a href="/f2d/837/0432-01" class="citation" data-index="120" data-cite="837 F.2d 432" data-case-ids="1773212" data-case-paths="/f2d/837/0432-01">837 F.2d 432</a>, 434 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation v.

As the regulation of insurance companies both solvent and insolvent has been conceded to the states and since the goal of <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201012" class="citation" data-index="123" data-cite="15 U.S.C. § 1012">15 U.S.C. § 1012</a> was to exempt insurance activities from federal antitrust laws to preserve the state regulation of insurance companies, it would appear that the McCarranFerguson Act operates to preclude the applicability of the Federal Priority Act.</p>

Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Article Four, Section One of the United States Constitution, and an implementing statute, 28 U.S.C. Section 1738, Pepsi's federal court judgment is to be accepted by the states as conclusive proof of the rights adjudicated. <em>See Stoll v.

The result of disallowing the payment of interest on Pepsi's judgment for any period beyond the date the Petition of Rehabilitation was filed, is also consistent with those decisions wherein courts have held that interest accruing on claims after insolvency proceedings have begun is payable only after the principal on all claims have been paid in full. <em>American Iron and Steel Manufacturing Co. v.

As we view the Plan to most efficiently and equitably do so, the role of the Policyholder Committee as representative of policyholder interests is no longer necessary. Indeed, in view of the testimony offered regarding the Committee’s numerous attempts to interfere with the Plan, ignore Orders of the Court and bill the estate of Mutual Fire millions of dollars in expenses and fees, its continued presence may be an unacceptable financial detriment.</p>
