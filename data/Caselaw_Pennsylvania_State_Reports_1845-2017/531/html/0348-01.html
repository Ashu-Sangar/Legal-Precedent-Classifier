Appellant contends that the weight of the “substance” should be determined without including the weight of the cutting agent, i.e., that it is the weight of the cocaine rather than the weight of the mixture containing cocaine that is determinative. Such a contention, however, ignores the plain definition that the same statutory provision accords to the term “substance.”</p>

The legislature could not have been more clear in expressing that, for purposes of the sentencing statute, a preparation or mixture containing cocaine is to be counted as a “substance.” This reflects the legislature’s awareness that cocaine is commonly possessed and circulated in a mixture containing cocaine and adulterants which serve as cutting agents. Within the same statutory provision, at subparagraph (3)(ii), supra, reference to the weight of the “substance” must be taken as referring to the same substance, namely the pure cocaine or any preparation or mixture thereof. To conclude otherwise would be to accord the term “substance” two different definitions within the same statutory provision, a result which would be both unreasonable <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>and unsupported by any language in the statute.

    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[255,493,1166,855]]]'>Appellant’s contention is essentially that subparagraph (3)(ii) of the statute should be construed as though it used the term “pure cocaine” rather than “substance” in describing the material to be weighed. The language chosen by the legislature, however, is controlling. “Substance” is expressly defined in the statute to include a “preparation” or “mixture.” If the legislature had not intended to include preparations and mixtures containing cocaine as substances whose weights could trigger the mandatory sentencing provision, it would have made reference to the weight of the cocaine rather than the weight of the “substance” as the triggering factor for imposition of a mandatory sentence.
