No children were born of this marriage. At the time of the marriage, the wife owned her own home, <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>subject to a $30,000.00 mortgage. During the marriage, the parties accumulated joint liabilities in the amount of approximately $35,000.00. At the time of the parties’ separation in the fall of 1984, the marital assets consisted of a $1,700.00 increase in the value of wife’s real property, a master bedroom suite with a value of $2,000.00, a living room suite valued at $1,000.00, and individual pensions held by both parties. Shortly after the parties’ separation, wife remortgaged her home to pay off the marital debt. Because the wife was the manager of a local bank, she had the loan payment of $794.00 automatically deducted from her wages.</p>

The husband received the master bedroom suite and his pension benefits. The master recommended that the parties be equally responsible for the marital debt, although wife was required to continue making the monthly mortgage payment of $794.00. With respect to alimony, the master recommended “... that the Husband pay to the Wife the sum of $300.00 per month alimony payments to assist her in extinguishing the marital debt for a period of forty-eight (48) months for a total amount due to the wife of $14,400.00.” <em>See </em>Master’s Report page 3.

The trial court adopted the master’s recommendations and entered a final decree of divorce in April of 1987. On two occasions subsequent to the entry of the divorce decree, the husband sought a reduction of the monthly payments to his former wife based upon changed circumstances. On each occasion, the wife argued that any change in circumstances was irrelevant since the monthly payments were for a finite debt and not based upon her need for support in a traditional alimony context.</p>

As indicated, the trial court granted the petition holding that Section 501(e) mandated the termination of alimony payments upon the remarriage of a divorced spouse.

Shortly after Dr. Bold opened his own practice, Mrs. Bold moved from the marital residence at the request of Dr. Bold.
