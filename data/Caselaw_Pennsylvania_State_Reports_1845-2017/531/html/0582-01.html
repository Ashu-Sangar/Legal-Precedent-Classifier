While counsel for appellant cross-examined the witness during the preliminary hearing, she was unaware or had not been informed that Mr. Hauser had made a prior inconsistent statement to the police; that he had a criminal record; and that the Office of the District Attorney was, at that time, contemplating the filing of criminal charges against Mr. Hauser for homicide and conspiracy in connection with the same incident giving rise to the complaint against Bazemore.</p>

Just what suffices to establish “full opportunity” to cross-examine in the context of an unavailable witness where the Commonwealth has failed to disclose relevant impeachment evidence prior to the initial testimony is, however, an issue of first impression for this Court. The Commonwealth would have us find that the key element is the <em>opportunity </em>to cross-examine the witness at the prior proceeding. The Commonwealth argues that because the record here establishes that appellant was afforded an opportunity to cross-examine Hauser at the preliminary hearing and did, in fact, cross-examine him at length, appellant’s right of confrontation was not infringed. We do not agree.</p>

Moreover, we have recognized the importance of providing the defense, at trial, the opportunity to examine prior statements of a Commonwealth witness of which the Commonwealth has possession, finding that examination of such statements provides the defense “a <em>fair </em>opportunity to cross-examine the witness.” <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition, counsel was unaware of Hauser’s prior criminal record.</p>

Of course, defense counsel was able to cross-examine Hauser generally at the preliminary hearing, but because she did not have knowledge of Hauser’s prior inconsistent statement, she could not impeach his credibility through the use of that statement. Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth’s contention, the record does not establish that the cross-examination employed by defense counsel at the preliminary hearing, no matter how extensive, “fully tested” Hauser’s recollection when, in fact, Hauser had given a different version of the events of the evening in question on a prior occasion. If that same testimony could now be used at trial, appellant would forever be denied the opportunity to confront Hauser with his <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>prior statement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Given the significance of Hauser’s testimony, as evidenced by the Commonwealth’s certification in the Statement of Jurisdiction in its brief to the Superior Court that the order barring the use of his testimony effectively terminates the prosecution of appellant, the credibility of Hauser is undoubtedly of vital importance in this case.</p>

Indeed, subsequent to giving this testimony, Melvin Hauser was charged with criminal conspiracy and criminal homicide in connection with the death of Elbert A. Williams, appellant's cousin, who was shot and killed during the incident occurring at Hauser’s residence on August 13, 1987. Hauser was also charged with aggravated assault <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>based upon allegations that he shot appellant in the hand during the same incident. These charges were, however, eventually dismissed as a result of appellant’s refusal to testify against Hauser at his preliminary hearing. The Commonwealth notes in its brief that appellant has since agreed to testify against Hauser and the charges have thus been refiled.</p>

Appellant also argues that he was “effectively” without counsel at the preliminary hearing and, therefore, the third element of the test for determining the admissibility of the prior testimony was not established. Specifically, he argues that because the evidence of which prior counsel was unaware was so critical to cross-examination, the failure of counsel to utilize such evidence constitutes ineffectiveness and that where counsel is ineffective, the defendant is essentially "without counsel.” Appellant’s argument is, however, wholly without merit. Appellant did, indeed, have counsel at the preliminary hearing. Moreover, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to utilize information of which she did not have the means or opportunity, at that stage of the case, to discover.</p>

The Commonwealth submits that, at trial, appellant will be permitted to introduce the prior inconsistent statement of Hauser through the testimony of the police officers to whom the statement was made and thereby argue the impeachment value of such. In support of this proposition, the Commonwealth relies upon two Superior Court decisions, <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em><a href="/pa-super/380/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="380 Pa. Super. 619" data-case-ids="458842" data-case-paths="/pa-super/380/0619-01">380 Pa.Super. 619</a>, <a href="/pa-super/380/0619-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="380 Pa.

Davis, </em><a href="/pa-super/363/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="363 Pa.

      <p id="b719-7" data-blocks='[["BL_719.6",719,[207,1184,1125,572]]]'>The <em>Smith </em>and <em>Davis </em>decisions — and the possibility that Hauser's prior inconsistent statements might come into evidence through the testimony of others — are, however, inapposite to the issue presented in the instant case. The mere opportunity to impeach an unavailable witness indirectly is obviously not the same thing as the opportunity to cross-examine (and impeach) the witness directly. Had the defense in this case had the opportunity to confront Hauser directly and to cross-examine him directly with the benefit of the vital withheld information, Hauser may have recanted his prior testimony or he may have made other responsive statements or reactions which would have strengthened appellant’s defense by casting doubt upon Hauser's credibility or his prior inconsistent account of the circumstances in question. The introduction of such impeaching information indirectly is clearly an inadequate substitute for a full and fair opportunity to examine the witness himself or herself.</p>

While there is no evidence that the Commonwealth acted improperly in this case, we do take this opportunity to remind prosecutors throughout the Commonwealth that Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3(a)(4) expressly provides that "[a] lawyer shall not knowingly ... (4) offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false. If a lawyer has offered material evidence and comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures.” The Commonwealth argues in its Brief to this Court that "... by presenting the testimony of a witness, whether actual or recorded, the Commonwealth does not vouch for the credibility of that testimony.” This is an incomplete statement of the Commonwealth’s obligations. While it is not the Commonwealth’s duty to make the fact-finder’s decision who to believe and who not to believe, it <em>is </em>the obligation of lawyers for the Commonwealth — as it is the obligation of every lawyer in this Commonwealth — not to present any testimony to the court that <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>they know to be false and to correct false testimony that comes to their attention after the fact but prior to "the conclusion of the proceeding.” Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 3.3(b).</p>

Kemp, </em>No. 00843 Pittsburgh, 1988, <em>allocatur discontinued, </em>February 9, 1990, addressed this exact issue and reached the opposite conclusion from that which it reached in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The defendant therein, Mr. Kemp, was charged with the murder of Mr. Williams, the man killed at Hauser’s residence on August 13, 1987. Appellant, Mr. Bazemore, testified at the inquest in <em>Kemp </em>but, following the filing of the instant charges, invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, refusing to testify at Kemp’s trial. The defendant then filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to preclude the Commonwealth from using Bazemore's prior testimony which motion was granted by the trial court. On appeal by the Commonwealth, a panel of the Superior Court, including thereon a panel member in <em>Commonwealth v. Bazemore, </em><a href="/citations/?q=397%20Pa.%20Super.%20637" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="397 Pa.

The facts in <em>Kemp </em>and the case <em>sub judice </em>are indistinguishable and the findings made by the panels, inconsistent.</p>
