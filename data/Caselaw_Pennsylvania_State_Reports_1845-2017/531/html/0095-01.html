(Maritime) following a decision of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB). The PLCB decision, rendered March 30, 1990, denied Maritime’s request for a public service liquor license. Maritime sought the license in order to serve liquor on a cruise vessel known as the “Spirit of Paupack” which operates on Lake Wallenpaupack, situated in Pike and Wayne Counties. In denying the request, the PLCB held that “the granting of this license would adversely impact on the neighboring communities and that in the reasonable exercise of the discretion authorized by Section 408(b) of the Liquor Code, the said application for [a] new public service liquor license should be refused.” Maritime filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court. Paupack Township and Palmyra Township intervened, as did Pennsylvania Power and Light, the owner of Lake Wallenpaupack. The intervenors were all opposed to issuance of the proposed liquor license.</p>
    <p id="b227-4" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[156,1271,1158,314]]]'>Paupack Township filed a motion to quash the appeal. Commonwealth Court granted the motion, relying upon Section 408(b) of the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. § 4-408(b), which provides that PLCB decisions regarding the issuance of liquor licenses to steamship companies are not subject to appeal. In 47 P.S. § 4-408(b), it is provided:</p>
    <blockquote id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.5",227,[197,1611,1117,420]]]'>(b) For the purpose of considering an application by a steamship or airline company for a public service liquor license, the board may cause an inspection of the steamship or vessel or aircraft for which a license is desired. The board may, in its discretion, grant or refuse the license applied for and <em>there shall be 'no appeal from its decision, </em>except that an action of mandamus may be brought against the board in the manner provided by law.</blockquote>
    <p id="b227-6" data-blocks='[["BL_227.6",227,[152,2060,1159,311]]]'>(Emphasis added). Commonwealth Court viewed this provision as according absolute discretion to the PLCB over the grant or refusal of steamship liquor license applications, subject only to judicial review in the form of actions for mandamus. Inasmuch as the petition for review filed by Maritime was not an action for mandamus, the appeal was quashed.</p>

The present PLCB decision was plainly not “appealable under” the Liquor Code, due to the prohibition on such appeals found in the Code at 47 Pa.C.S. § 4-408(b), supra.

    <blockquote id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[238,1865,1119,528]],["BL_230.1",230,[277,337,1123,840]]]'>In <em>El Rancho Grande </em>[supra] this Court held that individual tavern owners who sought to challenge the necessity of an additional liquor license ... had standing under section 702 to appeal the Board’s approval of the license application even though the tavern owners were not among the classes of persons authorized to appeal under the Liquor Code.... [0]ur decision in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>was in no respect inconsistent with section 701(b)(2), which excludes from the operation of the Administrative Agency Law those appeals which may be taken initially to the courts of common pleas <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>under 42 Pa.C.S. § 933. Although section 933(a)(1)(v) confers jurisdiction upon the courts of common pleas of appeals from “determinations of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board appealable under ... the Liquor Code,” that Code, as noted, limits the classes of persons and institutions permitted to appeal. Because the individual tavern owners in <em>El Rancho Grande </em>were not among the classes specified in the Liquor Code, the Board’s determination was not, as to the tavern owners, appealable under the Liquor Code to the court of common pleas pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 933. Thus, the exclusion contained in section 701(b)(2) did not apply to the tavern owners, and their appeal should have been taken directly to the Commonwealth Court under section 702 of the Administrative Agency Law. See 42 Pa.C.S. § 763(a) (jurisdiction of appeals from government agencies under § 702 vested in Commonwealth Court).</blockquote>
    <p id="b230-4" data-blocks='[["BL_230.4",230,[231,1201,1163,202]]]'>(Footnote omitted). Hence, as recognized in <em>Family Style Restaurant </em>and <em>El Rancho Grande, </em>provisions in the Liquor Code disallowing appeals do not bar appeals taken under the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 701(a), 702.</p>
    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.5",230,[229,1424,1166,523]]]'>We find no merit in the contention of the PLCB that Section 4-408(b) of the Liquor Code, supra, was intended by the legislature to supersede the right of appeal set forth in the Administrative Agency Law. Although the Liquor Code was reenacted by the legislature on June 29, 1987, and the Administrative Agency Law provisions in question, 2 Pa.C.S. §§ 701(a), 702 were enacted prior thereto, on April 28, 1978, there is no basis for belief that the legislature intended the Liquor Code to, in effect, repeal the Administrative Agency Law insofar as rights to appeal are concerned.</p>

See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1936 (“Whenever the provisions of two or more statutes enacted finally by different General Assemblies are irreconcilable, the statute latest in date of final enactment shall prevail.”). Such a conflict is not present in this case, however, for the two statutes in question are applicable to entirely separate subject matters. The Liquor Code addresses appeals that can <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>be brought <em>under </em>the Code, while the Administrative Agency-Law sets forth a separate, additional, right of appeal. The latter statute clearly provides that it shall override any other law that prohibits an appeal, to wit, that an appeal shall be allowed “regardless of the fact that a statute expressly provides that there shall be no appeal,” 2 Pa.C.S. § 701(a), supra. Thus, the Administrative Agency Law expressly contemplates that other statutes will differ insofar as appellate rights are concerned, and it expresses explicit legislative intent that it shall prevail.</p>
    <p id="b231-4" data-blocks='[["BL_231.4",231,[180,898,1160,205]]]'>In addition, the Judicial Code sets forth a similar right of appeal, and this right is applicable to final orders of Commonwealth agencies such as the PLCB. In 42 Pa.C.S. § 5105(a), it is provided:</p>
