Dr. Resnick reported that his examination did not reveal any significant findings that could be causally related to the symptoms complained of, or to the injury of April 24, 1981. He stated that there was a strong possibility of chronic pain syndrome, but reserved his final opinion until X-rays could be examined. Alston had refused to allow Dr. Resnick to take any X-rays.</p>

Dr. Wynne indicated to Rohrer that he was unable to calculate a firm date on which Alston could return to work.

Dr. Williams conducted a brief examination.

The Superior Court held that the legal immunity that is afforded to employers and their compensation insurers under the exclusivity provisions of the Workmen’s Compensation Act extends not only to acts of negligence, but also to claims based on intentional, wanton and willful misconduct. Citing its decision in <em>Rosipal, </em><a href="/pa-super/360/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="360 Pa.

    <p id="b395-6" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[213,1330,1161,423]]]'>The plaintiff brought a civil action against her employer, alleging economic duress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, procuring a false affidavit of recovery, and breach of compensation agreement.

The Superior Court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action as all of the allegations in her complaint had as the ultimate basis an injury compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, and her claims must be considered within its framework.</p>

The court held that when employees sustain injuries during the course of their employment, because of an intentional wrongdoing by their employer, the employee’s exclusive remedy for the injury itself, or for the handling of the claim, lies within the framework of the Workmen’s Compensation Act. The Superior Court concluded that the administrative remedies established therein are the exclusive remedies for claimants who believe that their benefits have been wrongfully suspended or terminated by the workmen’s compensation insurer. The Superior Court applied this analysis as well to those individuals or entities employed by the insurer to review the case, such as Vocational Services and Dr. Williams.</p>

The workmen’s compensation system encompasses all disputes over coverage and the payment of benefits, whether they arise from actions taken by the employer, the employer’s insurance carrier, or the insurance carrier’s employees or agents.

On the other hand, the Act itself provides that an employee may sue a fellow employee for an <em>intentional </em>tort under the “personal animus” exception to the exclusivity provision of the Act. <em>Dolan v.

Since the Act was written in order to resolve issues as between employer and employee, it is only rational that the legislature would have to explicitly except intentional tortious conduct of fellow employees since one could not expect an employer to bear the consequences of an intentional act of a fellow employee unless the employer in some way directly facilitated the intentional tortious conduct. It seems to me that there was no commensurate need to specifically exempt intentional tortious conduct of the employer since, as Mr. Justice Larsen aptly notes, "... the purpose of this kind of legislation was to restrict the remedy available to an employee against the employer to compensation, and to close to the employee, and to third parties, any recourse against the employer in tort for <em>negligence.” Kline v.
