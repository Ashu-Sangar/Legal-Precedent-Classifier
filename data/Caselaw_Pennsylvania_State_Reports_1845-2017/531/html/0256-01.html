On October 15, 1987, this court reversed Superior Court’s <em>Revtai </em>case and confirmed Superior Court’s holding in <em>Schimelfenig </em>that a failure to file a timely complaint under Pa.R.Crim.P. 130(d) does not require a dismissal unless defendant can show that he was prejudiced by the delay.'</p>

      <em>Commonwealth v. Mirarchi, </em><a href="/pa/481/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="481 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1747294" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0385-01">481 Pa. 385</a>, 390, <a href="/pa/481/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="481 Pa. 385" data-case-ids="1747294" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0385-01">392 A.2d 1346</a>, 1348 (1978). The Commonwealth is correct, therefore, that in cases which are dismissed because of failure to make a prima facie case, rearrest is permissible. The question remains, however, whether this case, involving dismissal because of untimely filing, is analytically similar to cases in which the prima facie case is defective.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[213,1168,1159,415]]]'>We believe it is not. Making a prima facie case has to do with the presentation of evidence which, if true, would sustain the charge. Traditionally, the failure to make a prima facie case has been treated as an interlocutory matter, for at the time it is determined that the prosecution’s evidence is deficient, jeopardy has not attached and the state is not out of court because of the adverse determination. It may add to its case and resubmit the case for prosecution.</p>
    <p id="b389-7" data-blocks='[["BL_389.7",389,[212,1604,1156,362]]]'>In the case at bar, however, the dismissal was based not on insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case, but on the application of a rule of law handed down by Superior Court to the facts of this case. The Commonwealth had failed to file the criminal complaint within five days, and this conduct, as interpreted by Superior Court’s treatment of Pa.R.Crim.P. 130(d), required dismissal.</p>

The defect was incurable unless the magistrate’s application of Superior Court’s rule was in error or unless Superior Court’s rule was itself in error. In either case, the remedy was to appeal the magistrate’s dismissal, for it is axiomatic that when a judicial officer commits an error in application of the law, the remedy is on appeal. And if the claim was that the rule of law <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>handed down by Superior Court was in error, it is again axiomatic that a lower court, in this case a magisterial court, is without authority to overrule an appellate court. Thus, appeal was the only route available to contest the dismissal. Having failed to appeal, the dismissal is res judicata.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

Here, filing a new complaint would be of no avail, for defects in the complaint are not what is at issue. What is at issue is the legal effect of failure to take an appeal from the dismissal of the complaint which was based on late filing, and that is not treated in the rule. Pa.R.Crim.P. 150(b), therefore, may not be used to resolve the issue in this case, and the Commonwealth’s claim is without merit.</p>
