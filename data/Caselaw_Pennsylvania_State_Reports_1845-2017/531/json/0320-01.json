Thomas, 526 Pa. 540, 587 A.2d 727 (1991).\nHowever, I must write separately to exhort the General Assembly to amend Chapter XIV of the Public Welfare Code, 62 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1401, et seq., to provide remedies and/or penalties against attorneys who knowingly violate the Public Welfare Code. These benefits are public funds which are paid for by the taxpayers. I find it unconscionable that an attorney, who is charged with knowledge of the law and is aware that his client has received public assistance, would fail to notify the Department of Public Welfare that his client has been reimbursed for injuries already paid for by the Commonwealth. The law clearly establishes an obligation on the attorney to advise the Department of Public Welfare, 62 P.S. \u00a7 1409(b)(12), but fails to provide a remedy or sanction against an attorney who neglects that duty. The legislature should seriously consider establishing a sanction for those who fail to comply.",
