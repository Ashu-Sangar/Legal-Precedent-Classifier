He was keeping a tavern at the time of his death, and after he died the tavern was kept by James Neely for three years; after Neely by Dale Kuhn for four years, and thenceforward by the defendant. About December 1, 1887, a man named Dennis, employed by the defendant to clean out a Cess-pool on the tavern premises, found a roll of money concealed about the cess-pool. Dennis gave the money to one Caldwell, who handed it over to the defendant, who counted it, and found the amount to be $320. The plaintiff’s testimony was in substance as follows:</p>

George Warren testified that at one time he came across the money hidden in the cave; Mrs. Warren, <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>that she knew of him burying money at different times in the garden ; Kennedy Marshall, that he did not deposit in bank, and that he had seen him with large sums of money; Elizabeth Caldwell, that she had seen Warren dig money out of the garden; Thomas Marshall, that the decedent was a man of some means; he never deposited money in bank, and was accustomed to having sums of money about him.</p>

There was no positive proof bearing upon this question; but there was a chain of circumstances clearly proved, and not disputed, which render it extremely probable that the money in question had been buried, where it was found, by George Warren, the former owner or occupier of the property. Piad it been found while he remained upon the property, the case would have been much <em>clearer; </em>but it was not found until after his death, and after the premises had been occupied by other tenants for some years. Neither of them claim it, however, and, in view of Warren’s aversion to banks, and his known way of hiding and secreting his money, we are not surprised that the jury found him to have been the owner of it. It is true, the finder of money has title to it against all the world except the true owner; yet we cannot say there was not evidence of <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>Warren’s title to submit to the jury, and their verdict is in accordance with all the probabilities of the case.</p>
