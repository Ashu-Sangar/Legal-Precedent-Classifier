If this is intended to refer to the amount in money, of the rents, etc., it is not sustained by the evidence. It appears that until after this agreement was made, the rents were collected by Vm. R. Gormly, uncle of the defendant and of plaintiff’s husband John B., and as to this she says, “ My husband was sick and I took the checks to bank and had them cashed; ” so that she had the same opportunity to know the amount of the rents, that the defendant had. But aside from this means of knowledge, it appears that prior to the signing of the agreement, the rents to that date were settled. The exact date has not been given, but the agreement was not signed until after William’s return from his wedding trip. Plaintiff says, “William afterwards gave me two or three notes for back rents. These notes were given me about the time William was going to be married. Uncle William Gormly had the back rents in his possession at that time.” William testifies to the same matter.</p>

It is not sufficient to put him in motion, that suspicion and distrust have been thrown over a transaction. Inadequacy of price, improvidence, surprise and mere hardship, have each been held sufficient to stay the active interposition of a chancellor. Yet no one of these, nor all combined, furnishes an adequate reason for a judicial rescission of a contract. For such action, something more is demanded, such as fraud, mistake or illegality. .....In regard to the value of the lots, and their liability to sale, both parties had equal means of information, and when that is the case, a representation, though untrue, will not be considered fraudulent.” And in Light v. Light, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%20412" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="21 Pa. 412">21 Pa. 412</a>, Judge Black says: “Everyone is conclusively presumed to know the law; without this presumption no law could be executed.

If the interest were plain, then she should know it; i-f it were doubtful, it was the proper subject of conpromise. Under the evidence in the case, the findings of the master cannot be approved. If there were more doubt as to these conclusions, the court would be slow to move, at this time, the contract having been in force for over fifteen years, without complaint.
