The personal assets were not set apart for the payment of the special legacies, but were used for other purposes. Several years after his father’s death, Wm. B. Hays, Jr., became financially embarrassed and made a voluntary assignment for the benefit of his creditors. In the meantime he had purchased the interest of his brother, Curtis H. Hays, in his father’s real estate, subject to a mortgage given by said Curtis in favor of the Allegheny National Bank, and after his voluntary assignment proceedings were instituted on this mortgage in the District Court of the United States and prosecuted to sale. The proceeds of sale, $68,000, were claimed by or on behalf of the estate of Wm. B. <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>Hays, deceased, and also on behalf of the Allegheny National Bank. The matter was referred to an auditor, who awarded one -half of the fund, less costs, $33,511.55, to W. A. Lewis, trustee aforesaid, and one half to the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. of Wm. B. Hays, deceased, and this finding was approved bj»- the Circuit Court upon exceptions filed on behalf of the Allegheny National Bank. The marshal’s sale was confirmed absolute^ on August 6, 1881, and the one half of the net proceeds of sale was, in accordance with the said finding, paid said W. A. Lewis, trustee, on August 31, 1882.</p>

The estate out of which the testamentary legacies are payable is solvent. The manifest intention of the testator was that interest should be paid on these legacies continuousl}-, and it could not be paid except upon the basis of an invested corpus set apart for its production. The liens of these legacies were admittedly prior to that of the mortgage of the Allegheny National Bank. That the proceeds were not promptly paid on account of the satisfaction of the former, on confirmation of the sale, was due to the interference of the latter lien creditor, and the bank has therefore no equity to object to the allowance of <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>interest. On what principle, then, are these legatees to be made to forfeit a substantial part of the bounty which this testator manifestly intended for them ? Or, how can their legacies, with the interest thereon, be said to have been paid, before the legatees in fact received the money. True, the sale divested the lien of the legacies from the property sold, but it did not satisfy them. The legacies were intended to be paid as given, and the whole estate was made liable for their satisfaction. The interest was an essential part of the bounty intended in the provision for the education of testator’s grandchildren, by which he placed himself to this extent at least in loco parentis, and the provision could not be made effective without it. The satisfaction of these legacies was made the primary object. The residuary devisees could certainly raise no valid objection to their satisfaction in full, and those who claim under them can have no higher nor prior rights.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[181,1179,1171,195]]]'>It was claimed on behalf of the Allegheny National Bank that Yeatman’s App., supra, was not in point, because the lien there was not due at the date of the sheriff’s sale, and because W. B. Hays, Jr., whose land was sold here, was insolvent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[178,1384,1172,606]]]'>There is a complete answer to the'first of these objections, in the fact that interest was computed in that case beyond the date of the maturity of the debt. But the court makes no reference to the non7maturity of the debt as a basis of decision, but places it upon the ground that the debtor- estate was solvent, and the delay in payment was for its convenience. The answer to the second of these objections is, that the right of these legacies turns, not upon the solvency of Wm. B. Hays, Jr., but the solvency of the estate^ of Wm. B. Hays, deceased, on which the primary liability lies. They are claiming now to enforce their rights in the settlement of the estate of their testator, and not in that of the -servient owners of the land charged.</p>
