Shriver wickedly and maliciously, and for the purpose of injuring affiant, conspired with the plaintiffs in said action and other parties interested in the promotion of proceedings in No. 544 December Term 1881, to prevent a proper defence to be made thereto, and did wilfully and falsely swear, as a witness, being sworn in said cause, to matters and things that were untrue, and throughout the whole litigation was the main witness against Nellis, Shriver &amp; Company, and thereby prevented a proper determination of said cause.”</p>
