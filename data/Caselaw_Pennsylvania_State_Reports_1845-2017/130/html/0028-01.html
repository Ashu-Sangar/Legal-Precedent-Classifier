Crawford &amp; Co., to recover a balance due upon an account. Issue. On December 15, 1886, a trial of the cause was had, when the jury returned a verdict in favor of <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>plaintiff for $292.50. On June 6, 1887, a rule for a new trial was argued, and discharged, and on June 7th, judgment was entered on the verdict.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.6",47,[218,919,1179,201]]]'>No answer to the foregoing petition was filed, but after argument upon testimony taken and filed by the defendants, the court, Neale, P. J., on October 25, 1888, filed the following opinion:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b47-8" data-blocks='[["BL_47.8",47,[219,1331,1181,506]]]'>The plaintiff, at the trial, gave evidence to support his claim; and the defendants seemed to rely in a great measure upon one Miller, who had been a former partner of the plaintiff. The manner and the language of the witness on the stand, certainly indicated a hostile spirit towards the plaintiff; and the reluctance of the plaintiff’s counsel to examine him in the plaintiff’s behalf, was strongly persuasive that he was regarded by the plaintiff as wholly unfavorable to him. At the trial, the best efforts of counsel on both sides was exerted to draw the verdict of the jury to the side of their respective clients.</p>

The argument of the motion was then held over at the instance of counsel till <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>May 11, 1887, when it was argued, and after careful consideration of all the grounds and evidence presented, the court, on June 6, 1887, the second term after the trial, discharged the rule in an opinion filed. On June 7, 1887, the plaintiff took judgment upon the verdict.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-5" data-blocks='[["BL_48.5",48,[249,604,1178,507]]]'>On June 13, 1887, the defendants, under misapprehension that judgment had been taken, renewed their motion for a new trial; in other words, asked for a rehearing upon the former motion. This motion remained until September 7, 1887, the third term after the verdict, and a full term after the entry of the judgment, when it was also discharged, the defendants’ counsel acquiescing. Then on September 26, 1887, a new petition of the defendants was presented to the court asking for the opening of the judgment and that the verdict be set aside; whereupon the rule now under consideration was granted.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-6" data-blocks='[["BL_48.6",48,[248,1118,1176,296]]]'>The parties have taken considerable testimony, and if we were now to pronounce upon the weight of it we would not hesitate in saying that it preponderates in favor of the defendants. How it might be, if the witnesses were to be presented in court, and subjected to the scrutiny and diversified views of a jury, we cannot determine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-7" data-blocks='[["BL_48.7",48,[245,1424,1177,452]]]'>The argument of the counsel for the defendants is largely predicated of alleged fraud on the part of the plaintiff in the procurement of the verdict, by misstatement of fact and the concealment of fact. The testimony, it is true, shows that the plaintiff is contradicted in material matters by the testimony of other witnesses, but it remains yet a question of fact whether or not his testimony was true and the testimony of the witnesses now produced incorrect: Mead v. Conroe, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20Pa.%20226" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="113 Pa. 226">113 Pa. 226</a>. Fraud must be clearly proved.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b48-8" data-blocks='[["BL_48.8",48,[244,1884,1176,401]]]'>In the present case, the application to set aside the verdict is made at the third term after the verdict was rendered. Two full years after the narr had been filed, were afforded the defendants to prepare for trial. The further opportunity of supporting the original motion continued until May, 1887, some five months, and in all that time it was not deemed by the court that such facts were presented as would warrant the court interfering with the verdict.</p>

But we do not overlook the authorities cited by the defendants’ counsel that sustain a liberal exercise of the power of the courts over judgments. In the main, however, these authorities apply to judgments upon defaults and warrants to confess. But we find that even in cases of verdicts, a generous exercise of discretion is committed to the courts and sanctioned : Stephens v.
