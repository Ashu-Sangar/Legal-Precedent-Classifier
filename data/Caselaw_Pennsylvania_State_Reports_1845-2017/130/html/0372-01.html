By the custom of the trade, whiskey in bond is sold or hypothecated 'by the execution and delivery of certificates, called on the face warehouse receipts; containing, inter alia, the serial numbers of the barrels, the date when bonded, and the gauge of <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>the contents thereof, attested by a U.

Thereupon defendant purchased from him 45 barrels of whiskey, 21 barrels of which are the subject of this controversy, and are a part of the same sold by Jones to plaintiff, Miller, in March, 1883. The defendant paid a full consideration therefor, and as payments were made by him, the money or checks were turned over to Elwood &amp; Co., in payment of the debt for which the whiskey Was pledged, and from time to time as payments were made, by direction of Jones, Elwood &amp; Co., delivered to defendant the hypothecated certificates for the whiskey in suit.

    <p class="summary" id="b395-8" data-blocks='[["BL_395.5",395,[202,1373,1180,818]]]'>As has already been stated, whiskey in bond cannot be actually delivered. It cannot be removed from the warehouse until the tax is paid, but under the law the tax must be paid and the whiskey withdrawn within three years from its entry. As is well known, the traffic in bonded whiskey is a very large one'and great quantities of bonded whiskey are sold. To hold that these sales would be invalid without actual delivery, would be to hold that a purchaser of bonded whiskey is entirely at the mercy of the distiller and must trust entirely to his honesty ; on the other hand, to hold that all that is necessary is to make a bill of sale, leaves it in the power of a dishonest distiller to sell the same whiskey to half a dozen purchasers, and thus defraud all but the first purchaser. Therefore, the general rule of equity should be applied, and the purchaser required to do all that can reasonably be done to give notice of his title and prevent a second sale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-9" data-blocks='[["BL_395.6",395,[200,2200,1181,251]],["BL_396.1",396,[252,362,1174,752]]]'>The testimony shows that the trade has adopted a system regulating the transfer of bonded whiskey by means of certificates called warehouse receipts. These certificates in addition to the certificates of the distiller that he has sold the whiskey, contain a statement signed by the - U. S. gauger showing the <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>numbers and dimensions of the barrels, the gauge and date of entry. It does not clearly appear that but one certificate of this character is signed by the gauger, but as the only purpose of these certificates is the sale and transfer of the title, the gauger by issuing more than one would be a party to a fraud. It is therefore probable that the gauger will sign but one certificate for each lot of whiskey. And the fact that when Browarsky required from Jones the warehouse receipts for the whiskey, they had to be released by Elwood &amp; Co., to whom they were pledged, goes to show that a second certificate could not be obtained, from the gauger. It would only be reasonable then that Miller should have required from Jones the usual form of delivery by transfer of the so-called warehouse receipts. If this had been done, it would have been out of the power of Jones to have made the second sale.</p>

The whiskey under the law, is in the joint possession of the storekeeper and the distiller. It may be removed at any time upon the payment of the tax, and although the custom is for the distiller to obtain the withdrawal order, the law recognizes the right of any owner to withdraw whiskey on payment of the tax; and this being so, delivery certainly would not have been made to the distiller, in the face of notice that the ownership was in some one else, and the defendant would have discovered the fraud of Jones upon presentation of the first certificate.</p>

    <p id="b397-11" data-blocks='[["BL_397.10",397,[205,1401,1178,661]]]'>This case does not require extended discussion. The learned referee has given sufficient reasons for his findings. It is clear that but for plaintiff’s laches Jones would not have been able to sell the whiskey the second time; and the rule is well established that, where one of two innocent persons must suffer a loss, such loss must be borne by the person, whose neglect was the occasion of it. The plaintiff left the whiskey absolutely under the control of Jones, when, by reasonable caution, he could have placed it beyond his power to re-sell it. The defendant was a good-faith purchaser, without any knowledge of tire prior purchase and of the fraud of J ones. Having so purchased the whiskey, paid the tax, and taken it out of bond, we see no reason why he did not get a good title.</p>
    <p id="b397-12" data-blocks='[["BL_397.11",397,[977,2069,359,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
