The track was a narrow-gauge track, but the train upon which the plaintiff was engaged, was made up of broad-gauge cars which had been moved upon narrow-gauge trucks. At Fowler siding, one of the ears was found to be disabled, and it became necessary to drop it from the train. The plaintiff mounted the car, loaded with lumber, to run it upon the siding, and when it got upon the curve, it turned over and rolled down the embankment, whereby the plaintiff was injured. Witnesses for the plaintiff testified that they examined the track immediately after the accident occurred, and saw that a rail was shoved off to one side, a little, at the end; that the ends of the two rails did not meet, and that there were no fish-plates at the joint.</p>

I decline to instruct you that there is no proof that the want of the fish-plates was the cause of the accident. There is some evidence on that subject and the evidence is for the jury. You, gentlemen, will remember what the witnesses said with respect to the displacement of the rail there. One of the plaintiff’s'witnesses said something about it being displaced just a little, and that there were some marks or indications as though a car had passed over the end of the rail abutting on it, and that is for you. You will remember what the witnesses said as to the condition the rail was in when it was first seen after the accident, and from all these facts it is for you to determine whether or not there was sufficient proof, that the want of the fish-plate was the cause of the accident, or whether there was sufficient proof that it was the cause of the accident.3</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[235,677,1178,1159]]]'>Answer: This point is not affirmed. It is for the jury to determine from the evidence, under the instructions given you, whether the defendant was culpably negligent in constructing its track, and whether the accident was the result of that negligence. It is true, gentlemen of the jury, that the plaintiff could not recover here if the evidence satisfies the jury that this accident occurred, not because of the negligence of the railroad company, but because of the negligence of a co-employee, that is, a fellow-servant with himself, and a trackman would be a fellow-servant with himself. But, if the railroad company put down a railroad track and then undertook to run the trains upon it, it is for the jury to say whether under all the circumstances they reasonably ought to have known that it was imperfect, if in point of fact the jury conclude that it was unsafe. The railroad company cannot shield itself by the fact that it did not know, if it was indifferent to the interests of a proper construction of its road, and let it go without making proper inquiry. It is for the jury to determine then whether they, even if they did not have actual knowledge that there was anything wrong (and there was something wrong, if that be true), yet it is for the jury to determine, whether reasonably they ought to have known; whether proper, ordinary prudence would have informed them.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[230,471,1171,1162]]]'>Answer : This point is not affirmed. The court will not say that the plaintiff and his fellow-servants were outside of their place or line of duty, in putting this car on the Fowler siding, without positive orders from the company to put it there. That, gentlemen, is also another question for you, along with the other facts of this case. Whether the Fowler siding was provided for that purpose, or for such a purpose, and whether reasonably this plaintiff and his co-employees were in the line of their duty in putting that car on that place without orders, —there is no pretence they had any direct orders — was it their duty to do that; was it their duty to take it somewhere else ? The court will not undertake to say that they should have taken it somewhere else, and not put it in there, nor will the court say they should have put it there or that it was their duty to put it there. They might have put it somewhere else. One of the witnesses testified they might have switched it out there on the West siding. It is for the jury to say, under all the facts of this case, whether they were outside of their duty in doing what they ought not to have done in putting the car where they did. If they were outside of their duty, doing an improper thing there, a thing the company did not intend, did not build that track for the purpose of having done, then the company would not be liable.5</p>

    <p id="b207-10" data-blocks='[["BL_207.11",207,[228,1683,1171,349]]]'>In its third point defendant below requested the court to charge “ that an employer does his duty when he provides for his employees in such manner as he fairly and reasonably deems prudent and safe, and if he furnishes appliances which, although not the best that can be obtained, and yet may be used without danger, he has discharged his duty, and is not responsible for accident or injury.”</p>
    <p id="b207-11" data-blocks='[["BL_207.12",207,[226,2041,1172,348]],["BL_208.1",208,[241,361,1169,399]]]'>The learned judge, being unwilling to take such a long stride in advance of anything that has heretofore been claimed as the proper standard of the duty which employers owe to their employees, substituted the words, “ is fairly and reasonably prudent and safe,” for the words, “ he fairly and reasonably deems safe,” and said it is not what he decides may be prudent, “but what is, in point of fact, reasonable, prudent, and safe, that he <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>is required to furnish.” With that modification he affirmed the point. In that he was clearly right. If the doctrine asserted in the point were recognized as correct, we would have as many standards of duty as there are degrees of carelessness among employers, and every employer would have to be adjudged guilty of negligence or not, according to his own standard of duty to his employees in each particular case. That would never do. The first specification cannot be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[243,768,1168,145]]]'>As presented, defendant’s seventh point might have been properly refused, but the learned judge affirmed it with a qualification that was undoubtedly correct.</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[243,919,1169,350]]]'>In defendant’s eighth and tenth points, respectively, the court, on an assumed state of facts, was substantially requested to withdraw the case from the jury, and direct a verdict for defendant company. In view of the evidence, it would have been manifest error to have done so. The learned judge was clearly right in refusing to affirm either point, and in answering them as he did.</p>
    <p id="b208-7" data-blocks='[["BL_208.7",208,[243,1277,1168,288]]]'>He was also right in declining to affirm defendant’s eleventh and twelfth points. The case was clearly for the jury under all the evidence, and it was fairly submitted to them in a clear and correct charge that was as favdrable to the plaintiff in errólas it had any right to expect. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
    <p id="b208-8" data-blocks='[["BL_208.8",208,[1005,1585,357,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
