McCartney, son of his deceased daughter Jennie W. McCartney, “ each to share and share alike.” In the following clause he proceeds thus: “I would rather prefer not to have a division made of my estate until the youngest child of Henrietta arrives at the age of twenty-one years. But should any of the heirs, after arriving to that age, wish to engage in business, and wish to realize any portion of their interest in said estate, my executors can give them such an amount as they may think proper, and take their individual note or notes, bearing interest to be added thereto, and deducted from their respective portions of said estate on the final division of the same.

This court held that the division should be into two equal parts, one of winch should belong to the heirs of Mrs. Osburn, and the other to the said Harry G.

    <p class="summary" id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[199,821,1182,1328]]]'>In 1884, Mr. Osburn and Mr. McCartney met -in Chicago, Illinois, and éntered into negotiations for the partition of the land which belonged to the estate, located there. They were unable to agree upon a basis of valuation, and Mr. McCartney thereupon insisted that there should be no sale. Mr. Osburn then consulted his counsel, submitted to him copies of the paper-book in the proceedings which, as above stated, had been instituted in this court, in reference to the construction of the will of Judge Warner, and was advised that the will must be construed by the Supreme Court [of Illinois] in order to give title to the different heirs, to the land there; and that in his opinion, no partition could be made until Mrs. Osburn’s youngest child attained majority, but that this question also must be decided by that court. A bill was thereupon filed with this view, on behalf of the executors and the children of Mrs. Osburn, against Mr. McCartney, in which it was alleged, inter alia, that the proper construction of Judge Warner’s will was, that distribution of his residuary estate should be per capita and not per stirpes. Mr. Osburn testified in reference to the purpose of this bill, at a hearing in this court: “ It was not my purpose at all in the proceedings in Chicago to obtain partition, but simply to obtain construction of the will, just as McCartney did here. .... I wanted a different construction of the will from that given here, and that is very likely the reason why the papers were drawn as they were, without reference to the injunction made by the court here.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[261,1077,1177,552]]]'>1. The reasons for present division of this estate, as between Harry G. McCartney and the “ heirs ” of Mrs. Osburn, greatly preponderate. Mr. McCartney has an absolute and vested interest under the will: Osburn’s App., <a href="/pa/104/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="104 Pa. 637" data-case-ids="452204" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0637-01">104 Pa. 637</a>; he has attained his majorfiy, and it does not appear that he is “ incompetent or incapacitated, either in mind or in body, or from intemperance, to take charge of or manage his interest.” There is no allegation that such division would be prejudicial in any way to the estate; and there is no prohibition against such division contained in the will. So far as Mr. McCartney is concerned, there is no reason for the existence of any trust.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[261,1639,1178,760]],["BL_381.1",381,[231,352,1171,93]]]'>The executors are not given expressly, nor by necessary implication, control over the time of division. They are, it is true, expressly given power to make sales of real estate, and to invest the proceeds until “ final division,” and to make advancements to the “ heirs ” upon the security of their individual notes ; but manifestly this gives them no power to determine when the final division shall take place. The whole administration, including the exercise of these special powers, might have been ended within the year after Judge "Warner’s death, without, so far as appears, prejudice to any interest. The expression of a preference by testator, that the “ final division ” should not take place until the youngest child of Mrs. Osburn should attain majority, was not necessarily directed to the executors, but rather to the “ heirs,” and, being merely precatory, it is not to be regarded as binding. Even if addressed to the <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>executors, it gave them no power to postpone peremptorily the final division: Rawle’s App., <a href="/pa/119/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="119 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="558116" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0100-01">119 Pa. 100</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-5" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[231,454,1173,507]]]'>But, assume that the executors were given discretionary power in the premises. They have made a solemn declaration in this and the Supreme Court, that the time for final division had arrived, and have not only since given no sufficient reason for postponement of that time, but have actually made division of a large part of the estate. This implies that in the opinion of the executors, final division could then have been made without prejudice to the estate, and that Mr. McCartney was “ competent to take charge of, and manage ” his interest; and there is no allegation that these conditions have since changed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.5",381,[231,968,1175,1056]]]'>If the solemn declaration of the executors, made as above stated, was not an exhaustion of any alleged discretionary power to determine the time of final division of the estate, their conduct must at least be regarded as either arbitrary or capricious, and cannot be suffered to prejudice the rights of any of their cestuis que trust: Hill on Trustees, 494. If it was wise then, it is wise now, to make final division. There is no reason apparent on the face of the will, in the condition of the estate, nor in the character of this petitioner, why it should not now be made; and there is every reason why it should now be made. Judge Warner has been dead 15 years, and this petitioner’s interest has been compelled to bear its proportion of the costs and expenses of administration, during the whole of that period. Mr. McCartney has attained the age at which the law gave him the right “ to take charge of and manage ” his property: and there is no reason why he should not exercise that right here and now. The will gave him an absolute and present vested interest in the estate. There is therefore no reason for the continued existence of a trust so far as he is concerned. It is the polioy of the law to encourage the distribution and division of estates and the dissolution of trusts.</p>

    <p id="b383-5" data-blocks='[["BL_383.5",383,[236,579,1174,766]]]'>It is not needed that we add anything to the opinion of the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court in this ease. He has fully vindicated his decree. Upon one point only do we differ from him. He ordered that the costs of this proceeding should be paid out of-the estate. In an ordinary case, this would be correct. In the case in hand, however, the costs have been incurred through the conduct of the executor himself. All that was necessary for his guidance was ruled when the case was here before. See Osburn’s App., <a href="/pa/104/0637-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="104 Pa. 637" data-case-ids="452204" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0637-01">104 Pa. 637</a>. The executor, however, appears not to have been satisfied with our rulings, and to have taken -a different view of the law. We have nothing to say in regard to this, beyond the fact that we cannot permit him to waste the money of the estate in seeking to establish his own views of the law. If he desires to indulge in litigation as a luxury, he must pay for it.</p>
