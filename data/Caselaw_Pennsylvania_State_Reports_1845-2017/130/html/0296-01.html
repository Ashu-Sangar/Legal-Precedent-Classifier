And the order of said .court, under and by virtue of which she holds the said 1-and, and under which all liability to plaintiff, if any, exists, was in the words following, to wit: ‘April 9, 1884. The court award purpart No. 1 to Mrs. Martha Gill, at her bid of forty dollars per acre; she to enter into recognizance with surety, in the sum of five thousand dollars, for the payment of the widow and heirs of decedent of amounts to which they may be entitled by law; the amount payable to heirs to be paid with interest within one year.’ And in pursuance of and in compliance with said order of court, the defendants entered into a recognizance in the sum of five thousand-dollars with surety, conditioned for the payment to the widow, Nancy Donaghy, interest on the one third during life, and to the heirs as in said decree directed the two thirds payable within one year with interest.' And within the year these defendants paid the two thirds due the heirs with interest, and have continued to pay the widow her interest under said decree and recognizance, and are not in arrears for any part of the same.

That recognizance obliges the defendants to pay to the plaintiff only one third of the interest of the valuation money, and of course, in an action on the recognizance, no more can be recovered than is thereby stipulated to be paid. It is, however, perfectly clear that the recognizance should be amended or a new one made for the correct amount, and then, if the recognizors refuse to pay, the proper remedy can be speedily enforced. Upon the present state of the record, there can be no recovery for the whole of the interest, and therefore the judgment must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[224,935,1174,559]]]'>The proper course for the plaintiff to pursue would seem to be to go into the Orphans’ Court, and have the correct decree made. We say nothing on the question of jurisdiction., as it is not now before us; but perhaps, when the defendants reflect that if there is no partition the plaintiff is entitled to the exclusive possession of the land during her life as against them and all others, they may conclude that it is doubtful policy to raise that question. The alternative of an action of-ejectment by their mother to recover possession and mesne profits, may be less pleasant than the prompt and full adjustment of her undoubted legal rights bjr their voluntary act.</p>
