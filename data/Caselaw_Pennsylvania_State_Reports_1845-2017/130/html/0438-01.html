In consideration thereof the Philadelphia Co. agreed to “ use, manage, maintain and operate the said property and lines in the same manner, <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>as fully and to the same extent as the party of the first part is or may in law be bound to do.” •</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b459-5" data-blocks='[["BL_459.6",459,[212,1549,1168,754]]]'>Counsel for defendant claims to read the contract between the two companies as though it said the obligation the Philadelphia Co. assumed was only to fill the contracts of the Pennsylvania Co., where the latter had made actual connections and was supplying gas at the date of the contract. To put this interpretation on the contract would be to-assume that the two companies deliberately contracted to prevent the Pennyslvania Co. from performing its corporate duties. We see no necessity arising from the wording of the contract to arrive at such a conclusion. We assume that hoth companies acted in good faith towards the public, towards parties having contracts for the supply of gas, and towafds each other. Contracts must he interpreted in accordance with the surrounding circumstances and with the well known usages of the business which is the subject matter of the contract.</p>

This seems to us to be the fair and proper construction of the contract. It is one of the things that it may be said that everybody in and around Pittsburgh knows, that where a natural gas company has a supply main or large pipe on a street or road, it is the custom for them to run a pipe from that supply main to the curb or to the regulator at any reasonable distance in the vicinity, to supply customers. When a large main is in the vicinity, customers can then be supplied from the existing works of the company. The evidence shows that about 220 feet of 2£ inch pipe at a cost of $55 for pipe and laying, was all that was required to make connection with the plaintiff’s works from the large main of the Pennsylvania Co. We admitted evidence to show that that was a usual and ordinary connection to be made for the supply of a factory, such as that of the plaintiff. It is in no proper sense an extension of the works of the gas company. Although the contract of the Carbon Company with the Gas Company uses the word “ main ” in relation to their supply, it is evident, from the whole contract, that an ordinary connection for a supply for the factory was intended.</p>
