The evidence shows that an ordinance was passed by the borough council on June 5, 1886, for the construction of a board walk on the south side of Fourth street, from Beltzhoover avenue to Florence street, and on the north side from Florence street to Myrtle avenue; and that the board walk was so constructed. <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>An earlier ordinance, adopted March 4,1878, regulates the construction of boardwalks and provides for notice to the parties. That general ordinance in relation to board walks, and earlier ordinances also, fixes the curb lines of the streets, so that when the authorities come to fully improve them, in the regular way, by pavements, etc., they shall know how to do it. It makes the sidewalk of a 50 foot street 10 feet wide when fully completed. In other words, the curb line is fixed 10 feet out from the property line, which is about the proportion adopted in the city of Pittsburgh. About one fifth of the width of each street' is allowed for a sidewalk. This general regulation in regard to board walks provides for a board walk of not more than 4 feet in width in front of unimproved property. That, I think, is the general width of a board walk, unless otherwise ordered, to be in the middle of this 10 feet of sidewalk, that is, 3 feet from the curb and 3 feet from the property line.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[193,1189,1181,248]]]'>In this case, it appears that the board walk was so laid, but was carried out 7 feet beyond the property line at the corner lot, so that it would meet a similarly constructed board walk on the other street, as would evidently be necessary to make a complete sidewalk, if there was one on the other street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[185,1447,1186,963]]]'>It is alleged on behalf of the defendant, that there was no sufficient ordinance fixing the grade or the manner in which these board walks are to be built. There is evidence in the ordinance, however, fixing the general place for the board walk in the sidewalk, and there was no necessity for a new ordinance for that. In passing an ordinance for a board walk along a particular street, it is not necessary to say where in the sidewalk it shall be. The location of the board walk, if it did not take the whole of the sidewalk, was fixed by the ge^b.al ordinance. There is also evidence from which the jury might find the grade of Fourth street, or they might not, namely, a profile proved by counsel which would fix the grade; although I am inclined to think the jury might fairly find that there was no formal grade fixed for the board walk on this street. When a board walk is ordered to be built, without any special grade being fixed, it means the natural grade of the surface. That makes the grade unless otherwise ordered. I do not think it is important, however, on account of other evidence in the case about this matter. That evidence I will refer to.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.3",356,[241,358,1173,1785]]]'>
      <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>It is alleged that there was no sufficient notice given to Mr. Maple of this ordinance for making the board walk. We think there was. It was done in two ways : first, it was posted on the premises, and second, given to him personally at Ins request. He seems to have recognized that and treated it as sufficient. He says he went to the street committee, which was the proper committee, to ascertain at what grade they wanted it put down, but they failed and neglected to give it to him. The act of assembly and the ordinance provide, that after it is determined to build a board walk and notice is given to the lot owner, he has the right to construct it himself; but if he does not, then the borough may construct it at his expense, and collect the cost thereof with twenty per cent additional. Now, the ordinance fixes that thirty days’ notice is to be given, and the work must be done within thirty days, or within a month. He had that notice on the seventh of August; the work was not done, and it seems a contract was let by the borough authorities to Mr. Walters and others, or parties with Mr. Walters, to build this board walk at thirty cents a foot. Mr. Maple, in Ms testimony, says that he was waiting for them to inform him of the precise place in which they wanted the board walk built, and was ready to build it. He does not complain of any want of notice. He says he then saw these parties grading there and saw how it was to be done. He claims that he went to those that were doing the work, inquired, and found that they had a contract with the borough to do it at thirty cents a foot, and that that was more than it would have cost him to do it himself, he having some special facilities for such work; and that he, seeing the street commissioner, who was superintending the work of locating the board walk, told the contractors, in his presence, that as they had the materials there they could go on and do it; that it was a little more than it would have cost him, but, substantially, that he would pay them for it; in other words, that he made a contract with them to do the work for him and not for the borough.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b356-5" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[247,2151,1167,250]],["BL_357.1",357,[184,352,1175,402]]]'>Now, we say to you that if he went to the street committee and demanded directions as to where he should put the board walk down, whether to cut down the grade or build it substantially on the surface by leveling it off, as according to his testimony was actually done there, if he did that and they neglected <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>to give him the information and were holding him back with any promise to give it to him, then the thirty days would not run against him, and he still had the right to put down the board walk himself at his own expense, and could make a contract with Mr. Walters or anybody else to do it. If he contracted with Mr. Walters, independent of the borough contract, and it was built under that contract, then he owed Mr. Walters for the work, not the borough, and it cannot recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-5" data-blocks='[["BL_357.4",357,[185,763,1174,1120]]]'>According to Mr. Maple’s testimony, which is the most satisfactory we have on that, the street is cut on the hillside and is not graded out nearly to the full width of 50 feet, the board walk being above the grade of the traveled roadway, and at the side, which is simply leveled off so that the walk may be laid on it properly. [Now, if he went there and found that the borough had let the contract, that the grade was simply the leveled surface, and knew that the contractor, Walters, had the contract to lay the board walk for the borough at thirty cents a foot, and he simply said, “ go ahead,” without contracting for himself that they should do it for him at that place, then he is estopped from raising these other questions and is liable to pay. The two men, Walters and Cox, who were present, say that he said nothing about doing it for him; that he knew that the contract was with the borough, but simply said to go ahead with their arrangement. Now, upon the determination of that disputed fact depends, I think, 'the question whether there should be a verdict for the plaintiff or the defendant in this case']17 I do not think that any of these people are intentionally wrong, and it is very unfortunate, in my judgment, that this misunderstanding arose, or that there should be any bad feeling in the matter.</p>

Our present impression is that the owner of the lot has to pay for building out on both sides to the full width, and that that is the rule here, but it is by no means certain under the peculiar wording of the ordinance. We will ask you to find that fact, that it includes 7 feet out from the property line, and find a verdict for the full amount.

Sidewalks being necessary to the use of the lot, are not governed by the rules applicable to the roadway of the street.

    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[264,686,1174,805]]]'>Smith v. Kingston Bor., <a href="/pa/120/0357-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="120 Pa. 357" data-case-ids="559974" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0357-01">120 Pa. 357</a>, squarely decides, under the general borough act of April 3, 1851, P. L. 320, that upon the failure of a property owner to repair his sidewalk, after notice to do so, the borough may repair it and file a lien against the owner for the cost thereof, with 20 per centum additional as a penalty. This is precisely what was done in this case; and, although a large number of errors were assigned to the proceedings below, we fail to see merit in any of them. The discussion of the foot-front rule is out of place, as that was adopted merely as a means of ascertaining the cost of the improvement to each lot. Nor is it any.objection that separate liens were filed against each lot of the block. The defendant has cut his property up, and plotted it as town lots. The court below might have consolidated the suits to save costs, but the same object was accomplished by the arrangement that one suit should be the test of all.</p>
