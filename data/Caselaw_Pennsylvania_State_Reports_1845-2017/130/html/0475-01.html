Good, 11 S. &amp; R. 247, Judge Gibson says: “ Originally, I apprehend, fees were strictly demandable the instant at which the services were rendered, but an uninterrupted course of indulgence at length ripened into a custom which has received the sanction of judicial decision, that the party for whose benefit they were rendered should not be <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>called upon to pay them till after the determination of the cause.” In the case referred to, Lyon v. McManus, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Binn.%20167" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Binn. 167">4 Binn. 167</a>, Judge Tilghman says: “ Fees are given to the prothonotary by act of assembly, but the act does not say at what time these fees shall be payable.” The intimation is that if the act had prescribed the time of payment it would have been conclusive of this right; and in the absence of such provision he holds that it must be governed by custom, which fixed the time of payment at the end of the suit, which Judge Yeates says is “ in case they could not be procured from the defendant, as in an action marked ‘ not to be brought forward,’ when it was not brought upon the docket again in the course of a year, or when judgment had been obtained against a defendant who had been discharged under the acts of insolvency.” In the subsequent case of Harris v. Christian, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pa.%20238" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Pa. 238">10 Pa. 238</a>, the court held that the fees of an alderman were earned when the suits were terminated on the rendition of the several judgments.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b495-5" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[214,1228,1176,353]]]'>These cases recognize that the right to fees is statutory as to amount and time of payment. And the right to so regulate them has been exercised by the legislature in the acts prescribing fees, and providing that no officer shall charge for any service other than those expressly provided for: Section 15, act of February 22,1821, 7 Sm.

The defendant claims that such qualification is found in the act of March 22, 1877, P. L. 16 (Pittsb. Dig. 274). The ninth section of the act authorizes the collector to sell personal property after thirty days, and “ the real estate of any owner, where the taxes or water rents remain unpaid for six months,” and directs that he procure a description of the property and “ file liens therefor in the oSice of the prothonotary;” and then provides: “That in all eases of sale for taxes or water rents, the city controller is hereby authorized and directed to bid on the property a sum sufficient to pay the city’s lien for all taxes and water rents due and unpaid under this act, and in case of purchase the property shall be subject to redemption, and in all such cases neither the collector nor the city shall be liable for the payment of the sheriff’s or prothon<a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>otary’s costs, until the claim of the city and'the costs shall be realized out of the real estate so bought in and held for the use of the city.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b496-5" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[256,513,1184,1009]]]'>Counsel for plaintiff contends that this provision is limited to the cases specified in the proviso, to wit, a sale and purchase by the controller. If this were so, it would be absolutely nugatory. As soon as judgment had been obtained the officers could demand payment of their fees before the city had an opportunity to bid in the property, or to ascertain if such course would be necessary because of the want of other bidders. It would thus be within the power of the officers to nullify the provision of the act by compelling payment before it could come into operation. Such effect can be avoided by referring this provision to the entire section, instead of limiting it to the proviso, and holding that “all such cases” apply to all proceedings mentioned. This does no violence to the language and gives full effect to the apparent intention of the legislature. As to the justice of such legislation we have nothing to do, but when properly considered it may be fully justified. Since the act of 1877 it is a question between the city and county, two municipal corporations, both the creatures of the legislature, each serving the public, and each looking to the proper realization of its claims. •</p>

The title is “ An Act in relation to cities of the second class, providing for the levy, collection and disbursement of taxes and water rents.” The collection of taxes is thus distinctly stated and the costs of such collection is certainly pertinent and properly included in that subject. “If the title fairly gives notice of the subject of the act, so as reasonably to lead to an,inquiry into the body of the bill, it is all that is necessary: ” Allegheny County Home’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=77%20Pa.%2080" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="77 Pa. 80">77 Pa. 80</a>.
