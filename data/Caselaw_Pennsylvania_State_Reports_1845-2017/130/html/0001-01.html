Schell, who had become insolvent, and with other evidence the plaintiff rested upon a prima facie case. In defence it was shown that the legal title to the lands in dispute was in Mrs. Schell before the sheriff’s sales, and testimony was introduced establishing, as it was claimed, that Mrs. Schell was possessed of a separate estate; that part of the real estate in dispute was purchased and paid for at the time with her own funds, and that other portions purchased on time were purchased by her solely on the credit of her separate estate, and afterwards paid for out of it, and from savings from the increase of her investments and from the profits of a tinning business in which she had been engaged with her son.</p>

Schell, a separate estate sf^ ficient to purchase this property, and did that estate really purchase it ? If so, it became her property in fact, as it is in law. She had previously obtained a regular deed for these several pieces of land, prior to the sheriff’s sale to Mr. Steckman, and that gave her the legal title. The plaintiff, however, alleges that it was a fraud on the creditors, and therefore she only takes a trust title; that she is trustee for John J. Schell and his creditors. This is the whole pinch of the case, gentlemen. The married woman’s act, passed in 1848, provides that what belonged to a married woman prior to her marriage, or what accrues to her through any other person than her husband, is hers as absolutely after marriage as it would be before marriage, and it is under this clause in the act that she sets up defence here. When she alleges that this property was bought with her own means, and not through means obtained from her husband, the laboring oar is with her; and she must satisfy a jury, by clear and satisfactory testimony, that she had a separate estate, and that that estate went into the purchase of thisj property and purchased it. Now, that is, as we have stated^ question of fact, and it is entirely for the jury.....</p>

It seems that that property culminated in about 1865, as Mr. Schell testifies; that he was at that time, had been for five years previously and five years afterwards, a banker in Somerset and in good circumstances. He stated himself to be worth at that time some $60,000. In that he is borne out to some extent by Judge Baer and by Mr. Colburn, and partially by Mr. Sanner, who testified, upon the other side, that he was apparently in very good circumstances. If he was in such circumstances as these witnesses testify, a gift to the amount of two or three thousand dollars to his wife would be legitimate, would be no fraud, because it is not shown that any creditor of that day was defrauded, or that there was any wrong done to any party.] 7</p>

They rest it upon the fact that the money obtained by her, with its regular increase, constituted a fund sufficient to purchase this property. Now, you have his testimony positively as to this, and we may begin there. No matter what the fluctuations in the property would be, if it was her property it would remain hers, until a gift of it should be made by her to her husband, and the law does not presume a gift of that kind. Then you take the date of 1865, and his wife testifies to the arrangement between her husband and herself, agreeing in the main with his testimony, agreeing as well as witnesses would be supposed to agree after such a lapse of time, and she subject to an infirmity and not in the best capacity for taking care of her own estate. We have their testimony supplemented by that of Ankeny and young Schell, the testimony of both of whom was taken on a commission in a case between these parties. They testify, in corroboration of Mr. Schell and Rose Schell, that these Kansas City bonds were procured in 1865, and procured at the time that Mr. Schell swears they were, and for Mrs. Schell. These bonds, it seems, were obtained at ninety cents on the dollar and bore ten per cent interest. Mrs. Schell testifies that she received payments or dividends on these bonds, without being definite as to the amount. You heard her testimony upon that <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>subject. Taking all this testimony together, does it appear to your minds clear and satisfactory that Mrs. Schell, the defendant here, had this amount of money derived from another source than from her husband; and, if so, did she place it in these properties ? The whole question, gentlemen, depends upon your view of this testimony.</p>

Schell in 1870. If this property was hers and went into the property for which this ejectment is brought, then, gentlemen, it would be her property, whatever else occurred, and no mismanagement or misconduct subsequent to that, no action on the part of her husband, would affect her title, if you are satisfied by clear and satisfactory evidence that she had the^. estate, and that with that estate the land was purchased.</p>

Schell, one of the defendants, and purchased by the plaintiff, who afterwards brought this action of ejectment against Schell and his wife to obtain possession thereof. The interest of Mr. Schell, if any he had, in the land, was, of course, divested by the judicial sale, and, if he alone had been defending in his own right, the plaintiff would have been entitled to a verdict ; but at the time of the sale, and long prior thereto, the legal title was in Mrs. Schell. Her contention was that she had acquired the title in her own right, with her own separate means, and not in fraud of her husband’s creditors. Whether she did so or not was the cardinal question in the case. It was, of course, a question of fact exclusively for the jury; and to them the evidence was fairly submitted, with proper instructions as to its application. Among other things, the learned judge instructed the jury thus: “ Had the defendant Rose B. Schell a separate <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>estate sufficient to purchase this property, and did that estate really purchase it ? If so, it became her property in fact, as it is in law. She had personally obtained a regular deed for these several pieces of land, prior to the sheriff’s sale to Mr. Steckman, and that gave her the legal title. The plaintiff, however, alleges that it was a fraud on the creditors, and therefore she only took a trust title; that she is trustee for John J. Schell and his creditors.....When she alleges that this property was bought with her own means, and not through means obtained from her husband, the laboring oar is on her; and she must satisfy a jury, by clear and satisfactory testimony, that she had a separate estate, and that that separate estate went into the purchase of this property and purchased it.”</p>
