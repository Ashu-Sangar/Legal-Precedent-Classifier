L. 163, provides that, “ the several Courts of Quarter Sessions within the commonwealth shall have power, by and with the concurrence of the grand jury of the county, to incorporate any town or village within their jurisdiction.” The authority thus conferred is limited to the incorporation into boroughs of towns or villages.

This unanimity of sentiment is rarely to be found in a proceeding of this kind, and would indicate that the object meets with general approval by those immediately interested in the application, and who by law are entitled to incorporation. The opposition to the application comes from persons outside of the proposed borough, and their objections are, that the natural and not actual boundaries of the village of Swiss-vale are encroached upon, 'and also that taxable property is withdrawn from the township of Braddock. It is not conclusively shown, as I have said, that the village of Swissvale is invaded, unless it be held that the ravine referred to determines and fixes the boundary line between the two villages. Such a boundary cannot be said to be the boundary of a village, unless the village with its houses, streets and lanes, extends to the ravine ; and in the present instance the owners of land taken for the new borough, on the Swissvale side of the ravine, say that they do not belong to the village of Swissvale, and are not more directly connected with it than they are with the village of Edgewood, with which they ask incorporation. The question of taxes withdrawn from the township of Braddock, we take to be the motive which animates the controversy. If the village and its adjacent territory is entitled to incorporation, this objection will not avail to defeat the grant. We are not able, under the evidence, and the almost unanimous sentiment of the property holders within the territory to be incorporated, in favor of the borough, to refuse the application for the charter.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.6",371,[197,958,1176,961]]]'>3. Because it is not shown that the territory south of the ravine and on account of the taking of which the complaint has arisen, belongs clearly to the territory embraced within the unquestioned limits of either village, that of Swissvale or Edgewood. The landholders within the territory of the new borough, and especially those who own the body of the disputed territory, claim that they are not in any way infringing on either village rights, but that the territory, if not actually within the village limits of Edgewood, is at least immediately adjacent lands, and entirely independent of any other village; that at least the territory taken can be united to one village with as much propriety as the other, and that the village first seeking incorporation, with the assent of the owners of the disputed territory, ought not to be refused the privileges asked, because the township of Braddock or the people outside of the proposed new borough protest on the ground of a withdrawal of taxable property from their control, or, because of any other similar reason, they do not desire the contemplated separation.</p>

It is not necessary, therefore, in the determination of this question, to say more upon this point than that the publication, however informal it may prove, is sufficient in the present instance, for the reason that notice has been actually taken, and all parties desiring to make objection are here in court to be heard.</p>
