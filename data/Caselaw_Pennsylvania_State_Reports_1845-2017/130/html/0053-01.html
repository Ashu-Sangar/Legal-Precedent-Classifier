The work of construction between Mahaffey and <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>Williams’s Run was done during the season of 1887. For the first month after the work of 1887 was commenced, John D. Riley, assistant engineer, was in charge. The chief engineer, John B. Bott, then took personal charge'and supervision. Mc-Cauley commenced the performance of this contract by putting in such masonry as he had constructed in 1886, between Irvona and Mahaffey. When Bott came in charge, however, he refused to accept this grade of work in arch-culvert and bridge masonry, and required such masonry to be constructed in a manner much superior to that of the work of 1886. This requirement was first made in connection with the masonry at Whiskey Run bridge, which was the first arch-culvert work done by McCauley under his second contract. The circumstances in which Bott’s directions respecting it were given were thus stated by the plaintiff, testifying on his own behalf:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[246,1113,1180,1162]]]'>I met Mr. Bott and Mr. John Keller on the train between Irvona and Mahaffey, I coming from Philipsburg, before we laid any stones to the best of my knowledge on that work at all, but there were some of the stones quarried, and they were quarried like the stones of 1886, fully as good; and Mr. Bott called my attention that he would not accept those stones, the bed was too small and the joints were too small; had not half enough square back to the joint and the face of the stone; and I told Mr. Bott that was not my contract; my contract was to do the work the same as in 1886. Mr. Bott said he didn’t know me in the contract at all, anything about my contract with Keller &amp; Bush, but that he was going to have the work done as he saw fit and directed; and then Mr. Keller was in the next seat with him, or probably in the same with Mr. Bott —I don’t know, but he was probably in the next seat if not in the same seat — and I told Mr. Keller, and Mr. Keller and Mr. Bott got into a controversy about the matter and I do not know exactly what they said. We then got out at Mahaffey station, and Mr. Keller told me to go on and finish that bridge according to the direction of Mr. Bott, and that he would see the company about it, and if it was required so, to bring the company on the ground, if there was any better work exacted of me than the work of 1886.</p>

A. I saw Mr. Bott in the meantime; I could see him nearly every once in a while, probably every day if I wanted to, I think, except on Saturdays and the early part of Monday, that he was with his family; and he told me he would not accept any work like the work of 1886 on his line of road — of bridge masonry; would not have it. Then I went and saw Mr. Keller, and brought Mr. Karbaugh with me.</p>

Then before we commenced the Murray Run arch Mr. Karbaugh and I went to see Mr. Keller at Mahaffey, and I suppose were over an hour, probably two hours, in conversation about this work; and then Keller agreed to give me ten dollars a yard for all arch masonry that was required of me to be cut in the manner in which I cut the stones at Whiskey Run bridge. He said above the spring line he would give me ten dollars for arch masonry. If the work was allowed to be put in the same as the work of 1886, that was not expected. It was all cut stone, ashler, that is the term of the word in railroad bridges. And then Mr. Keller looked after his own rights; he did bring the company there.</p>

We dispute the assumption of the defendants that the written contract made the engineer the judge of the class of the work. The words, “ all work to be paid for as estimated by the engineer,” have reference simply to an estimate of the quantity of the work done, made each month, as the work progressed, in order to adjust the amount of the monthly <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>payments. There is nothing to indicate that the estimates were to be taken as final, even on the quantity of work done, when it was completed. Had the parties intended that the engineer should determine the class of the masonry, they would have used apt words for the purpose. But the subsequent agreement to pay value for the work as enhanced by additional labor, cost and expense, would abrogate any provision in the original contract for a classification by the engineer, if such there was in it.</p>

Whether the written contract had been changed, the scope and extent of the new agreement, and the kind, class, character and value of the work done under it, were all questions for the jury, and any testimony giving light on any of them was admissible. The plaintiff was not claiming on a quantum meruit for all the work done by him. He claimed under the written contract for the work done under it before any change was made, and under the subsequent parol agreement for extra compensation, for extra and more expensive work than the written contract required. If the jury found that no specific price was fixed for a portion of the extra work, the instructions of the court as to the mode of arriving at its value cannot be questioned.</p>
    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[250,1486,1190,653]]]'>4. The plaintiff’s receipts, appended to the so called estimates made out by Keller &amp; Bush, are not conclusive on him as to the correctness of the classification or as to the amounts due him. In a long line of cases, commencing with Hamilton v. McGuire, 3 S. &amp; R. 355, it has been settled that a receipt is mere matter in pais which estops nobody. It is like any other •parol admission by the party, open to contradiction, explanation or correction: Russell v.

It is erroneous to assume, as the defendants’ third point did, that the engineer had in fact, without fraud, passed upon the class of the plaintiff’s work.

It is equally clear that the work was to be done “ as directed by the chief engineer ” of the company, and that “ the work was to be paid as estimated by the engineer in charge during the month, payments to be made according to that estimate about the 20th of the succeeding month, less ten per cent,” etc. Under the written contract, therefore, the engineer was the arbiter of the kind of work to be done, as well as of the class to which it belonged, and his decision determined the compensation which the plaintiff was entitled to receive under his contract. It turned out, however, that at certain points on the line masonry of a higher class and grade was required by the engineer than was contemplated by the parties, and the contract fixed no price for this higher grade of work. It is alleged on the part of the plaintiff that when this exigency arose the defendants instructed the plaintiff that the work should be done “ as directed by the engineer,” and that they would pay the plaintiff what it was reasonably worth; that the work required for arch masonry was of a superior quality and workmanship, and that the whole work as completed under the requirements of the engineer was of a better-quality than that between Irvona and Mahaffey, which was mentioned in the contract as descriptive, in a general way, of the kind of work to be done; and this suit is brought, not only to recover for “ extra ” work, that is to say, for what the work done was worth more than was stipulated in the contract, but also for the balance remaining upon the work done under the special contract.</p>

The rule that extrinsic evidence is not admissible to contradict or alter the written instrument is not thereby infringed: 1 Greenl. Ev., § 308; Malone v. Dougherty, <a href="/citations/?q=79%20Pa.%2053" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="79 Pa. 53">79 Pa. </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=79%20Pa.%2053" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="79 Pa. 53">53</a>; </em>Collins v.

But, in such cases, the special contract will be pursued as far as it can be traced in the intention of the parties. <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>The deviation, except where otherwise expressed or mutually understood, must be taken in its proper connection with the original contract, with reference to and in modification of which it was made. The theory of the plaintiff’s case is that, according to the doctrine established in Vicary v. Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20457" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 W. 457">2 W. 457</a>; Spangler v.

It is plain, then, that the sealed instrument must be supposed to contain the agreement of the parties to the full extent that it has not been modified by the subsequent parol contract, and that both taken together (the former being subject to the latter) state the agreement of the parties. If there had been no provision for estimates, etc., the plaintiff would, without doubt, have been entitled to recover upon a quantum meruit whatever he could show the work was worth; but all the work was to be done as directed by the engineer, and was to be paid for as estimated by the engineer in charge during the month.</p>
    <p id="b88-5" data-blocks='[["BL_88.4",88,[257,1591,1184,868]],["BL_89.1",89,[209,378,1183,664]]]'>The work covered by the parol agreement was the same work which was embraced in the special contract. It is alleged simply that it was to be performed in a different way if the engineer required it to be so done, and if the estimate of the“ engineer was not to determine its nature and extent it would doubtless have been so stated. The masonry was to be the same as masonry on the same line between Irvona and Mahaffey, but it was to be paid for as estimated by the engineer in charge during the month. If the work, under the requirements of the engineer, was of a higher class, it was for the engineer to determine and designate the class of work to which it belonged,, according to the usual and customary methods in railroad construction. It is not to be supposed the parties intended that the engineer, in making his estimates from time to time, was to compare in detail the work of 1887 with that of 1886, and that the compensation was to be rated accordingly. The contract provides the price to be paid for second-class work, the nature <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>and characteristics of which were presumably known to the engineer; and this of itself indicates that the work was to be estimated according to a certain classification recognized in the business, and was to be compensated' accordingly. Upon that basis of calculation the defendant would be held for the difference between the value of the work required and the sum stipulated in the contract. If the parties fixed any price for the work which was required to be done in a superior manner, that price would govern in the calculation of the amount; if not, the value of this class of work could be otherwise readily shown. But the kind and classification of work was for the engineer, and his estimates, monthly and final, were conclusive upon both parties.</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[207,1051,1185,1382]],["BL_90.1",90,[231,363,1181,392]]]'>Although the character of the work to be performed is described, in a general way, as the same as the masonry between Irvona and Mahaffey, yet it was to be done “ as directed by the engineer of the company,” and in a good and workmanlike manner. Although, as between the contracting parties themselves, the work would be satisfactory if it was the same as the masonry between Irvona and Mahaffey, yet it was required to be done as directed by the engineer. McCauley entered into this contract with notice of the duties and powers of the company’s engineer. He took his chances with the engineer, and was to receive pay as for second-class work. It is conceded that the masonry between Irvona and Mahaffey was second-class work of an inferior quality; but this work, although of the same class, was to be performed in a good and workmanlike manner, as directed by the engineer. First-class work was not contemplated, but, when work of that class was afterwards required, the parties appear to have provided for it in a subsequent parol agreement. How much of this first-class work the engineer directed to be done, and how much was actually performed in pursuance of his direction, was for the engineer to estimate; and his certificate, fairly made, without fraud, was, by the terms of the contract, binding upon the parties. We are of opinion, therefore, that the court erred in throwing this inquiry open to the opinion and estimate of those who casually observed the work, the parties having designated a person for this purpose, a person whose classification of the work and measurement of the amount were necessarily binding in the computation <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>of the plaintiff’s claim. That the parties so understood their contract is shown by the fact that monthly settlements were made upon the estimate of the engineer, and the work was paid for and receipts taken in accordance therewith. The estimates, it is true, were in some instances modified and changed, but the classification and measurement of the engineer constituted the general basis upon which these settlements were made.</p>
