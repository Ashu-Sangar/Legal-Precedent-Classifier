The language of the lease is, “ a failure to perform or a breach of the said covenants shall work an absolute forfeiture of this grant or lease, and the privileges or easements hereby given shall absolutely cease, determine and become null and void.” There was a breach on December 1, 1887, and at that date the lease “ absolutely ceased, determined and became null and void.” The defendant company has paid and there has been collected from them, all rent “ due ” and payable at and immediately before such <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>breach, and they abandoned and surrendered the lease and have not been in possession of the leasehold since they forfeited their rights and interest therein.

The proviso in the lease, that no forfeiture shall prevent the collection of any sum due at the time a forfeiture is incurred, may be claimed to be against the plaintiff, but we take it that the proviso was intended to operate only when a forfeiture is declared by the lessor. Moreover, no forfeiture having occurred before the time fixed for the completion of the first well, the plaintiff is entitled to judgment under the proviso we have referred to, even if a forfeiture did afterwards occur. Upon failure to complete the well within the specified <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>time, the lessee, by the terms of the lease, became liable to pay the whole of the first year’s rent, the third and fourth quarters of which are embraced in this action. The whole year’s rent at once became debitum .in praesenti, though solvendum in futuro, in instalments. Whether the stipulation in the lease be regarded as a penalty, as a .condition precedent, or as a continuous and continuing contract, is immaterial, for in either aspect the obligation to pay $1,000 in quarterly instalments, became fixed beyond recall by the lessee’s default.</p>

    <p id="b245-6" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[230,948,1171,752]]]'>1. The covenant in this lease providing for a forfeiture is mutual. It contemplates an absolute ending and termination of the lease. It provides that “ it is understood and agreed ” that a breach shall work an “ absolute forfeiture ” and the easement shall then “ absolutely cease, determine and become null and void.” It is not left optional with the lessor to declare the forfeiture. That is to be absolute, though it is not to prevent the collection of all rentals to that date. This construction leaves the lessor free to lease to somebody else, and compensates him for the time the lease was held. Any other might require a lessee to operate worthless territory, or, as an alternative, pay rental, at the option of the lessor, until the end of the term specified in the lease. This would be inconsistent with and contradictory of the express provision for collection of the rental due at the time of forfeiture.</p>

Kellerman, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20Pa.%20492" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="123 Pa. 492">123 Pa. 492</a>, the forfeiture clause is not like the one in the present case, and the suit was only for rental due at the time of the forfeiture. The decision, therefore, is not applicable as an authority. None of the other cases cited for the plaintiff can affect this case. It is sui generis. The claim that rent for the entire year accrued at the, time of the failure to complete the well, is not supported by the language of the lease. It does not say that the $1,000 shall be paid annually in advance, but before the sentence is complete provides for its payment quarterly. The defendant could not owe any of the money here sued for at the time of the forfeiture, nor for three months thereafter. “ Due ” and “ owing ” are synonymous terms: Roberts v. Beatty, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pen.%20%26%20W.%2067" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 67">2 P. &amp; W. 67</a>.

This was manifestly intended to be applied as a spur to the operator and to compel the development which was the object of the lease. Anticipating, however, that the defendant might not only fail to put down a well, but through insolvency or otherwise, might become unable to pay the money, the plaintiff provided in the contract, upon 'the failure of the companjr to keep their covenants, for a forfeiture of the lease, which would enable him in that event to put an end to the lessee’s pretensions, and give him an opportunity to seek other means of development. It was certainly not in contemplation of the parties that the defendant might set up its own default as a cause for cancellation; if this is so, this contract, drawn with exceptional care for the protection of the lessor, is a mere rope of sand; its obligations could only “ keep the word of promise to the ear to break it to the hope.” It was the duty of the lessee to develop the territory by putting down a test well according to the stipulations of its contract; failing to do so, and failing also to pay the money as agreed upon, the plaintiff had an undoubted right to declare a forfeiture, but the lessee had no such right.</p>
    <p id="b248-5" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[307,1537,1169,847]]]'>But, although the lessor had this right, he was not, we think, under the present state of the law, bound to exercise it. The clause of forfeiture having been inserted wholly in his interest and for his protection, it was competent for him to dispense with its provisions and to affirm the continuance of the contract. His right was optional or elective; and when default was made by the defendant on both alternatives, the plaintiff might either forfeit the contract or affirm its continuance, as he chose. The English authorities recognize the rule that “ even in the case of a lease for years, when the direction is that it shall become void on breach of the condition, it will only be void at the option of the lessor; the lessee shall not take advantage of his own wrongful performance of the contract in order to destroy the <em>lease, </em>which had perhaps turned out a disadvantageous one: ” 1 Smith’s L. C., 89, citing Doe v. Bancks, 4 B. &amp; A. 401; Rede v. Farr, 6 M. &amp; S. 121; Arnsby v. Woodward, 6 B. <em>&amp; C. 519, </em>and other cases.</p>

Bancks, 4 B. <em>&amp; </em>A. 401, the lease was for mining <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>purposes, and contained a proviso in substance as follows: “ Provided also, and it is mutually agreed, etc., that tbe aforesaid works shall commence and begin within one year from tbe date hereof, and if tbe same shall stop or cease working at any time for two years, this lease shall be deemed void to all intents and purposes.” Best, J., said: “ In construing this clause of tbe lease we must look to the object tbe parties bad in view. Tbe rent was to depend upon tbe number of tons of coal raised. In order to derive any benefit from tbe mine, it was tbe object of tbe landlord, by introducing this clause, to compel the tenant to work it. Tbe clause therefore was introduced solely for the benefit of the landlord, to enable him in case of a cesser to work to take tbe possession of tbe mines, and either to work them himself or let them to some other tenant. That, therefore, being tbe object of tbe parties in introducing tbe clause, I think it will be fully answered by holding the lease to be void at the option of tbe landlord. Besides, I take it to be a universal principle of law and justice that no man can take advantage of bis own wrong.”</p>

It was held that in the former case tbe lease became absolutely void on tbe event named, and was incapable of being restored by acceptance of rent or other act of intended confirmation; whilst in’ tbe latter, some act, such as entry or claim, must have been performed by tbe lessor, to manifest bis intention to end tbe demise, which was voidable in tbe interval and consequently confirmable. Tbe force of this distinction, it is said, in Taylor on L. &amp; T., § 492, has been almost, if not quite, abated by tbe modern decisions, which establish that tbe effect of a condition malting a lease void, upon a certain event, is to make it void at tbe option of tbe lessor only, in cases where tbe condition is intended for luis benefit, and be actually avails himself of bis privilege. To tbe same effect is 2 Platt on Leases, 327. But it is entirely optional with tbe lessor whether be will avail himself of this right or not, although by tbe terms-of tbe proviso tbe term is to cease or become void for tbe non-performance of tbe covenant; and if tbe lessor does not avail himself of it tbe term will continue, for the lessee cannot elect that it shall cease or be void: Tay<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>lor on L. &amp; T., supra.

    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[219,570,1179,803]]]'>The English law in this respect has been generally followed in this country, and such a lease is held to be good until avoided; though the lessee is estopped to set it up against the lessor. A lessee cannot avail himself of his own act to vacate a lease, on the principle that no man shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong: Wood’s L. &amp; T., 1204. So, Mr. Parsons in his Law of Contracts, vol. 1, page 507, referring to the distinction formerly recognized between the effect of a proviso declaring that the lease shall be void on a specified event, and a proviso enabling the lessor to determine it by re-entry, says : “ This distinction is now exploded, and it is held that the lease is voidable only at the election of the lessor, but not of the lessee, though the proviso expressly declare that it shall be void.” To the same effect are the cases of Clark v. Jones, <a href="/denio/1/0516-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Denio 516" data-case-ids="484113" data-case-paths="/denio/1/0516-01">1 Den. 516</a>, and Phillips v.

Smick, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 41" data-case-ids="481810" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0041-01">7 W. &amp; S. 41</a>. In the case cited, there was a lease of land upon condition that the rent should be paid upon certain specified dates, and if a certain default was made for three months, neglect to pay after ten days’ notice should render the lease null and void. The default occurred, and notice was given, and it was held that after ten days the lease was ipso facto void, without re-entry, and could not afterwards be affirmed, or continued. In Sheaffer v. Sheaffer, <a href="/pa/37/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="37 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="418875" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0525-01">37 Pa. 525</a>, the doctrine announced by Justice Sergeant, in Kenrick v.

Smick, and it is admitted that the rule of the English courts is followed in most of the states of the Union. In Davis v. Moss, <a href="/pa/38/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="38 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="994059" data-case-paths="/pa/38/0346-01">38 Pa. 346</a>, the rule of the previous cases is again apparently recognized, but its rigor is relaxed in this, that the forfeiture is said to depend upon the terms of the in<a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>strument, “ unless there be evidence to affect the landlord with a waiver of the breach, like the receipt of rent or other equally unequivocal act.”</p>

We do not understand that in either case a re-entry is required to complete the forfeiture. This almost amounts to a distinction without a difference. In practice, the prima facies being different, it merely shifts the burden of proof from one party to the other.</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.5",251,[222,1089,1171,545]]]'>It will be observed, moreover, that the Pennsylvania cases already referred to are all cases in which the forfeiture was set up by the lessor upon the default of the lessee; in none of them did the lessee set up his own default as a cause of forfeiture. No case has been called to our attention, in this or any other state, in England or elsewhere, which recognizes the doctrine that a party may take advantage of his own wrong, or set up his own default to work a forfeiture of his own contract. Persons may, of course, contract in this form and to this effect, if they choose, but we do not understand the parties to this contract to have so intended.</p>

In that case the lessees in an oil lease covenanted to commence operations within sixty days and to complete one well within three months thereafter, and, in case of failure, to pay the lessor for such delay $1,000 per annum within a certain period; it was further agreed that a failure to complete one well, or to make such payment within that period, should render the lease “ null and void,” so as “to remain without effect between the parties.” In a proceeding by the lessor, on failure of the lessee to put down the well, to recover the $1,000, or a proportional part thereof, covering the period during which he had been deprived of his property, the counsel for the defendant submitted a point for instruction to the jury as follows:</p>
    <p id="b251-8" data-blocks='[["BL_251.7",251,[265,2369,1122,44]],["BL_252.1",252,[244,363,1169,196]]]'>“ That there can be no recovery in this case because at the <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>time of bringing tbis suit the contract or lease sued on was null and void and not in existence; that the non-payment of the rent claimed in this case, instantly, upon its non-payment, and ipso facto, rendered the lease null and void.”</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[241,569,1172,1318]]]'>The point was refused, and in this court the refusal was assigned for error. The opinion of this court was delivered by our brother Williams, who, in disposing of this branch of the case, distinguished the rights of the lessees from the rights of the lessors, as follows: “ But the acts that forfeited their (the lessees’) rights did not also forfeit those of the lessor. Their liabilities growing out of their non-performance are to be distinguished from their rights under the contract. The latter they could forfeit, but the former belonged to the lessor and could be lost only by his act. The lessees promised to complete one well within a given time. This was for the benefit of the lessor. If this was not done he was to be compensated in money. If the money was not paid he was at liberty to rid himself of his tenants and resume the possession of his land. But the construction contended for by the plaintiffs In error transfers the punishment for the breach of the contract from him on whose default it arises to the innocent injured party. Because the lessees have secured the control of the land of the lessor by covenants which they have broken, the lessor shall be deprived of all redress at law, by the very acts of his lessees which give him a cause of action. Their default takes away his remedy. The acts or omissions of which he complains are an answer to his complaint. We should need the constraint of insurmountable necessity to induce us to adopt the construction contended for.” The ruling of the court below was approved and the judgment affirmed.</p>
