Darrah avers that, “in answer to his objection to the restriction in his deed, he (M. C.

Ross Stevenson. The mansion house, or Hamilton lot, was included in the plot just the same as any other lot, and the judge told me that he had offered it for sale. Both the wells back by Hamilton’s house are on the addition, as it was when shown to me, and are a violation of the representations on which they got me to accept the restriction.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[221,1081,1180,1276]]]'>From these affidavits the defendants claim, as we have already said, that when the ■ plaintiff put the lots in Acheson’s Addition in the market, he made it a general condition in the sale thereof that no wells would or should be drilled on the lots in the addition for oil or gas, the object being to secure a building site that would attract those who preferred a residence in <em>“ </em>a quiet rural retreat,” rather than the ownership of a lot where they and their neighbors could engage in the business of drilling oil-wells; in other words, that he dedicated and disposed of these lots solely for building purposes, and that he has violated this general agreement made with the purchasers of those lots by drilling two wells on the Hamilton lot, which is in the addition, and by drilling a well on the Gibson &amp; Giles lot which is in the immediate neighborhood; that he has done the thing, the effect of doing which has destroyed those very advantages which the clause of restriction was intended to maintain, and now seeks to use this restriction to protect him in doing that which he agreed'not to do. It is unnecessary at this stage of this proceeding to decide that the evidence produced by the defendants is sufficient in law to sustain this claim set up by them. It is certainly sufficient to raise a dispute, to make the plaintiff’s equity questionable; and, under such circumstances, an injunction ought not to be granted until the parties can be heard before a master. We need hardly to cite authorities to sustain this position.</p>

A man who comes to the court, to restrain the breach of a covenant or contract, must be able to show that he comes with clean hands..... He cannot have relief unless it appear that he has actually carried out, as far as in him lies, his own part of the agreement..... A covenantor.....whose own acts have been inconsistent with the covenant.....cannot come to a court of equity to have the covenant or contract enforced. Thus; where the leases of an estate contained covenants to build on a uniform plan, and the landlord let loose some of his tenants from the obligations of the covenant, the court would not interfere to prevent a similar infringement by other tenants.' Nor would the court restrain the erection of buildings contrary to a covenant, where the plaintiff had himself erected buildings, the effect of which was to destroy those very advantages which the covenant was intended to maintain. Nor will the court enforce a restrictive covenant by injunction, on the application of a man who has wilfully allowed it to be broken by other persons who were bound to the same restrictive covenants.”</p>

The oil that the defendants may mine will go into the pipe-lines, and an account thereof will be kept by a third disinterested party. While, on the other hand, the granting of a preliminary injunction, should the plaintiff’s bill be dismissed on final hearing, might irreparably injure the defendants, as there is no means of estimating how much of their oil in the meantime may have been taken out through the plaintiff’s neighboring wells. “ An injunction will not be <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>granted where it will be productive of greater injury than a refusal of it, and the damages are susceptible of compensation at law: ” Richards’s App., <a href="/pa/57/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="57 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="1010471" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0105-01">57 Pa. 105</a> ; Harlrinson’s App., <a href="/pa/78/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="78 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1040340" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0196-01">78 Pa. 196</a>.</p>

On September 24th, an amended bill was filed by leave of the court below, and on September 25th, the plaintiff, upon his amended bill, the affidavits already filed, and additional affidavits then presented, renewed his motion for a preliminary injunction, and prayed that a time be fixed for the hearing thereof. The same day, the court below overruled the motion 'and refused the hearing prayed for, until the appeal already in the Supreme Court was disposed of by that court. Thereupon the pi aintiff took an appeal to No. 245 October Term 1889, Sup. Ct., assigning the overruling of his motion for error. On October 28, 1889, the defendants filed in the Supreme Court a motion to quash this second appeal upon the grounds, (1) that the record showed no decree by the court below from which an appeal lay; (2) that the record showed no certificate by the judge of the court below such as is required by § 2, act of June 12, 1879, P. L. 177. On October 24th, after argument, the appeal was quashed; Mr. Justice Mitchell, dissenting.</p>
