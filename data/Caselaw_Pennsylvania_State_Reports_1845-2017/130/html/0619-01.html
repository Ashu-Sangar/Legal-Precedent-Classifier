Thereupon Rugh placed in Judge White’s hands the sum of $700, to be used in buying up the claims of the creditors who refused to assent to the proposed arrangement.

It was used as directed, claims being purchased at from 85 to 50 per cent of their face, and assigned to Judge White, who held them for the use of Rugh, all of this being done without the knowledge of the defendant.

It recited the entry of the judgments and the issue of executions in favor of the parties of the second part, the levies upon the personal property thereunder, and the endeavor of the defendant to effect a compromise with his subsequent judgment creditors and others having claims, by delivering to them, or to some person in trust for them, said personal property in full satisfaction of their debts; and provided that Simeon Truby should give to the parties of the second part preference of lien upon the defendant’s real estate over his own judgment, and that the parties of the second part should stay their writs and release the personal property from their levies, upon the conclusion of a settlement between the defendant and his subsequent creditors as aforesaid.

Judge White testified that thereupon he paid to their attorney $35, which was about seventy per cent of their judgment, and took an assignment of the judgment to himself; that he made this payment out of his own money, and purchased the claim of his own motion, and without any authority from or consultation with the defendant, simply because the witness preferred not to be bothered with a law suit over such a small sum.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.3",643,[192,374,1168,797]]]'>
      <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>Now, gentlemen of the jury, the evidence upon this subject is this, that there were a number of. creditors in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, probably from five to eight in number, who declined to sign this paper. This arrangement, it was thought, could not be effected without their consent. Thereupon, these claims, as .testified to by Judge White, were purchased for Mr. Hugh, and the assignments taken to Judge White, he paying therefor a considerably larger amount of money than the creditors would otherwise have gotten if they had signed this paper and shared along with the others. The evidence would indicate that the creditors who thus stood out and refused to sign, received about fifty per cent of their claims. The evidence is that this was done without the knowledge of Mr. Truby; he was not consulted about it; it was not his money; no part of this fund was taken away from these creditors in any shape or form.....</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b643-5" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[189,1191,1169,1062]]]'>Now this brings up the question as to whether or not such an arrangement can be made in law, whether it is valid. We have been referred to cases, here, in which it has been decided that all the creditors, where there is a stipulation of this kind, must sign, and that if one creditor receives, more than the stipulated amount, that the balance are discharged; that is, that they may take what they can get out of the composition, and then may sue for the balance of the claim. Their part of the contract by which they had agreed to release the debtor is not binding upon them under such circumstances. Now, gentlemen of the jury, that is true, in a composition deed such as those cases refer to, where the parties agree to pay a stipulated sum of money; and we would have no difficulty in this case whatever, if this were just exactly that kind of a case. But the distinction here is that there was no agreement that any specified sum of money should be paid the creditors who signed this paper. The only agreement was that certain property should be turned oyer to Mr. Kimmell, or some other person to be chosen by the majority of the creditors, who should dispose of it for their use, and, upon the payment to them of the proceeds, they were to release Mr. Truby from further liability.</p>

And therefore, it appearing undisputed that Judge White for Mr. Hugh, and Mr. Hugh himself, has assented to the property being disposed of in this way, and the other creditors having released their liens upon it, and Mr. Simeon Truby having released or preferred those creditors over him in any distribution of the real estate, William Truby’s property, we think this arrangement is such that it ought to be carried out.] 3</p>

Four of them were called, or three, and testified that they had furnished materials to Mr. Truby in the erection and construction of some building or other, and they have entered, and had entered, mechanics’ liens against the building for their claims. By that act, they declared that they had furnished those materials on the credit of the building, and not . on the personal credit of William Truby; and after a careful examination of these papers, I am fully persuaded that, so far as those creditors are concerned, they were not required to sign this paper, or either of them. Their claim is what is known in law as a claim in rem. It was a claim against the building, and was not a personal claim against William Truby, and, if that building did not pay that claim, that was the end of it. There was no personal liability further by Mr. Truby, and, therefore, it was not necessary that these persons should sign this paper, or assent to it even.] 4</p>

You will remember the testimony of Judge White and the testimony of William Truby, William Truby particularly.

The Indiana Deposit Bank had a judgment against William Truby, and, in order to perfect this arrangement, they <a id="p627" href="#p627" data-label="627" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*627</a>along with the persons named in the Philadelphia agreement, stayed their writs and executed this agreement by which this property was released and turned over to Mr. Kimmell, so that the proceeds of it could be applied to the persons who had already signed those papers or assented to them. Well now, gentlemen of the jury, that, in my judgment, is a sufficient answer to the allegation that they were bound to sign this paper. Without their consent and without their signing that paper and thereby releasing their levy on this personal property, for they were otherwise secured, this arrangement could not have been perfected, and these creditors could not, so far as the evidence in this case shows, have obtained anything.] 5</p>

The paper stated what creditors were not to sign, and provided that if all others did not do so it should be void. The Indiana Deposit Bank *and Miller Brothers were not among those thus excepted, and it was error to charge that, because they were sufficiently secured, it' was unnecessary for them to sign. The instructions respecting the mechanics’ liens are too manifestly erroneous to need any discussion.</p>

The purchase of claims as shown by the testimony, or the paying them off at from 40 to 70 per cent, when their holders could not be induced to sign the composition paper, was a fraud upon those who did sign, and avoided the contract. If Artman &amp; Co. had known that on their refusing to sign, their claim would have been bought up at from 50 to 70 per cent, they would not have given their signature and taken the risk <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>of receiving only 12 per cent as offered. If the contract was void from this or any other cause, it could be ratified only upon a new consideration: Stuart v.

The court was clearly in error in directing a verdict for the defendant. There were questions upon which, if the court were not satisfied to give binding instructions for the plaintiffs, the case should have gone to the pry-</p>

    <p id="b647-7" data-blocks='[["BL_647.5",647,[191,946,1175,608]]]'>1. Was the agreement signed or assented to by all the creditors concerned in it, within the meaning of the contract and the law controlling it ? The agreement designates the creditors coming within its scope as those who “ have little prospect of realizing anything ” and “ no prospect of collecting their claims by a sheriff’s sale.” No creditor would likely mistake its purpose ; it would not occur to him that one having a lien that was certain to bring him payment in full, would be expected to abandon it and release the entire debt, in return for an agreement which on its face only promised him “ something.” Upon this question of construction we refer to Wells v. Greenhill, 5 B. &amp; Ald. 869 (7 E. C. L. R. 472).</p>

If the purchases of claims made by Rugh were not illegal, the agreement is not void by reason of his not having signed as the holder of those claims, for lie distinctly assented to its terms, and afterwards waived his right to participate in the fund. A formal signing of such an agreement is not essential. It is binding on the creditor if he assents to it, and especially if he accepts money under it: Jolly v. Wallis, 8 Esp. 228; Ex parte Sadler, 15 Ves. 52; Fellows v. Stewart, <a href="/wend/24/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="24 Wend. 294" data-case-ids="2155237" data-case-paths="/wend/24/0294-01">24 Wend. 294</a>. When he waived his right to the money for reasons that recognized the obligation of the contract upon him, this was equivalent to an acceptance of the money.</p>

We do not question the authorities cited by the plaintiffs, respecting secret preferences extended to a few creditors as an inducement to sign, but they do not meet this case. Rugh induced nobody to sign; much less did the defendant. The accounts purchased by Rugh were certainly the subject of sale. He bought them fairly, with his own money, and without the <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>defendant’s knowledge. The defendant was under no obligation to reimburse him. The facts being undisputed, the question of the legality of the purchase was for the court, and it did not vitiate the composition: Babcock v. Dill, <a href="/barb/43/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="43 Barb. 577" data-case-ids="5124341" data-case-paths="/barb/43/0577-01">43 Barb. 577</a>. Smith, Seltzer &amp; Co. signed the agreement unconditionally. In settling with them out of his own money and without the defendant’s knowledge, Judge White was merely buying exemption from an unfounded law suit.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[280,788,1176,655]]]'>4. Even if the contract was not strictly followed as to procuring the signatures of all^ creditors interested in it, the plaintiffs should be estopped, at this late stage of the proceedings', from questioning its validity. What is called the composition paper is not the ordinary form of composition. The creditors secured by executions abandoned that security in favor of those who otherwise would have gotten nothing, and, in compensation, Simeon Truby gave the execution creditors priority of lien on the real estate. The original rights of the secured creditors are now gone and cannot be restored. The plaintiffs expressed no dissent till months afterward, when Kimmell, as the agent of themselves and others, had sold the property and partly distributed its proceeds.</p>

C. Rugh &amp; Bro., and C. Rugh, who are first judgment creditors of the said William Truby, and are not to participate in the proceeds of the property above assigned, and the Farmers Bank, which <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>has collateral security for its judgment, unite in and sign this agreement.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.4",649,[216,470,1184,921]]]'>The agreement was signed by the plaintiffs, but it was not signed by all the creditors who, by its terms, were required to sign it, to make it binding upon the creditors who did sign it. Some of the creditors who refused to sign it were paid 50 per cent of their claims; others were paid in full, or secured, and Smith, Seltzer &amp; Co., who did sign it, were paid 70 per cent, while the proceeds of the assigned property pay a dividend of 12 per cent. It is claimed that these payments were made by Judge White with his own money, or money furnished by J. C. Rugh, a brother-in-law of the defendant, and without the defendant’s knowledge; that the parties who furnished the money make no demand upon the defendant, and that he is under no legal obligation to reimburse- them; and that the plaintiffs cannot complain of these payments, because they are not prejudiced, but are benefited, by them. It is further claimed that it was not the intention or understanding of the parties to the agreement, that the creditors who were secured by judgment, mechanics’ liens or collateral, should sign it.</p>
    <p id="b649-6" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[223,1400,1179,814]]]'>The learned judge adopted these views, and directed a verdict for the defendant. In this, we think, he erred. The true inquiry was whether the plaintiffs were bound to accept the dividend under the assignment, in discharge and satisfaction of their judgment. Their undertaking was in writing, and on condition that all the creditors except six “first judgment creditors,” who were named, should sign the agreement. There was no ambiguity in the written instrument, and there was no claim or evidence of fraud or mistake on which to modify or reform it. We must therefore accept and construe it as it is written. We can enforce contracts as parties make them, but we cannot make contracts for them. If it could be demonstrated that the plaintiffs would receive a larger dividend under the assignment, by reason of the payments made as claimed, it would not defeat their right to insist on the condition on which they consented to be bound.</p>
