Sweeney against the Ten Mile Oil &amp; Gas Company, and the suit grows out of a written contract that was executed by the plaintiff and the defendant company. A material part of that contract reads as follows : “ Proposition for the sale of the property and franchises of the Ten Mile Oil &amp; Gas Company: First, the plant, including the franchises and all the territory of our company to be sold to, or by, John F. Sweeney, of Wheeling, West Va., at and for the sum of thirty thousand dollars cash ; and if sold to or by him within sixty days after this date, Mr. Sweeney is to have two thousand dollars for negotiating the sale.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.6",214,[266,1027,1180,1327]]]'>It is admitted on both sides that a slight modification of this contract was afterwards made, allowing the sale to be made, in place of for $30,000, for $10,000 cash, and the balance to be secured by <em>notes; </em>and with this modification, the contract stands as I have read it. The interpretation of this contract, so far as I have read it, and so far as it is written, is for the court, and the important words in the contract to be interpreted are the words “sale” and the words “if sold.” We instruct you that this contract means that there was to be an actual sale. - And the word “ sale,” as defined by Story, is, “ The transfer of the absolute title to property for a certain agreed price.” It is a contract between two parties, one of whom clearly parts with the property in the thing sold, and the other parts with a valuable consideration. [There was no actual sale, as we understand the evidence in the case before the court, but it is claimed there was a contract to sell, which the defendants failed to carry out.] 3 You will see, gentlemen, there is a difference between the word sale and a contract to sell. And we instruct you, that the word employed here by these parties contemplated an actual sale. [The first question then arises: Did Mr. Sweeney, who had an option on this plant, make, as far as he was concerned, an actual sale of it ? And did the defendant company refuse to deliver the property, and is that the reason the franchise is still in the hands of the defendant company, and not in the hands of. the alleged purchaser ?] 3</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b214-6" data-blocks='[["BL_214.7",214,[313,2359,1129,42]],["BL_215.1",215,[237,377,1180,2048]]]'>There is, I believe, no evidence in the case to show that the <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>parties ever did consummate the sale; that is, that there ever was a perfect execution in regard to all the details of the sale. It appears that there were some things left undone at the time it was declared off by the parties. If that is the case, and you come to the conclusion from the evidence, as you no doubt will, that the sale never was completed, and that there never was an actual sale, then the next question arises, was there a contract to sell, and was the failure to consummate the sale under that contract due to the defendant company failing to do something that they were required to do under that contract of sale ? [If Mr. Sweeney got so far along in this transaction as to have brought these parties together, so that a contract of sale was made, which included in it certain things to be done by the parties, and the defendant company failed to do those things which they were required to do, in order to consummate that sale, to make it an actual sale, then we think the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. Although he is only entitled to recover in case of an actual sale, yet the contract having gone so far that all it required of the parties was that they should do certain things, or perform certain details, contemplated in the contract of sale, he would be entitled to his money, if the failure to consummate the sale was by reason of the defendant company not doing that which they were bound to do. And we think, gentlemen, that is really the point in the case. It is admitted there was no actual transfer of this property; this defendant company still owns this plant, so far as the evidence in this case shows ; there is no evidence to the contrary. The contract of sale, if there was one entered into, was never fully consummated by a transfer of the stock and an assignment of the leases. But, if you believe there was a contract of sale made here, an agreement entered into by these parties looking to the transfer of the stock of this company, and also an assignment of the leases, which was to be consummated by the parties doing certain things, and that the defendant company failed to do that which they were required to do, and that that was the reason the sale was not consummated and the transfers made, then I say Mr. Sweeney ought not to be held responsible for that failure, if he has done all that he could do in consummating the sale, and the reason it is not consummated lies solely at the door of the defendant company.] 4</p>

      <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>Now, gentlemen, in the first place, there is some dispute about whether there ever was a contract of sale, and you will have to determine from all the evidence in the case, whether there ever was an agreement upon the conditions of sale. Did the parties come together, and have an understanding as to the exact things they had agreed on, and the exact things that were to be done on each side ? If they did, that would be a contract of sale. Was everything agreed upon that had to be done, if not already done, in order to make a consummated sale ? If it was, then there was a contract of sale. You will consider all the evidence in the case on this question; this telegram sent by Mr. Logan, and then what happened in pursuance of the proposition contained in the telegram, when the parties got together in Mr. Sayer’s office, and at the other meetings of the parties ; you will consider it all together, and then determine whether or not there was an agreement by the parties to sell this property. If you find there was a contract to sell the property, then the next question will be, what is the reason it was not consummated ? Did the thing fail on account of the defendant company not doing something that they were bound to do ?</p>

The defendant company claims they did everything on their part that was required at their hands to perfect these titles; while the plaintiff claims that they were in default, from the fact that some of these leases, so far as the record title was made to appear, were given by parties that had no title; that the purchaser was not bound to accept these leases in that condition, and that the defendant company failed to make these titles good when they could have done so, and that that was the reason why this trade failed to be consummated, and that the failure or want of consummation of the contract must be solely laid at their door. Now, gentlemen, you will take all the evidence in this case in regard to that matter, and you will determine from the evidence in the case whether .or not that is correct; and if you find, as I said before, that there was a contract of sale that contemplated certain things to be done in order for its consummation, and that the defendant failed to <a id="p199" href="#p199" data-label="199" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*199</a>comply with the things they were required to do in that contract of sale, then the plaintiff ought to recover, because he has done everything that he possibly could do in consummating the sale, and the reason it is not consummated is the fault of the defendant. On the other hand, if you conclude there never was any contract of sale, but only dickering between these parties and they never came to any understanding at all, or even if they did come to an understanding, that it was the plaintiff’s fault, or his purchaser’s fault, that the sale never was consummated, ..then we think he ought not to recover.] 3</p>

It was written by a person whom the plaintiff had held out as the responsible purchaser and was the closing act of the whole matter.

The proof of the contract without proof of its being defeated by some act or failure on the part of the defendant would not be sufficient, and it was upon this ground that defendant moved for a compulsory non-suit, which was refused by the court.</p>
    <p id="b219-7" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[256,1715,1177,659]]]'>3. If any one is able to tell why the sale was never consummated, W. P. Logan was able to do so. He testified that it was because his attorney could not approve all the titles. The court below said to the jury that it was claimed that there was a contract of sale which the defendants failed to carry out, yet from the beginning to the end of the case there is not a word of testimony to show that the defendant failed to do anything; on the other hand the plaintiff’s case only -showed failure of title for which the defendant was not responsible. The court said to the jury, second assignment, that the question whether the defendant had prevented the consummation of the sale by a failure to do that which it was bound to do was, in the opinion of the court, “ really the point in the case.”</p>

Latshaw, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20167" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 W. 167">2 W. 167</a>. “ A jury ought never to be left to mere conjectures, when sympathy or some other equally improper motive will be sure to turn the scale. It is not too much to insist that there shall be evidence of circumstances on which the conclusion asked for may be reasonably predicated: ” Raby v. Cell, <a href="/pa/85/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="85 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="440466" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0080-01">85 Pa. 80</a>. We claim therefore that there being no evidence whatever that the defendant had agreed, or was in any way bound to do anything towards perfecting the titles, or that it failed, neglected or refused so to do, it was error to submit the question to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[236,983,1170,602]]]'>5. Both the first and second points submitted to the, court on behalf of the plaintiff should have been unqualifiedly refused. These points would have been entitled to an affirmance, if the plaintiff had been either a real estate broker or an agent: Keys v. Johnson, <a href="/pa/68/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="68 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1024563" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0042-01">68 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/68/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="68 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1024563" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0042-01">42</a>. </em>He testified, however, that he was neither, and all the evidence in the case shows the same thing. Why then should the points be affirmed by the court, even subject to what was said in the general charge, when they were based upon an unsound theory ? The affirmance of these two points, with a reference to the general charge, served to intensify the error of submitting to the jury a question of fact unsupported by evidence.</p>

The only witness called by the defendant to prove the letter, exhibit 11, testified he had no knowledge of the signature, and there was not even an attempt to show any circumstances which would give the letter the ear-marks of genuineness. But, even if the letter was not inadmissible for these reasons, it was properly excluded for the reason that it did not tend even to prove what it was offered for, to wit, that Col. Potts, though interested, was not interested as a purchaser in the way alleged by Mr. Logan.</p>

In order to know whether the court’s instructions to the jury were correct or not, we must know what were the terms of this contract of sale. The contract consisted of the company’s “ proposition ” of April 20th, and W. P. Logan’s tele <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>gram of acceptance dated four days later, April 24th. ' This telegram proposed no new terms, but confined itself entirely to an acceptance of the company’s proposition. Consequently if we would acquaint ourselves with the terms of this contract of sale, we must look to the company’s “ proposition ” alone, because from no other source can the terms of sale be ascertained.</p>
    <p id="b221-5" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[247,725,1167,647]]]'>3. The company empowered the plaintiff to sell their property but said nothing in the original article in regard to warranting titles. But upon the plaintiff’s producing them a purchaser in the person of W. P. Logan, they hold a meeting and come to a “ conclusion ” in which they propose that one of the terms of sale shall be that their “ titles and franchises to be subject to proper examination and approval: ” This, they say, is “the conclusion arrived at in our meeting,” etc., and appears to be the result of deliberation by the members of the company. This proposition was made April 20th and was forwarded to <em>W. </em>P. Logan, who accepted it by telegram April 24th, and the sale was consummated so far as the plaintiff to this action was concerned.</p>
    <p id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[245,1391,1167,706]]]'>4. On the trial of the case below, neither M. Sharp, president, nor A. M. Brown, secretary, made any pretence to ignorance of the defects in the titles, but on the contrary it appeared that they not only had full knowledge of them but made every effort to correct them. Nor was it incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that these defects could have been cured by the efforts of the defendant company. By incorporating into their proposition of sale a stipulation that their titles were to be subject to examination and approval, they engaged to make their titles at least marketable; and what reason have they to complain that the court held them up to their undertaking, or to deprive the plaintiff of his compensation after he has produced a bona fide purchaser, simply because they cannot come up to terms of their own proposing?</p>
