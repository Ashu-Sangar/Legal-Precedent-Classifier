One is, as to the facts as they appeared upon the ground at the time when the defendants went into possession of this property to put this well down, and to that particular subject the larger part of the evidence that has been introduced was directed. The defendants undertake to prove too by witnesses, that from what was seen there upon the ground in June, 1888, when this well was commenced, Glade Run seemed to be to the east of that well, and that therefore the property belonged to the Coasts under their lease from Blakely. The plaintiffs have introduced several witnesses whose testimony is as to the same state of facts, tending as they claim to show that at that time Glade Run appeared to be west of that point, and therefore that place was upon the land of Phillips and Osborne. Now, how was that ■ in fact ? If it be true that an individual going upon that property at that time with the information that Coasts had up to that time, and looking at it, seeing it just as it was, would determine that Glade Run was west of that Run and not east of it, then there would be no good reason why the defendants should assume that they owned that property; no good reason why they should undertake to put that well down. And. if you find the facts to be, then, that from the appearances on the ground as they then appeared, a man reasonably ought not to <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>conclude that Glade Run was east of it, and east of it at the time the Phillips lease was taken in 1884, then you may come to the conclusion at once that the defendants are not entitled to anything here; that it was a mere wanton trespass, without any reasonable grounds to suppose they had a right upon it, and you may find the verdict for the plaintiffs for the entire sum.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b595-6" data-blocks='[["BL_595.5",595,[220,1061,1168,505]]]'>The plaintiffs here gave the defendant notice, there is no dispute about that, not to enter upon the property and not to put that well down, — that same notice including No. 6, about which there is no controversy now. But if, in point of fact, it did appear and a man could reasonably conclude from the ground that Glade Run was east of this well No. 7, then when the defendants received that notice that put them upon inquiry. Then it became their duty not only to look at the ground, but it became their duty to inquire of these plaintiffs what the facts were upon which they claimed to own that property.</p>

It will be for you to determine, if you reach this question at all, which of these states of fact is correct. If it be true that that notice was given before any work was done, then the defendants were put upon their full inquiry, no matter what they saw upon the ground, as to the place where Glade Run was in 1884. But if the jury conclude that that notice was given after this improvement was commenced, but before it was finished, and further conclude as I have already stated, that the defendants could reasonably consider that Glade Run was east of that point, then you may find for the defendants so much as they had expended up to the time that that notice was actually given to them, and may find that they are not entitled to any more. If you come to the conclu<a id="p578" href="#p578" data-label="578" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*578</a>sion that that notice, if followed np with proper.inquiry, would have informed them where Glade Run was in 1884, on November 6th, when they received that notice, then it was incumbent on them not merely to go to Mr. Blakely and inquire of him where he had leased to them — that, if you believe Mr. Coast, he knew already — but it was incumbent on them to inquire of the plaintiffs what the facts were upon which they based their claim, and that would be more emphatically true after the suit was brought. This action in ejectment was commenced on July 2, 1888. Some of these improvements, the engine, tanks and some other matters, as Mr. Coast testified, were put up after that suit was commenced, after the 2d day of July— indeed after the 6th.</p>

If the jury come to the conclusion that a proper inquiry would not have revealed such a state of facts as would have convinced a reasonable man that this was the property of Phillips and Osborne, then his good faith 'would seem to be made out. Of course I am assuming now that you have passed the first question as to what appeared upon the ground, in favor of the defendants. But if the inquiry would have revealed such a state of facts to the defendants as would have convinced them reasonably, or convinced reasonable men, that Glade Run on November 6, 1884, was not east of that point, then they must be held from the time they got that notice to have had all that information, and if, with that information they would not have been, in good faith, claimants of that ground, then they would not be entitled to receive anything for the improvements they have made as they claim them in this case.</p>

All that a defendant in ejectment can claim, in the way of compensation for improvements made during his occupancy of land recovered from him, is to mitigate the damages by offsetting the value of the improvements made in good faith, to the extent of the rents and profits claimed by the rightful owner: Sedgwick on Dam., 5th ed., 131-136; Green v. Biddle, <a href="/us/21/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wheat. 1" data-case-ids="6136159" data-case-paths="/us/21/0001-01">8 Wheat. 1</a>. If he has received no rents and profits, and no claim for damages is made by the rightful owner, there can be no recoupment. In the present case, there is no recoupment nor anything analogous thereto. The defendants are attempting to actively maintain and establish a claim to a fund <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>in court, which is the product of oil taken out of the land after the issue of a writ of estrepement against them. This oil is not rents or profits; it is a part of 'the land itself, and for the purposes of the present case is the whole of it, as neither party claimed anything but the oil. The taking of this oil from the land is waste: Dunlap v. Riddell, 7 W. N. 466. It is the same oil the defendants were restrained and prevented from getting, and the same the ejectment was brought for. The writ of habere facias would have delivered it to the plaintiffs, if no receiver had been appointed, and it must go to them with the rest of the land.</p>

Whether oil produced on a leasehold is profits or rents, or is part of the leasehold itself, is a questiozz ziot raised on the trial and zzot for argument here. The plaintiffs’ poiizts raise <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>substantially but one question, viz., whether the notice by Phipps that Phillips had a claim to the land, rendered all the acts of the defendants mala fide. We may remark, however, in connection with- this new position, that the word, profits, seems to cover a pretty wide field; that the Common Pleas case of Dunlap v. Riddell, 7 W. N. 466, is not fully in harmony, either in letter or in spirit, with Emerson’s App., <a href="/pa/95/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="95 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="492910" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0258-01">95 Pa. 258</a>, and, as it was decided prior to the act of June 5, 1883, P. L. 79, it has no relevancy in the present case.

Good faith and fair dealing should not be peculiar to one side. They required a statement of what title Phipps represented, or enough to put the defendants on inquiry. Such notices from parties without a shadow of title are not infrequent as a mode of levying black-mail. The evidence of the defendants’ good faith is found in their expenditure of some $2,500 on property pointed out by their lessor as within them lease. That they believed it to be so is not strange, in view of the fact that the east channel, pointed out by Blakely as the boundary, was full of water and had every appearance of the true channel. Besides, the ejectment extended to land clear west of both channels. The plaintiffs claimed both No. 6 and No. 7 wells, and to the defendants the claim for the one appeared as unfounded as that for the other.</p>

If the radical doctrine contended' for, that for improvements made after notice no recovery can be had, be conceded, it will not avail the plaintiffs; for, in view of the instructions of the court, the jury must be regarded as having found that the notice was not given until after the entry of defendants and the making of improvements worth $2,263.60. The instructions to the jury were clear, and as favorable to the plaintiffs as they could expect, unless actual and express notice had been given before the entry of defendants, which is unwarranted by any testimony or inference in the case.

    <p id="b602-6" data-blocks='[["BL_602.6",602,[230,619,1164,1565]]]'>The question of the good faith of the defendants in putting down the well No. 7 was submitted by the learned court below to the jury with so much care, with so many cautions, with so much exactness, and with such perfect legal accuracy, that we must assume it to have been found absolutely, and in accordance with the precise limitations fixed by the court; that is, we must assume that, from the appearances on the ground as they were in 1884, a reasonable man would conclude that Glade run was then east of the well; and, in addition to that, — for so the court left it to the jury, — that after the notice of the plaintiffs, if the defendants had made inquiry from them for the facts upon which they founded their claim of title, they would not have learned that Glade run was west of the well in 1884. This being so, there can be no question of the good faith of the defendants to be now considered by us. It was a question of fact, to be decided by the jury alone, and they have found it in favor of the defendants. There was ample testimony to justify the finding. The channel of Glade run was not definitely fixed, for the water of the stream ran in two courses, and which was the real channel in 1884 was fairly open to question. The notice of the plaintiffs fixed no boundaries, described no line, pointed out no marks. It was merely a general notice that the well was on their property. The same notice also included well No. 6, but that well has been found <em>not </em>to be on plaintiffs’ land. We are bound, therefore, to conclude that the acts of the defendants in putting down well No. 7 were done in the honest belief that it was upon their own land, and, that if they had made inquiry of the plaintiffs for the facts upon which they claimed title, such inquiry would not have revealed to them that the well was on the plaintiffs’ land.</p>
    <p id="b602-7" data-blocks='[["BL_602.7",602,[229,2193,1162,195]],["BL_603.1",603,[202,369,1177,1574]]]'>Having, then, put down the well in the utmost good faith, why should they not be compensated for the cost of the well, which the plaintiffs have recovered and now hold, and by the use of which all the oil that the well yielded was obtained ? <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>This is a kind of improvement of an unusual character, and one which particularly commends itself to the favorable consideration of the courts. It was an oil well, with all the machinery and appliances necessary to its operation. Now, without this well and machinerj'', the oil could not possibly be obtained. After it was completed, its operations were all for the benefit of the plaintiffs. They have actually received the entire advantage of its structure and maintenance, without a penny of cost to themselves, and without any risk. All the cost and all the risk were borne by the defendants. If the defendants had not put down the well, the plaintiffs would never have obtained the oil without themselves sinking the well at their own cost and their own risk. Obtaining oil from the bowels of the earth is a very different thing from obtaining crops from the surface of the ground. The oil exists only at a distance of hundreds of feet below the surface. If it is not developed by means of wells, it is the same as if it had no existence at all. It is, in a state of nature, of no use or value whatever to the owner of the land. In order to obtain it, he must, by absolute necessity, incur the expense and the risk involved in putting down wells to reach it, and draw it from the deep recesses of the earth. The defendants, in the most perfect good faith, expended their money in sinking this well, as the jury has found; but they have reaped none of the benefits. All of these have gone to the plaintiffs. They could not possibly have enjoyed those benefits, if they had been in the possession of the land, without incurring this very same cost. Therefore it is no hardship whatever to them to repay to the defendants the bare cost of the well and appliances, which belong to the plaintiffs now, and the whole benefits of which accrue to them alone.</p>
    <p id="b603-5" data-blocks='[["BL_603.4",603,[202,1962,1173,455]],["BL_604.1",604,[248,368,1174,701]]]'>The fund, out of which this repayment is asked by the defendants, is a part of the proceeds of the very oil which was produced by their own good-faith expenditure* in sinking the well. It has cost the plaintiffs nothing, and we know of no good reason, in law or morals, why the reasonable claim of the defendants should not be allowed. The proposition that oil is part of the land, and cannot be regarded as mesne profits, and hence the right to compensation for valuable improvements, has no application. The oil has been taken. It is not <a id="p586" href="#p586" data-label="586" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*586</a>a question of staying waste, but of allowance for the cost of valuable improvements, actually necessary, and made in good faith. For such improvements compensation is allowed, whether that which is taken be minerals, oil, or other substance of the land, or not. This was fully decided in Kille v. Ege, <a href="/pa/82/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="82 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1047915" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0102-01">82 Pa. 102</a>, and Ege v.

There, large quantities of iron ore were taken, and we held that the defendants were entitled to compensation for their permanent improvements, which gave increased value to the land. That such was the character of the improvements in the present case, was not and could not be questioned. We are of opinion that the plaintiffs’ points were correctly answered, and that there was no error, either in the trial of the issue or in the final decree.</p>
