The nature of the defence, upon the facts, was the same as upon the first trial.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b434-6" data-blocks='[["BL_434.5",434,[250,829,1171,448]]]'>Before you can find for the plaintiff in this case, you must not only be satisfied that the sickness of himself, his family and his tenants, was occasioned by lead or arsenic from these works, but also that they were in such appreciable quantities as would, under the same circumstances, have affected persons of ordinary susceptibility to the poison. I do not intend to review the testimony at length; it has been commented on very fully by counsel on both sides, and I shall not refer to it except by way of illustration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b434-7" data-blocks='[["BL_434.6",434,[244,1287,1173,802]]]'>First, has the plaintiff or his wife, his family or tenants been sick in that house ? Next, have they been sick from lead or arsenic poisoning ? If they have, it still does not follow that it was the fault of the defendants. Before you can find for the plaintiff you must not onty be satisfied from the preponderance of testimony that the sickness existed, and that it was either lead or arsenic poisoning, but also from the testimony that it came from the defendants’ lead works or shot tower, and that it was in such appreciable quantities that it would have affected persons of ordinary susceptibility under the same circumstances of situation, not of health; because I take it that in the case of a lawful trade, even if a person should, from some cause, have been reduced to such a physical condition as to be extraordinarily sensitive and to be affected by such a small quantity of lead or arsenic as would not affect a person in an ordinaiy condition, then the defendants cannot be held liable.</p>

That is not in serious dispute. It is alleged that the wife, and I think one of the children, of Mr. Grantz had typhoid fever about 1881 or 1882, I have forgotten the precise date, but before this alleged lead poisoning. It <a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>is alleged that some of the children had scarlet fever, and that a child of a tenant has since had diphtheria. [The plaintiff, his wife and tenants, allege that they had, almost continuously while there, symptoms which some of the physicians at least give as the symptoms of lead poisoning.] 1 There is a contrariety of opinion among the experts, both the physicians aird the chemists who are not physicians, and perhaps chemists and physicians combined. You have heard their testimony; the court has admitted them to testify as experts, and you judge as to their credibility. The court has its own opinion as to which of them know most about the piatters upon which they have testified, but it is not the province of the court to indicate that.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.4",435,[202,1056,1175,850]]]'>There is a good deal of testimony in regard to whether other people have been affected by it or not. [The plaintiff alleges that his whole family and his tenants were affected, and has given in evidence that some neighbors were. An old lady who at one time lived there and frequently visited there afterwards says that she was affected.] 8 The majority of witnesses, and nearly all those called by the defendants, workmen and people in the neighborhood, say that they were not affected. The question as to whether or not they were affected, is simply one of persuasive evidence in this case. That others in the neighborhood were affected in the same general way, is evidence tending to show that there was some poisonous matter there or near there, which would affect ordinary people'in ordinary circumstances, situated as they were. The testimony of others who were there also and not affected injuriously is persuasive evidence that it would not affect ordinary people in the same •situation.....</p>

The third and fourth assignments are general in their character, and relate in the main to alleged errors-of omission. We cannot reverse the court below for “not reviewing and analyzing the evidence,” and for “not instructing the jury sufficiently as to the rules for weighing the value of testimony.” If more specific instructions were desired, they could have been obtained by asking for them in the usual way. The qualification of defendants’ second point was justified by the ruling of this court when the case was here before. See Price v.
