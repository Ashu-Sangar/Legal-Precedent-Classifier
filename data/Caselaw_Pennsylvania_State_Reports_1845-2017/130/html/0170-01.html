The court below, when the cause was tried, looked at the face of the pleadings, the affidavit of defence filed, observed the manner of the trial up to the time of submitting points, considered the evidence, and, regarding its own rules of pleading as it understood them, thought the condition precedent, which required the plaintiff to wait sixty days after proof of loss before suing, was waived, and therefore held, amongst other things, that the suit was not premature.</p>

The rulings on the real merits were, it seems, sustained. Whether, if the court above had their attention called to the matters herein suggested, the ruling would be the same, is now an immaterial question. Whether, from analogy to the rules that require statutes of limitations to be pleaded, the defence that the action had not yet accrued, should, after the plea of special matter had been filed, also have been pleaded, or deemed waived, so as to have afforded the plaintiff an opportunity, if he could, to show that such a defence was avoided by a waiver, or, if the plea were deemed fatal, afford him an opportunity to suffer a nonsuit, and institute a new suit before the conventional limitation fixed by the policy expired, is not now a question. A new suit was brought on November 21,1887, less than a year after the reversal of the judgment, but more than a year from the date of the fire ; and the question now is, was this second <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>suit instituted too late, by reason of the contractual limitation of the policy? The reserved point denied the right of action, as more than twelve months since the fire had expired.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[203,512,1176,1527]]]'>As the former action was premature, a strict construction of the contractual limitation would warrant an affirmance. The authorities are clear that such a limitation in a contract of insurance is valid. The plaintiff, however, interposes the second section of the act of March 27, 1713, known as the statute of limitations, which provides that, if, “ in any of the said actions, or suits, judgment be given for the plaintiff, and the same be reversed by error,.....a new suit may be brought within a year after such judgment reversed; ” and argues that, by analogy, a case arising under a contractual limitation must be governed by the same principles as apply in cases of limitation by statute. As against this view the defendant argues, that as the plaintiff had no cause of action when the first suit was brought, he is not within the equity of the statute, even if the limitation now set up were by statute and not by contract. A limitation by statute is arbitrary and peremptory, admitting of no excuse for delay except as recognized by the statute itself, or coming within the equity of it; whereas a limitation by contract is to be governed by the principles governing contracts, and is, therefore, more flexible in its nature. As forfeitures are not favored in law, slight evidence of waiver will be deemed sufficient to estop the defendant. By the affidavit of defence and the pleadings, the defendant alleged in the former case “ that the plaintiff had failed to make proof of loss as required by the policy.” He therefore denied that such proof of loss had been given as would at any time support an action. That the proof of loss was sufficient under the policy on March 28, 1885, was only and first established when the Supreme Court on March 7,1887, ruled the case, sustaining the court below except as to the action’s being premature.</p>

One clause in <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>the limitation is, that “ the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed conclusive evidence against the validity of such claim.” This seems to indicate the spirit and purpose of the limitation to be the barring of suits for stale claims, claims made doubtful, or first presented after witnesses have passed away and evidence is lost. Numerous cases were cited to show that the operation of the statute is prevented by the commencement of a new suit within a reasonable time, and that this, when not regulated by statute, is ordinarily understood to be one year, this period having been adopted from the analogy of the statute of 1713. True, in the cases cited, the cause of action existed at the issuing of the writ, whereas in this case the court above held that the plaintiff had a claim, though the right to sue did not then exist.</p>

Had the policy in suit contained no limitation clause, the first section of the act of 1713* would have governed the parties; but they have agreed upon a substitute for the first section, without interfering with the second section; and the case stands, by the contract, as though the limitation in the first section were changed from six years to one year, leaving the contingency provided for in the second section unaltered. That contingency has arisen in this case, and we ask that thé benefit conferred by the act be not withheld from us.</p>

This question has <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>been raised in this court but once before, so far as we know, in Keystone M. B.

It follows, therefore, that the statutes of limitation do not apply. The very object and spirit of the agreement are to exclude the operation of the statute which would otherwise govern. And in the present case the exclusion is so clear and express that nothing short of an entire disregard of the language used can escape it: “ It is hereby expressly provided that no suit or action against this company for the recovery of any claim by virtue of this policy shall be sustainable in any court of law or chancery..... unless such suit or action shall be commenced within twelve months next after the fire shall have occurred; and, should any suit or action be commenced against this company after the expiration of the aforesaid twelve months, the lapse of time shall be taken and deemed as conclusive evidence against the validity of such claim, any statute of limitation to the contrary notwithstanding.” The words are, not that “ no first action ” shall be sustainable, but “ no action ; ” and in the face of these words, and the concluding clause, “ any statute of limitation to the contrary notwithstanding, ” we regard the argument that the case is within the purview of the second section of the act of March 27, 1713, relative to the bringing of a second action within a year after a reversal of the first, as entirely irrelevant. The statute is expressly excluded from operation, the second section as much as the first, and the rights of the parties must be determined without reference to it.</p>

That must be this action, and all actions in which a recovery is claimed. And there is no provision for any exception on account of the failure of any such actions.....Statutes of limitation would be subject to no such exception, unless by the express terms of the statutes. That a party was driven to a nonsuit in his former suit is no excuse for not bringing a suit before the cause of action is barred by statute, or by the terms of the contract, unless such an exception is contained in the act of limitation.”</p>

There, the statute of limitations of Missouri provided that if, in any action commenced within the statutory period, the plaintiff should suffer a nonsuit, he might commence a new action within one year; but the Supreme Court of the United States held that this provision did not prevent the bar of the agreement. “ The rights of the parties,” says Field, J., “ flow from the contract. That relieves them from the general limitations of the statute, and, as a consequence, from its exceptions also.” To the same effect are Wilkinson v.

Two grounds have been argued with much ingenuity, both depending upon a former action between the same parties. That action' was brought within sixty days of the furnishing of proofs of loss, and was therefore held by this court to be premature : Howard Ins. Co. v. Hocking, <a href="/pa/115/0415-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="115 Pa. 415" data-case-ids="551791" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0415-01">115 Pa. 415</a>. It is now argued, first, that the issue upon which that action was finally decided against plaintiff was not raised in the pleadings when it should have been, so as to afford plaintiff an opportunity to discontinue, and bring a new suit after the sixty days, and still within the stipulated twelve months, but was held back by the defendant until the trial, after the twelve months had elapsed, and therefore that the limitation should be treated as waived. It <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>is undoubtedly true that any act which tends to mislead the plaintiff, while parties are dealing on friendly terms, to avoid litigation, will be held to be evidence of a waiver of such a limitation as the present; but after suit has been brought, and the parties are dealing at arms length, the rule does not apply with the same strictness, and much more positive evidence of actual misleading, if not of intent to mislead, is necessary to prove a waiver by estoppel. A defendant, ordinarily, is only bound to make such defence as he thinks sufficient for the pending action. If he chooses to omit some- special defence, he may do so, and take the risk that if he fails on the others, he has thus lost his chance on the omitted ground, but, if he succeeds, he still has it in reserve, in case of a second action. Experience in actions of ejectment affords ample illustration of this practice. In the former action between these parties, the defendant made its defence partly on the ground that the action was premature. The plaintiff, on the other hand, brought and pursued his action on the ground that, as the insurance was on a single building, Ms notice of a total loss was sufficient, and the sixty days had elapsed between such notice and the suit. Each party stood upon his own view of the law, and this court sustained the defence. We fail to see in this anything that can be considered a waiver of the limitation in favor of the present action.</p>
    <p id="b199-5" data-blocks='[["BL_199.5",199,[185,1602,1174,812]],["BL_200.1",200,[256,360,1173,402]]]'>Secondly, it is argued that the sufficiency of the proofs of loss, having been denied by the defendant in the former action, was not really established until the decision of this court; and, as the present action was brought within a year from that decision, it should be held to be within the agreement, by that equity of construction which dates the commencement of the period of limitation from the time a right of action could first accrue, notwithstanding the agreement itself names the date of the fire as the starting-point. See Wood on Insurance, § 469. The argument is extremely ingenious, but it is hardly necessary to go into the question of the equitable construction appealed to. The contention must fail for the same reason as the preceding-one. It is true that the sufficiency of the proofs of loss was, in a certain sense, not established until the decision of this court; but the same may be said of every disputed point in every litigation. The parties stood upon their respective views of the <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>law, and on this point the decision was in plaintiff’s favor, but what it decided was the rights of the parties as of the date of the writ.. That the decision did not save the plaintiff’s action was his misfortune, but it certainly did not give him a new starting-point for his period of limitation under the agreement, any more than it would have done so under a statute, had the statutory period been fully run when the court held the first action premature.</p>
    <p id="b200-5" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[254,772,1175,299]]]'>It may be hard for the plaintiff to lose his case on this single point, after an apparent victory on the merits; but his agreement is explicit and unavoidable, and to sustain this action in the face of it would be to substitute a new contract for the one which the parties have lawfully made for themselves. That is not'the duty or the province of courts.</p>
    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[255,1080,1172,83]]]'>The defendant’s point should have been affirmed, and verdict directed for defendant.</p>
