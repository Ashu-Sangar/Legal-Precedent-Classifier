The buildings appear to have been eleven in number and are sufficiently described and the size and character thereof given.” They consisted of a boiler house, filter house, barrel house, several tank houses, pump houses, tool house, etc. An engine and boiler for any kind of a manufactory do not absolutely require a building to protect them. Both may stand iii 'the open air, yet no one doubts that if an engine and boiler house are erected to protect them from the weather a lien will attach, etc. A careful examination of all authorities bearing upon this question will reveal no conflict. In all a building must be present upon which a lien can attach. This is such an essential.characteristic, that if the building be destroyed by fire, or otherwise, the lien is discharged: Presbyterian Church' v.

Webster says, “A fabric or edifice constructed for use or convenience, as a house, a church, a shop,” etc. In legal phrase the best definition I can find is in Rapalje and Lawrence’s Law Dictionary, as follows : “ Building.

An oil refinery has every characteristic of a building, according to every definition except that of Kapalje and Lawrence, which is exceedingly unsatisfactory. The usual method of construction is to erect the structures specified in our claim and nothing more, without inclosing or covering them with sheds. The learned judge misapprehended Short v.

Such a construction would subject every stone laid one upon another, every boiler and engine, every wind-mill, hitching post, fence, statue, monument and liberty pole, in the state, to a lien. In general, statutes are presumed to use words in their popular sense: Endlich on Statutes, § 76; School Directors v.

L. 212, passed for Venango and certain other counties. If that act be unrepealed, the question raised by this record remains the same, as that act neither repeals nor amends any provision of the' act of 1836; it does not dispense with the necessity of a house or other building. The act of 1868 was in fact wholly unnecessary, as it extended to the counties sought to be favored no right not already enjoyed all over the state : Short v.

With regard to the constitutionality of the latter, the sole question is whether it is valid as to Venango county. Such an act may be constitutional as to one county and not so as to another: Beckert v.

So far as it relates to Venango, it is clearly in conformity with § 3, article III. of the constitution. It does not sin against § 7, article III., as it neither creates, extends, nor impairs liens; nor does it directly or indirectly enact a local law. <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>The objection based on § 8, article III., is answered by Kilgore v.

The sole question raised, discussed and decided by the court below and this court, on the former presentation of this case, was the constitutionality of the act of June 17, 1887, P. L. 418. The “ other legal or equitable cause ” referred to in the order of this court, is any cause other than the failure to give notice under the act of 1887. The sufficiency of the plaintiff’s claim was in no sense involved in the determination of the sufficiency of the affidavit of defence. The reasons assigned for striking off the lien could not properly be raised by affidavit. The objection may be taken by demurrer or motion to strike off, at any time before plea: Lybrandt v.

    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.7",237,[233,1309,1178,967]]]'>The lien was entered in this case on September 30, 1887. The scire facias was issued on October 29th following, and was served two days later. According to a well-settled and immemorial course of procedure in the courts, the defendant, when served with process requiring him to appear and answer, should consider, in the first place, whether the writ has been properly issued and legally served upon him-. If there is ground for a motion to quash the writ or to set aside the service, it should be made the basis of a motion before an appearance has been made, or the irregularity will be waived. If the writ and service be regular, the defendant should next consider whether the court has jurisdiction. This inquiry in mechanics’ lien cases extends to the regularity and completeness of the statement and description on which the lien was entered. If there is a want of form or substance in the original paper filed, a motion to strike off should be made. If no objection is made on this ground the defendant must consider whether he has a defence on the merits, and file his affidavit of defence, or suffer judgment, as the case may be.</p>
    <p id="b237-7" data-blocks='[["BL_237.8",237,[234,2284,1171,147]],["BL_238.1",238,[239,372,1177,1069]]]'>The defendant in this case appeared to the writ, and, making no dilatory motion or plea, spread its defence on the record in an affidavit of defence.1 The plaintiffs were then at liberty to <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>admit pro forma the facts averred and raise an issue of law over their legal effect, or proceed to trial on the questions of fact presented. The plaintiffs took the first of these methods, and moved for judgment non obstante, alleging that the affidavit disclosed no defence. If the court below had made this rule absolute, as they should have done, final judgment would have been at once entered in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount of their claim; but the rule was discharged, and the plaintiffs thereupon brought the record to this court, and assigned the refusal of the court below to enter judgment as error. The question here, as in the Common Pleas, was whether the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment in their favor on the issue made. We held that they were, and, following the words of the act of assembly giving a writ of error in such cases, remitted the record to the court below, with directions to enter the judgment that should have been entered when the rule for judgment was heard, “ unless other legal or equitable cause ” for refusing the judgment upon the final' hearing of the motion should be made to appear. When the record was returned the plaintiffs’ counsel renewed his motion, and asked for judgment in accordance with the opinion of this court.</p>

The original affidavit was held by this court insufficient to prevent it; and, unless by supplemental affidavit some legal or equitable reason for denying the motion then pending was brought to the attention of the court, the plaintiffs were entitled to have their rule made absolute and their judgment entered. Instead of disposing of the motion, sent back to it from this court, the Common Pleas went back to an earlier stage of the case, and set about the examination of a question which had been passed on the way up to the issue which had been tried, and then, by striking off the lien, leveled its own judgment and the judgment of this court with a single blow. This cannot be done. The record was returned that the court might go forward to judgment or- to trial, not backward into the region of dilatory motions and pleas. A venire facias de novo brings about a new trial, with all the possibilities that belong to a trial; but an order to enter judgment on a pending motion, unless further legal or equit<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>able reason should be shown against it than is shown by the affidavit under consideration, fixes the status of the case and the duty of the court below. The affidavit on file being adjudged insufficient, the only question is, whether there is any further consideration to be presented as affording at law or in equity a defence against the plaintiff’s claim. Beyond this the court has no power to inquire.</p>
    <p id="b239-3" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[226,719,1181,1074]]]'>We regard this as conclusive of the questions raised upon this writ, and a discussion of the other questions which have been argued is therefore unnecessary. But we have examined the description of the property against which a lien is claimed, and which the court below held to be insufficient. It enumerates the several structures, and describes their uses, gives the dimensions, height, or capacity of each, and the materials of which it is constructed; avers that, taken together, they constitute an oil refinery, and that they are located upon a certain, piece of land which is fully described by its lines and adjoiners, and which contains 55.15 acres, situated in Cornplanter township, Venango county, Pa. The description fixes the locality with reasonable certainty, describes the character and peculiarities of the several structures taken separately, and gives the use for which they are intended and the name by which they are known when taken together. This, we think, is sufficient, and meets the requisites of a description as indicated in Short v. Ames, <a href="/pa/121/0530-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="121 Pa. 530" data-case-ids="561234" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0530-01">121 Pa. 530</a>. If so, we see no reason why the lien may not be good under the act of 1836. For the reasons given, a discussion of the constitutional question presented is unnecessary.</p>
