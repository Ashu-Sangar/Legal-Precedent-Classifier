      <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>On February 12, 1887, the inquest <em>was </em>awarded; upon return thereof, Stanton Black, the exceptant here, filed exceptions to the return, setting forth that there was an outstanding life-estate in him in the one eighth of the land, and that he had had no notice of the proceedings, and was not named in the petition. This being a disputed question, the matter was referred to an auditor, who after hearing the evidence found in favor of Stanton Black, and his report was confirmed on March 30, 1888. Thus the matter stood till May 18,1889, when the usual rule on the heirs, including and naming Stanton Black, was issued. To this rule Stanton Black voluntarily appeared, and in person, and accepted service in his own handwriting. We think, therefore, from the face of the record that Stanton Black, who now exempts to the inquisition and to the awarding of the land to any of the heirs, has made himself a partjr to the proceedings; otherwise, by the proceedings throughout and at any time he would not have been affected, because he was not named in the petition and had no notice. This is clearly ruled in the case of Thompson v. Stitt, <a href="/pa/56/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="56 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="1009155" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0156-01">56 Pa. 156</a>, and the authorities therein cited.</p>

The only complaint is that since that time, the land has greatly appreciated in value. Now, we are unable to see that this reason should prevail, to have the appraisement set aside. Sudden rises in the value of real estate have become with us quite a common thing, but this of itself surely cannot have the effect of setting the finding of juries in partition aside, as we have said. It is true that the exceptant has no right to bid, as the heirs have, but that comes from the nature of his interest in the land and of this he cannot complain.</p>

Stanton Black appeared in court and filed exceptions to .the inquisition on May 19, 1887.

He did not ask the court to quash the proceedings, but simply to refer the matter back to the jury for a re-valuation. As to this subsequent appreciation, the action of the court was correct. Re-valuations will hot be ordered with the ever changing values of the country. No proof was offered at any time that the jury made a plain mistake of fact or law, or that any fraud was practiced; and in the absence of proof of one or other of these, an inquisition will not be set aside on a question of valuation: Kreider’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20376" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="18 Pa. 376">18 Pa. 376</a>.</p>

But this case recognizes that an irregular proceeding may be ratified by the acts or conduct of the party, and when the exceptant voluntarily appeared in court and took part in all the proceedings subsequent to his appearance, and especially when he accepted service of the rule to accept or refuse, and appeared at its return day, he thereby ratified and confirmed all the prior proceedings. McKee v.

This report did not make appellant a party to the proceedings, nor validate them. It brought on the record, and to the knowledge of the court, a fact which demonstrated that the proceedings were unlawful, and required that they be set aside. Nothing further was done until April 13, 1889, when the usual rule on heirs, including and naming Stanton Black, was issued. The appellant accepted service of this rule, and filed additional exceptions to the inquisition, setting forth, inter alia, that the property was worth $300 an acre, or $20,000 more than the valuation placed on it by the inquest. He asked the court “ to take off the confirmation of the inquest and valuation, and refer the matter back to the jury for a revaluation.” The exceptions were dismissed, the court helow holding that the appellant had made himself a party to the proceedings by accepting service of the rule on heirs, and that although the land had advanced more than 200 per cent since the valuation by the inquest, he was bound by it.</p>

Of course the accuracy of an appraisal cannot be assailed on the ground of the subsequent appreciation of the property, but where some of the parties in a partition have a fee simple, and others a life-estate in the land, and, pending the proceedings, it is trebled in value by the discovery upon it of a mine or the like, it would be equitable to order a re-valuation of it. If the property is not brought to a public sale, the only protection the life-estate has is in a fair valuation, and this the <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>court may secure at any time before a decree which transfers the title.</p>

His subsequent effort to obtain a valuation of the property, as of the time it is claimed he became a party, did not cure previous irregularities, or want of jurisdiction, because it was of these he was complaining, and on these his application for relief rested. The illegality of the original proceeding still clings to it, and the appellant is not estopped from alleging it. As his claim respecting the value of the property is undisputed, and he was denied an opportunity to substantiate it by evidence, it must be taken as true.
