The note purports to be drawn by Smith &amp; Williams, the signature being in the handwriting of Smith. The suit was brought on May 5, 1886, by James A. Dick, who died in July of that year, as we recall the evidence, and his administrator was afterwards substituted as party plaintiff. Judgment by default went against the firm, after which the judgment was opened as to D. H. Williams, and he permitted to make defence, and as to him you are trying the case.

You will have this proof before you, and you will consider, then, first, whether in point of fact this has not been paid by Smith, or Smith’s property, or any part of it.

If so, the defendant would not be liable. Joseph Smith testifies positively that he borrowed the money for himself, and that Dick knew it at the time. [A remark may be made here as to the competency of this witness. Mr. Dick is dead and the rule of the law would exclude the other surviving party from testifying, but the witness is testifying as to the personal defence set up by Williams, and this testimony also would be against his own interest, by making himself individually liable for what all the members of the firm otherwise would be liable for, if a different state of facts from those which he testified to were true.] 3 You have also the testimony of Henry Croushore as to what Dick told him about the money not going into the firm, but that it was gotten by Smith. In addition, you have the letters of Dick to Smith &amp; Williams, which you will have before you, touching these notes, and the individual liability, alone, of Smith.

If this evidence satisfies you that this note was given for Smith’s individual use, and the money was obtained and used by him, and Dick knew it at the time, your duty is plain in not holding this defendant responsible, for he would not be responsible in the eyes of the law. If on the other hand, of course, it was a partnership note, or it had been signed by one of the partners, in the partnership name, and Dick knew no better than that it was a partnership note, it does not matter what became of the money, if Dick was ignorant as to the fact, as we have stated.....</p>

A debt not by contract, under seal, or evidenced by the seal of the party, cannot be recovered after six years from its maturity by an action at law. The statute of limitations absolutely forbids it, and where this defence is set up the law looks upon it with favor. Such a provision is a wise one, both for the creditor and debtor. Parties die and witnesses die, or their memories fail, and the rights of the parties, on the one side or upon the other, may be jeopardized by delay. We have in this action an illustration of this, for Mr. Dick is dead and unable to come and explain and speak for himself. But there may be some intervening act of the debtor which would prevent the running of the statute. As, for example, a special promise to pay, an acknowledgment of the debt, consistent with a promise to pay, or a partial payment. Where this is relied on, however, . the evidence must be clear, satisfactory, and indubitable. There must be no uncertainty about the identity of the debt, or the clearness of the promise or acknowledgment. But when a partial payment is relied upon, the creditor must clearly prove the fact, that in truth and in fact he received such partial payment from the person setting up the defence. This is a case where the party setting up the credit must prove the credit, for the purpose of avoiding the statute. So here, the plaintiff must prove that Williams paid the money within the six years. The only credit on this note of which you may inquire, is that of fl,000. The plaintiff here has shown by the deposition of M. O. Dick, a former cashier, that the defendant, Williams, was present when the credit was put on the note, and, as we <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>recall the facts, that he handed over the money, or the money was passed then, at least, lúieH in the bank, in his presence. This, not contradicted or explahiod, would take the case out of the statute of limitations. LiA the dcdevhdant.has^ere^eyidgii&amp;sv**~~~ to show that the $1,000 was money that Smith realized from the sale of his half interest' .in the premises of Williams, and that by Dick’s own request tide money was paid on the note.

    <p class="summary" id="b65-6" data-blocks='[["BL_65.5",65,[212,846,1184,665]]]'>Now, the partnership, it would seem, was dissolved in the summer of 1878, and this payment was made on October 24, 1881, over three years after the partnership wes dissolved. The partial payment of a debt of a firm, by one of the members of the firm, would not renew the debt as to the others, if made after the dissolution of partnership. It would take evidence sufficiently strong to renew the debt, to take it out of the statute of limitations, as it would to establish the debt itself, for it is substantially a new promise; and, while the action may be brought upon the original promise, it has life and force and effect only from the new promise which may be given. So that the payment by Smith would not bind Williams, so as to prevent him from pleading the statute, or taking the benefit of it.</p>

In all the statutes upon the subject the manifest intention of the legislature has been to preserve equality between litigants. Both the letter and the spirit of the act of April 15, 1869, P. L. 30, and its supplements, is opposed to opening a door to one party, that has been closed by death against the other. The same principle is maintained in the act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158. Should the court be of opinion that the act of 1887 renders the witness in any way competent, we submit that that act, if it means anything at all, is intended to collate, revise and amend all the former statutes on the subject. As such, it is in direct violation of § 6, article III. of the constitution.</p>

Smith had no defence to make for himself. By the recovery of judgment against him his liability had become fixed, and the cause was thereby concluded as to him.

To the objection that Smith, as the assignor of the chose in action, was incompetent on the ground of public policy, there are two answers, either of which is sufficient: (1) Smith was not the assignor of the note in question, nor was Dick the assignee; although it was drawn and indorsed as a negotiable instrument, Smith was really the maker and Dick the payee. (2) By § 4, act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, no policy of law except as provided in § 5, shall make any person incompetent as a witness. This section entirely abrogates the common law rule forbidding the assignor of a chose in action to testify, and we find nothing in § 5, saving this rule from the operation of § 4. The act of 1887 is not a revision or amendment, but a new system.</p>

    <p id="b69-5" data-blocks='[["BL_69.6",69,[219,416,1180,611]]]'>This action was brought against Joseph Smith and D. H. Williams as partners under the firm name of Smith &amp; Williams. It was upon a note purporting to be executed by the firm, made payable to and indorsed by Joseph Smith, and which matured on August 17,1878. The summons was issued on May 5,1886. A judgment was entered against the defendants on June 28, 1866, for want of an affidavit of defence, which was opened as to D. H. Williams on the next day, and he permitted to make defence. He alleged that the note was not given by the firm, or for a firm debt, but by Joseph Smith for his own individual debt, with the full knowledge of Dick, the plaintiff. He also alleged that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.7",69,[216,1035,1181,648]]]'>Two questions of fact were thus raised for the decision of the jury: (1) Was the note binding on the firm? (2) If binding when given, was the statute of limitations a defence ? It is to be regretted that these questions were not stated separately in framing the issue when the judgment was opened, so that they could have been separately disposed of by the jury. As the case stands, we cannot tell whether the jury found for the defendant on the first or the second of these questions, or whether both were decided in his favor. We must therefore examine the errors assigned relating to both questions, and reverse, if error is found in either, because of the impossibility of determining on which the verdict may rest. We will consider them in their inverse order.</p>
    <p id="b69-7" data-blocks='[["BL_69.8",69,[213,1701,1180,708]],["BL_70.1",70,[250,372,1184,866]]]'>Was the action barred by the statute ? That depended on whether the payment of $1,000 indorsed on the note in the handwriting of Dick as received from D. H. Williams on October 21,1881, was in fact made by Williams to apply on this note. The evidence showed that the $1,000 was due from Williams to Smith as the purchase money of his interest in the storehouse and lot which they had previously owned together, and that it was paid to Dick at Smith’s request, and for his convenience. Dick received it from Williams, not as his creditor, but as the agent of Smith; not as a payment on the note, but as payment in full for the land he had bought from Smith. After it came into his hands, any application he might make of it in accordance with his understanding with Smith could not, without more, bind or in any manner affect Williams. The in<a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>dorsement, to affect him, must, at the least, have been made at his instance and request. The learned judge of the court below, however, instructed the jury on this subject as follows: “ The plaintiff here has shown by the deposition of M. O. Dick, former cashier, that the defendant Williams was present when the credit was put on the note, and, as we recall the facts, that he handed over the money, or the money was passed then, at least, there in the bank, in his presence. This, not contradicted or explained, would take the case out of the statute of limitations.” The plaintiff in error cannot complain of this. It was more favorable to him than he had the right to ask, and, if complained of by the other side, could not be sustained. As we have already said, Williams was not affected by what Dick might do with Smith’s money, unless it was done at his instance, and of that there is not a particle of proof before us. We do not see why the defendant was not entitled to a peremptory instruction in his favor upon this branch of his defence.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[246,1246,1185,1165]],["BL_71.1",71,[235,369,1185,611]]]'>Was this note binding on the firm? It was, if given in the course of the firm <em>business; </em>it was not, if given for the indiwidual debt of Smith. In order to establish the latter position, and to show that Dick not only knew, but suggested, the use of the firm name by Smith for his own individual purposes, the defendant called Smith a,s a witness. Dick died before the trial; and his administrator, who had been substituted on the record, objected to the competency of Smith as a witness. The court below admitted him on the ground that he was called against his interest, and to sustain a defence personal to Williams. It is important to keep in mind that the action was not brought against Williams alone, but against the firm of Smith &amp; Williams <em>; </em>and he was liable, if at all, because he was a member of the firm. Smith’s liability rested on the same basis. It is true that a judgment by default had been taken against Smith; but if the result of the trial should be to determine that the firm was not liable on the note, the foundation on which the judgment by default rests would fall from under it. If the firm is not liable, the members of the firm, as such, are not. Smith may be liable as an indorser, or as the borrower of the money-represented by the note, but in this action his liability depends upon the fact that he is a member of the firm sued; and, if the firm is not liable, he is not liable. He was made a defend<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>ant, as Williams was, because be was a partner in tbe firm against wbicb the action was brought; but if tbe debt sued on is not a firm debt, the plaintiff must fail in bis action, and tbe verdict must be in favor of tbe firm, and necessarily in favor of tbe partners composing it. This being so, it is clear that Smith was permitted to testify in favor of bis own interest, when be was allowed to show by bis testimony that tbe debt was not that of tbe firm : Swanzey v. Parker, <a href="/pa/50/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="50 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="425176" data-case-paths="/pa/50/0441-01">50 Pa. 441</a>. As the other party to tbe contract under investigation was dead, and tbe interest of Smith was adverse to that of tbe deceased bolder of tbe note, be was incompetent to testify, under tbe express provisions of tbe act of 1887.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.5",71,[234,987,1184,664]]]'>Tbe learned judge was also in error in treating this line of defence as personal to Williams. Tbe defence made on tbe statute of limitations may be regarded as personal. One defendant may insist upon it as a defence, and the other may be unwilling to set it up. In that event a verdict might be in favor of one defendant, and against tbe other. But a denial of tbe liability of tbe firm goes to tbe entire cause of action. If that defence is maintained, not Williams alone, but tbe firm, and all its members, sued as such, are relieved from liability. For tbe reasons now given the judgment must be reversed; and, because we cannot tell whether tbe verdict of tbe jury rests on tbe determination of both, or one, and wbicb one, of tbe questions of fact before them, we must award</p>
