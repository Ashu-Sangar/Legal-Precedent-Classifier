    <p class="summary" id="b225-7" data-blocks='[["BL_225.7",225,[230,1215,1183,456]]]'>The plaintiff brings her action to recover the first payment due on an article of-agreement for the sale to the defendant of a house and lot in the borough of Indiana, being No. 6 in the plan of the borough. The facts have been agreed upon as a case stated.- The agreement for the sale is dated August 3, 1889, by which the plaintiff sells the lot to the defendant for the sum of $5,000, payable as specified in the article, $1,000 of which was due August 5, 1889. i The action was brought to recover this payment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b225-8" data-blocks='[["BL_225.8",225,[224,1679,1188,713]],["BL_226.1",226,[243,331,1178,199]]]'>It is agreed by the case stated that the title comes by devise in the last will and testament of Mrs. C. C. Banks, dated November 30, 1881, and probated November 11, 1884. By the will, this lot is devised to the plaintiff as follows <em>t </em>“ I. I do devise unto my granddaughter Mary C. Lloyd, daughter of my deceased daughter Mary P. Lloyd, my in-lot No. 6 on Philadelphia street in the said borough, with the buildings and appurtenances, on which said lot I now reside, to have and to hold to her my said granddaughter, her heirs and assigns forever.” Certain bequests to the plaintiff follow this devise, with provision over for such bequests in case of her death. Then, a residuum of the estate is created and disposed of as follows : “ VII. As to the rest and residuum of my estate, real and personal or mixed, after satisfaction and discharge of the <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>foregoing several devises, legacies and bequests and of my just debts and expenses óf settlement of my estate.” A division of her estate or the residue thereof into three parts immediately follows this provision. To this will there are two codicils.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.5",226,[242,536,1188,817]]]'>In no part, however, of the several provisions of this will do we find any interference with or change of the devise to the plaintiff of the lot which is the subject of this action. We are clear the devise to the plaintiff, as quoted above, “ to have and to hold to her my said granddaughter, her heirs and assigns forever,” vested in her at the death of the testatrix a fee simple estate, and no other part of the will limits or destroys it. All the elements of the grant of a fee simple estate even by deed to the plaintiff, are here found. If the expressions would create such an estate by deed, how much more by will. By a careful reading of the will, we repeat, we can discover no limitation of the fee simple estate originally devised, nor do we find any intention to incumber it with any trust by vesting the legal title primarily in a trustee; but we find the title vested on the death of the testatrix, by virtue of this devise, completely in the plaintiff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b226-6" data-blocks='[["BL_226.6",226,[242,1360,1181,814]]]'>The plaintiff having tendered to the defendant a deed in fulfilment of the written agreement, August 5, 1889, before suit, is entitled to judgment herein for the ¿.mount of purchase money due. The only ground of defence and refusal of the deed and the payment of the purchase money, set up by the defendant, being a denial that the will of the testatrix vested a title in fee simple in the plaintiff to the lot in question, we cannot sustain. As we have said, the plaintiff took under the will an estate in fee simple in the lot described in the case stated. We now direct judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $1,000, with interest from August 5, 1889, and costs, no attorney fee to be taxed. Before execution shall issue the plaintiff shall file a deed for the premises, according to the agreement, which the defendant shall have the right to lift upon delivering to the plaintiff a mortgage upon the premises for the balance of the purchase money.</p>
