Mullin, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20Pa.%20300" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 300">84 Pa. 300</a>, “is firmly settled. While the statute of 43 Elizabeth is not in force, the principles which the English Chancery has' adopted on the subject obtain here, not by virtue of the statute, but as part of our common law. The fact is that those principles were recognized and applied in England before the statute, which only introduced a new remedy. Hence, trusts for charities with us have always been upheld and enforced, no matter how uncertain were the objects, and though the effect evidently was to create a perpetuity. These have never been allowed as objections to their validity. Yet before the year 1855 it was a clear and well settled rule that when the objects of the charity were uncertain, there must be vested somewhere in a competent trustee or trustees, the discretion absolutely necessary to carry them into effect by selecting those objects. By the provision of the tenth section of the act of assembly, passed April 25, 1855, entitled, ‘ An act relating to corporations and to estates held for corporate, Religious and charitable uses,’ P. L. 331, this rule is impliedly recognized and a remedy enacted for future cases, in which <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>the donor or testator has omitted to vest such a discretion in a trustee or trustees, or it has failed to be effectual bjr the death or other disability of the person or persons whom he may have appointed. That provision is, ‘ that no disposition of property hereafter made for any religious, chaiitable, literary or scientific use shall fail for want of a trustee, or by reason of the objects being indefinite, uncertain, or ceasing, or depending upon the discretion of a last trustee, or given in perpetuity, or in excess of the annual value hereinbefore limited; but it shall be the duty of any Orphans’ Court or court having equity jurisdiction in the proper county to supply a trustee, and by its decrees to carry into effect the intent of the donor or testator, so far as the same can be ascertained and carried into effect consistently with law or equity; for which purpose the proceeding shall be instituted by leave of the attorney-general of the commonwealth, on the relation of any institution, association or individual, desirous of carrying such disposition into effect.’ ”</p>

The premises in dispute were devised by James Jones to “the Trustees of the First Presbyterian Church of the Northern Liberties of Pittsburgh, commonly called the Fourth Presbyterian Church,” for a charitable or religious use. The said church has ceased to exist as a religious organization, but, before its dissolution, conveyed the premises in dispute to trustees appointed by the presbytery to receive the same. We are not called upon to decide upon the regularity of this transaction. It is enough to say that the plaintiffs have no standing to call it in question. The trust <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>property remains, with the indelible stamp of the trust upon it, and by no failure of a trustee or the object of the trust ceasing can the property revert to the heirs of the grantor. This by force of the act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 331.</p>
    <p id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[961,561,357,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
