Sweet, testifying for the plaintiff denied that there was any agreement outside of the written contract, or that there was anything said at the execution of the contract about its being rescinded. He testified further that the proposal as to visiting other school districts in order to inspect furniture manufactured by the plaintiff, was limited to the following Monday, when the witness was to furnish the transportation for this purpose, at his own expense, but that the board did not accept this proposition.</p>

At that time the furniture at the station had not been examined or seen by Temple or by any one representing the defendant, and the refusal to accept it was based entirely upon the action taken by the board after the examination of the Coder and DuBois furniture.

The words “in accordance with the contract,” in the plaintiff’s fourth point obviously refer only to the delivery on board cars at Sidney, Ohio, consigned to S. W. Temple, and have no reference to the quality of the desks. But whether this be the true reading or not, the point should have been refused unconditionally; for, while the written contract speaks of delivery on the cars, it also says the furniture is to be paid for on arrival and shall be made of seasoned material and give good satisfaction. In such case the obligation to accept or reject arises only upon actual delivery, not upon the delivery to the carrier; the buyer is entitled to a fair opportunity to inspect, before the title passes and he can be sued for the price, and the goods must correspond with the contract: Dailey v. Green, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Pa.%20126" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 Pa. 126">15 Pa. 126</a>; Fogel v.

Dec. 728">84 Am. Dec. 728</a>). But even if a qualified affirmance of the point was right, the court should not have required the jury to find the facts stated in all of our first three points, in order to negative the plaintiff’s point; the facts stated in any one of them would be sufficient. Either the fourth or the sixth of our points, if found true, would have negatived the plaintiff’s fourth point.</p>

The plaintiff’s fifth point contained not a syllable about the desks being of such material and workmanship as the defendant was bound to accept. It should have been flatly negatived, or if affirmed with a qualification, the qualification should have embraced our fourth and sixth points, referring to all our points in the disjunctive. Plaintiff’s sixth point was, if possible, still worsé. It contained not a word about delivery anywhere, or about the desks being such as the defendant was bound to accept. Its effect was to instruct the jury that if the school board agreed to pay 1985.51 for desks of a certain kind, they must pay it whether they got the desks or not. The thirteenth point of the plaintiff has the same vice, though in a modified degree. By affirming it, and limiting the jury’s inquiry to the two facts mentioned in it, the court virtually withdrew all other material facts from the jury, including the disputed fact of performance of the contract by the plaintiff. If the furniture was far inferior to both the written and parol requirements of the contract, the plaintiff cannot recover the contract price, simply because the notice of rescission may have been a day too soon. Goods not according to the contract were shipped at the plaintiff’s peril: Fogel v. Brubaker, <a href="/citations/?q=122%20Pa.%2015" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="122 Pa. 15">122 Pa. 15</a>. But the second refusal was ten days after the arrival of the goods.</p>

The plaintiff’s fifteenth point is absolutely irreconcilable with our first three points, and they were virtually negatived by its affirmance. A stipulation that future deliveries under a contract shall be equal to a sample exhibited, may become a term of the contract and be enforced as such: Mining Co. v. Jones, <a href="/pa/108/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="108 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="539281" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0055-01">108 Pa. 55</a>. It is well settled that such a parol guaranty may be superadded to a written contract, when without the parol agreement the written one would not have been signed. Yet the jury were instructed, in the answer to the fifteenth point of the plaintiff, that the defendant was estopped from setting up the verbal agreement. The plaintiff’s eighth point should have been qualified by explaining that the jury might consider the representations and agreements that induced the signing of the contract, if made at the same interview, although not repeated at the moment of signing: Honesdale Glass Co. v. Storms, <a href="/pa/125/0268-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="125 Pa. 268" data-case-ids="563939" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0268-01">125 Pa. 268</a>.

The points involved in the first three assignments of error are virtually conceded to be correct propositions of law on the facts therein stated. The qualifications of them were as favorable as the defendant had any right to expect. The question of delivery raised by our fourth point, is well settled. Under the rule laid down in Borrekins v.

It is clear that the refusal to receive was not based upon any examinations of the desks, but on an alleged agreement giving the defendant the right to rescind. The point on this subject was drawn in accordance with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Clakk when the ease was here before: <a href="/pa/122/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="122 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="1948387" data-case-paths="/pa/122/0494-01">122 Pa. 494</a>. The argument of the appellant is erroneous in that it is based upon a supposed state of facts which the court submitted to the jury as requested, and which the jury found against the defendant.

Did the defendant’s testimony come up to the standard ? It was all admitted and submitted to the jury as the defendant requested. The court is not in fault because it failed to satisfy them. Under the evidence, the only questions for the jury were those stated in the plaintiff’s thirteenth point, which contains a correct statement of the law applicable to them. If the defendant accepted a written guaranty, it is bound by it, as a statement of the things guaranteed.</p>

Nor is there any assignment of error to the general charge, or to any portion of it. The only matters complained of arise upon the answers of the court to the points submitted by the plaintiff’s counsel. These points, it must be confessed, are very inaptly drawn. It may be remarked, generally, that the hypothesis upon which these several points were framed, respectively, in view of the evidence is wholly inadequate to support the conclusions which are sought to be drawn. Every point of law submitted for the determination of the court should be reasonably consistent with the evidence, and in such comprehensive manner that the deduction made therefrom, notwithstanding the force of the other evidence in the cause, is the logical, legal conclusion from the facts assumed. Each point submitted is to be taken as a distinct, independent proposition ; and the answer to it maybe a simple affirmation or negation of it, or, the answer may be accompanied with such qualification as is requisite to a correct exposition of the law. When a case comes before us for review, we cannot assume any fact not covered by the hypothesis set forth in the point, except such as is embraced by necessary implication. If this were not so, the court might, in some cases, affirm the points on both sides; and, whilst in the answers on one side or the other, the true rule might be given, the jury would be allowed to grope in the dark in search of it, with equal chances to arrive at a wrong or á right result. In such case the assumption of certain facts that are not stated would, if known, show the correct rulings on both sides; but the misleading tendency is such as to be manifest error. If we apply these well-established rules of practice to the instructions given to the jury in this case, we cannot avoid the conclusion that they were misleading to the jwy-</p>

These points assumed the existence of a verbal understanding at the time of the contract upon the faith of which the contract was made; and, as there was some evidence to this effect, whether or not there was any such verbal understanding, or any fraud committed, as alleged, was for the jury. The court might, therefore, with propriety, have negatived the plaintiff’s fourth, fifth, and sixth points on this ground, but chose to affirm them with the qualification, “ unless the jury further find, from the evidence in the case, the facts contended for in the defendant’s'first, second, and third points.” Having undertaken to affirm the points with this qualification, it was the duty of the court to add all the qualifications to which an absolute affirmation was necessarily subject. But we think these points of the plaintiff, if affirmed, should have been subject to further qualification. If the jury, upon a full consideration of the case, should find that the written contract was made without fraud, and without any super-added verbal understanding, upon the faith of which the contract was executed, the rights and obligations of the parties remained as expressed in the written contract. Having reference, then, to the rights of the plaintiff upon the written contract alone, in order to bind the defendant for the price, it was required of <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>the plaintiff, not only that the furniture be delivered in the ears at Sidney, Ohio, at the time specified, but that the furniture be of the kind and quality mentioned in the contract.</p>
    <p id="b110-5" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[217,512,1180,1575]]]'>In the plaintiff’s sixth point the court was requested to instruct the jury as follows: “ That if the jury find, from the evidence, that the agreement of purchase offered in evidence in this case was read over in the presence and hearing of the board of directors of the defendant corporation before signing, and was understood by them, and no objection was made by any one thereto as it was so read and signed, then said agreement is to be taken as the agreement between plaintiff and defendant corporation, and the verdict of the jury should be for the amount so agreed to be paid in favor of the plaintiff.” To this the court answered: “ Affirmed, unless the jury further find, from the evidence in the case, the facts as contained in defendant’s first, second and third points.” But suppose the jury should fail to find the facts contained in the first, second and third points of the defendant, and should find, as assumed in the point, that the written agreement was the only agreement subsisting between the parties, does it follow as a matter of law, in view of the evidence, that the verdict of the jury should be for the amount so agreed to be paid in favor of the plaintiff ? Can it be affirmed that the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict upon the proof of the written contract alone, without evidence of a delivery in pursuance of that contract, or, if there was a delivery, without evidence of the kind and quality of the desks delivered, or of a refusal on the part of the defendant to receive the furniture when it was delivered? There was, in fact, evidence upon all these points, not only of delivery, and of the kind or quality of the desks delivered, but also of a refusal on the part of the defendant to receive the desks after delivery; but this evidence was for the jury, not for the court. The hypothesis of the point was not sufficiently comprehensive, and it should have been refused; or, if affirmed, it should have been further qualified.</p>
    <p id="b110-6" data-blocks='[["BL_110.6",110,[216,2095,1171,294]],["BL_111.1",111,[228,351,1183,818]]]'>The answers to the plaintiff’s fourth and fifth points are open to similar criticism. The fourth is directed to the question of delivery alone, whilst the fifth is upon the effect of Temple’s refusal to receive the furniture on its arrival at Brockwayville. But in neither of them is it assumed, as part of the hypothetical statment of facts, that the furniture delivered, or the furni<a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>ture refused, was of the kind contracted for; and certainly, without the assumption of this fact, it could not be affirmed, as matter of law, that the “plaintiff could maintain this action to recover the amount so agreed to be paid, with interest.” It is true that the court, in affirming the defendant’s fourth point, instructed the jury that if the furniture at Brockwayville was not substantially up to the guaranty contained in the contract, and was not satisfactory to the defendant, the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant; and, in the sixth point, that if only part of the furniture shipped was in accordance with the contract, and the rest was inferior, the defendant was not bound to accept any of it. But how were the jurors to decide between these inconsistent rulings ? They were obliged to rely upon the court for instructions, and would not be expected to exercise that degree of discrimination which would enable them to reconcile the various inconsistent rulings of the court.</p>
    <p id="b111-3" data-blocks='[["BL_111.4",111,[229,1176,1182,190]]]'>The thirteenth point of the plaintiff is open to the same objection. The matters of fact assumed therein do not justify the conclusion which, by an absolute affirmation, the jury was permitted to draw therefrom.</p>
    <p id="b111-4" data-blocks='[["BL_111.5",111,[228,1383,1182,507]]]'>It is undoubtedly true, when the agreement is to make and deliver an article to the satisfaction of the person for whom it is made, the latter, acting in good faith, and not from mere caprice, may refuse to accept if, for any reason, it is really-not satisfactory to him: Singerly v. Thayer, <a href="/pa/108/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="108 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="539269" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0291-01">108 Pa. 291</a>; Seeley v.

But when the refusal to receive is made before an actual, bona fide inspection of the article, or before an opportunity is had to judge of its quality or merits, no such rule could obtain; for it would be impossible, in such a case, to decide whether the article is satisfactory or not.</p>
    <p id="b111-5" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[228,1899,1182,505]],["BL_112.1",112,[230,343,1173,1166]]]'>The agreement between the parties was in writing; and, as a general rule, where parties have deliberately put their engagements into writing, in such terms as import a legal obligation, without any uncertainty as to the object or extent of such engagement, it is conclusively presumed that the whole engagement of the parties, and the extent and manner of their undertaking, was reduced to writing; and all oral testimony of a previous colloquium between the parties, or of conversations or declarations at the time when it was completed, or afterwards,— as it would tend, in many instances, to substitute a new and dif<a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>ferent contract for the one which was really agreed upon, to the prejudice, possibly, of one of the parties, — is rejected: 1 Greenl. Ev., 351. But a written agreement may be modified, explained, reformed or altogether set aside by parol evidence of an oral promise or undertaking material to the subject-matter of the contract, made by one of the parties at the time of the execution of the writing, and which induced the other party to put his name to it: Walker v. France, <a href="/pa/112/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="112 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="546831" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0203-01">112 Pa. 203</a>; Cullmans v. Lindsay, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%20170" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="114 Pa. 170">114 Pa. 170</a>. The law esteems it a fraud by such means to procure an unfair advantage, and subsequently to deny the parol qualification upon the faith of which the eon-tract was made. In such a case, therefore, it cannot, with propriety, be said that a person, having accepted a written contract, is estopped from setting up by parol any agreement except that mentioned in the contract. The parol evidence, however, which will be effective to reform a written instrument in such a case, must be clear, precise and indubitable; that is to say, it must carry clear conviction to the minds of the jurors that the witnesses are credible, that the facts are distinctly remembered, and are truly and accurately stated; and to the mind of the court that, if the facts alleged are true, the matters in issue are definitely and distinctly established: Cullmans v. Lindsay, <a href="/citations/?q=114%20Pa.%20170" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="114 Pa. 170">supra.</a></p>
