I may note in passing a serious error in the syllabus of Grier v. Hood, in stating that “ one partner has power to confess a judgment against the firm,” etc. The words of Justice Knox, on page 432, are the reverse: “ That one partner cannot confess a judgment against another partner, even for a partnership debt, is a conceded legal principle.”</p>

    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[251,1117,1170,654]]]'>It is clear that this judgment note was signed by Thompson after the dissolution of the partnership, and after all his authority as a partner was at an end. By the terms of the dissolution Thompson sold out to Brown, and retired. Thenceforth the business was exclusively Brown’s, and the confession of judgment by Thompson was not only without authority, but in fraud of Brown’s rights. Much stress was laid by the learned counsel, at the argument, on the fact that appellant’s claim is admittedly a partnership debt, justly due by Brown as well as Thompson. But the question is not whether both partners are liable, but whether the creditors can make a short cut to judgment, by the Unauthorized act of one. This the settled rules of law prohibit.</p>
