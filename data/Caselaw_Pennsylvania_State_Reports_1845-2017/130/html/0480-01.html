(2) That her domicile was in this county, and that, therefore, a copy of the paper could not be legally admitted to probate there.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b499-9" data-blocks='[["BL_499.8",499,[223,1555,1171,351]]]'>1. Whilst the evidence shows that her mind was somewhat weak and vacillating, yet as this does not constitute testamentary incapacity, an issue as to that must be refused. It must be, also, as to the question of fraud and undue influence. There is no direct evidence to sustain this averment of the appellant, but it is claimed that it should be inferred from the facts of the case. They are substantially as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b499-10" data-blocks='[["BL_499.9",499,[220,1914,1173,504]],["BL_500.1",500,[267,369,1172,1165]]]'>On May 27, 1876, Mrs. McDonald executed a paper, as her will, in which she gave all her estate to her sister, the appellant. In July, 1885, in company with her husband, she visited friends in Ireland, stopping with her sister-in-law, Mrs. McMath, at Porta Ferry, where she executed the paper probated as her will on December 4, 1885, in which she bequeathed a legacy of one hundred and fifty pounds to Mrs. McMath, one of two hundred and fifty to Mrs. Savage her niece, one of one hundred and fifty to Capt. Conkey described as her cousin, one of twenty pounds to the poor of Porta Ferry, and gave the re<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>mainder of the estate to her husband. Prior to this visit she was not on friendly terms with Mrs. McMath and frequently expressed great dislike for her. The will was prepared by a Mr. Mount, one of the witnesses, who testified that no person was present with him when the instructions were given and it was prepared, and no person but the other witness and himself, when it was executed. Mr. McDonald, her husband, was with her almost constantly during her sickness, but when the will was being prepared, was out taking a walk, but returned before the business was finished. He testified that Mr. Savage, on his return, told him that he could not go into his wife’s room, that she was settling her affairs; that he was not allowed to go in, and did not, until after the witness had gone away; that he had no conversation with her about the will, except that on the evening after its execution, she asked him to sign an agreement that she was to do with her property as she wanted, which he promised to sign and subsequently did. He also testified, that his wife, when they were returning to Ireland from a visit to Scotland took sick at Belfast, and that at her request he telegraphed for Mrs. McMath to come there; that she came and accompanied them to her home at Porta Ferry, where Mrs. McDonald lay sick for four or five weeks, and died on December 7, 1885.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[268,1544,1171,605]]]'>The only reasons which can be given to infer undue influence, are that it is improbable that without such influence Mrs. McDonald would have bequeathed a legacy to Mrs. McMath, and none to the appellant. But, whilst it is evident that her feelings towards both had frequently changed, yet it appears that the change as to Mrs. McMath occurred prior to the time the will was made; and that when they were separated and she was in distress, she appealed to Mrs. McMath for friendly aid, and, for aught that appears in the evidence, the change as to the appellant ma}*- have occurred long prior to her visit to Ireland. These reasons, therefore, are not sufficient to justify such an inference.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[271,2156,1167,249]],["BL_501.1",501,[229,369,1171,301]]]'>2. Mrs: McDonald and her husband were domiciled in this county for a number of years prior to their visit to Ireland, and their intention was to return here after the visit. Her domicile was therefore in this county, and this court had original jurisdiction of the probate of her will. It was, however, <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>probated and filed in the probate court at Dublin, Ireland; and, as it cannot be withdrawn from the records of that court, a certified copy was admitted to probate by the register, upon proof by the subscribing witnesses as to the execution of the original, and that the copy was a true one. It is objected to this that only the original will could be admitted to probate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.4",501,[226,678,1176,865]]]'>In Foster’s App., <a href="/pa/87/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="87 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1057812" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0067-01">87 Pa.. 67</a>, it was held that when a will of a testator was lost or destroyed, its contents may be proved by parol and the will as thus reproduced admitted to probate. And it was said in Laing v. Oakly, 98 Mass..267, that the inability to produce the original will, caused by its detention in a foreign court, would make secondary evidence of its contents admissible, as much as if the papers were lost. The principal objection which can be made against permitting a lost or destroyed will to be probated, is that the contents have to be proven by oral testimony, and that too much, therefore, depends upon the memory of the witnesses. But where the will has been deposited in a foreign court and a copy of it is produced, this objection does not exist; and, as it is as much beyond the control of the parties there, as if it were lost or destroyed, a fortiori, the rule applicable to lost wills should apply. It follows therefore that the register was right in admitting the copy of the will to probate, and this appeal must be dismissed.</p>
