Standing on one of the tracks, at the right hand side of the street, was a train, the engine of which was blowing off steam.

What is negligence is a matter which must, as a rule, be left to the jury. It simply means the want of such precautions as persons of ordinary prudence and care take, under the special circumstances of the case, to prevent injury to others. So that there can be no definite rule laid down that will govern every case; but it must be left, ordinarily, to the jury to determine, whether, under the particular circumstances of the case, there was anything omitted which should have been done, or anything done which should not have been done.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[245,917,1180,1479]],["BL_405.1",405,[202,362,1180,715]]]'>In determining the question of the negligence of the defendant you will take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the place where the accident occurred. What would be reasonable care under one state of facts would be gross negligence, possibly, under another state of facts.....It is the duty of the plaintiff to make out to you satisfactorily that the defendant’s employees were guilty of negligence in the performance of their duty; and furthermore that this negligence was the cause of this accident. If you fail to find that, you may stop there and return a verdict for the defendant. But if you find that the defendant’s employees were negligent in the performance of their duties, under all the circumstances of the case, you then consider the testimony with reference to the actions of the deceased, because, as has been said to you by counsel, if the negligence of the deceased in any way contributed to-the accident, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover..... Now, the testimony upon that point is that of one witness only. There is nothing material bearing upon the question except the testimony of Mr. Irwin, who was the only person, so as far the testimony discloses, who saw this accident or knew anything at all -about it. It is not at all remarkable that the persons on the train did not ascertain it, until they got to their stopping place at the end of their run. A train passing at that rate of speed, and striking a man and knocking him off to the side of the track, would have had such a slight obstruction that the persons on the train would not have noticed it whatever. If they had run over him they would possibly have noticed the jolt, but merely striking him and knocking him off the track would be so slight an impediment to the train that it would <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>not be observed at all. And, furthermore, the evidence is that these parties were very close to the train and got upon the track when it was almost passing the crossing. Another matter that was referred to, as showing negligence on the part of the engineer is, that he pulled out his watch to look at the time. He says that was done after the bell had commenced ringing, and when he was within forty or fifty feet of .the crossing. In fact, he said it was while he was passing over the track, and as you will see, that is but a brief space of time. If the deceased then got upon the crossing, any precaution he would take would not prevent an accident, because he could not stop his train by any possibility. Therefore, he had done his duty if he looked forward to see if the track was clear before he got on the crossing.</p>

Ordinarily the rule of law is as defendant’s counsel requested me to instruct you, that a man before crossing a railroad track must stop, look and listen. It is so laid down in a number of cases. I think that it is usually applied, however, to parties who are driving, and not to parties walking. It is after all not a rule of law, but a rule of evidence only, and therefore the duty of stopping is always a question for the jury. I can say to you, as a question of law, that a man is never relieved, under any possible circumstances, from looking and listening. A man has no right to shut his eyes or stop up his ears and go into danger; and if he does, he must take the consequences and not ask any person else to pay damages for the injury done. But the question of stopping is a question which must be left, under all the circumstances, to the jury; and therefore I leave it to you in this case to say whether or not the plaintiff ought, under the circumstances, to have stopped anywhere upon this railroad, or before going upon it.] 5 Whether or not he ought to have stopped, he was not relieved, could not be relieved in any way, from the duty of looking and listening;, and if, by looking and listening, or stopping, he could have avoided this accident, you have no right to give a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>

As to the permanent obstructions, the evidence is clear that they did not obstruct the view for at least nine hundred feet, standing at a point twenty-five feet west of the first of these side tracks; and that would be far enough for a person to see a train. But the excuse for not seeing it is that on this particular night there were some piles of iron; according to the engineer, those piles of iron would limit that view to a distance of about six hundred feet. So that, as to any obstructions, unless it be these cars that were on the track, there was a clear way of at least six hundred feet that could have been seen before going upon any of the tracks. But the plaintiff’s testimony indicates that there were cars standing on one of the tracks, which one the witness was unable to state, but he says that that prevented them from seeing down the road until they had got on the tracks. On the right hand side, was this train with the engine attached which obstructed the view to some extent that way. He says that they passed on to the tracks, and after crossing a number of them that this train was upon them, as he says, within thirty feet of them before they observed it. Now, it is for you'to say whether or not after passing those cars, because he was bound to keep his eyes open all the time, if he had looked, if he had listened, would he have seen or heard this train ? If so, then he was negligent in irot seeing it before it reached within thirty feet of them. That is one element of negligence on his part. You will determine that question. As I say, they had no right to go over there without looking, and if they had looked, how far could they have seen the light after passing these cars? According to the testimony, they had forty-five feet, at least, if the cars were on the farthest of these tracks; they had forty-five feet to go before they struck the track upon which this train was coming, and after passing-those cars, by looking, they could have seen to Brushton station. Now, Mr. Irwin says that they did not see it until it was within thirty feet. I think he is mistaken about the distance. It is impossible that that could be, because he says that after he saw the train he stopped; Mr. Aiken said “ come on, we can get <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>across,” and started to go across, and tie (Irwin) caught him by the sleeve, and he turned, he halted a little, probably enough to cause the accident; he might have gotten over. A train running at fifteen miles an hour runs twenty-two feet every second, and if it was only thirty feet away it was only one and a half seconds after they saw the train before Mr. Aiken went across; so that it must have been further away than that.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b407-5" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[190,742,1179,806]]]'>Then comes another question: After they had seen it, was he guilty of a lack of caution in attempting to get over ? Now, that depends somewhat on the circumstances, as I have said. If they came upon the tracks without any negligence upon their part, without having omitted to do what they ought to have done, and then while the danger was upon them, suddenly, without being caused by their negligence, they mistook which course was the prudent one, which course was the safe one, he would not necessarily be guilty of negligence. But if they had time to see how far that train was off, and he undertook recklessly to go in front of it, it was negligence on his part, and the plaintiff ought not to recover. Now, it seems to me this gives you the general ideas. I have not attempted to give all the facts and circumstances' bearing upon this matter, but just simply such as will give you a general idea of how you will consider the case.....</p>

The evidence produced to prove negligence of the defendant was hardly, if any, more than a mere scintilla; but we do not propose to take up time in arguing this point, and pass at once to the duty of the deceased.

There was no testimony showing clearly and conclusively that if the deceased had stopped before entering, upon the crossing, he could then either have seen or heard this approaching train. On the contrary, a calculation based upon the rate at which the train was running, and the assumption that the deceased was traveling-two miles per hour, will show that, had he stopped twenty-five feet from the first rail on the side of the crossing where he entered, the train would then have been over 1,000 feet away and entirely out of sight; and, as the wind was blowing in such a direction as to carry the sound away from him, and a locomotive was blowing off steam upon his right, the question whether <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>be could have heard this train coming was for the jury.

It is claimed that the deceased should have stopped, looked and listened whilst upon the spur tracks, and should either have stood still or retreated, when he saw the train coming. The evidence is that he did stop somewhere on these spur tracks, before coming to the main track upon which the train was approaching, and the law presumes that he looked and listened. There is no evidence that he was familiar with the crossing, and knew that these were spur tracks, or that they were a place of safety. If he lost his presence of mind through the rapid and unexpected approach of the train, negligently driven, and being unable, by reason of the darkness and his want of knowledge of the tracks, to determine on which one it was coming, and whilst.thus confused unintentionally ran into instead of out of danger, the company is liable: Whart. on Neg., §§ 93, 304, 377; Penna.

The deceased, at 9 o’clock on a rather dark night in January, was walking along Penn avenue, in the borough of Wilkinsburgh, and came to the railroad, which at that point had then ten or eleven tracks at grade, occupying a space of about one hundred fifty feet. It was intrinsically a dangerous place, and at the particular time was made more than usually so by standing cars and piles of pipe and railroad ties which obstructed the view on one side, and on the other side a train on one of the tracks, with an engine blowing off steam. In the face of these manifest dangers, the deceased and his companion walked straight on, without stopping, until they had crossed six or seven tracks, when they saw an approaching train. At this moment they were either on a spur track that ends a few feet beyond the crossing, or between it and the first passenger track, on which the train was coming. Counting the spur tracks as safe, they had a space of forty-five feet of actual safety in which to wait the passage of the train; but as there is no evidence that they knew that the so-called spur tracks were not ordinary tracks, liable to be used at any time, it is hardly proper to charge them with the knowledge. But from the nearest spur track which they were on, or had just crossed, to the passenger track on which the train was, there was a clear space of twelve feet, in which deceased might have waited in safety, and in which, fortunately for himself, his companion did wait.</p>

Q. That is, to the main track? A. Yes, sir; and it was pretty close before we seen it; and Mr. Aiken attempted to go on,.and I stopped. I said: ‘We had better stop;’ and he says, ‘Come on; we can get across; ’ and he started, and I stopped. I had attempted to get across, and by the time I was at the track I could lay my hand on the engine.” None of these facts were in the slightest doubt, for the evidence was in behalf of the plaintiff, and was that of the only witness who saw the accident. It is therefore indisputable that the deceased saw the train while he Avas <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>in á place of safety, and voluntarily took the chances of crossing in front of it. In the face of this patent fact, the other circumstances — the danger of the place, the rate of speed of the train, the absence of warning, the obstructions to sight and hearing, etc. — became totally unimportant, and the plaintiff should have been nonsuited, or a verdict directed against her.</p>

That was said by our Brother Sterrett, in his opinion, to be a close case; but, in laying down the rule that a man in a position of danger is not responsible for a mistake of judgment in getting out, he was careful to add the explicit qualification that he must have got into the danger without negligence or fault of his own. Keeping this qualification in mind, that case was the logical sequence of Johnson v.

But in the present case the essential premise is wanting. Aiken not only walked into the dangerous position without any of the precautions which the situation required, but, when confronted with the actual emergency, had his attention called by his companion to the danger imminent, and his reply, “ Come on; we can get across,” — does not indicate a man who was confused, and in doubt what to do, but one who saw the risk, and chose to encounter it.</p>

It is made quite as much for the safety and protection of passengers on the train as of passengers on the highway; and the stopping is an essential part of <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>the rule, to enforce attention to the accompanying duties of looking and listening, and to secure their performance in something more than a perfunctory and heedless way; in fact, to prevent the very thing which cost this unfortunate man his life. Irwin was asked: “ Could you hear the train until you got past these obstructions? A. Possibly we might have, if we had been paying particular attention. We were talking, and I didn’t notice.” It is not a rule of evidence, but a rule of law, peremptory, absolute and unbending; and the jury can never be permitted to ignore it, to evade it, or to pare it away by distinctions and exceptions. That failure to stop is not merely evidence of negligence, but negligence per se, has been said so often, from North Penna. R. Co. v. Heileman, <a href="/pa/49/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="49 Pa. 60" data-case-ids="998459" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0060-01">49 Pa. 60</a>, to Greenwood v.

    <p id="b413-5" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[222,1147,1180,302]]]'>The evidence in the sixth assignment, relative to the speed at which trains <em>usually </em>ran over this crossing, was irrelevant, and tended to divert the attention of the jury from the particular case to the general condition of danger at this crossing. This objection was not obviated by the testimony of Irwin that he thought the train was going “ about the usual rate of speed.”</p>
