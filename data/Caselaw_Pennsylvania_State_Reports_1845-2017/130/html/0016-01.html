To cite the cases establishing this doctrine would appear to be an affectation of expertness at case hunting. While such a contract, then, can be enforced, we must carefully consider the rules within whichit must be brought. It is, in the first iustance, necessary for the court to determine as a question of law whether the evidence is sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the statute: Overmeyer v.

To establish such a contract, its terms must be shown by full, complete, satisfactory and indubitable proof; the evidence must define the boundaries and fix the consideration; exclusive and notorious possession must have been taken under it, and continuously maintained; and the contract must have been so far in part performed that compensation in damages would be inadequate, and rescission inequitable and unjust: Anderson v.

He says, substantially, that he had a verbal bargain with Scott about it in May, 1867. He describes the land as the same he pointed out to Mr. Whitworth, who made a survey of it in August, 1881. He says the price agreed upon was $100, no more, no less; that he took possession the fall of that year; that he^was to pay him as he pleased; that if he could not pay him in six years without interest, he could pay him in fifteen; that he could pay him with coal or money or anything else; that after he took possession, in September, 1867, he built a frame two-story house, furnishing all the materials, and hiring John Scott, the defendant, to build it; that this house cost him about $1,800; that he put up other buildings, and fenced the lot; that he built the fence in 1868; that Mr. Scott showed him where to put the fence all around the lot; that he paid Mr. Scott for his work on the house; that the stable was built on the ground adjoining that the plaintiff originally bought; that Scott told him that if the lot he first sold him was not enough, he would give him more; and that in pursuance of this contract with the defendant, he erected his stable on the ground the defendant told him to take in addition to what he originally pointed out. The plaintiff further testifies that he took possession of the whole of this land in pursuance of this contract with the defendant, immediately after it, made the improvements, and has been on it ever since. The plaintiff further claims that he paid the entire purchase money in coal and cash furnished to the defendant.</p>

He said the land was np on the hill. Scott pointed np the hill from the shop and said he had sold a piece of land. We were at the shop when he pointed up the hill. He pointed toward the place where our present house is. He said the property was to be from centre of railroad 100 feet deep into the hill, and 45 feet wide along the railroad. He said the whole place was to be 45 feet wide. Upon the hill it was to run to Judge Buffington’s land. I cannot tell whose land was to run on the lower side. John Scott said it was to run on the lower side to John Steinmet’s; on the upper or northern side it was to run to Buffington’s land. I saw Mr. Whitworth measure the land. I was in the yard at the time when Scott showed Schuey the lines around the place. This was after we had built the house. Mr. Whitworth went to the same place Scott pointed out to Schuey, of which I have spoken. Scott built the house for us. Schuey got him to build it. Mr. Williard built the stable for Mr. Schuey.” She further states that they have lived in the property since 1867, occupying to the lines to which they now claim. Then, she further says: “ At first we bought the land where the house is and then found we had not enough and asked him for some more for the stable and kitchen. And he said what you ask me for; take so much you want and build where you want. This was after the house was built, may be one or two years...... Scott showed us where to put the stable. I asked Scott several times for the deed, but one morning he said that when he came back from Virginia he would give us a deed and would settle and make everything right with us.” She further testifies to making several payments on the lot.</p>

The answer of the defendant to these is somewhat evasive. To the first he replies: “ I deny the averments contained in the first paragraph of the plaintiff’s bill as therein alleged.” The second is in the same form, and so also the third; while the fourth paragraph of the answer denies that the defendant ever signed any writing by himself or agent, selling or agreeing to sell the ground described in the plaintiff’s bill, to him.</p>

An answer must be full and perfect to all the material allegations in the bill; it must confess, avoid, deny or traverse all the material parts of it. To so much of the bill as is necessary and material for the defendant to answer, he must speak directly and without evasion, and he must not merely answer the several charges literally, but he must confess or traverse the substance of each charge: Brightly’s Eq., § 677. The rule is laid down clearly in Pusey v. Wright, <a href="/citations/?q=31%20Pa.%20395" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="31 Pa. 395">31 Pa. 395</a> : ■“ If a contract be set forth, and the defendant be called on to answer, a denial that it exists, modo et forma, would not be good, according to chancery practice, for this is subject to the implication that it existed in some other form. To avoid this, the defendant should state how it existed and wherein it had no existence.” This rule has not been observed in the defendant’s answer, nor are we enlightened by the testimony of the defendant in the case. It appears, however, that after these proceedings were instituted and progressed, the defendant died. When he made his answer, however, he was in full life and his failure to deny the averments of the plaintiff, if they were not in fact <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>true, is an element proper to be considered with the other evidence in the case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-4" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[218,474,1182,1422]]]'>In view, then, of the evidence we have briefly epitomized, together with the paucity of evidence from the defendant in denial, we entirely agree with the master in his finding that there was a contract of purchase and sale between the parties for so much of the land as is described as being 45 feet by 100 feet, on which the house and some of the out-buildings are erected, so far executed that it would now be inequitable to rescind it. . As to the balance of the ground claimed by the plaintiff, we are not so clear. We would hesitate to direct a conveyance for that, were it not for the satisfactory evidence that this part of the ground has also been improved by the plaintiff by the erection of a stable thereon. This stable, it would appear from the evidence, was erected with the knowledge of the defendant and he also actually pointed out the ground to the plaintiff on which he was to build and on which it was actually built and thereafter occupied, thus including that portion of the lot in the original purchase; the plaintiff claiming that by the original purchase for the §100, he was to have the lot first described and what more was necessary, immediately adjoining it, for his buildings. These facts would estop the defendant from denying the plaintiff’s title to that portion of the ground. “ Where one advises and encourages another to enter upon land and invest money or expend labor, assuring him that he will thereby acquire title, he cannot call in question such title:” Woodward v. Tudor, <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20382" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="81* Pa. 382">81* Pa. 382</a>. This is so, although the encouraging party acted in ignorance of his own rights. It is but the reiteration of a doctrine well established by the authorities, and repeated in Putnam v.

C. J. Gibson says, in Rerick v. Kern, 14 S. &amp; R. 271: “ But a license may become an agreement on valuable consideration; as, where the enjoyment of it must necessarily be preceded by the expenditure of money, and when the grantee has made improvements or invested capital in consequence of it, he has becom^ a purchaser for a valuable consideration. Such a grant <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>is a direct encouragement to expend <em>money, </em>and it would be against all conscience to annul it, as soon as tbe benefit expected, from tbe expenditure is beginning to be perceived.” This is the doctrine, also, of Young v. Glendenning, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%20509" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 W. 509">6 W. 509</a>. These cases are expressly approved in Big Mountain Imp.

This appears to be true. The evidence submitted, however, before the master, embraced all the land the plaintiff seeks, and shows he was in the actual possession of it since the improvements were made on it. We have thus the whole subject before us. It is true, our equity practice is controlled by particular rules, as well as that of our law courts. While we would not relax, unnecessarily, these rules, it was well said by Chief Justice Lowrie, in Troxell v.

Then, again, Danzeisen’s App., <a href="/pa/73/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="73 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1032279" data-case-paths="/pa/73/0065-01">73 Pa. 65</a>, where a bill had been dismissed because it alleged a trust, and the evidence failed to establish it at nisi prius, the Supreme Court reversed, being of opinion the facts showed a mortgage, though the bill contained no allegation to that effect, in order to do equity and reach the justice of the case, saying: “Wecannot turn the plaintiff out of court by reason of the inappropriate terms used in the bill, indicating a trust instead of a mortgage.” So also, in Postlethwaite’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>, Justice Sharswood says, “ It is evident that the jurisdiction of the court having attached, by the presentation of the petition, it had entire control of the subject that a court of equity would have.

By the terms of the contract he was to pay the defendant in cash and coal. It is in evidence the plaintiff was digging coal, after he bought this land, and delivered some to the defendant, some to other parties, the defendant lifting the money. This continued from 1867 up to 1870 or 1871. It was out of these transactions the plaintiff contends he had paid the purchase money. It is in evidence, however, that to No. 880 March Term 1874, the plaintiff sued the defendant to recover for coal delivered in pursuance of his contract with defendant. In this action, the plaintiff filed a statement of many items of coal and other transactions from 1867 to 1870. This case was tried in December, 1876, in which the plaintiff recovered judgment for $436.41, which was subsequently collected by execution in full. By an inspection of the record and the testimony in that case, we cannot doubt that the plaintiff recovered from the defendant for all the coal he had delivered to him or for him to other parties. In his testimony, the plaintiff, on his cross-examination, said, in answer to the question: “ Do you know what amount of coal you delivered to Scott or upon his order for or on account of the purchase money of the alleged land purchase ? ” A. “ I cannot tell you that for sure, because they are all up at the court house in the suit that was tried between Scott and me. Not all the coal that Scott got was not included in that account. The extra coal was not in. By the extra coal, I mean the slack and nut coal. The slack and nut coal was not included in the account at the court house.” Q. “Have you any account of the amount of slack and nut coal which you call extra coal, which was delivered to Scott or upon his order ? ” A. “ I had, but it is lost.” Q. “ Do you recollect the times of the delivery of the slack or nut coal, or extra coal, or the persons to whom the saftie was delivered ? ” A. “ Scott <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>got the nut and slack from me from the beginning to the last.

    <p class="summary" id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[211,648,1177,1166]]]'>Now, by looking at the plaintiff’s account filed to the case tried in 1876, all these parties are named as having received coal between the dates indicated. There are also items against the defendant for slack coal delivered to him. It appears, then, that the case tried in 1876, settled all the moneys coming to the plaintiff from the defendant for coal delivered. At all events, it embraced all their coal transactions and cash accounts between 1867 and 1871. In Hibshman v. Dulleban, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%20191" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="4 W. 191">4 W. 191</a>, the doctrine of the Duchess of Kingston’s Case, 11 St. T. 261, is fully recognized. The judgment of a court of concurrent jurisdiction directly upon the point, is good as a plea in bar; or, as evidence conclusive between the same parties in the same matter directly in another court. “ Whatever was claimed by the narr and could have been tried in the former suit between the parties, is presumed to have been included in a general settlement thereof, and the burden of proof is upon the party alleging otherwise: ” Moser v. Trust Co., 2 Cent. R. 808. To the same effect are the utterances of Head v. Meloney, <a href="/pa/111/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="111 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="545329" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0099-01">111 Pa. 99</a>. We are of opinion, therefore, that the coal and other transactions resulting in an indebtedness by the defendant to the plaintiff, out of which the purchase money was to be paid for this land, were settled, or are presumed to have been settled, in the case tried between them in 1876.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b43-6" data-blocks='[["BL_43.5",43,[217,1830,1172,609]],["BL_44.1",44,[242,384,1176,1004]]]'>We are also persuaded to this conclusion by the declaration of this court, through Judge Boggs. On January 18, 1877, the defendant, Scott, presented a petition to Judge Boggs, reciting certain judgments he held against the plaintiff and asked that they be credited upon the judgment recovered in 330 March Term 1874. This was refused in an opinion by Judge Boggs, saying: “ In view of the evidence given on the trial of the cause tending to show that the purchase money of a certain lot of ground was embraced in the claim sued for and recovered in this case, and had been applied as payment of such purchase money as alleged by the plaintiff, while the defendant alleged he had never sold the ground to the plaintiff or his <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>wife, which the plaintiff contended he did sell to him and contended the purchase money was paid, but sued for and recovered in this case, to save it from the statute of limitations, this controversy respecting the sale and purchase of a lot of ground has never been settled, either by the parties or by law,” therefore, the application to make the set-off was refused. We are, therefore, of the opinion, before the plaintiff is allowed to lift the deed, which we will direct the defendant’s administrator to make, the purchase money should be paid. It appears to us, from the evidence, the purchase money was to have been paid in six instalments from May, 1867. This would be $16.66 a year. The interest, therefore, on this would amount to $112.92. We will direct, therefore, the following decree to be made. We think this is a proper case to divide the costs between the parties. It was in the power of the plaintiff to have allowed a credit for the purchase money on the case tried between the parties in 1876, or to have paid it into court since in this proceeding the defendant is also in fault in not delivering or offering a deed. Dull’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20510" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="118 Pa. 510">118 Pa. 510</a>, is in point as to costs.</p>

Upon failure of the plaintiff to pay such sum within three months from this date, the defendant may proceed for its collection. It is further directed, that the costs of this proceeding be equally divided between the plaintiff and the defendant’s estate. A decree will be formally drawn up accordingly.</p>
