Defendant\u2019s truck,- which was being driven north on Broad Street, suddenly, without warning, turned into Ridge Avenue and struck plaintiff, when the latter was in plain view of the chauffeur and had not gone more than ten feet in his passage across the street.\nThe issues as to the alleged negligence of defendant and contributory negligence of plaintiff were all submitted to the jury and found in favor of the latter. Defendant has appealed, contending that it is entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict; with this conclusion, we cannot agree.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",
