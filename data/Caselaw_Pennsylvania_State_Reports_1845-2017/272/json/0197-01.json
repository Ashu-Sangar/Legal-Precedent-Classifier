After the death of both of my said daughters, the real estate, if still owned by either of them, I give, devise and bequeath the same unto my three sons, Joseph Grundler, Frank Grundler and Wenzel Grundler or their respective heirs and assigns forever, share and share alike.\u2019 Caroline [unmarried] and Mary (the husband of the latter joining) entered into an agreement to sell and convey, in fee, the real estate mentioned, and subsequently tendered a deed to the purchaser, who refuses to comply with her contract, alleging that the grantors cannot convey \u2018a good and marketable title.\u2019......The only contingency on which depends the right of the sons to take cannot happen if the contract involved is carried into effect by conveying the land. It is immaterial whether the daughters [plaintiffs] took a fee or a life estate with power of alienation, the purchaser will take a fee: see Edwards et al. v. Newland, 271 Pa. 1.\u201d\nThe will here in question clearly confers the right of alienation on the daughters; and this is enough to sustain the disposition of the case made by the court below.\nJudgment affirmed",
