        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nThis is a proceeding in equity,' under section 1 of the Act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360, by the Pioneer Coal Company against the Cherrytree & Dixonville Railroad Company, to restrain the latter from building what it claims to be an extension of a branch road, and what plaintiff contends is a mere spur or siding facility for the private use and benefit of a competing coal company; the injunction was granted and defendant has appealed.\nPlaintiff has some 1,800 acres of coal land in Indiana County, mined by another company, the latter owning the stock of the former; defendant operates a railroad in the vicinity, a spur or branch of which, leading from a portion of the railroad known as the \u201cBuck Run Branch,\u201d is employed as a siding by plaintiff in taking coal from its \u201cRodkey\u201d mine; this section of road, hereinafter called \u201cRodkey Spur,\u201d is approximately 2,200 feet long, was built in 1905, and since that time has been used solely for transporting coal from plaintiff\u2019s mine, constituting the only railroad outlet for that purpose; the condemnation proceedings enjoined in this case were \u201cbrought in connection with a proposed extension of the Rodkey Spur eastwardly fifteen hundred feet to lands of the Indiana Moshannon Coal Company, in the course of which seven hundred and fifty lineal feet of surface, an acreage of 1.047, owned by the plaintiff......, are to be taken,\u201d and \u201cthe proposed taking will appropriate also eighty feet of the eastern end of the Rodkey Spur itself\u201d; this will interfere with the operation of plaintiff\u2019s mine and thus materially injure that company.\nIn addition to the facts already stated, the court below found the following: Defendant\u2019s road was built by other and larger railroad corporations, \u201cas and for a public steam railroad, with all the rights of......eminent domain\u201d; when the present condemnation proceedings were begun, on January 19, 1920, this railroad was under \u201cfederal control, operation and management,\u201d and \u201cthe Director General of Railroads\u201d was not made a party to the proceedings; such control terminated on March 1, 1920; plaintiff had \u201cmore than one hundred thousand tons of coal unmined at the Rodkey operation,\u201d on August 28, 1920, and, \u201clabor conditions permitting,\u201d this might be produced at the rate of \u201cabout two hundred tons per day.\u201d Defendant suggests that by now plaintiff\u2019s coal must be approaching exhaustion; but, of course, as to this, we have no knowledge.\nThese facts, among others, appear in the chancellor\u2019s answers to plaintiff\u2019s requests: The Indiana Moshannon Coal Company is the only interest that will at present be served by the extension of the Rodkey Spur, and those concerned could be served equally well from the main line of defendant railroad. On the other hand, the chancellor found, at defendant\u2019s request, that the ground on which the spur in question is laid was owned in fee by defendant company, having been conveyed to it by plaintiff in 1908; and he refused to find, as desired by plaintiff, that defendant had not taken \u201cproper corporate action\u201d to support its proposed appropriation, or that its board of directors had not passed the necessary resolution authorizing the taking of the land intended to be appropriated.\nThe court below placed its final conclusion, granting the injunction, squarely on the ground that \u201cdefendant railroad company, under the guise of an exercise of the power.......to condemn for the construction of a \u2018branch,\u2019 is attempting to take land privately owned for the construction of what cannot be considered a \u2018branch\u2019 within contemplation [of the law], consequently it is endeavoring to exercise a power not possessed under its franchise......\u201d; and, the court adds, this \u201cis not the abuse of a franchise power, which admittedly can be questioned only by the Commonwealth, but rather an effort to exercise a nonexistent power which may be successfully contended against by an individual under authority of the Act of 1871.\u201d\nDefendant contends that, on the facts in this case, the above conclusions are wrong, for several reasons, which we shall presently discuss; while plaintiff takes the position that not only are those conclusions correct in every particular, but the chancellor should have rested his injunction on the additional grounds that no proper resolution to authorize the condemnation had been proved as duly passed by defendant\u2019s board of directors, and that such proceedings were void in law because not joined in by the director general of railroads. Neither of these latter positions were adopted by the trial tribunal, although urged upon it.\nIt is contended by defendant that plaintiff failed to show a case for relief under the Act of 1871; in Gring v. Sinking Spring Water Co., 270 Pa. 232, this court recently gave rather elaborate consideration to that statute, during the course of which (p. 237) we said that section 1 of the act (eliminating certain words unnecessary to an understanding of its terms) provides: \u201cIn all proceedings, in courts of law or equity, in which it is alleged that the private rights of individuals are injured by any corporation claiming to have a right or franchise to do -the act from which such injury results, it shall be the duty of the court to examine, inquire and ascertain whether such corporation does in fact possess the right or franchise to do the act from which such alleged injury results, and, if such right or franchise has not been conferred upon such corporation, such courts shall restrain such injurious acts.\u201d\nThe opinion we are now discussing (Gring v. Water Co.) states (p. 238) that \u201cthe cases where relief was granted\u201d under the act fall within several classes, and one of these is there designated thus: \u201c(2) those in which, though the power [in a general sense, to do the thing complained of], was apparently given by the corporation\u2019s charter, it was attempted to be exercised in a manner, for a purpose or to an extent not authorized by law.\u201d Immediately after our list of classifications, we reviewed the authorities which give rise thereto and (pp. 240-241) cited, inter alia, examples of what is meant by \u201cin a manner,\u201d \u201cfor a purpose,\u201d and \u201cto an extent,\u201d as used above. Edwards v. Pittsburgh Junc. R. R. Co., 215 Pa. 597, 602, is mentioned as an instance of an attempt to exercise an alleged franchise power \u201cin a manner\u201d not authorized by law; Bly v. White D. M. W. Co., 197 Pa. 80, \u201cfor a purpose,\u201d and Boalsburg Water Co. v. State College Water Co., 240 Pa. 198, \u201cto an extent\u201d not so authorized. We had no intention, however, to use the phrase \u201cin a manner\u201d as covering procedural points, and this is clearly indicated at page 238 of the opinion; nor did we intend the phrase \u201cfor a purpose......not authorized by law\u201d in a broad, comprehensive sense, but only in that suggested by the authority we had in mind. In other words, we did not mean to intimate that the state\u2019s right of inquiry into the purpose for which a franchise was to be used could be assumed by the plaintiff in an equity suit brought according to the Act of 1871; and the comment connected [With our mention of Bly v. White Co., at the bottom of page 243, shows this, as also does our citation of other icases (p. 244), asserting the right of the State, under circumstances quite similar to those in the Bly case, to make such inquiry to the exclusion of private complainants ; on the latter point see also Mountz v. Pittsburgh, B. & L. E. R. R. Co., 265 Pa. 67.\nWhat the Gring Case, as a whole, stands for, so far as the meaning of the Act of 1871 is concerned, plainly appears by the following excerpts from the opinion (p. 241, 242, 246) : \u201cThe question, in each case of the character of the one now before ns, is as to the existence of the charter right, and, if found, then, Is the corporation defendant attempting to exercise its franchise under circumstances authorized by law? \u2014 for it can possess the right only to that extent......; each decision, from one aspect or another, turns on the theory of the nonexistence, under the attending circumstances, of a charter right to do the particular thing in question, the rule seeming to be that inquiry in a proceeding resting on the statute must bear some direct relation to the ascertainment of a charter power or right to commit the act complained of, and that restraint can be granted only on a \"finding of either the nonexistence of the power or its nonexistence for the purposes to which it is being put to the injury of the complainant......; both the actual words of the legislation before us and the decisions in point indicate that, in order to entitle one to the equitable remedy which the statute provides, defendant, when [properly] challenged, must have failed to show a charter power to do the act complained of, or it must be shown that something essential to the rightful exercise of the power sought to be asserted is lacking, or that some act has been committed which is so closely connected with defendant\u2019s right to exercise the power in question as in effect to constitute a charter prohibition against its assertion under the facts in the particular case, but when any of these conditions appear, equitable relief is available, \u2014 it always being understood, however, that the statute does not clothe the courts, at the instance of a private suitor, with the Commonwealth\u2019s general powers of inquiry.\u201d Numerous cases, illustrative of these general principles, will be found reviewed on their facts in the authority from which the above-quoted excerpts are taken.\nAppellee concedes, if the enjoined portion of defendant\u2019s road may properly be classed as a branch, then the court below erred. In McAboy\u2019s Appeal, 107 Pa. 548, 557-8, we said that the question whether a proposed piece of railroad was a branch did not \u201cdepend either upon its length or direction\u201d; that any \u201csection\u201d of the road, whether it were an offshoot of the main road or of another section, might be a branch within the meaning of the law. If the section of defendant\u2019s road here in question is a branch, that concedediy is the end of plaintiff\u2019s case; or, as we shall show later, if the part in controversy is to be built for a public use, whether a branch or not, defendant, under the facts in this case, cannot be restrained. On the other hand, if, as the court below states, defendant, \u201cunder the guise of an exercise of its power to construct a branch,\u201d is using its right of eminent domain for the purpose of constructing a mere private siding, not for public use, the Act of 1871 was properly invoked.\nWe cannot, however, agree with the court below that, either in deciding whether the section of road complained of is a branch, or in determining whether or not it is Intended for public use, a rule of strict construction is to be applied, if by \u201cstrict construction\u201d is meant that, on a review of the evidence, all doubts must be resolved against the corporation; on the contrary, the rule is that \u201cthe burden of showing the company is exercising franchises which it does not possess is on those alleging that [the corporation] is attempting to do what it is not authorized to do \u2014 construct a railroad for purely private purposes\u201d (Deemer v. Bells Run R. R. Co., 212 Pa. 491, 493); the corporate directors have power to decide as to the location of, and public necessity for, an extension of any part of the road, be it a branch or otherwise (Mayor of Pittsburgh v. Penna. R. R., 48 Pa. 355, 359; McAboy\u2019s App., supra, 557), and it is to be assumed, unless the contrary is plainly shown, that such officials, like all other officials, have performed their duty in good faith, when they declare a public necessity for an extension, or when they designate it as a branch; \u201cit is not the special use made [of a section of road] which characterizes it [as a part of the public road], but its convenient necessity to that part which is [undeniably] for public use\u201d (P., W. & B. R. R. Co. v. Williams, 54 Pa. 103, 107); finally, the mere fact that some selfish interest may have inspired the plan for the part in controversy in no sense prevents that section from being classed as a \u201cbranch\u201d road, or for public use: Oliver v. Thompson\u2019s Run Bridge Co., 197 Pa. 344, 346. The learned chancellor seems to have overlooked most of these rules, and we incline to the belief that the court below erred in its mixed conclusion of fact and law that the section of road here enjoined was not a branch; but it is not necessary to rest our decision on that point, since, under the Pennsylvania authorities, it plainly appears that, even were the section in question properly classed as a \u201cspur,\u201d or a \u201csiding,\u201d the evidence fails to show it was not to be constructed for a public use, and if the use can be classed as of this character, the proposed condemnation would be an exercise of defendant\u2019s franchise, which could not be enjoined under the Act of 1871.\nWhat constitutes public use is a point not free from difficulties, but wherever it appears from the attending circumstances that a section of road about to be constructed will in'some direct way tend to contribute to the general public welfare, or the welfare of a considerable element of the public, it cannot be said that it will not serve a public use; this principle is now too well established in Pennsylvania to be questioned: Getz\u2019s App., 10 W. N. C. 453, 456, cited with approval in Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co. v. Stowe Twp., 252 Pa. 149, 160; Lycoming Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 608, 611. Here, conceding that the extension under discussion will be largely employed to take coal from the Moshannon Company\u2019s properties, yet, since it must also be conceded that the life, happiness and prosperity of the people of Pennsylvania depend to a very large degree upon getting the coal supply of the State out of the mines, on its way to the consumer, this in itself, on the facts at bar, stamps a project like that before us as one for public use, sufficiently to justify the exercise of the right of eminent domain.\nIn the instant case, the original extension from the main line was toward the mine of the complainant; now it is to be carried further on, so as to open up another and very considerable field, and it may be that, in the future, further extensions, by branches or otherwise, will be called for to satisfy patrons who require transportation facilities, and to serve public needs. There are no facts present sufficient to overcome the presumption that defendant corporation is doing what it conceives to be its duty as a common carrier, bound to keep up with public demands, or to indicate that it will not continue to so act in the future; but, if at any time it fails in these regards, \u201cthe remedy is through appropriate proceeding instituted by the Commonwealth\u201d: Rudolph v. Schuylkill Valley R. R. Co., 166 Pa. 430, 437, 444; Vinton Colliery Co. v. Blacklick, etc., R. R. Co., 226 Pa. 131, 135; Pittsburgh, etc., Co. v. Stowe Twp., 252 Pa. 149, 161; Mountz v. Pittsburgh, B. & L. E. R. R. Co., 265 Pa. 67, 69.\nThe case largely depended upon by appellee, Edgewood R. R. Co.\u2019s App., 79 Pa. 257, 270, \u2014 where we say, what of course is still the rule, that owners of land \u201chave the right to demand the interposition of those safeguards [provided by the Act of 1871] when private property is appropriated [under the guise of serving a public use] for a strictly private use\u201d (see also Smedley v. Erwin, 51 Pa. 445, 451; Mory v. Oley Valley Ry. Co., 199 Pa. 152, 155; Deemer v. Bells Run Ry. Co., 212 Pa. 491, 493; Vinton Colliery Co. v. Blacklick, etc., R. R. Co., 226 Pa. 131, 135), \u2014 Is distinguished on its facts from the case at bar, for there the railroad itself was in no sense a public one, while here there is no doubt of the public character of defendant\u2019s road. This distinction of Edgewood\u2019s App., which is noted by us in a number of subsequent cases (see Rudolph v. Schuylkill Valley R. R. Co., 166 Pa. 430, 436; Windsor Glass v. Carnegie Co., 204 Pa. 459, 466; Gring v. Sinking Spring Water Co., 270 Pa. 282, 239), also applies to McCandless\u2019s App., 70 Pa. 210. We have examined all the authorities cited by plaintiff and think none of them controls the present controversy in its favor; this case, on the main points involved, falls more within the principle of Getz\u2019s App., supra.\nIt is the general rule that inquiry under the Act of 1871 is not permitted \u201cconcerning the regularity of a condemnation from mere procedural standpoints\u201d: Gring v. Sinking Spring Water Co., 270 Pa. 232, 238; Williams v. D., L. & W. R. R., 255 Pa. 133, 144. This rule is sufficient answer to plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant had failed to prove the resolution for the appropriation to have been actually passed by its directors; although a copy of such resolution was accepted in evidence. The rule also answers the contention that the director general of railroads had not joined in the appropriation. Both of these points involve questions of procedure, which might be raised in the condemnation proceedings proper, but have no place in an equity suit under the Act of 1871, since neither of them, if sustained in fact, would tend to show that defendant had acted in the premises beyond its franchise rights.\nIt is true that, in Gring v. Sinking Spring Water Co., 270 Pa. 232, 252 et seq., we discussed the subject of proving a resolution authorizing appropriation, and suggested the advisability of showing all relevant facts in connection therewith; but this was to meet the manner in which that particular case was being tried, and, so far as possible, to have the matter disposed of for the satisfaction of those concerned, since the record was about to be sent back for further hearing. We did not intend to lay down any principle contrary to the general rule that inquiry under the Act of 1871 is confined to the charter or franchise rights of the defendant corporation and does not comprehend examination into alleged defects of procedure in asserting such rights; although, of course, \u201cwhether the proposed construction be a siding or a branch, in either case, when property [is] condemned, such taking must be by a corporate act, with as much formality as though it were a part of the main roadbed\u201d: Lycoming Edison Co. v. Public Service Commission, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 608, 612, by Kephart, J. On the general subject of corporate action to condemn, see also Boalsburg Water Co. v. State College Water Co., 240 Pa. 198, 209. But, returning to the point urged by plaintiff (appellee), that the actual passage by the defendant company\u2019s directors of the above-mentioned resolution had not been proved, we may add, to what has been said previously concerning this matter, that the relevant findings, to the extent they go, favor appellant, as hereinbefore indicated, therefore appellee is not in a position (on this, its opponent\u2019s, appeal) to question the fact of the resolution in any manner; and our opinion in State Hospital v. Consolidated Water Supply Company, 267 Pa. 29, 38, 39 (cited by appellee), contains nothing to the contrary. That case, so far as the point in hand is concerned, turned on the well-established rule that an appellee may, to sustain the decision appealed from, suggest legal reasons other than those depended on by the court below; it in no sense justifies the contention that one may, to support a decree in his favor, depend on facts which the trial court expressly refused to find, yet that is what the present appellee would do.\nIn conclusion, whether or not the appropriation of plaintiff\u2019s land is in any way defective from a procedural standpoint must be determined, if such a determination is desired, in the condemnation proceedings proper, and, if the appropriation is sustained, the question of damages must be adjusted there; hence we have neither elaborated nor discussed the findings concerning the nature and extent of the injury which plaintiff claims it will suffer. Defendant is a corporation enjoying the power of eminent domain, and, so far as the present record shows, nothing appears to warrant equitable interference with the exercise of that power; the court below erred in deciding otherwise.\nThe decree is reversed, the injunction is set aside, and the bill is dismissed; plaintiff to pay the costs.",

L. 1860 \u2014 Bill by private person \u2014 Procedural questions \u2014 Action of directors\u2014 Notice to director general of railroads.\n1. In order to entitle a complainant in a bill in equity filed under the Act of June 19, 1871, P. L. 1360, to the equitable remedy which the statute provides, defendant, when properly challenged, must have failed to show a charter power to do the act complained of or it must be shown that something essential to the rightful exercise of the power sought to be asserted is lacking, or that some act has been committed which is so closely connected with defendant\u2019s right to exorcise the power in question, as in effect to constitute a charter prohibition against its assertion under the facts in the particular ease.\n2. The burden of showing that a corporation is exercising franchises which it does not possess is on those alleging that it is attempting to do what it is not authorized to do.\n3. Where a railroad company has a right to build an extension or a branch, it will be assumed, unless the contrary is plainly shown, that the railroad company\u2019s officials have performed their duty in good faith, when they declare a public necessity for an extension, or when they designate such extension as a branch.\n4. The mere fact that some selfish interest may have inspired the plan for the construction of such section in no sense prevents that section from being classed as a \u201cbranch\u201d road, or public use.\n5. Wherever it appears from the attending circumstances that a section of road about to be constructed will in some direct way tend to contribute to the general public welfare, or the welfare of a considerable part of the public, such as the mining and marketing of the coal of the State, it cannot be said that it will not serve a public use.\n6. Where a spur or siding from the main track of a railroad was originally built to serve a particular coal mine, the owners of such mine cannot maintain a bill in equity under the Act of 1871, to restrain the railroad company from condemning some of their land for the purpose of extending the tracks to serve another coal mine some distance beyond.\n7. As such an extension will serve in part to get the coal supply of the State out of the mines, on its way to the consumer, to the great benefit of the public of Pennsylvania, the extension is one for public use, sufficient to justify the exercise of the right of eminent domain.\n8. It is a rule that inquiry under the Act of 1871, is not permitted concerning the regularity of a condemnation from a mere procedural standpoint.\n9. The complaint in a bill filed under the Act of 1871, to restrain the extension of a railroad, cannot allege that the extension was not authorized by the directors of the railroad company, or that the director general of railroads had not joined in the appropriation.\n10. Such procedural defects must be determined in the condemnation proceedings proper.\nEquity \u2014 Appeals\u2014Findings against appellee.\n11.
