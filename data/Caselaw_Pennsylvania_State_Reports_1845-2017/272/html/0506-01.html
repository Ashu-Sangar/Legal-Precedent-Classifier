An answer5 denied any such liability. After hearing, the chancellor found a partnership relation not only as to the wells mentioned, bnt as to one drilled upon a third property, known as that of Alston. No decree was made, however, which required a settlement of accounts as to the latter well; there could not have been, as the judgment necessarily conformed to the pleadings in the case. Neither unproved allegations, nor matters not alleged, could have been made the basis of any equitable relief: Luther v. Luther, <a href="/pa/216/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="216 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="950354" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0001-01">216 Pa. 1</a>; Spangler Brewing Co. v.

It was not attempted to amend the pleadings so as to bring the third transaction properly before the court. On the contrary, the defendants denied any duty to account, and appealed from the decision of the court below in holding that this was their legal duty. The result was an affirm<a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>anee (Rolshouse v.

    <p id="b532-4" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[286,513,1153,1012]]]'>A master was then appointed to adjust the rights of the parties; whereupon, a motion was made to amend the order entered so as to include in the accounting the Alston operation, which had been conducted at a considerable loss. This application was refused, and properly so. “The purpose of a preliminary proceeding on a bill for an account is to determine for what, if anything, the defendant shall account. If, as here, plaintiff claims to be interested in more than one transaction with defendant, the decree conclusively determines for how many of them the defendant should account; or if, as here, they differ as to whether or not in regard to one of these transactions plaintiff is to have an agreed compensation, a specified commission or a share of the profits, the decree conclusively determines the matter also; each determination being with the same effect as if there had been separate suits as to the particular subject-matter of the accounting”: Robinson v.
