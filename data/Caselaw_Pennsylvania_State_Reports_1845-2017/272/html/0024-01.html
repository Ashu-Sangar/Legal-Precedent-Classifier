This corporation became indebted to Valentine Hay, who, in 1916, entered a judgment, confessed by the company, for $7,000, payable in installments, the first of which amounted to $2,235. As collateral security, Hillegass and one Miller executed a note for a like amount, which was likewise made a matter of record. In 1917 an execution was issued upon the portion of the lien then due. Later, in September, a lease of the property was made to M. J. Rohm and James C. Long, who agreed to protect the property against the Hay judgment. The amount necessary was to be advanced by the lessees and repaid from royalties of not less than $500 a year. Rohm paid <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>the portion then due, taking an assignment thereof, and of a like part of the collateral lien.</p>
    <p id="b50-4" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[285,435,1157,471]]]'>At the time of the making of the contract, it was represented that a siding was located upon the property, which was available for the shipping of coal, but investigation showed it to be built upon the land of another, and impossible of use by the lessees. Further inquiry elicited the fact that the statements as to the character and amount of coal were false. The contract was immediately repudiated, but the sum advanced by Rohm was not returned.</p>
    <p id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.6",50,[281,924,1160,689]]]'>Later, the executrix of Rohm issued an execution on the part of the Hay judgment which had been assigned to her decedent. Defendants then took a rule to open the judgment, insisting that, under the agreement of lease, the payment of the claim had been assumed by Rohm, and that it should be equitably treated as satisfied. This was dismissed without prejudice, and a bill in equity was filed having the same purpose in view. After the hearing of testimony, the learned court below refused the relief prayed for on the ground that the agreement of lease was void and unenforceable, and that therefore the provisions for payment of the outstanding lien was of no effect.</p>

The new pleading averred facts which must have been fully known to the plaintiffs at earlier stages in the proceedings.
