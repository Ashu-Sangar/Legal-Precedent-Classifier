On the other hand, the chancellor found, at defendant’s request, that the ground on which the spur in question is laid was owned in fee by defendant company, having been conveyed to it by plaintiff in 1908; and he refused to find, as desired by plaintiff, that defendant had not taken “proper corporate action” to support its proposed appropriation, or that its board of directors had not passed the necessary resolution authorizing the taking of the land intended to be appropriated.</p>

On the other hand, if, as the court below states, defendant, “under the guise of an exercise of its power to construct a branch,” is using its right of eminent domain for the purpose of constructing a mere private siding, not for public use, the Act of 1871 was properly invoked.</p>

The learned chancellor seems to have overlooked most of these rules, and we incline to the belief that the court below erred in its mixed conclusion of fact and law that the section of road here enjoined was not a branch; but it is not necessary to rest our decision on that point, since, under the Pennsylvania authorities, it plainly appears that, even were the section in question properly classed as a “spur,” or a “siding,” the evidence fails to show it was not to be constructed for a public use, and if the use can be classed as of this character, the proposed condemnation would be an exercise of defendant’s franchise, which could not be enjoined under the Act of 1871.</p>
