Jessup, the real estate agent, appeared at the home of the vendor with the full amount of the consideration, above the $7,000 mortgage, in actual cash; they saw Huselton, his wife being too ill to appear, and tendered him the cash, asking for a settlement, which tender and request were rejected; on December 18,1919, the Huseltons conveyed the premises in controversy to Gillman, for an advanced price, although the latter had been formally notified, on the previous day, of Shrut’s claim to the property.</p>

H. Huselton. In reply to this, the court below very propérly remarks that, when Shrut brought the money to Huselton, saying he had it and was prepared to go on with the settlement, and the latter declined so to do, not on the ground that the money was unproduced, but, for other reasons, “He placed himself and his wife, for whom he acted as attorney in fact, in a position where they cannot deny that full tender was made.” Since no special consideration appears for vendor’s agreement to <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>accept the $500 judgment note in place of cash, we may add, vendee might not be in a position to enforce that understanding; nevertheless, after making such agreement, the vendor would be estopped from setting up the vendee’s failure to produce the $500 in cash at the first meeting for settlement, as a cause for rescinding the contract. Moreover, there is nothing in the written contract to indicate time was of the essence of the agreement, so far as the date of settlement is concerned, and the mere fixing of December 4th, as a mutually convenient date for settlement, would not make that day of the essence of the contract, under the circumstances of this case; had the vendor so intended, it was her duty, when she changed her mind about taking the judgment note, to have forthwith fixed a definite date for the vendee to appear with the proper amount in cash, or, failing in that, she must have allowed a reasonable time. It is not necessary to further discuss this phase of the case, however, for, as before said, the tenders made by the vendee were sufficient, on the facts here involved.</p>
