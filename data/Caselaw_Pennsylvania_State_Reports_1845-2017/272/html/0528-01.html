The affidavit of defense “denies that in violation of any agreement, he [defendant] removed said property from the hands of Worster &amp; Krider, and denies any agreement whatsoever;......he denies that Cyril E. Hepburn regularly collected the rentals from said premises,” but he does not deny that he received them, or that he made the agreement “to pay plaintiff the one-half of the net revenues of said property,” which agreement would of course be enforceable, since each had an interest in the accruing rents. The averment that he “denies any agreement whatsoever,” from its context evidently has relation only to the Worster &amp; Krider agency, or is so evasively stated as to leave it doubtful to what it does refer, and hence the doubt must be resolved in favor of plaintiff: Erie City v.

True, the question raised in that case affected only the right of possession while the former husband and wife were still alive, but the reasoning of the opinion applies equally well to the accruing income, and since it is sound in principle we intend to apply it thereto./lndeed, when the cases elsewhere are examined, it will be found that this ancient estate is treated as converted into a tenancy in common, largely because it is believed this will solve some if not most of the difficulties which would otherwise arise in regard to it after a divorce. We do not feel justified, however, in altering the intention appearing in the deed itself, merely because difficulties will arise if we do not; especially since the conclusion we have reached will cause most if not all of them to disappear./</p>

Because of the unity of person and estate existing during marriage, either spouse may lease it and collect the rent; but this is so not because the right to do it is an incident of the estate, on the contrary it only flows from an incident thereof. While the marriage subsists it is a matter of indifference which of the parties leases the property or which of them obtains the rents; presumptively the moneys received will be expended for the benefit of both of them. The unity of the relation of the parties results in a unity of the estate; the leasing by either is for the <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>benefit of them in that relation, and the rents paid to either is to him or her in that relation only.</p>

If a fund consisting of the rents of such a property was before a court for distribution, as for instance if paid in by a tenant for years having an earlier title, or if collected by a receiver of the property, — appointed because of a threatened or actual deterioration thereof, growing out of disputes between the tenants by entireties or otherwise, — and no other equity intervened, the court would unhesitatingly divide the net rents between the former husband and wife in equal shares. So, also, if an agreement for an equal division had been made, as is alleged to have been the case here, and one of the parties endeavored to repudiate it, the courts would unquestionably enforce it. Yet in all such instances the parties would hold per tout just as they do where the fund is not before the court and the parties have made no agreement. These conclusions are permissible, because no incident of the estate is affected, hence the law is not violated, and equality of division effectuates the equity which has always been part of the common law of this State. <em>\ </em>The same reason calls for the enforcement of an equal division where, as here, each has an equal right to all the rent <em>j </em>under such circumstances the law will imply a promise, by the receiver of that which belongs equally to each, to give to the other his full proportion thereof.^ No legal principle compels the chancellor to w;ait until, by reason of the conflicting claims upon the tenant in possession, he is driven out, the rents are lost and the property is deteriorating in value, and possibly the claimants and their partisans are indulging in breaches of the peace in the endeavor to enforce their conflicting but equally meritorious claims. On the contrary, the gross inequity which necessarily results where one, having only an equal right with another, nevertheless takes all, and the not unreasonable probability of bodily harm being done and the public peace disturbed because the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>other endeavors to obtain her legal rights, is a potent warning that a conclusion which compels such injustice has error somewhere coiled in it. We have already pointed out what and where it is. Indeed it might as well be said that since each takes all for the benefit of both while the unity of person continues, when, after that unity is destroyed by the act of the law, one takes the entirety and denies all right in the other, an incident of the estate is destroyed, a result which this appellee strenuously argues cannot be allowed.</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[197,874,1153,1136]]]'>If it be suggested that the effect of the conclusion reached is to permit the creditors and alienees of one, without the consent of the other, to acquire an interest in the rents, though they could not do this while the grantees were husband and wife, and hence, after a divorce, they became for all practical purposes tenants in common so far as the rents are concerned, it is answered that the law is desirous for and not antagonistic to the payment of creditors, whether voluntarily or by legal proceedings, if this can be done without injuriously affecting other rights, as it may be after a divorce; and if it is imagined that other serious results may follow, it need only be added that doubtless an adequate remedy will be found for them when, if ever, they are shown to exist. Certainly no greater incongruity can arise than there would be now, if appellee’s claim is sustained; for if he may take exclusive possession of the property and collect and keep all the rents for his own benefit, so also he may transfer them to a third party, either before or after they are paid, and thus, quoad the rents, the unity of interest will be destroyed.</p>

Limited to the facts of the case the quotation is unobjectionable; beyond that it must not be understood to go. “It is a maxim not to be disregraded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision”: Cohens v.
