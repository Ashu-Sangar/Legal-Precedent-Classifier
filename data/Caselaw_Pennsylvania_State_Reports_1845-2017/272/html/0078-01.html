Provided that......lands permanently injured by caving in......shall be paid for at double the present assessed valuation.” “Provided also that if the removal of the coal destroys the water at the building on said premises, then the parties operating said mines are to bore a well and case it to the depth of thirty feet below the lowest coal seam mined.”</p>

    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[177,868,1155,1135]]]'>The release covered any damage from the loss of water, and, if nothing further appeared, plaintiff could not recover; the subsequent clause as quoted had the effect of excepting the water at the buildings from the release. If it was “destroyed,” a well was to be bored and cased to a depth of thirty feet below the lowest seam. It was clearly the intention of the parties to preserve a supply of water at the plaintiff’s buildings, or the means to procure it if it was below the lower seam. The release in question did not cover an injury to the well after it was constructed, for it would be a useless thing to effect such an arrangement if the owner of the coal had the right, through negligent mining, to immediately thereafter destroy it without any liability. The owner of the coal owed the surface owner the same duty with regard to the pipe and the way covered by it as though it were, by contract, laid on surface land owned by defendant; that is, to refrain from any negligent act which would interfere with the proper exercise of the surface owner’s right, or that would, through lack of reasonable care, injuriously affect his pipe-line.</p>

Fletcher, L. R. 3 H. L. 330; but this doctrine does not prevail in Pennsylvania, — the Sanderson Case cannot be carried to this extent.</p>

Suppose the pipe-line had leaked, permitting an accumulation of water sufficient to destroy defendant’s electric motor or other mine machine. What would be the rule as to plaintiff’s conduct?

There may be authorities apparently to the contrary, but when examined carefully we find them to be cases of nuisances. The principle has recently been stated by this court in Jackman v.

A liability may, however, arise from the doing of a lawful act, or the exercise of a legal right, in negligent or improper manner; but in such cases the liability is based not upon the act done, but upon the manner of doing it. While there is an ancient maxim to the effect that one must so use his own property as not to injure another, the maxim, in its legal sense, has reference not to the mere infliction of damage, but to the violation of a right, and means only that one must so use his own as not to violate a legal right of another. Everyone has a right to the natural use and enjoyment of his own property, and, for lawful acts done by one person upon his own property in a lawful and proper manner, there is no cause of action, although damage to another may incidentally result therefrom.”</p>

It was not necessary for the charge to go beyond it. Where coal is being mined solely by one person from land owned by him, the presumption is, when the coal is removed, the owner removes it, though done by his employees. This would fix the person responsible for moving the coal under plaintiff’s land; the other evidence, the breaking, subsidence and other conditions, indicate coal was being removed. The connection between defendant and the acts complained of was clearly shown.</p>
