At the request of the city solicitor, the council, by unanimous action, employed the relator, Owen J. Roberts, Esq., of the Philadelphia Bar, to assist in the <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>defense of the equity suit, which, after several months’ litigation, was won by the city. Thereafter, the relator presented a bill of $8,000 for his services, which was approved by the city solicitor, the mayor and council. The latter by unanimous resolution authorized and directed the superintendent of accounts and finance to borrow the amount on the credit of the city, and, with like unanimity, duly enacted an ordinance appropriating $8,000 to the payment of the bill in question. This being done, the superintendent of accounts and finance drew a warrant upon the city treasurer for the payment thereof and presented it to the defendant as city controller to examine, audit and settle the account and countersign the warrant. This the controller refused to do and called for an itemized statement of the relator’s services and proof of their value, etc. Thereupon, the relator filed his petition in this case praying for a writ of mandamus commanding the controller to perform the services in question. The latter filed his return, but plaintiff’s demurrer thereto was sustained by the triál court, from whose order awarding a writ of peremptory mandamus defendant brought this appeal.</p>

Neither contention is tenable. The council is the governing body of the city (City of Philadelphia v. Flanigen, <a href="/pa/47/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="47 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="485566" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0021-01">47 Pa. 21</a>), and, in the absence of fraud, which is not here alleged, the controller cannot challenge the validity of a claim duly allowed by that body; otherwise he would be above the council and could in effect veto their acts. There is a presumption, not here rebutted, that the mayor and council properly performed their duties: 2 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5th <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>ed.), p. 1294, section 855. Moreover, that in doing the routine work of passing accounts, countersigning warrants, etc., the controller acts in a ministerial capacity and may be compelled to perform such duty by mandamus has been repeatedly decided by this court. In Com. ex rel. v. Phila., <a href="/pa/176/0588-02" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="176 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="882168,882219" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0588-02,/pa/176/0588-01">176 Pa. 588</a>, 592, the controller refused to countersign the warrant for payment of books purchased by the board of education because of the alleged improvidence of the contract. Mr. Justice Mitchell, speaking for the court, says (p. 592) : “What books, including what bindings are suitable for the public school service is not to be determined by him [the controller] but by the board of education. He is not intrusted with the duty of making, or even of supervising the contracts of other departments. He is the city’s head bookkeeper, and his office is to see that the various departments do not exceed their appropriations, nor apply them to purposes not within their proper scope. To this end, he is clothed with very large powers of examination and investigation, and a large measure of discretion, but they do not extend to the revision of lawful contracts made by other departments within their proper sphere. This reason presents no excuse whatever for refusal to countersign the warrant.” This is expressly reaffirmed in Com. ex rel. v. Larkin, <a href="/pa/216/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="216 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="950385" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0128-01">216 Pa. 128</a>, where, in delivering the opinion of the court, our late Brother Stewart adds, “If the contract be on its face regular, and the requirements of the statutes in connection therewith have been fully met, the controller is without choice in the matter; it becomes at once Ms duty in such cases to number the contract according to its date, charge it against the proper item of appropriation, and certify it accordingly. No opinion or so-called discretion of the controller can justify Mm in withholding his certificate from such a contract.” Com. ex rel. v. Walton, <a href="/pa/236/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="236 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="986739" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0220-01">236 Pa. 220</a>, holds that where the mayor and council have directed expenditures for matters within their jurisdiction, the city controller cannot <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>refuse to countersign warrants drawn in payment thereof; to like effect is Vare v.

Here, plaintiff had an admittedly valid claim against the city for legal services, the only question being the amount, and that was adjusted when council accepted his bill and ordered it paid. The advisability of recognizing, or adjusting, the amount of a valid claim against the city rests with the council: see Doverspike v. Magee, <a href="/pa-super/51/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="51 Pa. Super. 525" data-case-ids="430426" data-case-paths="/pa-super/51/0525-01">51 Pa. Superior Ct. 525</a>.
