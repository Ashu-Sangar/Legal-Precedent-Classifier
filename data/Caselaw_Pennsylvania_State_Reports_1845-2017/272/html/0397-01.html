L. 18, 21), an express averment to this effect was not necessary. (2) “The note was not made by the partnership, and there is no averment that it ever authorized the making thereof.” Inasmuch, however, as, in the absence of express or implied notice to the contrary, each partner is the agent of his copartners, authorized to borrow money for the firm, and to give obligations therefor, such an averment was not necessary: Ihmsen v.

(8) There are no “averments that the note came to the partnership otherwise than in due course.” As already pointed out, there are distinct allegations that the note was drawn for the benefit of the firm, was endorsed by plaintiff as an accommodation to it, was discounted for it, and the proceeds received by it. As between plaintiff and the firm, this, of course, makes the latter liable for the indebtedness and entitles him to recover against the individual partners, — of which appellee is alleged to have been one, — as soon as he, plaintiff, was compelled to pay the <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>firm debt; and this is so even though their names do not appear on the obligation: Maffett v.

If he believed it did “conform to the provisions” of the act, but was not sufficiently specific, he should have taken a rule for a more specific statement, and followed this with a motion for a non pros, if the court made his rule absolute and its order was not complied with (King v.

At times it may not be easy to determine under which of the foregoing heads an objection to a particular statement falls (though there is no such difficulty in the instant case), but, in that event, the doubt should be resolved against entering summary judgment, the power so to do being intended only for clear cases: Kidder Elevator Interlock Co. v.
