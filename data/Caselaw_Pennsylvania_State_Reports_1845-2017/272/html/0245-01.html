Under the circumstances, we cannot hold that error was committed in receiving testimony as to the real understanding between the parties concerning the capacity of the “100 tank cars” of molasses, referred to in the letter as “covered,” or purchased, by plaintiff for defendant.</p>

As to- this, we need only say that, after <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>reading the testimony, we are not convinced that any of the controlling issues involved could properly have been decided as matters of law in favor of plaintiff; hence he was not harmed by the fact that they were submitted to the jury. The manner of their submission, which is complained of in the two remaining assignments of error, is not properly raised; for the first of these last two assignments simply complains of the refusal to grant a new trial, embracing in this complaint seven different reasons assigned in the court below, and this without showing specific objections made and exceptions entered at the time the rulings and instructions now sought to be questioned were made. The practice thus attempted cannot be permitted; it offends several principles of appellate practice: see Maculuso v. Humboldt Fire Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/271/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="271 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="295734" data-case-paths="/pa/271/0489-01">271 Pa. 489</a>, and authorities there cited. Eule 26 of the Supreme Court expressly provides that “each error relied on must be specified particularly and by itself”; further, that “if any specification embrace more than one point or refer to more than one bill of exceptions or raise more than one distinct question, it shall be considered a waiver of all the errors so alleged.” In Mix v. North American, <a href="/pa/209/0636-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="209 Pa. 636" data-case-ids="936132" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0636-01">209 Pa. 636</a>, 641, we held that an assignment of error which complained of a refusal to grant a new trial was not vitally defective in setting forth four distinct reasons why such relief should have been granted, saying, the single error alleged by the assignment was the denial of the new trial and all of the reasons simply raised the question of an alleged abuse of discretion in this regard. That case, however, is not an authority that four distinct and disassociated matters can be brought before the appellate court in a single assignment (particularly where the single assignment fails to show the objections and exceptions tahen in the court below regarding each of the alleged errors, as in the case now before us); for, if it were, it would be a complete reversal of the above-quoted rule. It is still the law that, when counsel desire to question a ruling on the evidence, <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>or the manner in which a case is submitted to the jury, or other trial points which in themselves are the subject of specific objection and exception, such points must be incorporated in separate assignments of error for purposes of review.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.5",276,[263,613,1167,1508]]]'>The last of the two assignments now under discussion complains of an answer made by the trial judge at the end of his charge to the jury, to an oral request for further instructions. We recently held, in Ward v. Babbitt, <a href="/pa/270/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="270 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1066023" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0370-01">270 Pa. 370</a>, that points and answers thereto form part of the charge, and that, even when such points were presented, under the Act of March 24, 1877, P. L. 38, in writing, and the answers of the court were duly excepted to, unless there was a formal request made at the trial to reduce the charge to writing and file it of record, neither it nor the answers to points could be reviewed on appeal, our ruling being that the Act of 1877 had to be construed with other legislation, in pari materia, and, when thus read, it meant that answers to points were subject to review only when filed in connection with the charge, in the manner required by law, — that is, on request at the end of the trial; for, if this were not the rule, we might on appeal have points and answers before us without the charge as a whole, and, in the absence of the latter, we would not be in a position to judge properly concerning the correctness of the former, for, as may be realized, the points might be refused without reading, because fully answered in the general charge, which is often the case. These rules are not mere arbitrary regulations to make practice more difficult, as some seem to think, but represent arrangements which add materially to the orderly and efficient conduct of the business of the courts.</p>
