Section 10 merely introduces the idea, in a general way, of who, in default of the nearer kindred provided for in the earlier sections, may inherit; it does not undertake to specify under what conditions the surviving grandparents or the descendants of dead grandparents, respectively, shall take, or in what proportions; that is left to section 12, which fully covers the ground. ■</p>

The bill thus prepared was passed by the legislature without the slightest deviation from the recommendations of its draftsmen, so far as the portions having any bearing on this case are concerned; and, when the historical development of this branch of our statutory law is considered, together with the whole structure of the present statute, it is apparent that no radical changes or departures from preexisting rules of inheritance were intended. On the contrary, the mischief to be corrected lay in the fact that there were too many acts covering the subject-matter, not that the rules there laid down were either wrong or undesirable, and <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>the remedy intended, at least as to the sections here involved, was simply their codification, or putting together, in a single act.
