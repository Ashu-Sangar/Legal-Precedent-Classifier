It leased and sold portions of the property, divided a part thereof into building lots, collected rents, paid taxes and other charges, and, as “attorneys in fact,” sent to plaintiffs, at regular intervals, statements of account, thereafter applying the balances as plaintiffs directed. In a few comparatively trivial things they did not fully agree with the trust company, but such differences were always adjusted before the matter was communicated to others, plaintiffs doing nothing in regard to the property, save by and through the trust company, with whom they advised when requested and at whose instance they executed deeds, leases and other papers. It is not necessary to determine whether the agency arose and was continued because of a letter of attorney given to the trust company by plaintiffs, as remaindermen, and by the then life tenant, who has since died, or was simply the result of a long continued course of conduct; it suffices that the relation existed during the period stated, and that, so far as third parties were concerned, all arrangements in relation to the property were made with the trust company acting for plaintiffs, and not with plaintiffs themselves.</p>

With the intention of drilling a third well, he cut away some of the trees and thick undergrowth on a hilly part of the farm, at a point which he believed was outside of the plan, but before any boring was done an employee of the trust company informed him this was a mistake. Because of what he had been told, defendant expressed a doubt on the subject, but, rather than have a dispute regarding it, said he would not sink a well there, and would remove the derrick and machinery to another part of the property. The employee suggested, however, it <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>would be wiser, before doing this, to call upon and advise with tbe trust officer of the trust company. When he did so, he was informed he could drill the well at the place selected, and, purporting to act under the power of attorney above referred to, the trust officer gave to defendant a letter, referring to the power and to the fact that the proposed well was within the plan of lots and authorizing him to drill at that point.

A well bored off the plan would not have given the desired security. While these negotiations were pending, the trust company wrote plaintiffs that defendant “has finally offered 1/16 of the gas, if we grant him permission to locate another well on these lots [28 and 29 on the plan]. In the event that a well comes in as large as the other well, [which was well No. 3], our share will be <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>nearer $500 a day than $500 a year.” Following this, an agreement was entered into, signed by plaintiffs and defendant personally, authorizing the latter to sink well No 4 at the point suggested, in consideration of the royalty stated; and when it was drilled gas flowed therefrom in paying quantities, but not of the volume obtained from well No. 3.</p>

The matter apparently remains in this shape, plaintiffs having the money and being ready to repay it to defendant. There was no return or offer to return any part of the royalty received from well No. 4.</p>

Therefore we do not have to decide whether or not a title can be acquired by a trespass, but at the most what recovery can be had against one who, by a trespass, obtains possession of his own property; and certainly this cannot be measured by its value.

This writ is of grace, in the exercise of a sound discretion, and not of right; is ordinarily only preventive in its nature and not restorative; and will not be issued where it will harm a defendant more than it will benefit a plaintiff, and certainly never where, as here, plaintiffs would probably lose more than they would gain. Had defendant bored well No'. 3 in bad faith, or in a race with the law to accomplish his purpose before injunctive relief could be obtained, the chancellor doubtless would have issued the writ; for, under such circumstances, his conscience is too tender to permit a defendant to derive any advantage from his acts, even though it is difficult to' see how plaintiffs would be benefited. It was upon the first of these grounds we <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>sustained the injunction in Kelly v.

In the present case, however, the court below properly found that defendant acted in good faith, under written authority from those left by plaintiffs in charge of the property, and this is a potent factor even if the trust company exceeded the powers given by the letter of attorney.</p>

We have already answered this contention, and need only add that if there can be no ownership until the gas is reduced to actual possession, then plaintiffs themselves have no ownership, for it is as fugitive in their case as it is in his, and hence they have no standing to complain because he gets it. Perhaps this conclusion demonstrates, as effectively as any argument could, the fallacy of their contention that, as between the parties themselves, there could be no grant of ownership of the gas because of its fugacious character.</p>

It is a well-known fact that oil and gas may be readily drawn from one part of the underlying field to another (Kleppner v.

It follows that the drilling of well No. 4, at the point in lots 28 and 29 was a wise act, and the purpose to be conserved thereby, namely, the protection of well No. 3, was a proper purpose. Plaintiffs, however, cannot have the benefit of the excess royalty paid by defendant, because of the necessity for this protection, without affirming defendant’s right to place the well where it is. If its use was enjoined, in all probability either all the gas now secured through it would go to the wells on other properties, or partly there and partly to well No. 4, or wholly to the latter; these last-named contingencies being one of the reasons, asserted in the bill in equity and in appellants’ printed argument, why an injunction should be granted. If the gas all went to other properties both parties would lose, and this possibility alone would give the chancellor much pause. In either of the other events plaintiffs would get a larger sum for the gas they granted to defendant than by the lease they were entitled to have, simply because it came through well No. 4, though it was drilled for the express purpose of protecting the flow from well No. 3, and the larger payment was agreed upon because it would probably effect this purpose.</p>

It is true, as the event <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>happened, defendant made a large profit from well No. 3, but the law cannot deprive Mm of the benefit of tMs bargain, any more than it can take from him anythng else that is his, and a court of equity can go no further in this respect: sequitas sequntur legem. Had no gas been obtained, doubtless plaintiffs would be unable to see any equity in a claim that they suffer a part of the loss; that a gain resulted in which they have shared and are sharing stands in the way of their present contention, which in effect is that they are not only entitled to keep the enhanced royalty heretofore deiived from well No. 4, but to increase it by destroying well No. 3, whereas, as already stated, the former would not have been drilled, or the larger royalty agreed upon, but for the purpose of protecting, for joint benefit, the flow from the latter.</p>

The hint that plaintiffs might be entitled to receive, as a royalty, the same proportion of gas subsequently provided for in the agreement relating to well No. 4, cannot be sustained, for the situation had seriously altered between the time well No. 3 was drilled and the date of this agreement.
