    <p id="b351-7" data-blocks='[["BL_351.9",351,[158,767,1152,1299]]]'>James Fiscus and wife, by deed dated September 25, 1909, and recorded four days later, conveyed a farm, valued at about $10,000, to an unmarried daughter, Agnes Fiscus, the named consideration being $1. By written contract, executed at the same time, the grantee agreed to support her father and mother on the conveyed premises during their natural lives, and, after their respective deaths, to give each of them a suitable burial, to pay any doctor bills or other expenses connected with their maintenance and last illness, and to make certain payments amounting to $810 to other children and grandchildren of grantors. James Fiscus was eighty-two and his wife eighty years old at the date of the deed; subsequently they died, the former on June 17, 1915. After this, although the deed in question had been on record for some years and there was evidence to show that the present complainant had actual as well as constructive knowledge of its existence, A. B. Fiscus, a son of grantors, filed a bill in equity against his sister Agnes, alleging mental incapacity on the part of the father at the execution of the deed, also that the conveyance had been procured by undue influence and fraud. After hearing, on answer and proofs, the bill was dismissed. Plaintiff has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b351-8" data-blocks='[["BL_351.10",351,[157,2078,1149,319]],["BL_352.1",352,[283,343,1153,372]]]'>The chancellor found, inter alia, that plaintiff had “failed to establish, by sufficient evidence, or a fair preponderance of evidence, any of the material averments in the bill”; and concluded that “the deed in question,— being the voluntary act of the grantor, who, at the time of the execution thereof, was mentally capable of under<a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>standing his act [and the instrument haying been] executed without fraud, accident or mistake, coercion or undue influence on the part of the grantee or any one else, upon promises of a valuable consideration, which [promises] were duly kept and performed [by the grantee, so far as the parties concerned permitted] — will not be disturbed in this proceeding.”</p>

Carney, <a href="/pa/196/0034-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="196 Pa. 34" data-case-ids="916743" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0034-01">196 Pa. 34</a>, prevails (also see Compton v.
