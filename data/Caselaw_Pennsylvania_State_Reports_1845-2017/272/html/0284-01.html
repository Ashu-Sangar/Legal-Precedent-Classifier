K. McMullin on $2,145,784.61, representing the value of the shares of stock of the Window Glass Machine Company, American Window Glass Machine Company, Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, and bonds of the latter. The court below might have decided the case on the issue raised by the pleadings. In the petition for an appeal from the board of revision to that court, it was averred the companies involved were “foreign corporations registered in the State of Pennsylvania, and authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, and stock and securities in the hands of shareholders in Pennsylvania are not liable to taxation for state and county purposes within the meaning of the legislation relating thereto.” The only statement in the petition raising the question of non-liability for taxation is contained in the above quotation that the corporations are “registered and authorized to do business”; as we have shown in our discussion in the previous case, “registration and authorization” are not sufficient to cause a corporation to be liable to taxation. But, as the common pleas, court inquired into all the questions here argued, upon which some evidence had been submitted, and as there is an averment in the petition for an appeal that the common and preferred shares of the American Window Glass Machine Company were employed in the manufacture of window glass within the Commonwealth and are entitled to an exemption, we will pass on all questions raised, though the latter averment is indefinite. The company, through its board of directors, performs the obligations of its charter^ not the shareholders as such.</p>

    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[172,420,1152,480]]]'>The Act of 1913, imposing a personal property tax, lays a personal levy against the resident for the value of the shares of stock owned by him, unless the corporation issuing such shares is liable for a capital stock tax or exempt therefrom. A corporation capital stock tax is levied against the issued capital stock as measuring the corporation’s taxable worth, the value being based on all its assets, less nontaxables, exemptions and assets on which such tax is already paid.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[170,913,1148,535]]]'>The companies here mentioned filed reports in the office of the auditor general, in each of which the value of the capital stock was assessed at §1,000, the total assessment being §3,000. On this a tax of §15 was paid; it is now proposed this payment shall relieve a personal property tax of §8,400. Here again is illustrated the grave difficulties that might follow if the reports of the auditor general were always to be received as conclusive, as urged by appellee. We have discussed this phase of the case more fully in the prior opinion.</p>
    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.7",311,[166,1459,1149,920]],["BL_312.1",312,[280,306,1160,536]]]'>American Window Glass Machine Company, a New Jersey corporation, owns all of the stock of the American Window Glass Company, “a domestic corporation,” amounting to some §13,000,000. The latter is largely engaged in manufacturing and selling window glass and other commodities in Pennsylvania. All its property is located here except about §9,000 in the State of Indiana. The American Window Glass Machine Company (the holding company) has an office in the Farmers’ Bank Building, Pittsburgh, in which city the secretary and treasurer live. The books of the company are kept there. Its cash and current assets on deposit in this State are §340,000; its gross revenue is approximately §4,600,000, and net earnings §4,200,000. Like its subsidiary, it is incorporated for the purpose of making and manufacturing glass and machinery of all kinds, articles or commodities used in connection therewith, and to <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>purchase, lease or otherwise acquire patents, trademarks, etc., to grant licenses in respect thereto, and, unlike the subsidiary, to purchase, hold and dispose of stocks, bonds or other obligations of any corporation. Under this latter clause the company functions. The money it has on deposit is not the result of any business action done in this State, other than the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary at the office in Pittsburgh may be regarded as business done in this State. The activities of the company are of an administrative character.</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[274,854,1160,479]]]'>What we said in Gallery’s Appeal, concerning “doing business” either in an administrative or executive capacity with respect to a subsidiary company, and the ownership of tangible property, is applicable here and needs no elaboration. The same is true as to what we have written in that case in connection with “doing business” and being liable to a capital stock tax or relieved from the payment of such tax, and having capital or property employed within the State.</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[272,1345,1157,751]]]'>All the tangible assets involved are owned by the Pennsylvania corporation and not by the New Jersey company. In the report of the holding company to the auditor general the value of intangible assets is placed, in round numbers, at $20,750,000, with no tangible assets in Pennsylvania. The auditor general, from the report, appraised the value of the capital stock at $1,000. This was not authorized under the law. The report shows the company to be nontaxable. While it was doing business, through the activities mentioned, sufficient to require registration, as indicated in Callery’s Appeal, it was not liable to taxation on stock, and such liability is the necessary fact to relieve the shareholder from personal property tax.</p>
    <p id="b312-7" data-blocks='[["BL_312.7",312,[272,2108,1155,264]],["BL_313.1",313,[188,326,1152,700]]]'>Window Glass Machine Company, a New Jersey corporation, owns shares of stock in the above-named American Machine Company and another foreign corporation.

The cash on deposit in the bank was not received as a result of any business done in this State, and is in this respect like the American Window Glass Machine Company. All of the assets of the company, so far as reported, are of an intangible nature. The company has no tangible assets in Pennsylvania. On this report the auditor general made an assessment of $1,000 and imposed the tax of $5. This was not authorized, as the company was nontaxable. The assessment against the value of the capital stock was contrary to law.</p>

We do not know whether this company has any property in Pennsylvania, — the report is silent on this point; but if it has such property, or is doing business here, it should make a report. Not having done so, resident shareholders were at liberty to show at the hearing the corporation was, in fact, doing business, and had such property employed here. So far as the present record is concerned, this does not appear; consequently the company in question is not liable to capital stock tax or required to file a loan report. There is nothing in the record to show <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>that any of its officers lived here or that the company transacted any character of business here.</p>

While it is not within our power to relieve the appellee from the penalty imposed, the board of revision should take this matter into consideration and grant relief as to this item. The county’s desire is not to punish but to have the law definitely settled.</p>
