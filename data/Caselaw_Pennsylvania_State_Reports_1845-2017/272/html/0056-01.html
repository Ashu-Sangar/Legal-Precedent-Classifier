After waiting a few minutes for a representative of defendant to get ready to transport Mm, Callihan, for some undisclosed reason, stepped into an adjoining pumphouse, on defendant’s premises, was caught in the machinery and killed. The widow claimed compensation, which the referee allowed; when the award was sustained by the compensation board and the court below, defendant took the present appeal, contending (1st), that at the time of his death deceased was not engaged in the furtherance of the business of defendant; (2d), that Callihan’s employment was merely casual; (3d), that he was not employed in the regular course of the business of defendant; and (4th), that he was an independent contractor.</p>

L. 736, was passed for the mutual benefit of employers and employees directly engaged in the regular course of industrial or business life. It is a tacit recognition of the fact that such employees differ from those workers for hire who keep themselves detached, in order to use their labor and abilities in the best markets and most advantageous ways which may from time to time present themselves. The former class of employees, unlike the latter, are not as a rule in a position to seek out and grasp opportunities for advantageously using what little capital they may accumulate; hence, in event of injury, these workers cannot as readily care for themselves and those dependent on them for support. All of which, inter alia, created a public feel<a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>ing that they were entitled to the protection of such a system as the statute before us sets up, and this brought about its enactment. The system thus inaugurated guarantees standardized compensation in cases of injury to employees, but one who enlists in the army of industrial and business workers must, in order to entitle himself to the benefits of the act, undertake more than a mere casual or incidental job; he must enter the ranks •of those engaged in the regular course of the business of his particular employer, and, when such a worker claims compensation, it must appear that he was injured in the course of his employment.</p>

This usual and ordinary business here did not involve the loading of the grain, but embraced simply the purchase and transportation after the grain was loaded upon the cars. In other words, the applicant was casually employed to do work which was not ordinarily and usually done by or under the direction of the employer in the business in which he was engaged.” Perhaps the decision in this case goes a little far.</p>

The American compensation acts pretty generally employ the words “regular” or “usual” course of the employer’s business. Undoubtedly, there are American cases, such as State ex rel. v. Dist. Ct., <a href="/minn/141/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="141 Minn. 83" data-case-ids="173231" data-case-paths="/minn/141/0083-01">141 Minn. 83</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=169%20N.W.%20488" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="169 N.W. 488">169 N.

    <p id="b96-4" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[280,453,1163,1678]]]'>The casual employment of one, for the performance of an odd job, may occur in conducting a business and still not be within its regular course. For instance, emergency repair work on a machine used in the operation of a business can always be said to take place in the course of that business, as all machinery, at some time or other, is bound to need repair; but such work if not of a kind usually performed by or under the control of the person conducting the business, would be outside the regular course thereof. The legislature evidently intended, by the use of the words “regular course,” to give' them some definite significance and the most natural meaning is that they refer to the normal operations which regularly constitute the business in question, excluding incidental or occasional operations arising out of the transaction of that business, such as, now and again, repairing the premises, appliances or machinery used therein. While repair work may be considered an important incident to any business using machinery, and, in some cases, may enter into the customary operations of such a business (for example, when men are engaged as regular employees for the purpose of keeping the machinery in order), yet the repairs we are here considering were no part of the regular course of the business conducted by defendant, which is producing oil; they represent merely an odd job, incidental to that business, but not part of the work ordinarily done by or under the control of the employer in this particular case. On the other hand, such repairs might well be classed as within the regular course of the business of plaintiff’s deceased husband.</p>
