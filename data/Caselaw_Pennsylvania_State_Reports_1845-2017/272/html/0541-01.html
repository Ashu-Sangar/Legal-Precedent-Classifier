Charles Pinter was called as a witness for his father, as well as for himself, and testified that, at the time of the accident, he was not quite sixteen; he was not cross-examined in any manner on the point of his age. Andrew Pinter, the father, also said his son, Charles, was less than sixteen when employed by defendant, and was not cross-examined on this subject. The boy’s mother likewise swore to his age, without being cross-examined on that part of her testimony. Upon the production of defendant’s case, however, three endeavors were made to <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>prove that, when Charles was hired, he was asked concerning his age and stated it to he seventeen; hnt, on objection of plaintiffs, the testimony was disallowed. Appellant contends the age of the injured boy was a controlling issue, and that the testimony in question should have been received. This would undoubtedly be true, if the age had been urged as such an issue (Kreiter v. Bomberger, <a href="/pa/82/0059-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="82 Pa. 59" data-case-ids="1047879" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0059-01">82 Pa. 59</a>, 61), but as a matter of fact that was not the case; therefore the point we have to determine is, Was reversible error committed in rejecting the testimony, under the circumstances attending its offer?</p>
    <p id="b569-3" data-blocks='[["BL_569.4",569,[196,937,1155,911]]]'>Before taking up this main point, we state, incidentally, that the question as to whether the boy was under or over sixteen at the time of the accident was submitted to the jury, and found in favor of plaintiffs, i. e., that he was under sixteen at the time of the accident; we also suggest that, even had Charles’s alleged declaration as to his age been accepted in evidence, it is unbelievable that the jury would have found him seventeen years old when taken into the employ of defendant, in the face of the preponderating evidence to the contrary, already recited, and of the official birth certificate from the Division of Vital Statistics of the Bureau of Health, introduced by plaintiffs, which showed the boy to be under sixteen at the date in question; but, passing these considerations, we do not feel called upon to reverse the judgment on the verdict in the boy’s favor, for other reasons which we shall now state.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[198,1868,1152,425]]]'>The official notes of the trial make it quite plain that, up to the tender of the rejected testimony, which we are here discussing, the defense was not that Charles had, as a matter of fact, passed sixteen, but that his employer did not know he was of a less age. This is demonstrated by the testimony of the man who engaged the minor, and the colloquy between the trial judge and counsel at the time of the rulings at present under consideration.</p>

In addition, the colloquy before referred to (which the assignments of error do not show in full) strongly indicates that, when the rulings complained of were made, the trial judge had the first-mentioned defense in mind, which idea is reinforced by his remark to counsel for plaintiff, when the latter was taking exceptions to the charge, to the effect that he, the judge, did not understand there was any question as to the actual age of. the boy, — this conception of the defense having been expressed previously in the charge itself. Moreover, in determining what appeared as the defense at the time of the rulings, —and, therefore, what appeared as the defense in passing on the relevancy of the testimony offered, with the scope of the objection thereto, — consideration may be given to the fact that, when Charles Pinter was on the stand, no attempt was made to lay ground, by cross-examination, for the introduction of the evidence here in question, nor at the time of these rulings had such defense been brought out on the cross-examination of any of plaintiffs’ witnesses or otherwise suggested.</p>

Under such circumstances, the appellate court will say, “Since all the intimations on the record point to quite another contention, you should have made plain to the trial judge what you now allege as the issue sought to be proved, and the grounds you now depend on should have been called to his attention when he made the ruling of which you complain.” The underlying principle is that the object for which a particular piece of evidence is submitted should be kept steadily in view, when considering a complaint as to its admission or rejection, and complainant must be confined to that object; the relevancy of the evidence, had it been offered generally, need not be affirmed or denied, because a party cannot offer evidence apparently for one purpose, and complain, when it has been rejected, that it was legitimate for some other: Gaines v.

    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.6",572,[270,936,1163,1125]]]'>The Act of 1915, supra, ordains that no child under fourteen years of age shall be put to work, and those between fourteen and sixteen shall not be employed unless the certificate there provided for is furnished. The trial judge, when charging the jury, said, inter alia, “We instruct you, under the law of Pennsylvania, as we understand it, that it is the duty of an employer to obtain a certificate of age from his employees who are youthful, stating they are over the age of sixteen years, and, according to the evidence in this case, this was not done by the defendant.” Appellant complains of this excerpt from the charge, that it does not present a correct statement of law. The suggestion is there made that a Pennsylvania employer must obtain a certificate for all youthful employees, whether under or over sixteen, whereas the obligation extends only to those who are less than the stated age; but, since the jury were not told that the absence of the certificate made defendant liable to plaintiff, we do not feel warranted, under all the attending circumstances, in treating this mistaken instruction as reversible error.</p>
