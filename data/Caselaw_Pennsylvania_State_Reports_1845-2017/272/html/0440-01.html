John Bungar and others, trustees of the church, presented a similar petition, praying for a like order, coupled with a statement of their intention to pay the entire indebtedness of the church, which would <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>include the bank’s two judgments; there was not only-no such offer from appellant, so far as payment of the judgments is concerned, but, in answer to Bungar’s petition, appellant denied the validity of the additional judgments held by the bank.
