Plaintiff went into possession of the property and began mining operations, expending $970 in renewing the equipment and placing the mine in order; failing, however, to find coal in paying quantities, he ceased work and filed the present bill in equity alleging defendants falsely and fraudulently represented the land in question contained five to six acres of solid coal, and praying a cancellation of the contract and asking that defendants be ordered to return the consideration and reimburse plaintiff for the amount spent in preparing to remove the coal, and further that the mortgage of $750 be satisfied of record. Defendants in their answers denied having made such representations <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>as alleged in the bill and averred, on the contrary, they informed plaintiff they were not aware of the extent of the unmined coal in the land and advised him to examine the premises to satisfy himself of the amount contained in the property. The court below found the disputed questions of fact in favor of defendants and dismissed the bill, from which order plaintiff appealed.</p>
    <p id="b401-3" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[179,712,1151,470]]]'>The sole question raised is one of fact whether plaintiff was induced by false representation to execute the lease and, as the findings of the court below involve the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony, such findings have the weight of a verdict of a jury and will not be disturbed if supported by evidence: Shimer v. Aldine Trust Co., <a href="/pa/264/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="264 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1048547" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0444-01">264 Pa. 444</a>; Volk v.

Both testified plaintiff was informed they were unable to fix the extent of the unmined coal, and that, after the latter had examined the property, as they suggested he should do, he expressed himself as being satisfied there was coal under the tract and purchased the lease. This testimony substantially as above indicated, supports the findings of fact of the court below, especially the 7th, which is not excepted to, that “Musser did not at any time represent to plaintiff that there were five acres of solid coal in the tract, or any other amount. Neither did Mr. Wick, the other defendant, at any time represent to the plaintiff .that there were five acres of solid coal <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>under the land.” There is further testimony to the effect that neither defendants had experience in. coal-mining operations, one being a real estate agent and the other engaged in the lumber business and that if the property contained five acres of solid coal, as plaintiff claimed defendants represented to him, the market value of the tract would exceed five times the consideration mentioned in the lease.</p>
