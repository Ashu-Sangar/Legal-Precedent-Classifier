McCullough, all my property, real and personal, for her use and maintenance and that of my minor children, except my daughter Mary Jane above mentioned and provided for in this instrument, my real estate consisting of the house now occupied by me No. 250 Allegheny Avenue, in the City of Allegheny.</p>

By her will, a one-seventh part of her estate was given in trust, for Lovisa McCullough, a minor daughter of her son, who had died intestate, leaving a widow and this one child. The trustee, so named, secured leave from the orphans’ court to sell the interest of the minor in the real estate of which John McCullough died seized, averring that, by the devise of the grandfather, an estate in fee simple had passed to the grandmother, and that the grandchildren, under the will of the latter, had a one-seventh interest therein. Subsequently, the appellant, as guardian, asked for a revocation of the order made, it being insisted that only a life estate passed under the will of the grandfather, with a vested remainder in his three children, and that the interest of the ward was one-third, subject to the dower rights of her mother. The contention of the trustee was upheld, and the petition was accordingly dismissed; from the order so made Ibis appeal was taken.</p>

A power to consume makes possible the use of the proceeds of sale by the one named as donee, but if there be a failure to convert the realty, or a portion thereof, what remains unconsumed will pass through the will of the donor (Nieman’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=229%20Pa.%20406" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="229 Pa. 406">229 Pa. 406</a>; Allen v.

But all of these canons are subservient to the contrary rule as to intent, and are made to aid, not to override it”: Woelpper’s App., <a href="/pa/126/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="126 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="968893" data-case-paths="/pa/126/0562-01">126 Pa. 562</a>.</p>

This has been held under the following circumstances: where the estate was expressly limited to life (Reynolds’s Est., <a href="/pa/175/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="175 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="880512" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0257-01">175 Pa. 257</a>; Shaner v.

The devise was not to the widow alone with direction to aid the offspring, but expressly for “her use and maintenance and that of my minor children.” No intention to give to her an absolute estate in the whole is to be found. The contrary is most clearly indicated by the last paragraph of the codicil, which provides that any balance after payment of certain legacies should revert to her as executrix and not <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>as an individual. As executrix and guardian of the children under the will of her husband, it was within her power to use such of the fund as might be required for their joint maintenance, but this necessity seems not to have arisen, as the real estate remained unsold at the time of her death. Her life estate having terminated, those in remainder have become the owners in fee, and the petitioner in the court below, representing as she does her father, now deceased, is entitled to one-third, subject to the dower interest of her mother.</p>
