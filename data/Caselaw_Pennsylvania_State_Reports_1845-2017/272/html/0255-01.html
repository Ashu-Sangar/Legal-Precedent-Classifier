The latter has power to manufacture and sell, with all the incidental rights necessary to the prosecution of the business. Holding company, as its sole stockholder, controls subsidiary; but, to do so, it must use the rights and powers of the latter. Holding company has no authority to sell oil; but, through its officers, acting as officers of the refining company, or compelling the latter’s officers to obey, it imposes its will on subsidiary. Holding company does this, however, only as sole shareholder; it could impose no liability or legal obligation on the subsidiary except as the individuals who acted were brought somewhere within the limits of the latter’s functioning body.

It is this company that comes in touch with the great commercial world, from Mexico to Canada; it handles the mammoth production which gives substance to the enterprise.

The sole shareholder can lawfully impose its will on Gulf Refining and enforce obedience through the latter’s machinery, created by law to govern it. Gulf Oil, eo nomine, could not replevin a wheelbarrow of Refining Company, nor could it, eo nomine, execute a mortgage on the latter’s property. Holding company’s control does not sweep aside the corporate existence of Refining Company; the corporations are just as separate and distinct as though the sole shareholder did not exist. Gulf Oil, as sole shareholder, receives all net profits of the subsidiary company through dividends or other arrangements. Their dealing, because of share ownership, may assume various closely related forms; and, as no outstanding holder is prejudiced through such acts, there is no one to complain. The corporate lines are distinct, and we see no reason why it is not only legally right but wise to keep them so; for, while it may avail the owners of stock, in the present instance, to wipe them out, later, and, in matters of more serious import, when their interests may dictate a different attitude, it might prove disastrous to them in the extreme.

Under such circumstances, the subsidiary does not cease to exist, nor are its powers and property joined with those of the holding company, even for convenient taxation; although this may be done by consolidation or merger. It is not our purpose to extend the Westinghouse decision beyond the letter of its terms. See Com. v.

The auditor general, who received and filed a report of the Gulf Company, assessed against it what plainly is a mere nominal tax on capital stock. It is here contended that the auditor general’s report, fixing liability to tax, is conclusive, and the court cannot go behind it. The legislature has seen fit to set up two <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>taxing tribunals, each having equal powers, to determine a fact, to wit, a corporation’s liability to a tax on its capital stock.

If the auditor general’s reports are to be received as conclusive, as that official is diligently looking after the state’s revenues, one can easily see where the counties might suffer. On the other hand, it would be intolerable to have the auditor general’s action subjected to an attack, or set aside indiscriminately, by the sixty-seven county-taxing officials. The court below was in error in holding the report conclusive under the facts in this case. Generally speaking, the reports of the auditor general are not only prima facie evidence, but conclusive, except in case of fraud, legal or constructive, or where the face of the report exhibits an assessment of tax contrary to law, or where the officers of the company admit a situation that makes it nontaxable. The cases relied upon relate solely to situations where efforts were made to resist the collection of a tax assessed by the auditor general, and do not reach the facts in this case. Here, all facts necessary to a decision of the case were sworn to by the secretary of the company, and it naturally followed that some explanation had to be made, when the corporate purpose of the holding company, filing the report, was considered. The auditor general accepted the report, as is usual in that office as to the reports of all companies which make returns. In adjusting and deciding questions of the character which arise in setting a capital stock tax, the auditor general hears one side only, and is often not presented with the real problems in dispute; but, even so, we have sufficient admissions in the present record to show the facts before indicated, and upon them we base our decision, — we are not deciding anything about the right to file a consolidated return.</p>

In construing statutes relating to taxation, three rules must be steadily borne in mind: (1) No tax can be collected in the absence of a provision clearly imposing it upon the class to which the taxpayer or his property belongs; (2) Where the taxpayer or his property is within the general language of the statute imposing the tax, all exempting provisions are to be strictly construed against the claim for exemption; (3) Provisions relating either to the imposition of or exemption from a tax, are to be so construed as to give effect, as nearly as reasonably may be, to the common law duty to tax equitably and ratably all those within the given class, this subject being partially dealt with also in article IX, section 1, of our Constitution. It was by giving no effect to rule (3) and mistakenly applying the principle embodied in rule (1) instead of that in rule (2) (the last two being often confused with each other, though in no <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>way conflicting), that the exempting provision under consideration in Dupuy v.

The concern in question is a New Jersey corporation, engaged in making steel and products thereof, the value of its total capital stock being approximately §75,000,000; of this amount, §14,000,000 is employed in Pennsylvania, and all except §29,000 exclusively in manufacturing. The company is licensed to do business in this State, and in 1916 it paid a capital stock tax on the before-mentioned §29,000 amounting to §169.17.” The portion of the Act of June 17,1913, P. L. 508, 509, under which the liability was sought to be established in that case, provides that residents of Pennsylvania shall be liable to pay a tax upon, inter alia, “all shares of stock in any bank, corporation, association, company, or limited partnership, created or formed under the laws of this Commonwealth or of the United States, or of any other state or government, except shares of stock in any bank, corporation or limited partnership that may be liable to a tax on its shares or its capital stock for state purposes under the laws of this Commonwealth, or relieved from the payment of tax on its shares of capital stock for state purposes by the laws of the Commonwealth.” We held that, under this excepting provision, the payment of the §169.17 relieved from taxation all Pennsylvania holders of any part of the §75,000,000 of stock, although our citizens who held stock in other corporations, domestic or foreign (save as exempt because employed in manufacturing, etc.), were liable to a tax on the full value of their shares, even though no part of the corporation’s tangible assets was located in this State. In my opinion appellee, in that case, should have been held liable to <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>pay a tax upon 61/75 of the value, of his shares, and exempted from 14/75 thereof.</p>

Johns says, that <em>any </em>payment, no matter how small, relieves the stockholder from the tax, then the employment here of <em>any </em>part of the corporation’s assets for manufacturing purposes, no matter how small, must have a like effect, and the holders of stock in foreign corporations, but a trivial part of whose activities are in the line of manufacturing, will wholly escape, though, under substantially similar language, the holders of stock of domestic corporations will escape only pro rata, that is, to the extent the assets are used in manufacturing and not beyond that. This is not only discriminatory and inequitable, but is also in direct antagonism to rule (2), above stated, and should not be tolerated, unless there is no reasonable way of escape therefrom. It is true stockholders in domestic corporations do not directly pay the tax on their shares, but the corporation pays it for them, and not as a tax on its own assets, — a fact too often overlooked in considering questions arising under these statutes. If “any” or some similar word had been used in the Act of 1913, when referring to the payment or relief from payment of the tax, we might perhaps be required to construe the exempting provision as was done in Dupuy v. Johns, despite the inequality occasioned thereby; but no such word appears, and hence under rule (2), and indeed upon the principle that the legislature will be presumed to know and adopt the construction placed by this court upon similar language in previous taxing statutes, the exemption should be limited accordingly.</p>

The chief office was in New Jersey, as required by the law of that state, but its actual place of business was in the City of Pittsburgh, where all but one of its directors live, the securities of the company are deposited, banking done, accountings had, and from which point its corporate affairs are directed. Five floors of a large building, the Frick Annex, are occupied for the carrying on of these activities, as I understand the testimony. The office furniture is owned by it; private telegraph lines, leased in the name of its subsidiary, partly within this Commonwealth, are operated by it for communicating on company matters. Though the plants and refineries stand in the name of the subsidiary corporation, the actual control of the various properties is by the Gulf Oil Company, which was duly registered under the Act of June 8, 1911, P. L. 710, and authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, having paid the proper fees and bonus charges. As required by law (Act June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, section 20; Act June 2, 1915, P. L. 730; Act July 15,1919, P. L. 948), it filed with the auditor general, for taxation purposes, reports of capital stock and loans for 1920.

The latter is a holding company, and has registered and paid the bonus fees charged by the Commonwealth to secure the privilege of acting here. All its directors but one, the management and the officers, accounting department and bank deposits are located within the State.

The difference in the chartered purposes, as I understand, is that the refining company is authorized to manufacture and sell, whereas the oil company is chartered to hold the stock of the company so engaged.

The refining company maintains its corporate existence, yet its operations are conducted by the oil company, and, if it were necessary, it might well be said, under the authorities, that this constituted an employment of capital within the State, but it is not essential to so hold to solve the situation as presented by this record.</p>

Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/251/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="251 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="1019687" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0006-01">251 Pa. 6</a>. I cannot agree, as stated in the majority opinion, that the corporation is “doing business” within the purview of the registration and corporate loan acts, and not those regulating taxes on capital stock. It is said that this distinction is justified because a foreign corporation is liable only under the statute regulating state <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>assessments, when it is both “doing business and liable for taxation”; and it is suggested that the second condition does not exist here. To so assert, does not seem to me to be borne out by the evidence. Without elaboration, it may be noted that the tangible assets in Pennsylvania are listed in the annual report at a very considerable sum. This item includes real estate held in the name of the refining company, but is not so limited. According to my understanding of the testimony, it certainly embraces capital employed in the ownership of the business equipment of the oil company, and it operates telegraph lines, though it leases them in the name of its subsidiary. The exact valuation of each is not set forth, but that is immaterial; for if there is any tangible property here not exempted by law, or as to which deduction must be made, the company is subject to taxation. This has been held when the only assets of the foreign corporation within the State were office furniture, and certain appliances for loading and unloading vessels, the valuation of which did not exceed |11,000, a small fraction of the total capital of the company then the subject of consideration: Com. v. Clyde Steamship Co., <a href="/pa/268/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="268 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1061587" data-case-paths="/pa/268/0278-01">268 Pa. 278</a>. The fact that the amount of taxable assets is small makes no difference, the question being whether it has any capital here in service, making it liable to some levy. On the report as filed, the averments in which are not gainsaid, the taxing officials of the State were in duty bound to levy a capital stock tax. If they had not done so they would have disobeyed the mandate of the law. The thought ■ expressed that such a ruling might work injustice to the community in exempting the holdings of stocks of foreign corporations owned by residents, when the company pays but a trifling sum to the State, is satisfactorily answered by the present Chief Justice in Dupuy v. Johns, <a href="/pa/261/0040-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="261 Pa. 40" data-case-ids="1042250" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0040-01">supra,</a> at page 5. It follows from what has been said that, in my opinion, the Gulf Oil Company was doing business within the State, and liable to taxation, and <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>the auditor general properly made assessment and collected the sum found to be due. If his action was justified, then the court below was right in holding the valuation of the stock in the hands of the resident holder to be void, and as a result necessarily set it aside.</p>
    <p id="b305-5" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[196,619,1149,700]]]'>For another reason the judgment, in my opinion, should be affirmed. Reports required by law of all registered foreign corporations were filed, the taxes assessed paid, and no appeal was taken. The action of the state officials necessarily involved findings of fact that the corporation was “doing business and liable to taxation,” and this is ordinarily conclusive. Of course, if an assessment is made illegally by the taxing authorities, or if there have been fraudulent practices, a different situation arises; but these questions are not presented here. It is unnecessary to refer to other authorities than Stratford v.

Whether they could intervene in such a proceeding and secure a review of a prejudicial ruling it is not necessary to determine. Prior to 1913, the collection of all personal property tax was primarily for the benefit of the State, though it returned to the county a portion of the sum received, and the manner of correcting improper assessments was fixed by various statutes. In that year the legislature saw fit to give up a further portion of the revenues of the State; but it did not then, nor has it since, provided a different or additional tribunal for the adjustment of disputes. It did not cede the power, which the State then possessed, to determine through its own officials what property was subject to contribution in support of the Commonwealth; by a failure to so grant, the right was reserved. All corporations registered were at that time bound to make reports for con<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>sideration by the officials named, and if any failed to do so, it was penalized. This duty to submit annual statements to the central authority for taxation purposes has been reiterated since by two legislatures.</p>
    <p id="b306-5" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[276,565,1161,1235]]]'>In the present instance, the company reported as required by law. The proper officials determined, from the facts submitted, the question of liability for tax, and found affirmatively; otherwise a nominal charge would have been made. This action, subject to appeal, binds all parties, and is not reviewable by some other body, not granted such jurisdiction by statute.

The legislature may provide for returns of corporations to counties, and permit the making of independent investigations so that each may determine whether the stock held by residents is subject to local taxation; but no such power has been given. The effect of the majority opinion is to hold that the oil company is not liable to taxation for state purposes on any part of its capital stock, and that foreign corporations, such as it, organized as holding companies, can operate here, exempt from state taxation so far as capital stock is concerned. The far-reaching consequences of so holding may be of great moment to the Commonwealth so far as its revenues are involved; it can well be surmised that the gain in collections to the counties will be far overbalanced by the loss of revenue to the State.</p>

Subject to the restriction of the Constitution, that power may be exercised by such agencies as the legislature has <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>established for that purpose”: Erie v. Need, <a href="/pa/113/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="113 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="457576" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0468-01">113 Pa. 468</a>, 476. The county is an arm or agent of the State, and has been called a quasi, as distinguished from a municipal corporation: Bucher v. Northumberland County, <a href="/pa/209/0618-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="209 Pa. 618" data-case-ids="936094" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0618-01">209 Pa. 618</a>. In neither case can powers be exercised where not granted, or which are withheld, though in many instances the latter is given authority to legislate upon definite subjects. What has been declared as to extent of rights of municipalities is equally applicable to counties, with reference to a subject like taxation, where certain privileges have been conferred. In Com. v. Moir, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20Pa.%20541" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="199 Pa. 541">199 Pa. 541</a>, we said, in part: “Municipal corporations are agents of the State, invested with certain subordinate governmental functions for reasons of convenience and public policy. They are created, governed and the extent of their power determined by the legislature, and subject to change, repeal or total abolition at its will. They have no vested rights in their offices, their charters, their corporate powers or even their corporate existence. This is the universal rule of constitutional law, and in no state has it been more clearly expressed and more universally applied than in Pennsylvania..... The fact that the action of the State towards its municipal agents may be unwise, unjust, oppressive or violative of the natural or political rights of their citizens, is not one which can be made the basis of action by the judiciary.”</p>

Unless fraud is shown in the finding made, or the record shows on its face lack of authority to assess, — it does not in the present case, — or that the charge made is merely nominal, there being no taxable assets, as appears in McMullin’s Estate, <a href="/pa/272/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="272 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1068421" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0284-01">272 Pa. 284</a>, the findings of fact necessarily implied by the assessment are conclusive.

To my mind this will be the result of the decision of the majority, and does not find justification in our authorities.</p>
