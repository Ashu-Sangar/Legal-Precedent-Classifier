Defendant’s history of the case, on this appeal, states that plaintiff, as defendant in the former action, there filed an affidavit of defense, alleging that, by agreement between the parties, certain of the macaroni had been returned because unmerchantable, and that such return extinguished and satisfied the debt then in suit; but, as is later pointed out in this opinion, the pleadings in the county court have not been properly brought before us, so we cannot go into the details of that defense,- — it is enough to say the case resulted in a judgment for the then plaintiff. On July 28, 1920, the present action of foreign attachment in assumpsit was instituted against the plaintiff in the judgment in the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>county court, and the defendant there, in the capacity of plaintiff here, summoned himself as garnishee, attaching the judgment which he owed the present defendant. Subsequently the plaintiff filed an affidavit of cause of action, claiming $5,386.90 damages for breach of warranty of the quality of the 4,865 boxes of macaroni; defendant appeared specially and moved to quash the writ of attachment, alleging that plaintiff, when defendant in the county court, might have pleaded his present cause of action as a set-off, therefore the matter was res adjudicata by the judgment against him in that case.</p>

It is sufficient to say that the broad, or general, distinction is this: Where, notwithstanding the defects pointed out, the suit may remain, as a pending action, a motion to dissolve is correct practice; on the other hand, where the defects depended on are fundamental in character and such as to put plaintiff completely out of court, a motion to quash the writ is proper. To particularize: where security is entered under section 62 of the Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. (1835-36) 572, 583, the motion to dissolve is right, for the statute so ordains; the only other instances where the motion should be interposed are where one who wants relief desires to take advantage of defects in the statement of cause of action, or in the case thereby shown, which are not of such a fundamental nature as to sustain a motion to quash the writ. In Bergman v. Straus, <a href="/pa/264/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="264 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="1048497" data-case-paths="/pa/264/0439-01">264 Pa. 439</a>, 441-2, we note a distinction between “quashing or refusing to quash a writ of foreign attachment” and the quashing of the attachment itself, calling attention to our recent case of Mindlin v.

The defendant in that case (plaintiff here) may have admitted that the defense there set up (which he now asserts as absolutely independent of his present claim for damages) was the only one he had against the indebtedness then in suit; or the full record of that case may show that the defendant there (plaintiff here) treated facts which enter into his present claim in such a way as to constitute a severance of what he here calls an entire amount, and asserts to be, in law, nonseverable, and that parts of such claim were in fact severed and passed upon. (For a discussion of severable and nonseverable claims, see Carvill v. Garrigues, <a href="/pa/5/0152-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="5 Pa. 152" data-case-ids="953541" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0152-01">5 Pa. 152</a>, 153; also Holden v. Wiggins, <a href="/pen-w/3/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="3 Pen. &amp; W. 469" data-case-ids="1827668" data-case-paths="/pen-w/3/0469-01">3 P. &amp; W. 469</a>, 474.) Of course, we cannot assume any <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>of these conditions did in fact exist; but what the true situation may have been as to such matters, and others affecting plaintiff’s present claims, the record before us fails to show. It is clear, however, that this is not an instance where the court below, on the information furnished it, could have sustained defendant’s plea of res adjudicata, for the purpose of quashing the writ of attachment; whether or not that plea will constitute a good legal answer to all or any part of plaintiff’s claim, will have to be decided, if properly raised, at the trial of the case, which is the usual time for determining such matters. What we now decide, as controlling, is that the court below did not err in refusing to quash the writ of attachment, for this record does not present a case for that summary form of relief.</p>
