Croft that he was given an absolute estate, or fee, in the residuary real estate, which was not cut down by the subsequent words, limiting the power of the devisee over the estate; but the auditing judge is not convinced by this argument. Undoubtedly Jacob R. Croft had the power to dispose of the real estate; the will expressly says that he may do so. There is no restraint on alienation. The testatrix merely expresses her “desire,” that is her will, that, if he sells the property, Alice should receive two-thirds of the proceeds, and the question is, are those words expressive of desire merely precatory, or do they impress a trust on the proceeds? It will be observed that the testatrix used the word “desire” three times in her will, and, in the other two there can be no doubt that she intended a positive direction......</p>

The testatrix was dealing with her own property, and her intention is reasonably clear. It will be observed that she does not express a mere desire that Jacob R. Croft, if he sold the properties, should, himself, give two-thirds of the proceeds to Alice; she says that he may sell the properties with the provision that Alice receives two-thirds of the proceeds.
