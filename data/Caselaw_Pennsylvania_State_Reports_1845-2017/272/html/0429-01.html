It appeared by Ms testimony that one of the rungs broke or pulled from its socket, causing him to be thrown and hurt. Sullivan claimed he was employed in interstate commerce, and an action was brought to recover under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (Act April 22, 1908, <a href="/citations/?q=35%20Stat.%2065" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="35 Stat. 65">35 Stat. 65</a>, ch. 149).

To make applicable the federal statute, it must appear not only that the carrier was employed in interstate commerce, but that the one injured was likewise so engaged at the time: Shanks v. D., L. &amp; W. R. R., <a href="/us/239/0556-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="239 U.S. 556" data-case-ids="3933227" data-case-paths="/us/239/0556-01">239 U. S. 556</a>. This was properly explained to the jury in the present instance, and, under the circumstances developed, the question was one for its consideration: North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, <a href="/us/232/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="232 U.S. 248" data-case-ids="3672546" data-case-paths="/us/232/0248-01">232 U.

There may be cases in which the evidence is so clear as to justify a declaration by the court as to the class of work in which a claimant is engaged (Moyer v. P. R. R., <a href="/pa/247/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="247 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1009493" data-case-paths="/pa/247/0210-01">247 Pa. 210</a>; Hench v. Penna. R. R.

Here, there was testimony from which it could be found that the plaintiff was employed in making up a train, on the tracks of defendant company, for delivery to a connecting railroad for through shipment. Both were at the time engaged in interstate business, and the particular train contained certain vehicles billed to points in other states. The fact that intrastate as well as interstate cars were included does not alter the character of the service: P. &amp; R. Ry. Co. v.

The plaintiff might have instituted his action, basing his contention upon the Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1893 (27 Stat. at Large, ch. 196), as amended by the Act of April 14,1910 (36 Stat. at Large, ch. 160), and recovered without proof of negligence, if he showed that proper ladders were not provided on the cars about which he was employed: Texas &amp; Pacific Ry.

But his demand was based on the former statute; as a result, it was incumbent upon him to prove lack of due care by the defendant, which was the proximate cause of the injury, and to present a case free from facts showing the risk was one which had been assumed by him when employment was accepted: Southern Pacific Company v.

He testified to the displacement of a rung, causing his sudden descent, and that an examination showed the ladder to be rusted and so worn throughout that it was “practically ready to fall away.” This condition was observable to any one who examined it. It is true this evidence comes from the appellant alone, but it was for the jury.

The evidence shows, if believed, that the ladder was rusty and perceptibly fragile. Was the external appearancé sufficient to indicate the danger, and that the railroad company had not performed its duty in making inspection of its cars? • Unless the employer had previous knowledge of the defect, or ought to have had such, he is not to be held responsible for injury resulting from some unforeseen event: Mensch v.

A railroad company is bound to exercise due care to ascertain if its appliances remain in a reasonably safe condition, and to remedy any defects which may be discoveed. The observable condition of the object may be sufficient to put it on guard: Case v.

The question involved was carefully <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>and correctly submitted to the jury, and the evidence justified the finding which it reached.</p>
    <p id="b459-3" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[211,445,1149,1242]]]'>It is further insisted that no recovery can be had, since the proofs failed to clearly show that the injury, for which damages were sought, was the result of the negligent act. In March of 1915, Sullivan was operated upon for appendicitis, and testimony for defendant disclosed subsequent treatment by the doctors for a swollen leg. The plaintiff denied the existence of this condition, and offered proof of his good health at the time of the accident. The external hurt to his back and leg was described, the attention he received from the physicians of defendant, and, later, from others. His doctor testified the permanent injury complained of could have occurred from the fall. This in itself would be insufficient, if the finding of the jury was to rest alone on expert testimony. To be effective, such a witness must necessarily state at least that the present condition probably resulted from the injury, as was held in Fink v. Sheldon Axle &amp; Spring Co., <a href="/pa/270/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="270 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="1066073" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0476-01">270 Pa. 476</a>, a case in which no evidence of any surface injury appeared, and the claimant relied solely on medical opinion. In the present instance, there were facts presented which, if accepted as true, would fairly justify the inference that the cause was as claimed by plaintiff.</p>

Director General, <a href="/pa/270/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="270 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="1066010" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0330-01">270 Pa. 330</a>; Kemmler v. Penna.

Even if the proof was not sufficient as to the lasting damage to the leg, — as to this the jury was carefully instructed,— the plaintiff was entitled to recover for the temporary injuries, if the railroad had harmed him through its negligence. It is to be noted the evidence of Dr. Ralston, as to the cause of plaintiff’s present condition, was not objected to as insufficient, nor was there any request to strike it out; no additional instructions were asked of the court; no point was presented as to the absence of proper proof to show a fixed future loss, nor was a new trial asked because of the submission of this question to the jury. The theory now urged was not presented to the court below, and it is too late to advance it here: Hurt v. Fuller Canneries Co., <a href="/pa/263/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="263 Pa. 238" data-case-ids="1047452" data-case-paths="/pa/263/0238-01">263 Pa. 238</a>. . Even if merit appeared in the complaint raised at this time, it is not included, or plainly suggested, in the statement of questions involved, which is necessary, if a review is desired: Furman v.

It is insisted that the finding of the jury rests almost exclusively on the testimony of plaintiff, and that the contradictions are so many and so strong as to render any conclusion based thereon erroneous. A careful examination of the record does not convince us that the facts justify interference by this court, under the well-established rules which have been laid down as controlling in such cases. Where the result depends upon ascertainment of facts and inferences therefrom, the question is necessarily for the jury. The exercise of the power to set aside perverse verdicts, when injustice is apparent, is ordinarily for the court below: Maloy v.
