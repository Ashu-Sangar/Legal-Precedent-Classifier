In an action to recover damages for death of plaintiff’s husband in a collision between two autotrucks, where it appears that the decedent’s truck was driven at the time by his son, an experienced driver under eighteen years of age without a license, the ease is for the jury on the conflicting evidence as to the cause of the accident; and binding instructions for defendant on the ground that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence in permitting his son to drive the truck, are properly refused.</p>

    <p id="b278-7" data-blocks='[["BL_278.9",278,[293,858,1159,1027]]]'>Plaintiff’s husband, while riding on the Lincoln Highway near the City of Pittsburgh on a truck operated by their minor son, an employee of Jordan Brothers, was injured as a result of a collision with a truck of defendant’s, and died a few hours later. The evidence as to the cause of the collision was conflicting, each driver claiming the accident was the result of negligence on the part of the other. At the conclusion of the testimony defendant asked for binding instructions in its favor, assigning, as a reason in support of the motion, that deceased himself was chargeable with negligence in riding in the truck driven by his son, a minor under the age of eighteen years, who had failed to obtain a driver’s license as required by section 4, Act of April 27,1909, P. L. 265. The court below refused the motion and submitted to the jury the question of negligence on the part of the drivers of the two trucks, as well as that of deceased, if any, for failure to take precaution to avoid the accident. A verdict was rendered for plaintiff and defendant appealed.</p>

The minority of plaintiff’s son had no causal relation to the accident (McIlhenny v. Baker, <a href="/pa-super/63/0385-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="63 Pa.
