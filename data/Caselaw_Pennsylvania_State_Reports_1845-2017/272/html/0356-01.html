O’Maley conveyed certain real estate, situated on Boquet Street in Pittsburgh, to Sebastiano Pugliese and received in part payment a purchase-money bond and mortgage for $4,400, payable $50 a month, with certain provisions for payment of interest. On the same day, O’Maley entered the mortgage of record and, by endorsement on the margin thereof, assigned it to his brother, G. T. O’Maley, of Kansas City, Mo. The mortgagor paid the first eight monthly payments to the mortgagee, as they matured, in ignorance of the assignment, and thereafter, on May <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>27, 1920, conveyed the premises to Domenico Argentiere, subject to the mortgage debt. At that time the assignment of the mortgage came to the knowledge of Pugliese and Argentiere. Their attorney then repeatedly wrote to G. T. O’Maley with reference to the mortgage, but received no reply; and they contend James P. O’Maley declined to recognize Argentiere as purchaser of the property or to give them any satisfaction; admittedly he refused the installments for June, July and August, 1920, when tendered him on the 14th of the latter month. Yet sixteen days later, James P. O’Maley, having received a reassignment of the bond and mortgage, entered judgment upon the former for the penal sum of $8,800, and liquidated as the real debt the entire unpaid balance, including interest, attorneys’ commissions, etc., and proceeded to take the land in execution. This he did by virtue of a stipulation in the bond and mortgage that in case of default as to any payment for' thirty days the entire debt should become due and payable. However, on defendant’s application, the execution was stayed by the court below, who thereafter made an order opening the judgment and letting defendant in to a defense. An issue was then framed and the case went to trial before a jury, who made special findings to the effect that the owners of the land in question were able and willing to pay all installments as they matured and were prevented from so doing by the fraud and misconduct of James P. O’Maley, the mortgagee, and that he acted in bad faith in declaring the default. Plaintiff’s rule for judgment in his favor n. o. v. having been discharged he brought this appeal.</p>

The judgment was confessed as provided in the bond, and, the warrant being without limit as to time, it was not necessary to await the maturity of the obligation (Integrity Ins., etc., Co. v. Rau, <a href="/pa/153/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="153 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="840356" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0488-01">153 Pa. </a><a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a><a href="/pa/153/0488-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="153 Pa. 488" data-case-ids="840356" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0488-01">488</a>; Valkenand v.
