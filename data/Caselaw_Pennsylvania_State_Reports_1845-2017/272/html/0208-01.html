Donnelly, his daughter, Bessie C. Donnelly and Frank F. Nicola, his business associate, as executors and trustees. Letters testamentary were granted to the persons named and they continued to administer the estate until December 11, 1907, when they resigned and the Commonwealth Trust Company of Pittsburgh was appointed administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. On January 3,1908, two of the executors, Bessie C. Donnelly and Frank Nicola, filed an inventory and appraisement, which included paintings appraised at $107,186.25 and household furniture at $9,197. On the same day the executrix and executor who filed the inventory also made a first and final account in which they charged themselves with “Paintings as per inventory filed $107,-<a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>186.25.” Mrs. Donnelly did not file a separate account nor did she except to the one filed. The account was audited, a decree of distribution made, and, on dismissal of exceptions to the decree, an appeal was taken to this court which sustained the court below. Donnelly’s Est., <a href="/pa/246/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="246 Pa. 308" data-case-ids="1006212" data-case-paths="/pa/246/0308-01">246 Pa. 308</a>. In that case the question of the ownership of the paintings and household furniture was not involved. On March 5, 1909, the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. filed its first and partial account, in which it charged itself with the paintings and household furniture above referred to. Second and third partial accounts were filed later. In the last of these it was stated the paintings had been loaned to the Carnegie Art Gallery by Mrs. Donnelly and subsequently withdrawn from that institution by her and were at the time in her possession, she claiming them as her personal property and refusing to turn them over to the administrator. On November 3, 1919, a decree was made by the orphans’ court directing her to forthwith deliver the paintings in dispute to the administrator.</p>
    <p id="b234-5" data-blocks='[["BL_234.5",234,[276,1406,1158,915]]]'>This decree was followed by a petition, filed November 29, 1919, by Mrs. Donnelly, setting forth that the paintings in dispute are her individual property and that they “were improperly and mistakenly and against her protest included in the said inventory or account and that she did not know her property had been included in the inventory......., that the paintings never were the property of the estate of Charles Donnelly but were her own sole and separate property,” and asking the court to grant a review of the accounts previously filed because of the error cited. Upon the petition, citations were issued to the administrator and all creditors, and answers filed. On hearing and testimony taken, the court opened the decree, restated the account and made distribution of the paintings and household effects to Mrs. Donnelly. From the decree so made the administrator has appealed.</p>

In establishing ber ownership of tbe property in dispute, Mrs. Donnelly was corroborated by tbe testimony of a number of witnesses, members of tbe family and others, who testified tbe paintings were purchased usually one at a time by Mr. Donnelly, covering a considerable period, and, in each instance, presented to his wife at the time of purchase. It also appears that decedent frequently declared to bis friends that tbe paintings and household furniture belonged to bis wife.</p>

As stated above, she gave notice of her ownership at the time the inventory was prepared and protested against the property being included therein and nothing appears in the record to indicate she was aware, or had reason to believe, her protest was disregarded, and, so far as either the record or testimony shows, no one was misled or prejudiced by her acts or conduct.</p>
