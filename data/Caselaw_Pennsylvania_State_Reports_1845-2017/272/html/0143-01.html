Jacob must live on the farm, at a yearly salary of $1,500; if he does not, everything “willed to him is to be void and of no effect, and in that event Thomas Elliott is to live on the farm.” And, if Thomas refused to do so, everything willed to him was to be void, and Etta Lilley was to have “everything, to hold the same in trust for ninety-nine years.” Thomas was to be president of the Lilley Coal Company and to receive two hundred shares of its stock; fifty shares are given to persons named; $10,000 to Etta Lilley, and $5,000 to Charles Ullery.

The title to the property was to remain all the time in his name and control.

The nephews mentioned were a secondary consideration to the estate that was to be accumulated. During the ninety-nine years no one gets a dollar of this vast income or property, except the small bequests mentioned. His estate and its accumulations consist of farms, coal lands, royalties from coal lands and shares of stock in coal companies, and he directs that these shares shall be held in his estate until distribution. He orders, or attempts to order, his coal lands to be disposed of by sale, and all accumulations of surplus therefrom, or from royalty, sales or otherwise, shall be invested and reinvested in government bonds or coal lands. The insignificant bequests only emphasize the prevailing thought in testator’s mind, and, while he does not carefully instruct his executors as to their duties in the protection of this property (nor does he raise a specific trust for that purpose in others), his purpose, shown by a careful reading of the will, was to fix on the executors a trust responsibility, — not only through the manner and purpose of succession, but through specific directions as to future investments and <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>the upkeep of his property, the collection of royalties, dividends, interest on government bonds and other re-investments. It was intended that the trust (applicable in a certain instance to Etta) should apply to Thomas and Jacob. This is a fair deduction from the will; an active trust is created in the executors and their successors for ninety-nine years, to collect, invest, accumulate, conserve and divide the property at the end of ninety-nine years. The duties imposed on the executors named in the will are beyond those of ordinary administration, and they officiate, if at all, as trustees under the will; the legal title of the residuary estate became vested in the executors, and will pass on to their successors until final distribution. (Every provision, aside from the minor bequests mentioned, contemplates accumulation of capital and income in the residuary estate through the agency of this active trust (see Henderson’s Est., <a href="/pa/258/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="258 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1035099" data-case-paths="/pa/258/0510-01">258 Pa. 510</a>, 514; Perry on Trusts, 6th ed., section 312), to be distributed at the end of ninety-nine years to the heirs, that is, the surviving relatives, whether lineal or collateral, of his nephews, who, as their heirs at law or next of kin, would be entitled to receive such nephews’ estate.</p>

The company was not to be benefited, nor its stockholders; nor were its small minority stockholders to be considered as specific beneficiaries. The will was not written with any idea of an association between item 10 and these shareholders. Testator did not consider relatives or persons; his mind was fixed on one specific object, — the amassing of a great estate, to be divided as his ultimate gift at the end of ninety-nine years. He surrounds these thoughts and ideas with every protection possible. His right hand guards his left. Instead of leasing to an independent company, one is selected that he practically owns; his estate thereby reaps the reward both ways through dividends as well as royalties.

It is based on testator’s ultimate thought, so closely interwoven therewith that it is fairly to be assumed no such right would ever have been created had testator known that his ultimate gift was to fall. The general purpose of the will was unlawful, and we may add that such contingent testamentary right or interest thus left in item 10 is so indefinite and uncertain as to be unenforceable for any purpose; thus concluding, item 10 is invalid, illegal and void. Testator died intestate as to his residuary estate; it passes under <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>the law to his heirs and next of kin, Jane Elliott and the two Lilley nephews in fee.</p>
