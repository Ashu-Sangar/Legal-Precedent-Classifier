The <em>Holt </em>appellants claim that any differences between the 2011 Final Plan and the 2012 Final Plan are irrelevant for purposes of the constitutional analysis; any marginal reduction in splits from one plan to the next is attributable only to the relaxed population equality standard prospectively approved in <em>Holt I. </em>The <em>Holt </em>parties submitted a revised alternate plan that also allowed a greater range of deviation from the ideal population of each House and Senate district, as contemplated by this Court’s <em>Holt I </em>opinion.

The LRC argues that its authority to consider these additional factors is constitutionally conferred, as it is inherent in the design of the commission described in Section 17. Specifically, the LRC insists that it is empowered to take into account existing or historical districts or communities of interest, to preserve the cores of existing legislative districts in order to ensure a continuity of representation which voters have chosen in the past <em>(i.e., </em>to enhance incumbents’ electability), as well as to address majority/minority districts within the bounds of the Voting Rights Act.

      <em>Holt </em>appellants include what they term “fractures,” thus over-counting the number of counties, municipalities and wards that are divided. In any event, the LRC argues that the mere fact that the appellants created a plan with fewer raw splits — a point the LRC does not dispute — does not signify that the 2012 Final Plan is contrary to law because appellants did not have to concern themselves with important political considerations, public comment or the need to reach a majority consensus. Moreover, the LRC maintains, the difference between the number of splits in the current <em>Holt </em>plan and the LRC’s 2012 Final Plan is much less substantial than the discrepancy at issue in <em>Holt </em>I’s review of the 2011 Final Plan, which the Court struck down. According to the LRC, the difference between the LRC’s 2012 Final Plan and the <em>Holt </em>plan is “negligible” and “insignificant.” LRC Brief at 44. And, the LRC argues, when viewed in light of the total number of counties, municipalities and wards in Pennsylvania, the number of splits in the 2012 Final Plan is “miniscule.” <em>Id. </em>at 47. The LRC argues that alternate plans will always have fewer splits than plans devised by the LRC, and that fact “is a direct and inescapable function of the constitutional composition” of the LRC, and the process of compromise that Section 17 is designed to foster. <em>Id. </em>at 49-51.</p>

Furthermore, according to the LRC, adoption of the <em>Holt </em>plan would throw the Commonwealth into electoral chaos, and would create unnecessarily radical reapportionment. The <em>Holt </em>plan, according to the LRC, draws 42 House incumbents into legislative districts with another incumbent, meaning it would result in the loss of at least 21 current elected representatives as a result of redistricting alone, rather than as a result of choices made by voters.

The LRC states that it “chose to avoid creating new splits and dividing citizens and communities of interest for the sole purpose of unifying a handful of nearly uninhabited geographic quirks.” LRC Brief at 55-56. And, with regard to the <em>Holt </em>appellants’ challenge to the compactness of districts in the 2012 Final Plan, the LRC states that the Polsby and Popper method espoused by the <em>Holt </em>appellants is just “one of several privately produced mathematical formulae intended to measure compactness in some rigid, mechanical manner,” and that this method is not binding on the LRC or this Court. In fact, the LRC argues, another method of measuring <em>compactness </em>— e.g., the “Reock Test” — shows that the <em>Holt </em>alternate plan and the 2012 Final Plan are essentially indistinguishable, and that given the geographic anomalies of the Commonwealth, the 2012 Final Plan is sufficiently compact. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58.</p>

Furthermore, the LRC notes, the 2012 Final Plan resolves issues relating to Harrisburg by replacing it in the 15th Senatorial District, and reducing the number of Senate Districts in Dauphin County to two, the mathematical minimum it may have.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> According to the LRC, the <em>Costa </em>appellants, and appellant Kim, continue to object to this placement because of <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>the way the 15th District is now configured, but these specific concerns do not demonstrate that the 2012 Final Plan is contrary to law.

As we have noted, the LRC argues that the requirements expressly set forth in Section 16 are not the only factors it may properly take into account when redistricting the Commonwealth. Specifically, the LRC argues that Section <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>16’s substantive proscriptions concerning population equality, compactness, contiguity and integrity of political subdivisions are affected by a “secondary set of reapportionment factors” that derive from Section 17, the provision that establishes the composition of the LRC and procedures to govern its task. Pa. Const, art. II, §§ 16,17. The LRC maintains that Section 16’s substantive constraints must be viewed <em>in pari materia </em>with Section 17. Appropriating the “absolutely necessary” language from Section 16, the LRC then describes the interplay as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b465-4" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[276,862,1114,904]]]'>When reviewing a reapportionment plan’s Section 16 factors <em>in pari materia </em>with the provisions of Section 17, it must be recognized that balance and compromise are necessary components of any reapportionment plan. It is absolutely necessary that the Commonwealth be reapportioned on a decennial basis.... [It] is absolutely necessary that a Commission comprised mainly of political floor leaders of both chambers be the body to effectuate that reapportionment. It is absolutely necessary that the Commission accomplish its work in a set time-frame. It is absolutely necessary that at least three Commissioners vote for a reapportionment plan and that the plan withstand public comment and the right of appeal.

In fact, the LRC’s importation of “absolutes” into Section 17 is overstated. Indeed, Section 17(h) specifically contemplates a circumstance where the LRC fails in its task: “If a preliminary, revised or final reapportionment plan is not filed by the commission within the time prescribed by this section, unless the time be extended by the Supreme Court for cause shown, the Supreme Court shall immediately proceed on its own motion to reapportion the Commonwealth.” In short, Section 17, unlike Section 16, does not speak in absolute terms, much less in absolutes that dilute the substantive constraints in Section 16. Of course, the LRC <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>should deem it imperative to make a good faith effort to timely accomplish its task of adopting a constitutional reapportionment plan.</p>

It cannot be disputed that the LRC has to pay heed to the third factor; but, this is a fact of federal law and the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const, art.

However, we are not so naive as not to recognize that the redistricting process may also entail an attempt to arrange districts in such a way that some election outcomes are essentially predetermined for voters — “safe seats” and the like. Again, we do not doubt the legitimacy of employing such political factors in the redistricting process — or, put more precisely, nothing in the Constitution prohibits their consideration.

Assume a redistricting map in place which one party views as unfairly balanced (politically) to solidify or ensure the power of another party. In the next redistricting process, the party that considers itself aggrieved by the old map can seek to rework the map to accomplish what it views as a restoration of political balance — or even to tilt the balance more heavily in its favor.

The parties agree that federal law safely permits a population deviation range of up to 10%. Adjusting population deviations by another quarter percentage point, say, presumably would allow room for fewer subdivision splits.

We first note that only the <em>Holt </em>appellants challenge the 2012 Final Plan as a whole on these additional grounds; other challengers focused on specific districts, <em>e.g., </em>the <em>Costa </em>appellants claim the 35th Senatorial District should have been more compact, and the <em>Sabatina </em>appellants object to the shapes of the 127th and 174th House Districts. The <em>Holt </em>appellants rely on the Pols-by and Popper method for measuring objective compactness of districts (see page 14 &amp; n. 3, supra), but we agree with the LRC that it is not obliged to adopt this or any other of an apparent variety of such compactness models. Indeed, no principle has been articulated to us by which we may assess which of multiple methods of assessing compactness could or should be employed. In any case, even accepting the method favored by the <em>Holt </em>appellants, their alternate plan provides Senate districts that are approximately 27% more compact than the 2012 Final Plan, and House districts that are approximately 34% more compact than the 2012 Final Plan. Although this demonstrates that greater compactness is possible, it does <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>not show that these compactness problems rise to the level of a constitutional violation, given the interplay of other constitutional imperatives. We have no reason to doubt the validity of the LRC’s argument that the Commonwealth’s population is spread out across a large and geographically diverse territory, and that balancing the factors of population equality and integrity of political subdivisions necessitates “a certain degree of unavoidable non-compactness in any reapportionment scheme.” <em>Specter, </em>293 A.2d at 23. We further agree with the LRC that the 2012 Final Plan should not fail simply because “the shape of a particular district is not aesthetically pleasing.” <em>Id. </em>at 24. Given the geographic anomalies of the Commonwealth, taken together with the other factors that may properly be considered by the LRC, the appellants have not proven that the 2012 Final Plan is infirm on compactness grounds.</p>

The LRC again defends the 2012 Final Plan based on geographic anomalies that make certain non-contiguous districts in the 2012 Final Plan unavoidable; the LRC notes that the same seven non-contiguous districts exist in both the 2011 and 2012 Final Plans. We did not strike the 2011 Final Plan on the basis that its districts were insufficiently contiguous. The LRC points out that, in these situations, it was faced with choosing between creating additional political subdivision splits and unifying areas divided by a “handful of nearly uninhabited geographic quirks.” LRC Brief at 55-56. Furthermore, our independent review of the LRC’s Senate and House maps discloses no overt instances of bizarrely shaped districts, bespeaking (as appellants allege) only an intent to gather together certain targeted blocs of voters.

Commissioner Turzai explains that he filed his own brief based on his "position as a member of the Commission, with his resultant interest in defending the 2012 Final Plan, and his specialized knowledge in this area.” Turzai Brief at 7. Commissioner Pileggi states his interest as <em>amicus </em>arises out of his <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>position as a citizen, registered voter, State Senator, Majority Leader for the State Senate, and as a member of the LRC. Pileggi Brief at 1. The <em>amicus </em>briefs, in any event, largely echo points ably forwarded by the LRC. The Turzai brief goes further and misapprehends certain aspects of <em>Holt I, see </em>Brief at 8 (claiming that, in <em>Holt I, </em>"this Court for the first time held that the 2011 Final Plan was too focused on the federal standard”), and seeks to relitigate other issues resolved in <em>Holt I, </em>such as the scope of review and the level of judicial deference in reviewing any final plan. To the extent the brief would raise issues not implicated in the presentations of the parties, we of course will not reach those issues. <em>See Commonwealth v.

In forwarding the argument, the LRC goes outside the reported decision and discussion in <em>In re 1981 Plan, </em>looking to the pleadings. The LRC then notes that the challenger in 118 MM 1981 produced a statewide alternate plan. Holt responds by correctly noting, among other points, that reliance on the petitions and briefs filed in <em>In re 1981 Plan </em>"is misplaced, because those materials cannot supersede the description of the challenges provided by the Court" in its actual decision. And, indeed, our rejection of the LRC's position in <em>Holt I </em>was premised upon the content of the 1981 decision, since the LRC had claimed that the reported case affirmatively established a crabbed scope of review.</p>

It is also worth noting that the challengers have scrupulously adhered to this Court’s teachings respecting the relevance of alternate plans. Thus, the alternate plans proffered do not purport to attack the LRC’s plan by, for example, producing an alternate plan involving a greater range of deviation in population equality, coming closer to the ten percent parameter that all seem to agree would be permissible under federal law. Obviously, a greater deviation in population would make it easier to avoid political subdivision splits. Instead, the <em>Holt </em>appellants, for example, employed slightly smaller ranges of deviation than those employed by the LRC and, starting from that benchmark, claim that the number of subdivision splits in the 2012 Final Plan are not absolutely necessary.</p>

    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.4",482,[262,751,1161,981]]]'>Initially, however, I wish to note that, as before, my view of the actions of the 2011 Legislative Reapportionment Commission (the “LRC”) differs somewhat from that of the majority. As I suggested in <em>Iiolt I, </em>particularly in view of the many difficulties (including, perhaps, necessary compromises) inherent in crafting a reapportionment plan, I believe that criticism of the internal process by which the LRC performs its constitutional obligations should be undertaken with caution. Contrary to the majority’s assertions, moreover, the LRC’s present advocacy does not appear to overstate the constitutional commands under which it operates. Rather, it seems to me, for example, that the LRC appropriately points out that Article II, Section 17 requires that the Commission be composed mainly of legislative floor leaders, accomplish its work in a set timeframe, and act by majority vote; and reasonably •explains why continuity of representation, while not constitutionally required, represents a “legitimate consideration” that the LRC may, in its discretion, take into account. <em>See </em>Brief for LRC, at 12-15, 40.</p>

In reviewing the LRC’s work product, this Court is often limited to an examination of the surface of a districting map whose features are supported by factors that are hidden from our view. Moreover, the very nature of the maps, with their 50 Senate and 203 House districts covering thousands of political subdivisions in a state with a distinctive topography and highly uneven population distribution, may leave us with little apart from intuition to gauge whether the district shapes and political subdivision splits exceed the “outer limits of justifiable deference,” <em>Albert v. 2001 Legislative Reapportionment Comm’n, </em><a href="/pa/567/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="567 Pa. 670" data-case-ids="404594" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0670-01">567 Pa. 670</a>, 688, <a href="/pa/567/0670-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="790 A.2d 989" data-case-ids="404594,9395602" data-case-paths="/pa/567/0670-01,/a2d/790/0989-01">790 A.2d 989</a>, 1000 (2002) (Saylor, J., concurring) — particularly as there is no requirement that the LRC provide an explanation for its decisions.</p>

I recognize that it is now binding precedent that a final plan approved by the LRC does not carry a presumption of constitutionality, and as such, it is not reviewed deferentially. <em>See Holt I, </em><a href="/pa/614/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="614 Pa. 364" data-case-ids="4207655" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0364-01">614 Pa. at 401-02</a>, <a href="/pa/614/0364-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="38 A.3d 711" data-case-ids="4207655,7296583" data-case-paths="/pa/614/0364-01,/a3d/38/0711-01">38 A.3d at 734</a>. Nevertheless, it is difficult to perceive how such a holding is not merely symbolic or semantic in nature, particularly given the limited tools that have been developed in the case law since the present redistricting methodology was adopted in the 1968 Constitution.

In short, the LRC’s ability to exercise discretion implies a deferential standard of review. <em>See Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, </em><a href="/us/522/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="112" data-cite="522 U.S. 136" data-case-ids="11471033" data-case-paths="/us/522/0136-01">522 U.S. 136</a>, 143, <a href="/us/522/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="113" data-cite="522 U.S. 136" data-case-ids="11471033" data-case-paths="/us/522/0136-01">118 S.Ct. 512</a>, 517, <a href="/us/522/0136-01" class="citation" data-index="114" data-cite="522 U.S. 136" data-case-ids="11471033" data-case-paths="/us/522/0136-01">139 L.Ed.2d 508</a> (1997) (referring to “deference” as “the hallmark of abuse-of-discretion review”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>

    <p id="b484-4" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[272,590,1153,541]]]'>In summary, the Court has only a few definable standards in reviewing a reapportionment plan, such as population deviation benchmarks and a strict contiguity requirement enforced except in the rarest of situations. Beyond that, alternate plans forwarded by challengers assist the Court to employ its intuitive judgment as to whether the LRC has “gone too far,” and hence, abused its discretion. Whether or not we say deference is at work, the acknowledgement of discretion and the allocation of the burden of proof accord with the character of the exercise that lies at the heart of redistricting — which, as noted, is legislative and political.</p>
