Specifically, the trial court made the following factual findings. On February 7, 2008, Appellant was taken into custody when police officers unexpectedly found him at Aisha Kinney’s residence, where they had gone to look for a cell phone linked to the murders. Although Appellant was held for a lengthy period of time prior to giving his inculpatory statement, part of the reason for this was the enormous amount of evidence potentially relevant to the murders that the detectives were continuing to analyze. While Appellant was in custody, he was given food and drink, he was allowed to use a bathroom, he was given the opportunity to sleep and did in fact sleep. No psychological pressure was placed on Appellant during his time in custody. Prior to giving each of his statements, Appellant had been read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and had signed off on them. Prior to giving his inculpatory statement, Appellant had been permitted to speak to Ms. Kinney, whom he referred to as his “wife.” At the end of their private meeting, a detective overheard her tell Appellant to tell the truth when he asked her what he should do.

What Ms. Kinney said to Appellant at the station was developed at trial not by Ms. Kinney’s testimony, but by the testimony of two detectives investigating the case, as follows. When Appellant was in custody, the detectives permitted him and Ms. Kinney to speak privately for a few minutes. The words that passed between them are a matter of speculation, except for the end of their conversation, which Detective John Harkins testified that he overheard. Specifically, Detective Harkins testified that Appellant asked Ms. Kinney what she wanted him to do and she told him to tell the truth. N.T., 4/28/10, at 48.

      <blockquote id="b307-16" data-blocks='[["BL_307.8",307,[317,1911,1085,429]]]'>I believe that a logical corollary of the Court's decision to approve the acceptance of pleas of guilt to first-degree murder is the understanding that it simply may not always be possible to conduct traditional sufficiency review relative to the underlying conviction in pleas cases. Accordingly, in such cases it should be appropriate to center the obligatory review on the factual basis for the plea as developed during the course of the plea colloquy, in line with the general approach for reviewing pleas to other offenses, <em>see generally Commonwealth v. Hines, </em><a href="/pa/496/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="496 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1772879" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0555-01">496 Pa. 555</a>, <a href="/pa/496/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="496 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1772879" data-case-paths="/pa/496/0555-01">437 A.2d 1180</a> (1981). Traditional sufficiency review should apply, however, concerning aggravating circumstances developed on the record at the penalty hearing.</blockquote>
