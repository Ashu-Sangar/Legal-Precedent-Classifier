    <blockquote id="b642-13" data-blocks='[["BL_642.12",642,[320,1436,1107,581]]]'>(1) Where the Superior Court contravened its own prior holdings as well as controlling precedent from this Court on the fundamental requirement that confessed judgments must be supported by a warrant of attorney in the contract on which judgment was confessed, where the prevalence of confession of judgment clauses utilized in this Commonwealth makes this a pervasive issue, and where disregard of the legal requirements governing confessed judgments results in denial of constitutional rights to due process and trial by jury, should this Court take this appeal?</blockquote>
