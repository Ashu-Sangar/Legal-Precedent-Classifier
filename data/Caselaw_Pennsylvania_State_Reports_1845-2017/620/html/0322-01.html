After noting “a restrictive covenant is enforceable if supported by new consideration, <em>either in the form of an initial employment contract </em>or a change in the conditions of employment,” this Court held the covenant at issue was not enforceable because the employee’s status did not change beneficially when the parties reduced their agreements to writing. <em>Gottus, </em>at 281 (emphasis added).
