The administrative proceedings were stayed pending resolution of the matter in the common pleas court, which ultimately agreed with Appellant that Spivak lacked authority to change beneficiaries under Section 5536(b) of the Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. § 5536(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> For this reason, the court ruled that the third nomination form submitted by Spivak was a nullity.</p>

Ms. Cattermole asserted that the altered second nomination form that had been processed by PSERS in December 2002, should have been rejected because the changes had not been initialed by Decedent; however, she could not explain why the usual PSERS procedure was not followed in this case. Nevertheless, she also testified that (1) there was no prohibition against a member receiving assistance from another person to complete a form; and (2) it was her understanding, after reviewing relevant exhibits, that PSERS had accepted the second nomination form naming Appellant as the principal beneficiary of 100% of Decedent’s death benefits.</p>

Hearing Officer’s Opinion and Recommendation at 10, Finding of Fact No. 33, as adopted by the Board’s Opinion and Order at 3. The hearing officer concluded that Appellant was entitled to the benefits as the last person designated by Decedent to be the primary beneficiary, further determining that it was of no <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>moment that the second nomination form had been altered in contravention to PSERS policies.

The hearing officer further noted that PSERS had accepted and processed the second nomination form, notified Decedent of same, and Decedent had never thereafter altered her beneficiary designation. Relatedly, the hearing officer found: “Once a form has been processed by PSERS, a copy of the form is then returned to the member.” Hearing Officer’s Opinion and Recommendation at 10, Finding of Fact No. 38, as adopted by the Board’s Opinion and Order at 3.

In affirming the hearing officer’s recommendation, the Board adopted the hearing officer’s findings of fact with a few notable exceptions. First, the Board rejected two findings of fact (Nos. 42 and 51) outright because they relied exclusively on Appellant’s testimony as to what Decedent had told her, and modified several other findings of fact (Nos. 43, 54, 55, and 57) only to the extent that they relied upon arguably inadmissible hearsay statements purportedly made by Decedent to Appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Second, the Board made an additional formal finding of fact, based on the evidence of record, namely: “Decedent made no further change to her beneficiary nomination after being notified by PSERS that her October 2002 Nomination of Beneficiary form [designating Appellant as sole primary beneficiary] had been accepted. (Official Notice, PSERS’ Records)” Board’s Opinion and Order at 5, Finding of Fact No. 58.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The Board then adopted the <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>hearing officer’s reasoning that Decedent’s death benefit was payable to Appellant. Specifically, the Board reasoned that (1) Decedent had submitted the second nomination form naming Appellant as the sole primary beneficiary; (2) PSERS had accepted that form and notified Decedent that if she wished to make any further changes she could; (3) Decedent never made any subsequent changes to her designation of beneficiary, thus establishing that the second nomination form designating Appellant as the sole, primary beneficiary was the most recently filed, processed, and acknowledged valid nomination of beneficiary form received by PSERS; and (4) there was no evidence of fraud.</p>

The Commonwealth Court agreed, reasoning that “the express terms of Section 8507(e) specifically require a member to change a nomination of beneficiary by some manner of a ‘legible representation of letters or numerals upon a material substance.’ ” <em>Snizaski v.

The Board argues that Appellant should receive the death benefit because the second nomination form clearly establishes that Decedent intended to name Appellant as the sole primary beneficiary, and “the member’s intent is the polestar by which to determine the last named beneficiary.” Board’s Brief at 1. Along these lines, the Board argues that the Commonwealth Court ignored the undisputed evidence that Decedent had signed and dated the second nomination form after Appellant had (incorrectly) filled it out; that Decedent had twice mailed the second nomination form, first in its original state and then as corrected; and that Decedent had received but never acted upon PSERS’s acknowledgment and acceptance of the corrected form. Further, the Board contends that Decedent would have received a copy of the processed second nomination form <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>after the corrected copy had been received and approved by PSERS. So far as the Board is concerned, the corrected second nomination form was in a written, tangible form, signed by the member; therefore, it met the requirements of Section 8507 and was thus valid. The Board agrees with Appellant that nothing more is required. Indeed, the Board avers that the Commonwealth Court ruling would place a huge burden upon the Board to examine and confirm that every form it receives was completed by the member. Further, the Board emphasizes the autonomy given to members by the Code to make beneficiary changes, arguing that, ultimately, the determination of the proper disposition of death benefits must be controlled by the member’s intent, which was clear in this case: <em>ie., </em>the evidence is clear that Decedent intended the money to go to Appellant.</p>

Appellees further contend that Appellant had no right to act on behalf of Decedent in altering the form. Additionally, Appellees contend that because the Board struck or modified all factual findings dependent upon the purported hearsay statements of Decedent, Appellant is bereft of an argument, because her position has always been that she had altered the second nomination form solely at Decedent’s verbal direction. Appellees also argue the converse of Appellant’s and the Board’s contention that Section 8507(e) does not prohibit a member from allowing another individual to fill in areas of the nomination of beneficiary form. They assert: “Nowhere does [Section 8507(e) ] state that the member can authorize someone else to perform the writing.” <em><a href="/pa/613/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="34 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4205963,7265404" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0371-01,/a3d/34/0001-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/613/0371-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="34 A.3d 1" data-case-ids="4205963,7265404" data-case-paths="/pa/613/0371-01,/a3d/34/0001-01">at 15</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Appellees’ Brief at 15. A plain reading of the statute supports the argument of Appellant and the Board. Here, Decedent submitted a nomination of beneficiary form “in writing,” designating a change in beneficiary, and it was signed and dated by Decedent. As the Board observes in its brief, the Code “does not ... require the designation to be completed solely in the hand of the member nor does it require corrections by a member to an existing designation [to] be initialed or re-executed.” Board’s Brief at 1.

Consistently with this mandate, we logically infer that the General Assembly envisioned an application of Section 8507(e) that would facilitate the process of nominating beneficiaries in documents submitted to PSERS. If, as Appellees suggest, the legislature had intended to narrowly circumscribe the modes of written communication available to retirees in this context, far more circumscribed than even PSERS’s apparently inconsistently applied internal policies, it would have outlined those restrictions in the statute. The hyper-technical interpretation urged by Appellees is simply unreasonable, as demonstrated by Ms. Cattermole’s testimony that PSERS does not categorically reject nomination of-beneficiary forms that have not been completed entirely in the member’s own handwriting. Absent any evidence of fraud, the process that led to the necessary correction to the second nomination form in this case achieved the clear goal of the statute by allowing the member to make a beneficiary change “by written designation filed with the Board.”</p>

The Board’s decision is in accord with Section 8507(e), and it correctly determined that Appellant was the last person nominated by Decedent by written designation to receive her death benefit.
