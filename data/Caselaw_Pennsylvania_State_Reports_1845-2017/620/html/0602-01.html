This family of seven children, the five youngest of whom are before the Court, epitomizes the problem of foster care drift, as the family has been involved with the Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth, &amp; Family Services (“CYF”) for nearly a decade, and each child has had between six and thirteen foster placements. As a result, the children have been denied necessary permanency, and most are experiencing significant psychological and behavioral problems. This case exemplifies the challenges facing the foster care system when children have understandably strong, even if unhealthy, bonds to biological parents who <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>have proven incapable of parenting. Courts must determine whether the trauma caused by breaking that bond is outweighed by the benefit of moving the child toward a permanent home. After exhaustive review and consideration, we conclude that severing the parental bond best serves the needs and welfare of these children and accordingly reverse the decisions of the courts below denying the petitions for termination of parental rights and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this decision.</p>

The court listed a litany of occasions when the children were in Mother’s custody and she failed or refused to obtain necessary education, medical, and mental health care for them, which was especially concerning given that several of them suffered from mental health disorders. The court also noted Mother’s continued drug use, including several missed tests and two positive tests preceding the goal change hearing. The court also addressed a then-recent report that Mother’s paramour was being investigated for sexually abusing Tad. M. The Superior Court recognized that a bond existed between the children and Mother, but opined that “the bond between a parent and a child is only one factor to consider ... in making a decision regarding a goal change.” <em>Id. </em>at 27. It further noted that the parent-child relationship may be “destructive and therefore not in the child’s best interest.” <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the Superior Court reversed the trial court’s denial of goal change, and the permanency goals were changed to adoption in the spring of 2010.</p>

Following the GAL’s timely appeal, the trial court issued its opinion in May 2012. In discussing the case, the trial court analogized to the movie “The Blind Side,” which depicted Michael Oher experiencing foster care drift before being adopted by a family and developing into a professional football player for the Baltimore Ravens. The trial court emphasized two scenes. The first scene involved a conversation between the' biological mother and the adoptive mother, where the biological mother warned that Michael had run away from every prior foster home to come back to her, which the trial court viewed as evidence of dependent children’s strong bond with their biological families. The second scene involved a dinner at the adoptive family home where the adoptive father asked if Michael would like to become part of their family and for him and his wife to become Michael’s legal guardians. Michael responded that he thought he already was part of the family. The trial court viewed this scene as evidence of the benefits of a permanent, loving adoptive home and the insignificance of the legal designations of termination and adoption to the child. The court opined, “The reality [is] that children in stable, loving homes foster or adoptive, understandably still want to see their families, and we as child welfare courts should recognize and develop both relationships.” Tr.

In presenting its primary argument that termination serves the children’s needs and welfare given their history of abuse and neglect over the past decade, the GAL summarizes various sociological research and literature indicating that abused and neglected children, like victims of domestic abuse, often develop strong bonds toward their abuser. Despite the abuse, the GAL contends that the victims turn to the abuser for comfort, as the abuser is the one providing for the victim. According to the GAL, the bonds, while strong, may be traumatic, pathological, and unhealthy. Rather than being necessary and beneficial to the children, the GAL argues that these bonds cause confusion and various psychological issues for the victim. Moreover, the GAL contends that the behaviors children develop to cope with severe or long term abuse sometimes make them less able to adapt to the healthy family and social interactions in foster homes.

In contrast, the GAL observes that, as of the denial of the termination petitions, Ty.

We reject Mother’s preliminary arguments and instead find the GAL’s issue encompassed by the question raised in the Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement: “The Trial Court abused its discretion and/or erred as a matter of law when it found that CYF did not present clear and convincing evidence supporting the termination of parental rights of Mother pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 2511(b).” Given that the trial court’s denial of the termination petitions was based primarily upon the existence of a bond between the children and Mother and the concern that severing that bond would cause “irreparable harm,” Tr. Ct. Op. at 29, the GAL has always argued that the existence of a bond should not prevent the conclusion that termination of parental rights serves the needs and welfare of the children. The inclusion of the term “pathological” in the question presented does not change the underlying challenge.</p>

The trial court’s suggested exception could swallow the rule, and permanency could be obstructed in cases where children have been unable to form healthy bonds with foster families, potentially as a result of their unhealthy bonds with biological parents who may be undermining their relationship with their foster family. <em>See, e.g. In the Matter of T.D., </em><a href="/a2d/949/0910-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="949 A.2d 910" data-case-ids="8240962" data-case-paths="/a2d/949/0910-01">949 A.2d at 921</a>; <em>In re J.F., </em><a href="/vt/180/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="180 Vt. 583" data-case-ids="3147777" data-case-paths="/vt/180/0583-01">904 A.2d at 1215-16</a> (terminating parental rights where biological parents could not parent child and instead hampered child’s ability to bond with foster family and attain stability).</p>

We commend the trial court for recognizing that concurrent planning is a best practice, as it allows agencies to provide families with services in hopes of reunification while also preparing for the child’s potential adoption. Concurrent planning is especially useful early in <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>the proceedings when it is unclear whether the parents will be able to learn to parent their children. Conversely, we caution that concurrent planning should not be used to prolong instability for children when it becomes clear that parents will be unable to provide their children’s basic needs in the near future. Trial courts’ use of concurrent planning beyond its useful life can create confusion for the children and potentially increase the difficulty for them to bond with pre-adoptive parents, thus perpetuating the problem of foster care drift. As Dr. Pepe observed in her testimony, the child is conflicted “between loyalty to a biological parent and loyalty to a foster parent, pre-adoptive parent, adoptive parent. When it is clear to the child that they are in their permanent home, then the conflict can diminish, which can result in less disruptive behaviors and a greater sense of security.” N.T., 8/31/11, at 107.</p>

We conclude without hesitation that it best serves their needs and welfare to sever their bond with Mother permanently, in order to permit them to be placed forthwith into healthy, permanent homes.

As noted, in <em>R.J.T., </em>we questioned the Superior Court’s long-standing caselaw on this issue. <a href="/pa/608/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="9 A.3d 1179" data-case-ids="4199265,4200073,7288303,7288341" data-case-paths="/pa/608/0009-01,/pa/608/0008-01,/a3d/9/1179-01,/a3d/9/1179-02">9 A.3d at </a>1186-87 n. 9. While we do not resolve the issue here, we nonetheless note that the Office of Children and Family in the Courts has observed that a goal change from reunification generally relieves the agency of continuing efforts toward reunification; however, “[(Irrespective of a goal change, the judge or master can order the agency to continue to offer services <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>and make reasonable efforts when it is in the best interest of the child.” <em>Pennsylvania Dependency Benchbook </em>§ 11.5 at 122.</p>

As previously noted, Mother is in essence asking this Court to perpetuate a Catch-22, where her abusive parenting has created pathological bonds in the children that cannot be severed without causing further harm to the child. The result, however, is that the children strengthen their unhealthy bonds with Mother, who is unlikely to be able to parent them, and yet are stymied from forming healthy bonds with their foster families who could provide them permanency and, with it, well-being.</p>

We recognize, however, that the Superior Court in <em>K.K.R.-S. </em>addressed a situation where no clear bond between the mother and child was apparent, and thus rejected the mother’s attempt to require CYS to prove the absence of a positive bond.</p>
