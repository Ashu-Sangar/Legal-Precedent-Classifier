Because we find the references were not prejudicial, we reverse the Superior Court’s order and remand for reinstatement of the trial court’s judgment of sentence.</p>
    <p id="b541-9" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[258,1168,1152,746]]]'>Jack W. Fortenbaugh, II was charged with rape and other related offenses for incidents involving the sexual abuse of his stepdaughter. Fortenbaugh first abused her when she was approximately 12 years old, and again in 2005 and 2006, when she was approximately 16 years old. At trial, victim testified to the abuse; the Commonwealth also called a friend of the victim, who stated she was also abused by Fortenbaugh. Following this testimony, the Commonwealth played for the jury a CD recording of an interview of Fortenbaugh conducted by Detective John Bohrman; the jury heard Detective Bohr-man asking if Fortenbaugh would take a polygraph test. Counsel for Fortenbaugh immediately objected. A side-bar discussion ensued, after which the trial court directed the jury to disregard any reference to the polygraph test.</p>

The trial court issued the same cautionary instruction. The Commonwealth resumed playing the CD, and no other polygraph references were made. The redacted CD contained, however, two obvious gaps in the recording. Subsequently, Fortenbaugh’s counsel moved for a mistrial, but the trial court denied the request. The jury found Fortenbaugh guilty of rape and other related charges.</p>
    <p id="b542-5" data-blocks='[["BL_542.5",542,[267,708,1158,1541]]]'>On appeal to the Superior Court, Fortenbaugh argued the trial court abused its discretion in not granting his mistrial motion based on the two direct polygraph references and the two obvious gaps in the recording, which suggested further discussion about the test. The Superior Court agreed, finding the instant case “more closely mirror[ed]” <em>Commonwealth v. Watkins, </em><a href="/a2d/750/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="750 A.2d 308" data-case-ids="11525478" data-case-paths="/a2d/750/0308-01">750 A.2d 308</a> (Pa.Super.2000), because here, as in <em>Watkins, </em>there were multiple direct and indirect references to the polygraph test, and the references were not inadvertent. <em>Commonwealth v. Fortenbaugh, </em>No. 2460 EDA 2009, unpublished memorandum at 14-15, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.3d%20976" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 A.3d 976">13 A.3d 976</a> (Pa.Super. filed September 9, 2010). The Superior Court also noted “similar[ ] to <em>Watkins, </em>the sequence of the polygraph references in [Fortenbaughj’s case allowed the jury to infer [Fortenbaughj’s guilt.” <em>Id., </em>at 15. Specifically, the two direct references to the test “suggested that [Fortenbaugh] refused to take the test the first time he was asked[,]” and “the two redacted portions of the recording permitted the jury to speculate that [Fortenbaugh] either repeatedly refused to take the test, or that it was in fact administered and the redacted portions were the discussion of the results of that test.” <em>Id., </em>at 15-16. The Superior Court concluded “the references and redacted portions of the recording, taken as whole, raised an inference concerning [Fortenbaugh]’s guilt and caused him prejudice to such a degree that the [trial] court’s curative instruction, albeit thorough, was insufficient to remedy it.” <em>Id., </em>at 16-17. Accordingly, the Superior Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The Commonwealth sought allowance of appeal, which we granted.</p>

An abuse of discretion is not merely an error of judgment, but if in reaching a conclusion the law is overridden or misapplied, or the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will ... discretion is abused. A trial court may grant a mistrial only where the incident upon which the motion is based is of such a nature that its unavoidable effect is to deprive the defendant of a fair trial by preventing the jury from weighing and rendering a true verdict. A mistrial is not necessary where cautionary instructions are adequate to overcome prejudice.</blockquote>

    <p id="b543-7" data-blocks='[["BL_543.6",543,[253,1681,1154,689]]]'>In determining whether a testimonial reference to a polygraph test warrants a mistrial, three factors are generally considered: (1) whether the Commonwealth prompted the reference to the polygraph test; (2) whether the reference suggested the results of the polygraph; and (3) whether the trial court issued prompt and adequate instructions regarding the unreliability and inadmissibility of polygraph tests. <em>See Commonwealth v. Miller, </em><a href="/pa/497/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="497 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1775279" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0257-01">497 Pa. 257</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="497 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1775279" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0257-01">439 A.2d 1167</a>, 1171 (1982). After consideration of these three factors, courts must assess the resulting prejudice to the defendant, an evaluation which turns on whether such reference, considered in light of the circumstances of the case, causes an inference to arise as to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. <em>Id., </em>at 1170.</p>

      <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>In <em>Watkins, </em>the Superior Court, relying upon <em>Miller </em>and other decisions which applied the <em>Miller </em>analysis, determined the defendant was prejudiced by references to a polygraph test when the trial court permitted the Commonwealth to reveal the defendant abruptly changed his story and admitted to the crime when police stated a polygraph test could be administered. Additionally, the trial court in <em>Watkins </em>did not issue a cautionary instruction. While the results of the polygraph were not discussed, the Superior Court concluded the jury could easily have inferred the defendant failed the test due to the abrupt change in his story.</p>
    <p id="b544-5" data-blocks='[["BL_544.4",544,[273,917,1155,1109]]]'>The Superior Court’s reliance on <em>Watkins </em>was misplaced. In <em>Watkins, </em>there were multiple, deliberate references to the polygraph test. “[T]he Commonwealth directly referenced the polygraph test in its opening argument, on direct examination and in its closing argument.” <em>Watkins, </em>at 317. Additionally, “the Commonwealth fully intended to and later accomplished making numerous direct references to [the defendant’s] offer to take a polygraph test.” <em>Id., </em>at 318. The circumstances creating prejudice in <em>Watkins </em>are simply not present here. It is clear disclosure of the references on the CD was not intentional. The trial court determined: “Based on the specific facts of the case, we find that there has been no showing of any intent on the part of the Commonwealth to prejudice [Fortenbaugh] to the point of denial of a fair trial or any bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth in playing the CD.” Trial Court Opinion, 1/26/10, at 8. Our review of the record does not disclose anything to disturb this conclusion. Additionally, it is clear the references were not as extensive or numerous as in <em>Watkins; </em>there were only two short, direct references to a polygraph test, which fails to establish intent to prejudice by the Commonwealth.</p>

Additionally, the jury learned the defendant abruptly changed his story once the officer told him a polygraph test could be performed if he wished. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, there was no mention in the recording whether a test was <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>administered or what happened after the request to Fortenbaugh was made. <em>See </em>Trial Court Opinion, 1/26/10, at 8 (“[T]he jury did not hear whether [Fortenbaugh] took the polygraph test or, if he did, what the results of that test were.”).</p>

Miller, </em><a href="/pa/497/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="497 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1775279" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0257-01">497 Pa. 257</a>, 264, <a href="/pa/497/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="497 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1775279" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0257-01">439 A.2d 1167</a>, 1170 (1982). In this regard, the majority’s three-factor analysis, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion, at 486-88, 69 A.3d at 193-94, represents a particularized review of the circumstances at issue in <em>Miller </em>rather than a standard generalizable to all cases. Indeed, as the Superior Court has recognized, “[wjhether a reference to a polygraph test constitutes reversible error depends upon the circumstances of each individual case and, more importantly, whether the defendant was prejudiced by such a reference,” <em>Commonwealth v. Watkins, </em><a href="/a2d/750/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="750 A.2d 308" data-case-ids="11525478" data-case-paths="/a2d/750/0308-01">750 A.2d 308</a>, 317 (Pa.Super.2000).</p>

As the Superior Court observed, “the case essentially centered on [the victim’s] word against [Appellee’s],” <em>Commonwealth v. Fortenbaugh, </em><a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.3d%20976" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="13 A.3d 976">13 A.3d </a><a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a><a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.3d%20976" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="13 A.3d 976">976</a> (Pa.Super.2010) (table), No. 2460 EDA 2009, <em>slip op. </em>at 16, which elevates the potential impact of inferences stemming from testimony referencing a polygraph test that Appellee may or may not have taken. However, on balance, I do not believe that such references, even in combination with the “two obvious gaps in the recording,” Majority Opinion, at 486, 69 A.3d at 192, raised an inference as to his guilt or innocence such that a mistrial was warranted, particularly given that there was no indication that the jury knew whether a polygraph test was administered or, if so, what the results revealed, <em>see id. </em>at 195.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[274,908,1154,457]]]'>As a final note, I am troubled by the lack of consequence assigned to the Commonwealth’s carelessness, especially in light of the fact that the trial court issued several admonitions to the prosecutor to ensure that the references to the polygraph test were correctly redacted. <em>See id. </em>at 486, 69 A.3d at 192. In my view, it would not be inappropriate for a trial judge, evaluating a motion for a mistrial, to give weight to the prosecution’s conduct concerning the prohibited disclosure of the defendant’s potential submission to a polygraph test.</p>

The question of whether a new trial should be ordered because of an in-court reference to a polygraph test is one heavily dependent on the relevant facts. Accordingly, a trial court may take into account the particular role a party had in divulging the information at trial and the motivations for the disclosure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> Here, however, the trial court determined that <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>there was “no showing of any intent by the Commonwealth to prejudice [Appellee] to the point of denial of a fair trial or any bad faith on the part of the Commonwealth in playing the CD [containing the references to the polygraph test].” Trial Court Opinion, dated 1/26/10, at 8. The trial court was in the best position to make this judgment, and, with no prejudice to Appellee, the trial court appropriately determined that Appellee was not entitled to a new trial.</p>

The references to the polygraph test were contained in two separate places in a CD recording of a police interview of Appellee that the Commonwealth had in its possession and introduced into evidence. We must presume that the Commonwealth had actually listened to the CD before introducing it into evidence, and that the Commonwealth was cognizant of its potential impact upon the jury. The Commonwealth may have introduced the references to the polygraph test out of gross negligence — we do not know. However, I believe that it is simply unwarranted to unhesitatingly state, based on the record in this case, that the references to the polygraph test were “not intentional.”</p>
