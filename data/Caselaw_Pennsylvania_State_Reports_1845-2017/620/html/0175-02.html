In this regard, the Commonwealth agencies and GTECH stressed that longstanding decisions of this Court establish that the Board of Claims has exclusive jurisdiction to decide claims arising from Commonwealth contracts, including the threshold question of whether an enforceable contract actually exists in the first instance. <em>See Shovel Transfer &amp; Storage, Inc. v.

The Legislature has deliberately excluded Section 521 cancellations from the scope of the right of protest. <em>See </em>62 Pa.C.S. § 1711.1(a) (prescribing that bidders, offerors, and certain others “aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract, <em>except as provided in section 521 (relating to cancellation of invitations for bids or requests for proposals), </em>may protest to the head of the purchasing agency in writing” (emphasis added)). Neither the Commonwealth Court panel nor SGI has offered a persuasive reason why the Legislature would have wished to foreclose protests to cancellations (which would be subject to the Commonwealth Court’s appellate review, <em>see <a href="/a3d/34/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="34 A.3d 307" data-case-ids="7267555" data-case-paths="/a3d/34/0307-01">id.</a> </em>§ 1711.1(g)), while simultaneously sanctioning original jurisdiction actions in the <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>Commonwealth Court to challenge such cancellations. It is far more plausible, in our view, and consistent with the statutory scheme, that the General Assembly wished to rely on the immunity reaffirmed in the Procurement Code to foreclose these challenges altogether. This approach avoids protracted litigation relative to abandonment of, or re-solicitation for, a public project, when the cancellation is believed by a Commonwealth agency to be in the best interests of the citizenry. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(1), (4), (6) (authorizing consideration of the occasion for and object of the statute and consequences of its interpretation in construction of ambiguous statutory provisions).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_29" id="ref_footnote_1_29">29</a>

Indeed, in another cancellation scenario, this author and Messrs. Justices Nigro and Baer favored the affordance of a remedy on a different theory than has been pursued in the present appeal. <em>See DGS v. On-Point Tech.

Notably, this Court was not considering a Section 521 issue when it indicated in <em>Keenheel </em>that "the jurisdictional predicate [pertaining to the Board of Claims] is satisfied only when the claimant relies upon the provisions of [a] contract in asserting the claim against the Commonwealth.” <em>Keenheel, </em><a href="/pa/523/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="523 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1820307" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0223-01">523 Pa. at 227-28</a>, 565 A.2d at 1149. It is a modest adjustment to <em>Keenheel </em>to say that the claims process and the attendant Board-of-Claims review procedure is also implicated when a claimant’s core position turns on the fact of a contract or of its "execution” in making the claim. Along these lines, we find it most reasonable to interpret the term "contractor,” as used in establishing the remedial procedures under Section 1712.1, as including a participant in a contract with a Commonwealth agency which has been executed by all parties for purposes of Section 521. This interpretation eliminates the narrow window of claimants (as envisioned by SGI) who might otherwise fall between the statuses of bidder or offeror, for Section 521 purposes, and contractor for purposes of Section 1712.1, because they have a contract that is executed by all parties, yet nonetheless which is not fully consummated (including, arguably at least, the situation where the contract is signed by the necessary party but does not have essential legal approvals).</p>
