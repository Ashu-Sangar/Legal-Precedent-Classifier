Although appellant argues § 303(b) preserves an injured employee's right to bring an action against a third party, this section is not mandatory and does not specifically foreclose the employee’s waiver of such right. <em>See </em>77 P.S. § 481(b) (employee "may bring [an] action at law against such third party”). Moreover, unlike § 305(d), § 303(b) makes no mention of § 204(a) or Article II. <em>See <a href="/ark/331/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="331 Ark. 162" data-case-ids="1604802" data-case-paths="/ark/331/0162-01">id.</a></em>

Op. at 40, 65 A.3d at 905. The Majority justifies this holding by foraying into a statutory interpretation analysis of Section 204(a).</p>
    <p id="b101-14" data-blocks='[["BL_101.13",101,[238,1929,1159,362]]]'>I would find that the disclaimer at issue in this case is contemplated and indeed prohibited by the plain language of Section 204(a). Section 204(a) is absolute in its language that “no agreement, composition or release of damages” shall preclude “a claim for damages,” and that “any such agreement” is void as against the public policy of the Commonwealth. 77 P.S. § 71(a).</p>

      <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>The General Assembly’s broadness in language is particularly telling of the clarity of the statute; there are no exceptions, limitations, or provisos, even in the remaining clauses of Section' 204(a). The plain language does not restrain the prohibition to an injury suffered by the employee for which the employer would be solely liable (as the Majority holds). Rather, the plain language is completely consistent with other provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act that specifically permit an employee to sue a negligent third-party for injuries sustained in the normal course of employment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Put simply, within the employer-employee relationship, an employer cannot require an employee to execute a waiver of damages as a condition of the employment.</p>
    <p id="b102-4" data-blocks='[["BL_102.4",102,[278,1029,1154,420]]]'>As this plain language clearly controls in this case, I cannot countenance the Majority’s journey into the forbidden land of impermissible statutory construction. <em>Cf. </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b) (“When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”) Indeed, if there were ever an example of disregarding the plain language of a statute “under the pretext of pursuing its spirit,” it is this case.</p>
    <p id="b102-5" data-blocks='[["BL_102.5",102,[276,1473,1152,582]]]'>After rejecting the unambiguous language of Section 204(a) solely because it “speaks broadly,” <em>see </em>Maj. Op. at 37, 65 A.3d at 906, the Majority goes on a four-page discourse concerning what it believes Section 204(a) actually contemplates; what Article II of the Workers’ Compensation Act includes; the history of the Act, dating back to 1915; and even so far as to what Article III of the Workers’ Compensation Act <em>used to </em>say. <em>See id. </em>at 36-41, 65 A.3d at 906-08.
