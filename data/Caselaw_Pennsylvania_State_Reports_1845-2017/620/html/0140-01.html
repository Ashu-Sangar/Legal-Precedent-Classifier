To this end, the Code reposes a substantial component of the responsibility for financial administration in DPW, which — in coordination with the Governor and through recourse to the legislative appropriations process — must substantially reimburse counties for authorized expenditures. <em>See </em>62 P.S. §§ 704.1, 709.1.

According to the petition, the reimbursement scheme — as reflected in the Code, in published Department regulations, and in previous administrative practices — embodied a needs-based budgeting process supplemented by compliance review via intermittent auditing of county and service provider records by the state agency. Appellees contended, however, that DPW, through a series of recent administrative bulletins, had unilaterally and inappropriately substituted a restrictive, statewide rate-setting process in place of the prior regime. Appellees also complained that, whereas previous practices emphasized recordkeeping and documentation by the counties, the bulletins imposed newly-minted, strict, and burdensome cost-reporting obligations on providers operating under county contracts. Furthermore, Appellees asserted, although the Department has erected rigorous new thresholds to reimbursement, it had not disclosed the criteria guiding its own assessment of allowable costs.</p>

Beginning in 2003, the Department related, the federal government <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>had conducted an audit of the Commonwealth’s program for securing federal, Title IV-E funding. Based on the probe, the federal government took the position that some $220 million in payments for child-welfare services previously made to the Commonwealth were unjustified, either because the children receiving the services were ineligible under Title IV-E criteria, or since Commonwealth records contained insufficient documentation to support federal contributions. Accordingly, DPW noted, the federal government sought clawback repayments.</p>

DPW also highlighted that the flexible needs-based budgeting process was never a license for counties to make unauthorized or undocumented expenditures. Rather, the Department observed, it has always maintained the authority — and the duty — to undertake child-eligibility and cost-allowability reviews.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a>

In this regard, the court acknowledged the Department’s statutory authority to visit and inspect children’s institutions and examine all matters related to their administration and management, <em>see <a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20670" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="42 U.S.C. §§ 670">id.</a> </em>§ 911(a)(2), but it found that these expressed powers did not subsume the regimented submission of the newly required information on prescribed forms. The court also concluded, with reference to DPW’s general licensing authority,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">5</a> that there was no sanction for the mandates contained in the agency’s bulletins. Finally, the Commonwealth Court rejected the Department’s contention that its published regulation pertaining to reviews and audits of contracted service providers, <em>see </em>55 Pa.Code § 3170.106(a),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">6</a> authorizes a requirement for cost-data reporting.</p>

From this perspective, while DPW repeatedly emphasizes that counties may contract to pay whatever they wish for child-welfare provider services, as a practical matter, it should be clear to all that the availability of federal and state funding very often will be of critical importance in the local decision-making.
