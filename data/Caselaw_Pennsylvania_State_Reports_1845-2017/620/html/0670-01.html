    <p id="b729-4" data-blocks='[["BL_729.4",729,[258,738,1154,1285]]]'>In 1999, Appellee purchased property located at 12 Capitol Hill Road in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania (the “Property”) from Wicker Enterprises (“Wicker”). Wicker used the Property as an automotive service station until 1995, when it ceased operations of the service center. In connection with Wicker’s operation of the service station, the Property contained four underground storage tanks, three of which were located in the same excavation and used to store gasoline, and one of which was located in a separate excavation some 90 feet away and was used to hold kerosene. Wicker emptied all four tanks in 1995 when it ceased operation of its automotive service center; however, several inches of residual product remained in each of the four tanks. Upon purchasing the Property from Wicker, Appellee registered each of the tanks ■with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection for removal, and, in 2000, hired a contractor and consultant to remove the tanks. During the removal process, Appellee and the contractor discovered soil contamination around each tank. As a result, Appellee incurred substantial costs to remove the tanks and rectify the soil contamination. Because no holes were observed in the tanks or lines at the time of removal, it was considered likely that the release was the result of leaks at pipe junctions between the tanks and the product dispensers.</p>

Jennifer Goodyear, a claims investigator for the Fund, sent a letter to Appellee requesting the information the Fund needed to de<a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>termine Appellee’s eligibility for claim payment, including proof that the tank fees the Spill Act requires had been paid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Not having received all of the information requested, on November 17, 2000, Goodyear sent another letter informing Appellee that its claim was not eligible for coverage because records revealed that capacity fees owed on the kerosene tank and throughput fees owed on the gasoline tanks were not paid. The Fund closed Appellee’s claim file, but, thereafter, reopened it twice to receive proof from Appellee of tank fee payment. Appellee produced checks from 1994 and 1995 establishing that Wicker paid $8,040.73 to the Fund while Wicker was still operating its service station on the Property. In the Fund’s view, however, Appellee did not establish that tank fees were paid in full, and on that basis, again denied Appellee’s claim in August 2006. Appellee sought review from the Executive Director of the Fund, who affirmed the Fund’s denial of Appellee’s claim.

With regard to Section 706(2), which mandates that “[t]he current fee required under Section 705 has been paid,” the Presiding Officer noted that delinquent tank fees will disqualify a claimant from eligibility for reimbursement. He reviewed the evidence of <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>record to determine whether Appellee proved, as it asserted, that all applicable fees had been paid on its tanks, and found that Appellee did not sustain its burden of proof with regard to fee payment. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 6021.706(2). Specifically, the Presiding Officer found that only some of the tank fees had been paid in 1994 and 1995, a tank fee delinquency existed at the time Appellee’s claim arose in 2000, and that $4,504.37 in tank fees, interest, and late charges remained outstanding. Accordingly, under Section 706(2), the Presiding Officer recommended that the Fund’s determination that Appellee was ineligible for coverage of its claim due to its failure to pay tank fees in full be affirmed. In so doing, however, the Presiding Officer did not specify whether the fees that Appellee owed were throughput and/or capacity fees, nor did he specify the tank or tanks on which fees were outstanding.</p>

The main thrust of the exceptions was that Appellee remained eligible for coverage of the clean-up costs related to the gasoline tanks on its Property because, under the circumstances, no throughput fees were outstanding and only capacity tank fees that related to the kerosene tank were at issue.</p>
    <p id="b731-5" data-blocks='[["BL_731.5",731,[253,1535,1153,844]]]'>The Board rejected Appellee’s exceptions. It accepted the Presiding Officer’s findings and concluded that Appellee did not prove its eligibility for recovery from the Fund by demonstrating that all outstanding tank fees were paid at the time the release was discovered and presented no evidence to support its contention that, since Wicker Enterprises stopped using the gasoline tanks in 1995 and the tanks were empty at the time of their removal in 2000, there could be no unpaid fees properly attributable to the gasoline tanks. The Board further observed that, even if it accepted Appellee’s contention that Section 706(2)’s eligibility requirement is written in terms of individual tanks, the evidence indicated that the contamination which was remediated was related to all four of Appellee’s tanks. Accordingly, the Board adopted the Presiding Officer’s report and recommendation and affirmed the Fund’s denial of Appellee’s claim.</p>

      <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>Appellee thereafter appealed to the Commonwealth Court. On appeal, Appellee reiterated its argument that, since the record demonstrated that no throughput fees were assessable on the gasoline tanks after 1995, and that it did not incur throughput fees of its own, it was eligible to recover the costs associated with the remedial efforts it took as to the gasoline tanks, even if capacity fees on the kerosene tank were outstanding. Stated differently, Appellee maintained that Section 706(2) does not preclude eligibility for recovery on a claim as to one tank, for which all fees are current, even if fees on other tanks are owed. Accordingly, Appellee urged the court to reject the contention put forward by the Fund and the Board that, under Section 706(2), coverage of its claim depended on its showing that both the throughput and capacity fees owed as to all four of the tanks had been paid.</p>

Thus, Appellants argue, because both gallon and capacity fees were assessed under Section 705 in the instant case, Appellee must pay the payment of both types of fees, if it is to be deemed eligible for recovery under Section 706(2). Further, Appellants challenge what they see as the premise of the Commonwealth Court’s decision: that, due to the presence of the singular term “tank” in Section 706 and the absence of any reference therein to a “multi-tank site,” Section 706(2)’s must be construed to apply on a per tank basis. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 6021.706. Appellants claim the fundamental error in this approach is its disregard for the Spill Act’s definition of <a id="p680" href="#p680" data-label="680" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*680</a>underground storage tank. Based on that portion of the definition that describes such a tank as “[a]ny one or combination of tanks (including underground pipes connected thereto),” Appellants contend it plainly demonstrates that any reference to “tank” in Section 706 is not limited to the singular sense and includes more than just the vessel that holds the regulated substance. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 6021.103. Therefore, Appellants maintain, where, as in the instant case, “the current fees are not paid on any tank in a multi-tank site, the owner is not eligible under the Act for recovery of remediation expenses stemming from a leak from a single tank, from two or more tanks, or from piping and dispensers common to all tanks.” Brief of Appellants at 28.</p>
    <p id="b736-4" data-blocks='[["BL_736.4",736,[272,1026,1154,1059]]]'>Appellants also offer that the Commonwealth Court’s construction, if permitted to stand, essentially permits underground storage tank owners to forgo the payment of fees on newer tanks that have manufacturer warranties that will cover the costs of leaks without risking eligibility for coverage from the Fund on tanks that are older and more susceptible to releases. The resulting decrease in fees, Appellants contend, will adversely impact upon the ability of the Fund to function and pay claims, and thereby impede the Spill Act’s goal of encouraging tank owners to take corrective action. Appellants also assert that, if Section 706(2)’s eligibility requirement is deemed to be on a per tank basis, in cases where a leak emanated from several tanks, or from, as here, leaks from pipe junctions between tanks or product dispensers, it will be necessary to determine which, and how much, contamination originated from only those tanks on which the fees are current in order to properly apportion the costs of remediation and reimbursement. As this, Appellants submit, is an insurmountable task, the amount of reimbursement due on any number of claims will not be rightly calculated.</p>

Conceding the Spill Act defines “underground storage tank” to include a “combination of tanks,” Appellee nonetheless contends this language does not refer to a multitank site, as Appellants assert, but refers to an inter-connected series of tanks holding the same type of substance. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 6021.103. Finally, Appellee argues our Court’s holding herein will have no impact on whether future tank owners will choose to pay fees on only some of their tanks because the Property was purchased only after Wicker ceased its operations and after the spill had occurred.

In our view, the definition, by referring to “[a]ny one or combination of tanks (including underground pipes connected thereto) which are used to contain an accumulation of regulated substances,” reveals the legislature’s intent that an underground storage tank is not only a single tank that contains a regulated substance, but is also two or more tanks that serve the same function of containing regulated substances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Also, in our view, Appellee’s argument that a “combination of tanks” can refer only to two or several tanks that are connected by pipes and which hold the identical regulated substance is unavailing since the definition does not impose these additional qualifiers as to what constitutes a tank “combination.” There<a id="p683" href="#p683" data-label="683" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*683</a>fore, given the Spill Act’s definition of underground storage tank, Appellants are correct that Section 706(2)’s fee payment requirement may be construed to apply to all of Appellee’s tanks, i.e., the “combination of tanks” located on its Property.</p>
    <p id="b739-4" data-blocks='[["BL_739.4",739,[254,560,1152,731]]]'>That said, the definition of “underground storage tank,” is not, as Appellants argue, presently dispositive. As Appellee aptly observes, in specifying the eligibility requirements for recovery from the Fund, Section 706 does not include that phrase, but rather, uses the term “tank” throughout. <em>See </em>35 P.S. § 6021.706. Thus, whether, in this context, the legislature intended for the word “tank” in Section 706 to be taken literally or to be understood as an abbreviated reference to the term “underground storage tank” and, by necessary implication, its definition, is an open question that renders Section 706(2) ambiguous. Accordingly, we turn our attention to the factors we are permitted to consider when construing a statutory provision that is less than clear. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1921(c).</p>

As Appellants point out, if Section 706(2) is construed to apply per tank, owners could decide not to pay the fees they owe on newer tanks and rely on manufacturer warranties for said tanks, should leaks occur, knowing they will be remain eligible for at least some recovery from the Fund on their older tanks that fail. As a result, payouts from the Fund could exceed its funding and impact the Fund’s financial security. In turn, the critical role the Fund is to play in advancing the Spill Act’s aims of encouraging the prompt remediation of underground storage tank releases and protecting the Commonwealth’s citizens from the adverse effects of such releases could be impeded. We recognize that the con sequences the Spill Act imposes on unpaid fee balances aim to deter such conduct by owners. <em>See, e.g., </em>35 P.S. § 6021.705(e) (imposing a monetary penalty on unpaid fee balances); <em><a href="/pa/595/0685-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="939 A.2d 877" data-case-ids="3844292,8304153" data-case-paths="/pa/595/0685-01,/a2d/939/0877-01">id.</a> </em>§ 6021.1301 (withholding or revoking permits to applicants who violate the Spill Act); <a id="p684" href="#p684" data-label="684" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*684</a>

However, Appellants, who administer both the Fund’s sources of revenue and the claims it pays out, have persuaded us that the Commonwealth Court’s per tank construction of Section 706(2) poses a threat to the Fund’s long-term solvency. Further, were we to agree with the Commonwealth Court and conclude that recovery from the Fund is on a per tank basis, it opens up the possibility that, for a given claim, some tanks will be covered and some tanks will not. In these circumstances, for the Fund to make payments for only those tanks that are covered, it would be necessary to apportion the costs of remediation between or among tanks. Appellants have also persuaded us that the accurate allocation of the cleanup costs associated -with one tank, as opposed to another, would be a difficult and time-consuming endeavor, if not, practically speaking, an impossible task, and one likely to undermine the Fund’s efficient and fair functioning. In point of fact, the Spill Act has no provisions for allocating the costs of cleanup between or among different tanks, or assigning the burden of proving such allocations — it simply does not contemplate such an effort. And, last, we give due credit to the Board’s view of Section 706(2), as it is the entity the legislature has entrusted with claim administration.</p>

Accordingly, we hold that the tank fee payment eligibility requirement in Section 706(2) does not apply on a per tank basis. We further hold that, in the instant case, Section 706(2) requires the payment of the fees owed on the four underground storage tanks Appellee owned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

However, I see no need to reach this conclusion by applying the definition of “underground storage tank” or otherwise determining that Section 706 specifies that recovery from the Fund was not intended by the Legislature to be established on a per-tank basis.

Subsection (2) does not use the word “tank”; it refers to “the current fee” required under section 705. 35 P.S. § 6021.706(2).
