Mr. Edwards died on the way to the hospital while Mr. Hilario sustained serious bodily injury but eventually recovered. Following an investigation, police took Appellant into custody and conducted a videotaped interview. Appellant informed the detectives that he had recently been inducted into a gang, and, on the night of the shooting, had been in a car with several other members of the gang, including a senior member named Vernon Bradley. According to Appellant, when the car was outside of the victims’ residence, Bradley had given him a gun and a mask and told him to “put some work in,” which Appellant interpreted as an order to shoot the two men on the porch. Appellant admitted that he had shot Mr. Edwards and Mr. Hilario, but stated that he only did so because he believed that he would be killed if he <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>did not follow Bradley’s order. Appellant also told the detectives that Bradley had promoted him to a higher ranking within the gang after the murder. The police then charged Appellant with, <em>inter alia, </em>first-degree murder, attempted murder, and aggravated assault. Although Appellant was a juvenile, the nature of the charges automatically placed the matter within the jurisdiction of the criminal court. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6302 (excluding murder from the definition of a “delinquent act”).</p>

The trial judge conducted a hearing in order to consider the statutory factors applicable to the transfer decision, including: the nature and circumstances of the offense; the impact of the offense on the victims and the community; the degree of culpability exhibited by the juvenile and any potential threat to public safety posed by the juvenile; the juvenile’s amenability to rehabilitation and the time frame necessary for such; and individual characteristics of the juvenile, such as his age, maturity, mental capacity, prior delinquent history, and degree of criminal sophistication. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 6355(a)(4)(iii). Based on testimony presented by both Appellant and the Commonwealth, including experts in forensic psychology, the trial judge determined that transfer to the juvenile system was not appropriate. The judge first emphasized the “horrendous” nature of the crime and the “severe threat to the public” demonstrated by Appellant’s “total lack of respect for human life.” <em>Commonwealth v. Batts, </em>No. 1215-2006, <em>slip op. </em>at 5 (C.P. Northampton Feb. 21, 2007). In addition, the trial judge credited the testimony of the Commonwealth’s experts that Appellant’s “rehabilitation, if it ever occurs, will occur only after years of treatment and a willingness on the part of [Appellant] to seek treatment and rehabilitation, something that their clinical evaluations indicate [Appellant] is not ready to accept.” <em>Id. </em>at 6. The judge also found <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>that Appellant was “streetwise,” with “a well-developed criminal mentality and the degree of maturity necessary to commit audacious criminal acts.” <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b176-5" data-blocks='[["BL_176.4",176,[279,513,1152,1175]]]'>Accordingly, the matter proceeded to trial, where the Commonwealth presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the testimony of Mr. Hilario, several officers and detectives, and the woman who had been driving the car in which Appellant, Bradley, and other gang members had been riding on the night of the murder. In defense, Appellant testified, consistent with his statement to the police, admitting that he had shot the victims, <em>see </em>N.T. July 30, 2007, at 68, 137-38, on the instruction of Bradley, <em>see id. </em>at 65-66, because his life would have been in danger if he did not follow Bradley’s order, <em>see id. </em>at 56, 67. In addition, both the Commonwealth and Appellant presented testimony from expert forensic psychologists who opined as to the psychological factors that may have played a role in Appellant’s conduct. Ultimately, despite his defense of duress, the jury convicted Appellant of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and aggravated assault. At sentencing, the court imposed the mandatory term of life imprisonment for first-degree murder, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 1102(a)(1) (superseded, relative to juvenile offenders, by 18 Pa.C.S. § 1102.1), which rendered Appellant ineligible for parole, <em>see </em>61 Pa.C.S. § 6137(a)(1), as well as six to twenty years for attempted homicide, to be served concurrently.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The majority analogized mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juvenile offenders to the death penalty, finding that, just as individualized consideration of mitigating circumstances — particularly youth — was constitutionally required before the imposition of a capital sentence, such concerns must also be taken into account when imposing the harshest sentence possible for a juvenile. <em>See id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2467-68. Specifically, the majority explained that the mandatory nature of the life-without-parole sentences at issue precluded the sentencing court from considering important factors, such as chronological age, level of maturity, family and home environment, the circumstances of the offense, the extent of the juvenile’s participation in the unlawful conduct, the impact of familial and peer pressures, the juvenile’s ability to negotiate with police or prosecutors, and the possibility of rehabilitation. <em>See id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2468.

Observing that the information available at the time of such transfer proceedings will often be limited, the majority reasoned that “transfer decisions often present a choice between extremes: light punishment as a child or standard sentencing as an adult (here, life without parole),” which significantly differs from “discretionary sentencing in adult court” that allows for intermediate options, namely, “a lifetime prison term <em>with </em>the possibility of parole or a lengthy term of years.” <em>Id. </em>at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2474-75 (emphasis in original).

Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, first noted that “the direction of society’s evolution” had moved away from implementing a rehabilitative approach in favor of reducing recidivism, which “led many legislatures to reduce or eliminate the possibility of parole, imposing longer sentences in order to punish criminals and prevent them from committing more crimes.” <em><a href="/l-ed-2d/176/0825-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="560 U.S. 48" data-case-ids="12448995,3641893" data-case-paths="/l-ed-2d/176/0825-01,/us/560/0048-01">Id.</a> </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2478 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting) (citations omitted).

    <blockquote id="b186-5" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[316,1122,1108,310]]]'>Our decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime — as, for example, we did in <em>Roper </em>or <em>Graham. </em>Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process — considering an offender’s youth and attendant characteristics — before imposing a particular penalty.</blockquote>

      <em>Miller, </em>— U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2471. The Commonwealth also notes that, in other cases, the Superior Court has remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Miller </em>for the trial court to consider the relevant factors and determine whether a sentence of “life imprisonment with, or without, the possibility of parole” should be imposed. Supplemental Brief for Commonwealth at 10 (citing <em>Commonwealth v.

As noted by the Majority, this determination is premised upon the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Miller v.

I write separately to note my belief that, for purposes of uniformity in sentencing, it would be appropriate for trial courts engaging in the task of resentencing under this circumstance to seek guidance in determining a defendant’s sentence and setting a minimum term from the General Assembly’s timely recent enactment in response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Miller.</em>

Therein, a juvenile offender under the age of fifteen years at the time of the offense may receive “a term of life imprisonment without parole, or a term of imprisonment, the minimum of which shall be at least 25 years to life.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 1102.1(a)(2). An offender at least fifteen but under the age of eighteen years, <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>may receive, “a term of life imprisonment without parole, or a term of imprisonment, the minimum of which shall be at least 35 years to life.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 1102(a)(1). The statute then lists multiple individualized factors that the court should consider in making its determination, including, but not limited to: the nature and circumstances of the offense; the defendant’s age, mental capacity, maturity, culpability, and degree of criminal sophistication; and the success of failure of any prior rehabilitative attempts. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. §§ 1102.1(d) &amp; (d)(7)(vii).</p>

Here, the minimum sentence applicable to Appellant, if given a sentence of life with parole, would be 25 years.</p>

One court could immediately parole an 18 year old offender, while another court could impose a 50 year minimum sentence on a 14 year old offender. While discretionary sentencing is a valid trial court function and <em>Miller </em>specifies that individual circumstances should be considered by judges sentencing juvenile murder offenders, given that the legislature is the policy-making body for our Commonwealth and has quickly responded to <em>Miller </em>indicating the minimum sentences it views as appropriate for different aged juvenile homicide offenders, I believe courts engaging in resentencing necessitated by the <em>Miller </em>decision, should look to the newly enacted statute for guidance without abrogating their discretion as appropriate in individualized cases.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a>
