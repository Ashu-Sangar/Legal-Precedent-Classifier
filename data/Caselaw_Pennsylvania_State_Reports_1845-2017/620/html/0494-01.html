Its purpose was to consider certain proposed changes to the state charter, including changes to Article V, which pertains to the judiciary. The proposed revisions that emerged from the various committees and subcommittees were subject to public hearings and provided to the full convention for debate and amendment.

This language was amended in 2001 to specify that retirement must occur on December 31st of the year the jurist turns 70. <em>See </em>Pa. Const, art. V, § 16(b) (2001). After retirement, former jurists may, if they choose — and subject to necessity and approval, <em>see </em>Pa.R.J.A. 701 — be assigned to serve as senior judges, <em>see </em>Pa. Const, art.

Although their contentions are in direct conflict with <em>Gondelman, </em>Petitioners alleged that <em>Gondelman </em>“should no longer obtain” in view of: societal and demographic changes that have taken place in recent years, such as an increase in longevity and a decline in cognitive impairment among older individuals, <em>see </em>Driscoll Complaint at ¶¶ 58-62; Tilson Complaint at ¶¶ 56-62; and budgetary concerns that could be ameliorated by allowing judges to delay retirement, thereby decreasing payouts from the state’s pension system, <em>see </em>Driscoll Complaint at ¶ 63; Tilson Complaint at ¶ 63.
