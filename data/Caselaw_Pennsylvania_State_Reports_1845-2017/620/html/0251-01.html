All Philadelphia gun cases where the most serious charge was a violation of the Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act of 1995 (“VUFA”), 18 Pa.C.S. § 6101 <em>et seq., </em>were to be handled by the Philadelphia Gun Court.</p>

Appellant was pointing a handgun through the passenger window at the driver. The police officer ordered appellant to drop his weapon. Appellant did not comply, but instead, gun in hand, retreated to a nearby residence. The police officer repeated his demand that appellant drop his weapon. Appellant finally complied, and placed himself on the ground in compliance with <a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>the officer’s direction. The police officer, and a second officer who arrived on the scene in response to a call for back up, retrieved a loaded .38 caliber revolver.

As a condition of probation and of parole, the trial court authorized warrantless, suspicion-less searches of appellant’s residence for weapons, and prohibited him from residing in a household where anyone had a firearm.

The trial court, however, did not find that this statutory framework confined its authority to fashion a sentence. Instead, the trial court reasoned that “there is no violation of Appellant’s constitutional protections where the specific condition or probation prevents Appellant from residing where anyone has a firearm, and where Appellant is advised that there could be random searches to determine whether he is compliant.” Tr. ct. slip op., dated 5/04/2008, at 5.</p>

The OISA noted that in fashioning a probationary sentence, the trial court’s primary concern is to promote the probationer’s rehabilitation and restoration to a useful life. The OISA observed that the purpose of conditions placed on probation orders is to assist a probationer in leading a law-abiding life; the Sentencing Code authorizes a trial court, <em>inter alia, </em>to impose reasonable conditions that are reasonably related to the probationer’s rehabilitation. <em><a href="/a2d/972/1210-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="972 A.2d 1210" data-case-ids="7298931" data-case-paths="/a2d/972/1210-01">Id.</a> </em>(citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754(c)(13)).</p>
    <p id="b314-4" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[268,811,1152,512]]]'>The OISA found that permitting warrantless, suspicionless searches was an appropriate condition that was reasonably related to appellant’s rehabilitation. It observed that the trial court was aware that probationers have great incentive to conceal any criminal activities and quickly dispose of incriminating evidence; they are also more likely than the average citizen to violate the law. The OISA found that the condition was particularly appropriate with respect to appellant, considering the nature of his crime and the fact that he had a history of firearms offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 526.</p>
    <p id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[268,1356,1152,617]]]'>The OISA also found the condition appropriate for reasons extending beyond appellant’s particular case. <em>Id. </em>(noting that condition was “eminently reasonable” because it was “clearly tied to [appellant’s] rehabilitation and protection of the public[;]” further noting that condition was “especially reasonable in light of the epidemic of gun violence in Philadelphia.”) Given that trial courts are confronted with the task of deterring violent crimes and ensuring the public’s protection, the OISA concluded that trial courts “must be afforded every available and lawful tool in their arsenal to effectively stem this deadly tide of violence plaguing too many of our cities.” <em>Id.</em>

The OISA rejected this argument. It adopted a limited reading of Section 9912(d)(2), finding that it applied only to searches by probation officers acting on their own authority without any <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>judicial sanction. The OISA determined that Section 9912(d)(2) does not limit the authority of the trial court to impose a condition of probation that the probationer be subject to warrantless, suspicionless searches.</p>

As appellant did not raise the issue before the trial court, President Judge Ford Elliott would have found that the probation search issue was waived. In a footnote, however, President Judge Ford Elliott noted that she was in agreement with both “the rationale and result” of the OISA holding that the condition respecting parole was an illegal sentence. <em>Wilson, </em><a href="/a3d/11/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="11 A.3d 519" data-case-ids="7286115" data-case-paths="/a3d/11/0519-01">11 A.3d at 531-33</a> (Ford Elliott, P.J., concurring).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The terminology employed in these provisions— search, reasonable suspicion, exigent circumstances — are immediately recognizable to lawyers and judges as terms of art employed in search and seizure jurisprudence.</p>

Appellant maintains that the Superior Court’s interpretation effectively inserts a non-textual exception into Section 9912, permitting warrantless, suspicion-less property searches by probation officers when such permission is granted in a sentencing order. In appellant’s view, such a construction of the statute is contrary to the plain meaning of Section 9912. The statute, appellant stresses, contains no exceptions or restrictions on its scope: it simply is not written so that it applies only to those searches which are initiated by a probation officer without court authorization.</p>

In <em>Pickron, </em>parole officers arrived at the parolee’s apartment with an arrest warrant and were admitted by the parolee’s mother for the limited purpose of searching for the parolee. Upon entering the residence, the officers observed evidence indicating the presence of narcotics. The officers immediately expanded their search to areas that were too small to contain the parolee, but could contain evidence of narcotics. The officers then seized a package of white powder and other evidence indicating the presence of illegal narcotics, arrested the parolee and new charges were filed. Prior to trial, the parolee filed a suppression motion, which the trial court granted. Upon the Commonwealth’s • pre-trial appeal, the Superior Court reversed, but upon further discretionary review, this Court reversed and reinstated the suppression ruling.</p>

The provision is clear and unambiguous, and lists no exception, much less one tied to a trial court’s probation order.

It is true that <em>Pickron’s </em>constitutional concerns were expressed by focusing on the otherwise unfettered discretion of probation officers, and did not speak of the judiciary’s role. Still, the General Assembly’s response specifically focused on searches by probation officers, adopted a reasonable suspicion requirement, and did not suggest an exception whereby a judicial officer could authorize a no-suspicion search by a probation officer. The General Assembly could well have been concerned that any suspicionless search conducted without the probationer’s prior consent could pose a constitutional issue since an argument could be made (as one is by appellant here, in the alternative) that what is constitutionally impermissible for a governmental actor may not be rendered permissible simply by having the trial court authorize the suspect conduct.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

This provision does not specifically speak to issues of search and seizure — except insofar as it recognizes that the probationer maintains some measure of a liberty interest. If anything, the qualification of the Section 9754(c)(13) <em>power </em>— ie., that the reasonable conditions cannot be “unduly restrictive of liberty” — suggests the General Assembly’s awareness that even probationers may retain a measure of privacy.

In my view, the concerns this Court had in <em>Pickron </em>for the <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>safeguarding of those very limited Fourth Amendment rights against the unsupervised and unfettered discretion of probation and parole officers do not exist in the present case. Here, as the OISA ably explained, the authority for the warrantless search is an express provision contained in the sentencing order of the court that has the ultimate supervisory authority over the offender. Moreover, under Section 9754(c)(13) of the Sentencing Code, the sentencing court has the broad authority to require a probationer to satisfy any condition reasonably related to his or her rehabilitation that is not unduly restrictive of his or her liberty. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9754(c)(13). In my respectful view, that authority would include warrantless, random searches for weapons as a condition of probation for a convicted recidivist firearms offender. <em>See Samson, swpra.</em>

In light of <em>Samson, </em>I would apply settled constitutional precedent to conclude that generally requiring a probationer or parolee to agree to submit to random, suspicionless searches as a condition of probation is constitutional and legal, and specifically that a sentencing order requiring warrantless, random, suspicionless searches for weapons as a condition of probation upon a recidivist gun offender does not offend the Fourth Amendment.

The statute at issue sets forth the supervisory relationship of probation and parole officers with offenders, and provides, in pertinent part, that "[a] property search may be conducted by an officer if there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the real or other property in the possession of or under the control of the offender contains contraband or other evidence of violations of the conditions of supervision.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9912(d)(2).</p>

No state constitutional issues were raised in <em>Pickron, </em>and thus, this Court decided the issue only under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.
