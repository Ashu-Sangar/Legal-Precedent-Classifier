They forced Haynes into a van and drove him to an apartment where their friend, Raheema Washington, resided. There, they beat the victim and demanded he give them money. After Washington expelled them from her apartment, Appellant spoke with Aloysius Hall and Haynes’ brother Selvan on the phone, and demanded $20,000 within 15 minutes. If he and his confederates were not paid, Appellant threatened, they would kill Haynes. <em>See </em>N.T., 12/11/97, at 21 (Aloysius Hall's testimony that the kidnapper said he “needs $20,000 in 15 minutes or the Dread is dead”). After repeated phone calls between the kidnappers and Haynes’ family, Haynes was killed by four bullets to the back of his head.

N.T., 12/11/97, at 21. Third, a week after the murder, Montgomery County Police Officer James Slavin investigated a car which lacked a license plate in the parking lot of the Cheltenham Mall in Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, and discovered a firearm. After Officer Slavin and other officers staked out the car, Bowers, Washington, and others returned to the car; Bowers refused to cooperate with officers and was arrested.

At the joint penalty phase hearing, the Commonwealth cited three statutory aggravating factors in arguing that a capital sentence was appropriate: Haynes had died while being held for ransom; Appellant had a significant history of violent felony convictions; and Appellant had been convicted of another homicide.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
      <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9711(d)(3), (9), (11). Appellant argued a capital sentence was inappropriate because of his age, his character, and the circumstances of the crime. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. §§ 9711(e)(4), (8). On December 22, 1997, the penalty-phase jury determined the Commonwealth had established all three aggravating factors listed above.

This was because his mother was plagued with chronic illnesses that left her unable to care for her children and because, when able, his mother worked “long days.” <em>Id. </em>at 64.

N.T., 12/18/1997, at 27-28. All five crimes in this incident were felonies of the first degree. Four months after the murder of Carroway, Appellant, on May 5, 1998, robbed two victims by gun point.
