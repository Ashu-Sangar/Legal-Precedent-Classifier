Bayard Pump &amp; Tank Co., Inc., </em>3061 EDA 2007, <a href="/citations/?q=988%20A.2d%20712" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="988 A.2d 712">988 A.2d 712</a> (Pa.Super. Oct. 30, 2009) (hereinafter “Memorandum Opinion”). It held that the plaintiffs had been prejudiced by being unduly constrained in presenting their evidence and by their inability to refer to or present evidence of damages to the remaining plaintiffs, some of whom were members of the same households as the bellwether plaintiffs. The Superior Court first concluded that, although decisions under Pa.R.C.P. 213(b) are within the trial court’s discretion, the court here nevertheless had abused its discretion by severing the claims for trial. Memorandum Opinion at 7. The Superior Court stated: “Plaintiffs in mass tort cases may suffer prejudice if the number of plaintiffs in a trial is so <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>limited that their credibility is implicitly called into question .... The interests that militate in favor of severance and bifurcation must be weighed against the danger that the jury sees so small a part of the picture of a case that they are unable to make a fully informed decision.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=988%20A.2d%20712" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="988 A.2d 712">Id.</a> </em>The court reasoned that the “discrepancy” between the scale of the disaster and the number of plaintiffs in the trial may have caused the jury to unjustifiably infer that inhabitants of nearby homes were unaffected and were not pursuing claims, and to therefore reject plaintiffs’ expert’s testimony that gasoline had entered the bellwether plaintiffs’ homes. <em><a href="/citations/?q=988%20A.2d%20712" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="988 A.2d 712">Id.</a></em>

    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[245,928,1154,1168]]]'>The court further disagreed with the trial court’s view regarding potential prejudice to the defendants. It acknowledged the potential for a “spill-over effect” prejudicial to the defendants, but stated that the plaintiffs were equally prejudiced by being compelled to present their claims individually, because “isolating a few plaintiffs may well have trivialized their claims and caused the jury to perceive the isolated plaintiffs as hypersensitive and unsympathetic.” <em>Id. </em>at 8. The majority also opined that avoiding confusion, promoting judicial economy, and increasing settlement prospects did not justify severance because the remaining 41 plaintiffs’ claims still had to be tried, which arguably would be just as complicated as having tried all 45 plaintiffs’ claims together in the first place. The court determined that trying the bellwether plaintiffs’ cases separately did not significantly reduce the potential for jury confusion in the second case because each trial would still include a large amount of complicated technical evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 9. Accordingly, the court concluded that severing the four plaintiffs’ cases prejudiced those plaintiffs and did not significantly further the interests of convenience and judicial economy. <em>Id. </em>It remanded the matter for a new trial of the claims of <em>all 45 plaintiffs.

He opined that a jury would have difficulty <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>keeping the individual characteristics of each plaintiff separate if 45 cases were tried together, and he noted that test cases frequently give lawyers perspective on litigation and lead to settlements, as happened here. <em>Id. </em>at 3.

He believed instead that precluding such evidence <em>avoided </em>prejudice, inasmuch as each plaintiff bore and will bear the burden of showing that contamination affected his or her property and caused injury or damage. According to Judge Klein, evidence concerning widespread problems in the neighborhood could prejudice the defendants and is irrelevant to proving the claim of each separate plaintiff. Finally, he stated that, based on the record, “there was no question that the jury knew of the widespread nature of the alleged contamination.” <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>

They note that the trial court’s decision to sever was informed by holding oral arguments, soliciting suggested case management solutions from the parties, and presiding over hearings concerning expert evidence, and that the trial court’s “on-the-seene” factual evaluation of how a jury might best understand and analyze the evidence was supported by the record.

They contend that this case has broad implications for the ability of Pennsylvania trial courts to manage mass tort and other complex litigation. They assert that while the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure permit liberal joinder of plaintiffs in a single action, it is essential that trial courts retain their discretion to efficiently manage their dockets and protect the rights of the parties by severing claims when appropriate. According to Appellants, bellwether trials are particularly useful and popular because, as in this case, they facilitate settlement and resolution of claims by allowing parties to <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>value their respective cases and resolve their disputes.

Appellees contend they were further prejudiced by the trial court’s order precluding evidence at their trial of the claims of non-bellwether plaintiffs (except to recite case history) because this misled the jury into believing that family members and neighbors of the bellwether plaintiffs were not pursuing claims. Appellees assert that the trial court created the impression for the jury that there had been no harmful gasoline leak — at least not one that had entered the homes of the bellwether plaintiffs. Appellees argue that, given the large scale of the gasoline leak and contamination, severing the cases of just the four bellwether plaintiffs for a trial that did not even include relatives living with them prejudiced them by making it appear that only the four bellwether plaintiffs were pursuing claims, thereby trivializing those claims. As a result of this alleged trivialization, Appellees argue that the jury concluded that gasoline had reached but not entered the homes of three of the bellwether plaintiffs.

The Superior Court determined here that Appellees, Plaintiffs below, had been prejudiced in three ways. First, they were prejudiced because “[pjlaintiffs in mass tort cases may suffer prejudice if the number of plaintiffs in a trial is so limited that their credibility is implicitly called into question.” Memorandum Opinion at 7. The Superior Court does not explain why a jury would question a plaintiffs credibility based merely on the number of plaintiffs whose cases are being tried; it cites no evidence indicating that the jury either questioned or could have questioned the credibility of the plaintiffs on this ground. Indeed, the Superior Court’s opinion is devoid of citations to authority or to the record that would support the notion of prejudice it advances. The jury would have had to speculate to reject the plaintiffs’ credibility on the ground suggested by the Superior Court, particularly in light of the record, which <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>the Superior Court does not discuss. Additionally, even if the Superior Court’s concern is meritorious, it is a simple matter for a trial court to craft a jury instruction to make certain no such speculation and improper discrediting of bellwether plaintiffs occurs.</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[246,600,1157,1596]]]'>Appellees contend that the bellwether group of plaintiffs should at least have included all members of the bellwether plaintiffs’ households. Notably, this argument is a fallback from the primary position advanced below by Appellees — that <em>all </em>of the cases should have been tried together. This retrenchment implicitly underscores the deference that must be accorded the trial court’s exercise of discretion. Apart from repeating the Superior Court’s speculations, however, Appellees fail to explain how they were prejudiced by not being able to present evidence of the claims of other plaintiffs in their households. How, for example, would evidence relating to other plaintiffs’ claims have rendered the existence of facts relating to their own claims more probable? See Pa.R.E. 401 (“ ‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.”). How would evidence that other people were asserting claims have increased the probability that the jury would have determined, based on the evidence, that gasoline had entered the bellwether plaintiffs’ homes? In short, the evidence that Appellees were not permitted to offer was not relevant to their claims. Moreover, the Superior Court’s concern that the jury might have seen so small a part of the “picture of the case” as to be unable to make a fully informed decision is contradicted by the fact that the jury <em>was </em>aware of the large scale of the gas leak, as Judge Klein noted in his dissent. What the trial court would not allow the jury to be informed of was <em>evidence </em>relating to <em>other plaintiffs’ claims, </em>which, as just explained, was not relevant to proving the bellwether plaintiffs’ claims.</p>

Appellees do not contend that the non-trial plaintiffs wished to testify about injury or damage to the <em>bellwether </em>plaintiffs, only that they should have been permitted to testify regarding <em>their own </em>claims. As Appellants and dissenting Judge Klein note, every tort plaintiff must prove that the defendant’s conduct caused his or her injury. <em>See, e.g., Skipworth v. Lead Indus.

Specifically, the majority asserts that the jury’s conclusion, based on the expert testimony presented, that gasoline had reached but not entered three of the bellwether plaintiffs’ homes, “could have been influenced by the false notion that other inhabitants of those homes were unaffected and were not pursuing claims.” <em><a href="/a2d/690/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="690 A.2d 169" data-case-ids="11922615,468658" data-case-paths="/a2d/690/0169-01,/pa/547/0224-01">Id.</a> </em>Again, this conclusion is speculative and is not based on the record. It implies that if the jury had known that additional plaintiffs alleging injury lived in the homes of some of the bellwether plaintiffs, it then might have reached an opposite conclusion, still based on the same expert scientific evidence, and determined that contamination had, in fact, entered those homes.

The Superi- or Court completely fails to explain how the trial court has <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>committed an abuse of discretion. As noted, for a trial court’s exercise of discretion to constitute an abuse, it must be the result of manifest unreasonableness, partiality, prejudice, or such a lack of support as to be clearly erroneous. <em>Grady, supra </em>at 1046; <em>Lands of Stone, supra </em>at 335 n. 3. Not even arguably was that standard met here. As the trial court’s opinion shows, it carefully considered a host of factors relevant to determining whether severance of the test cases was warranted under Rule 213(b) for convenience and avoidance of prejudice. It explained why its orders were aimed at assuring efficiency and convenience, and avoiding prejudice, the precise factors that inform Rule 213(b) and are expressly mentioned in the rule. Even the Superior Court acknowledged the potential for prejudice to the defendants if evidence of all plaintiffs’ claims and damages were permitted at the trial of the four test cases. The trial court’s weighing of the Rule 213(b) factors, based upon a well-developed record, and its employment of discretionary judgment, illustrates the very essence of the nature of the discretion reposed in a trial court in a matter like this. A trial court is not prevented from exercising this discretion simply because a large number of plaintiffs joins in one complaint pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 2229(a). Such a filing does not eliminate or reduce the trial court’s discretion to sever or bifurcate claims or issues under Rule 213(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Apart from there being no legal requirement or entitlement for a plaintiff to have a jury consider him or her to be sympathetic, the Superior Court’s assumption that somehow the jury failed to sympathize with the bellwether plaintiffs is based on speculation; the majority cites no evidence of record to support its conclusion. It is <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>equally possible, if not probable, that the jury may actually have sympathized with Appellees but nevertheless determined, based on the expert evidence, that gasoline had not reached or entered their homes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Yet the Superior Court does not contend that the trial court is precluded from utilizing Rule 213(b) to sever or bifurcate cases in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice. One is left to wonder whether any fewer than all 45 plaintiffs could have been sufficient in the Superior Court’s estimation. Where is the line to be drawn? To ask this question is to highlight the discretionary nature of a trial court’s rulings applying Rule 213(b). Quite simply, the Superior Court would have drawn the lines differently from how the trial court drew them, but overturning a trial court on such a basis is precisely the type of improper review and substitution of an appellate court’s judgment for a trial court’s discretion that we have consistently held to be off limits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

But, in fact, as both the trial court and dissenting Judge Klein point out, the trial court’s method <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>did achieve efficiency, as two defendants settled with all plaintiffs just before the jury rendered a verdict. These settlements mean there will be less confusion than might otherwise obtain when the liability phases of the non-bellwether plaintiffs’ trials are reached (assuming such phases will be necessary per the trial court’s order).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> The Superior Court proposed no more efficient way of doing things, and, as Judge Klein noted, experience with bellwether trials in Pennsylvania demonstrates that other cases often settle, or have shorter trials, once the test case goes to trial.

The Superior Court did not address the specific, extensive reasons that the trial court gave for its severance/bifurcation and preclusion orders. Instead, the Superior Court stated merely that “the interests that militate in favor of severance and bifurcation” must be weighed against “the danger that the jury sees so small a part of the picture of a case that they are unable to make a fully informed decision.” Memorandum Opinion at 7. Rule 213 does not provide for “weighing” the factors suggested by the Superior Court, and the Superior Court cites no authority for the proposition it advances. Rule 213 gives the trial court discretion to sever “in the furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.” That is what the trial court did here, providing detailed reasons for its actions. Indeed, inasmuch as Rule 213(b) permits the trial court to sever claims or issues <em>to avoid prejudice, </em>the rule itself contemplates that prejudice can potentially result from <em>joinder </em>of claims in certain circumstances.

In arguing that the group of bellwether plaintiffs should have included all members of the four bellwether plaintiffs’ households, Appellees cite <em>In re Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em><a href="/f3d/109/1016-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="109 F.3d 1016" data-case-ids="834126" data-case-paths="/f3d/109/1016-01">109 F.3d 1016</a> (5th Cir.1997), for the proposition that bellwether plaintiffs must be <em>representative </em>of all plaintiffs. However, the <em>Chevron </em>court was concerned about representativeness because the bellwether results in <em>Chevron </em>were intended to be extrapolated to and be binding upon all 3,000 plaintiffs involved in that case. Here, they were not so intended. All of the non-bellwether plaintiffs in this case still have their cases to try. Moreover, <em>Chevron </em>involved just a single defendant and no issue of bifurcation; the trial was not to be bifurcated but rather to be a unitary trial on liability and damages. Perhaps most significantly, the Fifth Circuit abrogated the trial plan in <em>Chevron </em>on <em>due process </em>grounds because the claims of 3,000 plaintiffs could have been extinguished based on the results of a trial of a non-representative sample of plaintiffs. <em><a href="/f3d/109/1016-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="109 F.3d 1016" data-case-ids="834126" data-case-paths="/f3d/109/1016-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/f3d/109/1016-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="109 F.3d 1016" data-case-ids="834126" data-case-paths="/f3d/109/1016-01">at 1020</a>.

Indeed, the Superior Court's opinion remands the case for trial of all plaintiffs' cases together, without explaining why such a measure is required.

Further, even if, by the time all cases have been tried, the trial court's severance determination is shown not to have saved a great deal of time, still, when the court ordered the cases severed, there was the prospect that time would be saved and efficiency achieved.
