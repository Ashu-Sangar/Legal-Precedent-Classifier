    <blockquote id="b499-14" data-blocks='[["BL_499.12",499,[272,1481,1109,364]]]'>Did the Commonwealth Court err when it held that a cap on student enrollment in a 2005 school charter was valid for school years before 2008 but was invalid for school years after 2008, even though the Charter School Law states that a cap is permissible if “agreed to by the charter school ... as part of a written charter ... whether ... approved prior to or ... subsequent to the [law’s] effective date”?</blockquote>
    <p id="b499-15" data-blocks='[["BL_499.13",499,[226,1875,1153,367]]]'>The parties are directed in their briefs to address whether a charter school’s signing of a charter that contains a unilaterally imposed cap on enrollment can be considered “implied acquiescence” to that cap, sufficient to satisfy the requirement for an express agreement under 24 P.S. § 17-1723-A(d)(l), or whether something more is required in order to constitute such an express agreement.</p>
