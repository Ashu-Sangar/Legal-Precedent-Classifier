TIAA-CREF, </em><a href="/pa/612/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="612 Pa. 311" data-case-ids="4204863" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0311-01">612 Pa. 311</a>, <a href="/pa/612/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="30 A.3d 1100" data-case-ids="4204412,4204863,4205003,7281982,7282012,7282043" data-case-paths="/pa/612/0310-01,/pa/612/0311-01,/pa/612/0312-01,/a3d/30/1100-01,/a3d/30/1100-02,/a3d/30/1100-03">30 A.3d 1100</a> (2011) <em>(per </em>curiam). To my reading, that is not what the Superior Court held. For example, the court did not purport to foreclose the possibility that a copy of the will, if it had been sent to TIAA-CREF in a timely manner by the decedent during his lifetime (regardless of when it may have been <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>received), could have constituted valid written notice of a change in beneficiaries. <em>Accord </em>Opinion in Support of Affirmance, at 222 (Eakin, J.) (“As [the will] was a writing, the decedent could have sent it to the insurer, which might have sufficed.... ”)• Rather, a fair reading of the intermediate court’s opinion reveals that it merely determined that the decedent failed to. substantially comply with the terms of the policies in question because he never made any attempt to notify TIAA-CREF of the beneficiary changes at issue— although the record reveals that he lived for more than two months after dictating the will, was in sound mind during that time, and was undoubtedly familiar with the requirements for changing beneficiaries.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">1</a>
      <em>See generally </em>Brief for Appellees at 2 (pointing out that the question accepted for review was not addressed by the Superior Court, as that tribunal “determined the case on separate grounds”). The issue on which this case turns is therefore whether substantial compliance with the terms of the contract was achieved. Because I believe that the Superior Court was correct in finding a lack of substantial compliance, I would affirm.</p>

The OISR, however, never addresses the issue of substantial compliance by the decedent in this material respect. Rather, the OISR merely declares at the end of the opinion that, under the circumstances, decedent properly used his will to change the beneficiaries of his annuities.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">2</a> It is <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>difficult to know what standard the OISR applies to find that the decedent’s actions were sufficient to substantially comply with the contract’s notice term.

The first half states the fundamental question: may a will change a contractual beneficiary? The second clause suggests that the answer is dependent on whether the annuity contract expressly prohibits it. This contract of course did not prohibit anything. Essentially, insurance contracts set forth rights and duties of the parties, including the means by which the contract may be modified — they typically do not attempt a comprehensive list of prohibitions. Affirmative requirements for modifying a contract are not rendered meaningless by failure to preclude all other methods. If a contract requires a party to pay by certified check, that does not mean the party can pay in wampum simply because the contract does not expressly prohibit it. This annuity did not preclude changes by will, but it also did not prohibit changes by skywriting, a letter to the editor, or posting it on a Facebook page.</p>

Would the result <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>change if the will predates the contract designation, or the contract designation predates the will?</p>

The court reasoned that, in the instant matter, like in <em>Carruthers, </em>the decedent attempted to change the beneficiaries via his will; however, the court interpreted <em>Carruthers </em>as establishing that a beneficiary change could not be made in this fashion, ruling that, “under <em>Carruthers, </em>the will could not operate to change <a id="p545" href="#p545" data-label="545" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*545</a>beneficiary status, nor could it be deemed as substantial compliance with the policy company’s notice requirements.” <em>Alkhafaji, </em>at 7. The court found that decedent had previously changed the beneficiaries on these annuities in compliance with the marital settlement agreement and, thus, was aware of the procedures ostensibly required by the annuities for changing beneficiaries. Further, the court observed that more than two months elapsed from the time decedent executed his will until the time of his death, which it deemed sufficient time to inform TIAA-CREF of his desire to change his beneficiaries, but he had not done so. The court found no evidence that decedent’s hospitalization or condition had impeded him from making such contact with TIAA-CREF. Thus, the court concluded, “[i]n the absence of any evidence that Decedent took any measure to provide notice to the policy company, independent of the will, we cannot conclude that Decedent did all he reasonably could under the circumstances to comply with the terms of his policy.” <em>Id. </em>at 8.

Appellees maintain that Riley distinguished between cases in which the notice requirement was merely administrative in nature, and, thus, for the benefit of the insurance company, from cases such as <em>Sproat, </em>in which insurers retained the right to approve any change in the beneficiary. Appellees suggest that TIAA-CREF, by using the policy language it chose, specifically reserved the right to receive notice in a form which was satisfactory to it, and, hence, retained discretion under the policy to approve or disallow the beneficiary change since the change was expressly contingent on the policy holder adhering to those notice provisions.

The change of beneficiary clause in the deceased’s policy specified that a change in beneficiary would take effect only when the insurance company gave its written consent, and it also required that both the beneficiary change and consent be noted on the insurance policy itself by the company at its home office. The deceased, who had changed beneficiaries on the policy once before, wrote to the insurance company to obtain change of beneficiary forms; however, when he received the forms, he signed them but did not fill them out, nor transmit them to the company.

However, where a decedent’s will serves only as the vehicle by which he or she changes the beneficiaries for an annuity contract, it does not contravene Section 6108, since the manner of distribution of the proceeds of the annuity contract is still governed by the terms of the annuities themselves and, therefore, remains outside the probate process.</p>

Appellant raises, for the first time on appeal, the question of whether New York law should apply to interpretation of the change of beneficiary provisions for four of the six annuities at issue. However, by failing to raise any such contention below, as Appellees note, I consider Appellant to have waived any objection to interpreting the change in beneficiary provisions contained in those four annuities in accordance with Pennsylvania law. <em>See generally </em>Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) ("Issues not <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”).</p>

These fact-intensive questions were not raised by Appellant in her petition for allowance of appeal, and our grant of review was, accordingly, restricted to the narrow legal question presented by Appellant in her petition which was whether the Superior Court erred in concluding as a matter of law that a will could not change the beneficiary of an annuity policy when the policy did not prohibit that manner of change. Additionally, having interpleaded the proceeds of the annuities, TIAA-CREF does not presently contest the adequacy of the specific language used in the will to accomplish a change of beneficiary.</p>

Contrary to the position taken by Justice Eakin in his Opinion in Support of Affirmance, I conclude that decedent’s use of a will delivered to TIAA-CREF after his death was in accord with the specific terms of the change of beneficiary clauses of the annuities at issue. Construing the plain language of those change of beneficiary clauses, and giving their words their accepted and ordinary meaning, <em>Donegal, supra, </em>all that these clauses required decedent to do in order to validly change his designated beneficiaries was: first, that he furnish TIAA-CREF with written notice of his designated changes; second, that he sign such notice; third, that such written and signed notice be satisfactory to TIAA-CREF; and, fourth, that said written and signed notice be received by TIAA-CREF at its home office in New York. <em>See supra, </em>note 3 (reciting terms of annuities' change of beneficiary clauses).</p>
      <p id="b610-6" data-blocks='[["BL_610.6",610,[310,1030,1118,386]]]'>Regarding whether decedent’s signed will was an acceptable mode of written notice, it is significant that the change of beneficiary clauses of the annuities at issue did not require the annuitant to utilize any specific type of preprinted form to change beneficiaries, nor did these clauses otherwise specify or restrict the type of written notice an annuitant could use to make a beneficiary change. The mere fact that decedent had previously executed another written instrument to change his beneficiaries — the marital settlement agreement — did not mean that he could not, thereafter, use a different method of written notice to change his designated beneficiaries again.</p>
      <p id="b610-7" data-blocks='[["BL_610.7",610,[308,1420,1118,536]]]'>Further, the instant change of beneficiary clauses did not require that written notice of an annuitant’s desired change be delivered to TIAA-CREF at its offices during the annuitant's lifetime, or that the annuitant himself effectuate delivery while he or she was alive. As previously mentioned, <em>see supra </em>at n. 3, and highlighted by Justice Baer in his Opinion in Support of Reversal, <em>see </em>Opinion in Support of Reversal (Baer, J.) at 4, the language of the change of beneficiary clauses specifically permitted a change in beneficiary to take effect any time TIAA-CREF receives the written change of beneficiary request at its New York headquarters, and the clauses explicitly provided that this change would be implemented even if the annuitant had died by the time TIAA-CREF received the written notice. So, in my view, the mere fact that the will was mailed to TIAA-CREF after decedent’s death is of no moment in this case.</p>
      <p id="b610-8" data-blocks='[["BL_610.8",610,[307,1967,1118,387]]]'>With respect to the question of whether the notice was satisfactory to TIAA-CREF, having interpleaded the proceeds of the annuities, TIAA-CREF does not presently assert that decedent’s use of the will was not a satisfactory form of written notice to it. Moreover, and in any event, since the annuities did not require TIAA-CREF give its approval for a beneficiary change to take place, as the insurance company had required in <em>Sproat, </em>and in light of the fact that TIAA-CREF has presently interpleaded the proceeds of the annuities into court, under <em>Riley </em>it has waived any right in these proceedings to reject decedent's will as an unsatisfactory form of written notice to it.</p>
