Rubenstein, and several individuals alleging a status as qualified electors who voted for Judge Friedman and/or Judge Rubenstein, filed in the Commonwealth Court a Petition for Review in the nature of a Complaint for Declaratory and Equitable Relief (the “Complaint”). Petitioners raised a single cause of action under Article I, Sections 1 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, claiming that Article V, Section 16(b) of the state charter — which mandates that judges retire on December 31st of the year they turn 70— should be struck down as contrary to Pennsylvania’s Declaration of Rights, that is, Article I of the state Constitution. The jurists contended that Section 16(b) deprives them of their inherent right to be free of age-based discrimination; the <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>electors asserted that the provision denies them their right to elect and retain jurists of their choice and to have those candidates serve to the end of their commissions. Petitioners sought relief in the form of a declaration that the retirement mandate is unconstitutional, as well as an injunction restraining the named Commonwealth officials from enforcing it. Respondents lodged preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, and Petitioners answered. The parties filed legal memoranda in support of their respective positions.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">1</a>

Application for Relief, at 12-13. In particular, Petitioners sought to introduce evidence supporting their claims that: mandatory retirement at age 70 is irrational; older Pennsylvania citizens are living and working longer than their 1968 counterparts; the compensation package available to senior judges is less valuable than that provided to commissioned judges; and individuals who voted for the judges in question believed that they were electing the judges to a ten-year term.

Article I, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution originally provided that "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.” Under the provision, slave states would receive disproportionate representation in the U.S. House of Representatives (and therefore also an increase in presidential electors) based upon inclusion of a percentage of their resident slaves in apportioning the House. Gouverneur Morris, one of Pennsylvania’s delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, was recorded by James Madison as stating during debate on the measure: “Upon what principle is it that the slaves shall be computed in representation? Are they men? Then make them Citizens and let them vote.... The admission of slaves into the representation when fairly explained comes to this: that the inhabitant of Georgia and South Carolina who goes to the Coast of Africa, and in defiance of the most sacred laws of humanity, tears away his fellow-creatures from their dearest connections and damns them to the most cruel bondage, shall have more votes in a government instituted for the protection of the rights of mankind, than the Citizen of Pennsylvania or New Jersey who views with a laudable horror, so nefarious a practice.” Wendell Phillips, the Constitution. A Pro-Slavery Compact' or Selections from The Madison Papers, etc., 29 (2nd ed., 1845). Following a bloody Civil War, the clause was abrogated by the Fourteenth Amendment. U.S. Const, amend. XIV, § 2 ("Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.”).</p>
