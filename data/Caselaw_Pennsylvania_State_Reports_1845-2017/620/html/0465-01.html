R.A.P. 311(d). The explanatory note to the rule states, “[T]he 1992 amendment permits appeals by the Commonwealth from certain interlocutory orders that were previously treated as final orders under the pre-1992 version of Rule 341(c).” <em><a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">Id.,</a> </em>Note (as amended May 6, 1992, effective July 6, 1992).

The Commonwealth’s motion for reconsideration of the suppression order was not an appeal; the Commonwealth sought reconsideration by the same court that entered the order. Therefore, the trial court had the authority to revisit its initial ruling and to reach a different result; moreover, it did not have to do so within 30 days. Appellee’s jurisdictional argument fails, and we turn to the main issue concerning whether the trial court violated Pa.

At the hearing, appellee was not merely challenging the validity of the warrant on its face as set forth in his motion; he challenged the propriety of the initial warrantless search of the trash, claiming it could not be considered as a fact in support of probable cause. He sought to have the trash pull declared illegal, and its results stricken from the affidavit, such that the suppression court would determine whether the remaining facts were sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. This distinction, the Commonwealth contends, takes the inquiry out of Pa. R.Crim.P. 203(D)’s framework and into a posture requiring “a hearing on the veracity of the implicit representation that the trash pull evidence was obtained in a constitutional manner.” Commonwealth’s Brief, at 33 (quoting LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, </em>§ 3.1(d) n. 89 (4th ed.2004)).</p>

Since the reviewing court’s task is to determine whether the magistrate’s finding of probable cause was proper, the court can only review what was in front of the magistrate, <em>i.e., </em>the affidavit.

Appellee further posits the proper procedure when there is a question regarding the validity of a factual averment in an affidavit is for the magistrate to deny the warrant application, inform the affiant of the deficiency, and permit the affiant to submit a supplemental affidavit.

The affidavit’s language, “taken from the residence,” it was argued, could have meant the trash was seized while still on appellee’s porch, or it could have meant the trash had been taken to the curb by its owner. Thus, appellee made an assertion his constitutional rights might have been violated during the accumulation of evidence used in the affidavit.

Testimony that allowed the suppression court to rule on abandonment, including the specific location where the trash was located, was necessary to answer the new issue appellee raised at the hearing. <em>See (William) Ryan, </em>at 1348. The goal of this inquiry was not to determine probable cause; it was to determine whether a fact in the affidavit would be included or stricken when determining probable cause.

The affidavit alone is not enough; when its facts are challenged, evidence concerning how those facts were ascertained is often required. Live witnesses subject to cross-examination — in this case, one of the officers who conducted the trash pull — were essential for the trial court to determine whether the initial warrantless search was lawful and could remain among the facts it considered when assessing probable cause. Having found the trash pulls were lawfully conducted, the trial court properly considered the information regarding the trash pulls in its review of the magistrate’s probable cause determination, and we agree with its conclusion that probable cause was established. Accordingly, its denial of appellee’s suppression motion was proper, and we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand for reinstatement of appellee’s judgment of sentence.</p>
