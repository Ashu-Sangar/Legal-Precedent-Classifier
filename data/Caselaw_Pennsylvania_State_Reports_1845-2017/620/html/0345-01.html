In Employer’s view, such a requirement is not overly burdensome and Claimant failed to meet it here. Because Claimant presented no medical evidence that she was incapable of working in any capacity, Employer argues, she was not forced into retirement from the entire labor market.

This case, as is often the case, proves the point. Claimant did not simply retire to an able-bodied pension; she was entitled to a disability pension because of her prior service and a work-related condition which disabled her from her time-of-injury job. 58 P.S. § 23564(a). At most, Claimant’s approved receipt of a disability pension necessarily shows that she could not perform her time-of-injury position; it does not necessarily follow that she, and all workers similarly situated to her, decided to forgo all employment. Any presumption of a total inability to work or intent not to work is conjectural. Mandatory presumptions are, essentially, time-saving evidentiary devices governing matters not subject to reasonable dispute (as a matter of logic or policy). The requisite rational connection between the fact proved (acceptance of any type of pension) and the ultimate fact that Employer would have presumed (voluntary retirement and removal from the workforce) is lacking here. Put another way, if the proffered presumption here was so obvious and legitimate, Employer should have little difficulty proving it by conventional evidentiary methods.</p>

However, this is just one fact of many possible probative facts that must be considered in determining whether the claimant has voluntarily withdrawn from the workforce. Given that the inference to be drawn from a person’s receipt of a pension, viewed alone, is equivocal and inconclusive, the receipt of a pension is not sufficient evidence, in and of itself, to discharge the employer’s burden of proof.</p>

In subsequent litigation regarding the worker’s status, a referee concluded that the claimant was entitled to receive total disability benefits, but only until July 1, 1989, the date upon which the referee determined that he had retired. The claimant’s compensation was suspended based on his own testimony that he was receiving Social Security retirement benefits and that he was applying for a pension from SEPTA on his 65th birthday, June 18, 1989, together with evidence that he began receiving pension benefits on July 1, 1989.

Where the employer challenges the entitlement to continuing compensation on grounds that the claimant has removed himself or herself from the general workforce by retiring, the employer has the burden of proving that the claimant has voluntarily left the workforce. There is no presumption of retirement arising from the fact that a claimant seeks or accepts a <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>pension, much less a disability pension; rather, the worker’s acceptance of a pension entitles the employer only to a permissive inference that the claimant has retired. Such an inference, if drawn, is not on its own sufficient evidence to establish that the worker has retired-the inference must be considered in the context of the totality of the circumstances. The factfinder must also evaluate all of the other relevant and credible evidence before concluding that the employer has carried its burden of proof.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[240,822,1151,418]]]'>If the employer produces sufficient evidence to support a finding that the claimant has voluntarily left the workforce, then the burden shifts to the claimant to show that there in fact has been a compensable loss of earning power. Conversely, if the employer fails to present sufficient evidence to show that the claimant has retired, then the employer must proceed as in any other case involving a proposed modification or suspension of benefits.</p>
    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[236,1276,1153,744]]]'>Our holding will not impose a prohibitive burden on employers, nor does it subject employers to the unreasonable task of proving the claimant’s state of mind. Nor are we convinced that the dire consequences predicted by Employer — that claimants will impermissibly benefit by supplementing their retirements with workers’ compensation benefits, and that the cost containment goal of the Act will be undermined-will result. If an employer is convinced that a claimant has retired, the employer may present evidence to establish that status. As the Commonwealth Court suggested, the employer may do so by objective facts, including the claimant’s receipt of a pension, the claimant’s own statements relating to voluntary withdrawal from the workforce, and the claimant’s efforts or non-efforts to seek employment.</p>

As we have explained above, receipt of a pension does not establish on its own the fact of a claimant’s retirement from the workforce. In this case, the disability pension only shows withdrawal from the Claimant’s time-of-injury job. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court plurality accepted the WCJ’s factual finding that Petitioner was seeking employment, and that she would have been working had the Employer not terminated her modified-duty job. Finally, the fact that claimant did not submit evidence showing that she was unable to work does not prove voluntary retirement, especially in light of the Employer’s own medical testimony regarding Claimant’s physical limitations, and the absence of evidence of available work within her restrictions or expert testimony regarding her earning power.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> We agree with the tribunals below that these circumstances do not prove that Claimant intended to withdraw from the entire workforce.
