Those reservations gave U.S. Steel the exclusive rights to mine and remove coal within a specific coal seam, while keeping with the property owners all oil and natural gas rights below the coal seam.

As far back as <em>Gibson, </em>minerals have been defined in the law for private deed reservation purposes as those substances which are metallic in nature.

Harkening back to <em>Gibson </em>and <em>Dunham, </em>Appellants argue that those courts were clear that the deed reservations are to be construed consistent with that which was understood by ordinary people at the time the deed was executed. Thus, before even considering any potential interpretation of the deed reservation, Appellants challenge the remand order by the Superior Court because scientific evidence as to what Marcellus shale is and is not considered presently would have no bearing on Appellees’ burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the common-persons who executed the deed in 1881 would have contemplated and understood Marcellus shale, and therefore the gas contained within it, to be a mineral.</p>

According to the United States Energy Information Administration, natural gas and all shale gas are one and the same substance; it is the manner of drilling and production that is different.

Accordingly, in summation Appellants assert that <em>Hoge II </em>cannot apply, as this case concerns exclusively natural gas and without (1) an express designation of natural gas within the deed reservation, or (2) clear and convincing evidence through parol evidence that the parties in 1881 intended to include natural gas within the reservation, the <em>Dunham </em>Rule controls and Appellees are not entitled to any natural gas rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

In general, shale gas is a term used to define natural gas that has become trapped within various shale formations throughout North America. Marcellus shale natural gas is that gas which is located in the Marcellus Shale Formation, which covers 104,067 square miles in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New York.

According to the latest projections by the USEIA, the Marcellus region contains approximately 140 billion cubic feet of "technically recoverable” natural gas. <em>Annual Energy Outlook 2012 </em>58 tbl. 15. To the extent we discuss the formation at large, we will refer to it in shorthand as “the Marcellus Shale.” To the extent we discuss the sedimentary rock and the gas therein, we will refer to it as "Marcellus shale” or "Marcellus shale natural gas.”</p>
