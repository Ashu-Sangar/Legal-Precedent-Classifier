The court also inferred from the evidence presented that any suggestion of “possible verbal agreements]” derived from defense attorneys’ and witnesses’ own hopeful predictions, rather than from actual incentives offered by the district attorney. <em>See Rega, </em>Nos.

In terms of the assertion of a suggestion of dangerousness, there is a well-developed line of judicial decisions reflecting trial courts’ discretionary authority to implement security measures, even where these carry some measure of potential prejudice, when required to further an essential state interest. <em>See, e.g., Helium v.

Although Appellant seems to imply that there was no specific risk relative to the courtroom setting, in the exercise of its discretion, the trial court was not obliged to believe that Appellant’s proclivity toward violence would be limited to the one specific avenue which had already been uncovered.
