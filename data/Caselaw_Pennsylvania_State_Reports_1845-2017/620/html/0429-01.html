For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>

Appellant entered his mother-in-law’s bedroom while she slept, struck her in the head with a hammer, and slit her throat with a knife, killing her. He then turned the hammer on her young <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>son, and his own son and daughter. When his wife returned approximately 11 hours later, she met the same fate.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[232,465,1154,1123]]]'>Appellant was initially unapologetic and offered no excuses for his actions. He wrote a letter to the police admitting guilt and refuting any suggestion of mental illness — he specifically asked the court to show no mercy and give him the maximum sentence. The chief public defender of York County was appointed to represent appellant. Appellant, after completing both oral and written colloquies, pled guilty to murder generally. During the oral colloquy, appellant repeatedly confirmed he understood and waived his right to a determination of guilt, as well as a jury determination of the degree of guilt and the appropriate sentence. Trial counsel filed a pre-trial motion to suppress appellant’s letter to the police, including his confession; the trial court granted the motion and commenced with the degree of guilt and penalty hearings. Prior to the degree of guilt hearing, the court again colloquied appellant regarding his rights, and he reaffirmed his desire to plead guilty to murder generally. Appellant also informed the court he personally canceled the appearance of a witness whom trial counsel had previously subpoenaed to testify on appellant’s behalf at the penalty phase. The trial court found appellant guilty of first degree murder on all five counts.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[229,1629,1153,745]],["BL_488.1",488,[273,333,1148,96]]]'>A penalty phase hearing immediately followed, and at appellant’s direction, counsel rested without presenting any witnesses or offering any mitigating evidence. On January 23, 1992, the trial court imposed the death penalty for four counts and a life sentence on the fifth count. Appellant informed the court, both directly and through counsel, he did not wish to file any post-trial motions. Trial counsel represented appellant on direct appeal, and this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence December 9, 1993. <em>Id. </em>Appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition, and new counsel was appointed to represent him. PCRA counsel filed an amended PCRA petition, which contained no reference to trial counsel’s prior representation of appellant’s father-in-law, Eric Barshinger, occurring between 1981 and 1988. Rather, the petition alleged trial coun<a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>sel should have disregarded appellant’s instructions and presented mitigating evidence at the penalty phase.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[269,469,1153,959]]]'>During the PCRA evidentiary hearing, appellant again acknowledged he had instructed trial counsel not to call witnesses or present evidence of impaired mental health because he wanted to admit guilt. Trial counsel testified he followed his client’s instructions because his observations of appellant gave him no reason to question his competence. Following the hearing, the PCRA court denied relief, finding appellant’s testimony was truthful, he had instructed witnesses not to appear, he had instructed counsel not to contest the Commonwealth’s evidence, and he was competent to make those decisions. We affirmed the PCRA court’s order, reasoning “counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to override [appellant’s] decision not to present such [mitigating] evidence.” <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/553/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="553 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="356228" data-case-paths="/pa/553/0144-01">553 Pa. 144</a>, <a href="/a2d/718/0743-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="718 A.2d 743" data-case-ids="11687370,356228" data-case-paths="/a2d/718/0743-01,/pa/553/0144-01">718 A.2d 743</a>, 745 (1998). Following our decision, appellant, through PCRA counsel, filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.</p>

Again, the petition contained no reference to trial counsel’s prior representation of Barshinger. Due to the filing of the PCRA petition, the federal district court dismissed the habeas corpus petition, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit overturned the order and stayed the habeas proceedings pending the disposition of the state court proceedings. The PCRA court subsequently dismissed appellant’s second petition as untimely, and we affirmed. <em>See Commonwealth v. Gamboa-Taylor, </em><a href="/pa/562/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="562 Pa. 70" data-case-ids="225976" data-case-paths="/pa/562/0070-01">562 Pa. 70</a>, <a href="/a2d/753/0780-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="753 A.2d 780" data-case-ids="11212841,225976" data-case-paths="/a2d/753/0780-01,/pa/562/0070-01">753 A.2d 780</a> (2000). On March 15, 2004, the federal district court issued an opinion finding all of appellant’s habeas corpus claims procedurally defective and dismissed the petition. Thereafter, the district court vacated the order and considered appellant’s claims on the merits. On July 22, 2004, the district court determined appellant was not entitled to relief and <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>dismissed the petition. The Third Circuit unanimously affirmed. <em>See Taylor v.

    <p id="b489-5" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[232,453,1156,1281]]]'>Appellant, through PCRA counsel, filed a third PCRA petition, January 28, 2008, alleging, for the first time, at the time he entered his guilty pleas, trial counsel had a conflict of interest which adversely affected his representation of appellant. Appellant contended trial counsel’s representation of Barshinger beginning in 1981 and continuing sporadically through 1988, Barshinger’s familial relation to the victims, and trial counsel’s appointment as stand-by counsel for Barshinger in 1988 on appeal, created an actual conflict of interest because Barshinger’s case “had yet to be finally adjudicated at the time [trial counsel] assumed representation of [a]ppellant” in 1991. Appellant’s Brief, at 6. Specifically, appellant contended this conflict of interest caused trial counsel to abandon appellant’s interests and begin working against him. The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss the third PCRA petition as untimely. The PCRA court made a “preliminary finding” the petition was timely and held three days of evidentiary hearings. The PCRA court subsequently determined trial counsel did not have an actual conflict of interest during his representation of appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Based on this determination, the PCRA court concluded there was no newly-discovered evidence of a conflict of interest that would bring appellant’s petition within one of the PCRA’s timeliness exceptions. Accordingly, it found the petition untimely and denied it.</p>
