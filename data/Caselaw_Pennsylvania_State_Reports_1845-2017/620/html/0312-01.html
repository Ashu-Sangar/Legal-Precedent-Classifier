On December 6, 1996, appellant condemned the property in order to build a public golf course. Appellees filed preliminary objections challenging the validity of using eminent domain for such a purpose. That issue was eventually appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which found the taking was for a legitimate public use. A Board of View determined the value of the property was $3,990,000. As the parties were unable to agree on damages, the matter proceeded to a jury trial for a calculation of the property’s value.</p>
    <p id="b370-9" data-blocks='[["BL_370.9",370,[267,1665,1151,528]]]'>The trial lasted six days. A total of 11 witnesses were called, one of whom was appellee Chester Dalgewicz. Mr. Dalgewicz testified regarding the farm’s history ánd the interest shown by several developers in purchasing the property due to its size and proximity to Interstate 95. He described some of the offers received both before and after the property was condemned, including a 1995 agreement of sale with Ryland Homes for $5.1 million, and a 1998 sales agreement with Toll Brothers for $7 million, contingent upon the condemnation being overturned.</p>

Appellant objected, reiterating objections made in its motion <em>in limine, </em>arguing the offer was inadmissible as it did not result in a sales agreement and any testimony concerning the offer price would be irrelevant and prejudicial. The trial court overruled the objection, relying on its decision denying the motion <em>in limine, </em>and further explained it would be appropriate to “let in what was going on with this piece of land in terms of developers from a reasonable time before to a reasonable time after the taking.” N.T. Trial, 11/18/08, at 31. The court observed the Township could cross-examine Mr. Dalgewicz on the nature of the offer, and that its evidentiary value was “something that should be argued to the jury[.]” <em>Id., </em>at 31-32. The jury determined the fair market value of the property was $5,850,00o.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Appellant filed post-trial motions, alleging the trial court erred in admitting the Pulte offer; the trial court denied the motions.

The court held that while case law suggests mere offers generally should not be admitted into evidence, the underlying rationale for such a prohibition was not present here. The court noted both parties stipulated to the authenticity of the Pulte offer, and the offer was introduced merely to show the reasonableness of the Toll Brothers agreement; thus, there were no hearsay concerns. While reiterating the general rule, the court crafted a narrow exception where “a sufficient foundation was laid to establish that the offer was made in <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>good faith, by a party acquainted with the value of the [property, and of sufficient intention and ability to pay” so as to make it a <em>bona fide </em>offer and, therefore, admissible. <em>Lower Makefield Twp. v.

Like Toll Brothers, Pulte Homes is a large, sophisticated developer and home builder with a nationwide presence; there is no evidence to suggest its offer was not genuine, issued in bad faith, or an attempt to inflate the value of the property. Testimony, including from appellant’s own expert, established the process which a large developer, such as Pulte Homes or Toll Brothers, undertakes before submitting an offer. This was not some “fly by night” contractor rushing to make a bid and betting the farm on the success of a development it might not <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>have the resources to complete.

Despite the Code’s liberalization of the receipt of expert evidence concerning property value, the 1964 legislation did not purport to override all evidentiary restrictions on expert testimony.

Under Rule 703, for example, the underlying facts or data relied on by the expert "need not be admissible in evidence.” Pa.R.E. 703.
