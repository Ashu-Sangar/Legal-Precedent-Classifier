The loan agreement entitled Izett Manufacturing to borrow up to $50,000 and was secured by a promissory note.

The guaranty included a confession of judgment clause and stated that it was “executed under seal,” with the designation “(SEAL)” as part of the signature line. By 2001, the company had borrowed $50,000 under the agreement. At that time, Appellee Osprey Portfolio, LLC (“Osprey”) purchased the loan and was assigned the note and guaranty.

      <em>Id. </em>§ 5529(b). Appellant conceded that the guaranty was a writing under seal but maintained that it did not qualify as an instrument for purposes of Section 5529(b)(1). He asserted that the court should apply the definition of instrument found in Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”), which defines an instrument as “a negotiable instrument,” <em>i.e., </em>“an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money.” 13 Pa.C.S. § 3104(a), (b). The guaranty does not fall within this definition, Appellant contended, because the company’s default is a precondition of Appellant’s obligation, and the amount of money involved is not “fixed,” as the note authorizes a loan of up to $50,000.

Instead, the <em>Cadle </em>court applied the four-year period of Section 5525(a)(8), holding that the agreement was “a contract, obligation, or liability founded upon a written document.” <em>Cadle, </em>No.2006-2023, <em>slip op. </em>at 5 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 5525(a)(8)).</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[252,869,1155,1060]]]'>The common pleas court denied Appellant’s petition, explaining that, “[r]ead together, § 5525(a)(7), (8) and § 5529(b)(1) of the Judicial Code provide that certain instruments in writing which might otherwise be subject to a four-year statute of limitations are subject to a twenty-year statute of limitations if signed under seal.” <em>Osprey Portfolio, LLC v. Izett, </em>No. 2010-07295, <em>slip op. </em>at 3 (C.P. Chester Mar. 1, 2011). Centrally, the court rejected Appellant’s position predicated upon the UCC, observing that UCC Article 3 is specifically addressed to negotiable instruments, <em>see </em>13 Pa.C.S. §§ 3101-3805; <em>see also <a href="/citations/?q=959%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="959 A.2d 455">id.</a> </em>§ 3102(a) (“This division applies to negotiable instruments.”), and, further, that the Article 3 definition of instrument is limited to that division only, <em>see <a href="/citations/?q=959%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="959 A.2d 455">id.</a> </em>§ 3103(b) (including “instrument” in a list of “definitions applying to this division and the sections in which they appear”). The court distinguished <em>Cadle, </em>moreover, reasoning that that case involved a line of credit rather than a guaranty, and additionally noted that the intermediate court’s decision in <em>Cadle </em>was nonbinding because it was unpublished. <em>See Osprey, </em>No.2010-07295, <em>slip op. </em>at 3-4.</p>

Recognizing <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>that the dictionary identifies a “negotiable instrument” as a type of instrument, the court developed that the ordinary meaning of “instrument” is broader than “negotiable instrument,” and hence, even assuming the guaranty is not a negotiable instrument, this does not mean it is not an instrument. Additionally, the court observed that numerous reported Pennsylvania appellate decisions refer to a guaranty as an instrument, see id. at 4 (collecting cases), and that at least one federal court has found expressly that an action on a guaranty executed under seal is subjéct to the limitation period of Section 5529(b). <em>See id. </em>at 5 (citing <em>Marcucci v. H &amp; L Developers, Inc., </em>No. 08-5560, <a href="/citations/?q=2009%20WL%205177767" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2009 WL 5177767">2009 WL 5177767</a>, at *6 (E.D.Pa.

Pursuant to the UCC definition, Appellant maintains, the guaranty is not an instrument because the loan was not for a fixed amount of money, but was more akin to a line of credit. Additionally, Appellant contends that giving “instrument” its ordinary meaning for Section 5529(b)(1) purposes would make that provision so broadly applicable as to render part of Section 5525(a)(8) inoperable. Specifically, he asserts that a definition such as that espoused by the common pleas and intermediate courts, encompassing <em>“any </em>written contract^]” would negate the applicability of Section 5525(a)(8) vis-a-vis sealed documents, with the result that that subsection’s exception for “action[s] subject to another limitation specified in this subchapter” would “swallow the rule,” at least insofar as documents executed under seal are concerned.

In advocating for use of the UCC definition of instrument, Appellant relies heavily on Section 5501(b) of the Judicial Code.

As observed by the Superior Court, however, the Judicial Code does not define the term instrument, and hence, the two statutes do not manifest a direct inconsistency. More fundamentally, Article 3 is exclusively committed to negotiable instruments. <em>See, e.g., </em>13 Pa.C.S. § 3104, UCC Comment— 1990, No. 1 (“The definition of ‘negotiable instrument’ defines the scope of Article 3 since Section 3-102 states: ‘This Article applies to negotiable instruments.’ ”). It defines the term instrument for purposes of that division only, effectively utilizing the term as a shorthand for negotiable instrument. <em>See </em>13 Pa.C.S. § 3104(b) (“‘Instrument’ means a negotiable instrument.”). There is nothing to suggest that Section 5501 was intended to import such construct into Chapter 55 of the Judicial Code, particularly as the latter expressly refers to negotiable and nonnegotiable bonds, notes and “other similar instrument[s].” 42 Pa.C.S. § 5525(a)(7); <em>see supra </em>note 2. Moreover, Article 3 of the UCC has no application to this case, as the parties agree that the guaranty at the center of this controversy is not a negotiable instrument. Accordingly, Appellant cannot prevail on his assertion that the guaranty is not an instrument on the grounds that the UCC limits the term to negotiable instruments.</p>
