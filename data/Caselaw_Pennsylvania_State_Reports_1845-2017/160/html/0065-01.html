Caleb were the survivors; also, deed of February 5,1867, from Job G. Darlington and wife to his brother Caleb, for his undivided interest in same; also, will of Caleb Darlington, probated December 11, 1890, by the residuary clause of which he devised same land as follows: “ All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed, I give, devise and bequeath to my brother Job G.

Darling-ton, dated December 13,1890, and probated February 13,1891, wherein he directed, 1st, that all his just debts and funeral expenses should be paid by his executors; and, 2d, “ in order to enable them to pay the same, I do authorize and empower them to sell all my real and personal estate,” etc. He then gave four small legacies, aggregating $360, and disposed of the residue of his estate ás follows: “Then all the residue and remainder of my estate I do give and bequeath to my wife Lydia Ann Darlington, to her, her heirs and assigns.”</p>

Darlington, his residuary legatee. The land in dispute was not sold by the executor; and, so far as appeared at the trial in November, 1892, there were no debts or funeral expenses unpaid, or anything else, requiring the exercise of the power of sale contained in the will.</p>

The evidence showed that her husband, seized of the land in controversy, devised the same to her in fee. There was no conversion of the land into personalty by anything contained in his will. It contains no direction to his executors to sell the land in question. It gives them merely power to sell, “ in order to enable them to pay ” his debts and funeral expenses. To work a conversion of real estate into personalty, there must be either <em>(a) </em>a positive direction to sell; or (5) an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will; or <em>(o') </em>such a blending of realty and personalty, by the testator, in his will, as to clearly show that he intended to create a fund out of both real and personal <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>estate, and to bequeath the same as money. In the first,, the intention to convert is expressed. In the latter two it is implied.

    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[231,1250,1168,708]]]'>Defendants points for charge recited in the third and fourth specifications were rightly refused. In the former, binding instruction to find for defendant is requested; in the latter, the court is asked to say that the verdict must be for defendant, because there is no evidence of plaintiff’s acceptance of the real estate, or of her election to take the same. For obvious reasons, neither of these points could have been affirmed. We have already seen that plaintiff’s claim of title, etc., was sustained by the evidence; and, as devisee under her husband’s will, her title was complete without proof of either acceptance or election to take. The presumption is that every devisee has accepted the bounty of his or her devisor; but, if evidence of acceptance were necessary, plaintiff’s assertion of title by bringing this suit is sufficient.</p>

The obvious answer to each of these offers is that the statute of frauds is a bar to the admission of such evidence for the purpose of showing title out of the plaintiff. The written agreement of the executor recited in the tenth specification could not affect her right, and was therefore not admissible against her in this action. Nor is there anything in the case on which estoppel can be grounded. Plaintiff acquired nothing <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>under the agreement referred to, nor did defendant lose anything thereby to which he was entitled.
