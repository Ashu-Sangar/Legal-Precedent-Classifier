R. Brown intended to make the payment of his debts a condition precedent to the delivery of -this deed. It is true that the recording of the deed by the grantee is evidence from which delivery may be presumed, but if the will of the grantor and the evidence of George Brown are to be considered, this presumption is rebutted and destroyed. If it were the case of bona fide purchasers, stronger evidence might be required to rebut the presumption of delivery, but there is nothing of the kind in this case, and it is not even claimed by the creditors of George Brown that they advanced money to him on the faith of his title to the Jones and Orshalt farms. This deed then as <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>deposited with Mrs. Mary Brown was an escrow, to be delivered upon the performance of the condition set forth in the will of the grantor, and the performance of this condition was necessary to make the instrument operative and vest a complete title in George Brown. In Blight v. Schenck, <a href="/pa/10/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="962705" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0285-01">10 Pa. 285</a>, it was held: ‘A delivery to an agent as an escrow and by him delivered to the grantee contrary to the condition, passes a title voidable only.’ It seems therefore that by the delivery or obtaining possession of the deed to the Jones and Orshalt farms by George Brown without performing the condition, he acquired, at the most, but a voidable title to the lands described therein.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[312,953,1166,852]]]'>“ It is contended, moreover, that the title George Brown acquired in these farms became vested in him at the time of the original delivery, that is, that the deed took effect by relation back to the time of depositing it as an escrow. Generally an escrow takes effect from the second delivery, and is to be considered as the deed of the party at that time, but this rule does not apply when justice requires a resort to fiction. The relation back to the first delivery so as to give the deed effect from that time is allowed in cases of necessity, to avoid injury to the operation of the deed from events happening between the first and second delivery: Kent’s Com. 454. Thus it was held in Levengood v. Bailey, 1 Woodward, 275 : ‘ In general when an instrument is delivered as an escrow to a third person to be delivered to the grantee on a future event, it is not the deed of the grantor until the second delivery; but this rule is subject to exception “ founded,” it is said, “ on necessity, ut res valeat.” ’</p>
