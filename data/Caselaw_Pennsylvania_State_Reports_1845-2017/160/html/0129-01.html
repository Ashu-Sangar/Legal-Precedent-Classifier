Gilmore and in favor of Ransom Rogers for $5,381.21 on a judgment note. In 1888 a rule to open the judgment was made absolute, and on a trial of the issue in C. P. No. 2, a judgment was entered in favor of defendant, Gilmore. Gilmore there testified that the judgment was given merely to secure to Rogers some property that was in Gilmore’s name; that Gilmore subsequently returned the property but that the judgment was never satisfied. On Oct. 10, 1882, plaintiff, Sommer, to use, issued this attachment execution against Gilmore, and, at the trial, in 1891, claimed that the verdict obtained in 1888 was secured by collusion between Rogers and Gilmore to defeat the attachment of the debt.</p>

I think, however, to give one half would be too liberal a fee in a case like this. There are no expenses to be incurred ; the judgment is obtained all ready, and, if I remember correctly, on a judgment note with a waiver, all there is to be done is to find property in his possession, belonging to, or money coming to him, then issue an execution and attach it, and, the three hundred dollar law exemption being waived, can always make the expenses of the proceedings out of the defendant, if no more. It may be that I know your friend Mr. Thackara; but I can’t call him to mind at this time. Will you be good enough, therefore, to inform me, is he a lawyer, or what is his business? Would you also be good enough to inform me of the nature and character of his claim against Gilmore, whether upon open account or what is his condition ?

Gilmore says that he gave that judgment note as security to Rogers, for certain property put in Gilmore’s name for Rogers’s. account, on a theater at Tenth and Callowhill streets, fifteen or twenty years ago. Rogers, it is said, was a Quaker and did not want to put it in his own name. That judgment note was put on record, so that in case Gilmore got into trouble with other creditors Rogers could come in first and secure his own by execution on the judgment. Having had the benefit of that security, having accomplished its purpose, the case went to the jury and there was a verdict for the defendant.] [8]</p>

If you believe the trial in Court of Common Pleas No. 2 was a fair trial — both sides being represented by lawyers, as the record shows, and witnesses heard, and a judge charging the jury —if you believe that was a bona fide trial of the case, that ends this case. If you believe it was a sham — [if you believe the ■case tried before twelve jurymen, two lawyers and a judge was a sham, a bugaboo to frighten people, and if you believe also that Mr. Gilmore does owe that money, then you can find a verdict against him in this case.] [5] If you do find that, you will find how much he owes. Their original judgment was about $5,300; he has paid out some money for Rogers, $1,300, I believe, which is to be deducted. He is liable, if at all, for the difference, $4,000 and interest for fifteen years, notwithstanding he has a judgment in his favor in another court. If you find that Gilmore owes Rogers, notwithstanding that verdict and judgment that he does not, then you may say how much you find Gilmore owes Rogers, and I will put it on the record, and out of that Sommer will get payment of his judgment.”</p>
