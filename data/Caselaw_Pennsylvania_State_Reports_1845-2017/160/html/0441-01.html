That no application was ever made to the orphans’ court by the trustee for leave to pay to the executors or the widow the amount due upon this bond. That the said Eliza F.

It will be seen that under the wording of the <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>will the testator only intended a sale should be made of the real estate in the event of his wife deeming it to be to her advantage that the same or any part thereof shall be sold, and that then the sale is to be made by a trustee to be appointed by the orphans’ court upon her petition. Thus it will be seen that there was not an absolute direction to sell, and that the sale could only take place in the event of the wife consenting to it and presenting a petition to the court for the'appointment of a trustee. In the opinion of the auditor there was therefore no conversion of the land into money by the will, even in equity, and no such conversion could be considered as having taken place until such consent on the part of the wife had been given, by her petition to the orphans’ court for the appointment of a trustee to make sale, and the sale made under the order of the orphans’ court really worked the conversion. In Henry v. McCloskey, 9 Watts, page 145, it is decided that if the direction by the testator in his will to sell his real estate be not absolute but qualified, such as where there is a direction in the will to sell the real estate upon the widow agreeing to it in her lifetime, and if it shall appear from the words of the will that the testator only intended that the sale should be made in event of his wife consenting to it and not otherwise, a conversion of it into money would not even in equity be considered as having taken placesuntil such consent on her .part had been given.</p>
