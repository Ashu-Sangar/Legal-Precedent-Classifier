Anson. True the “ principal ” of the estate was directed to be “ divided ” “ from and after ” her death;' but by the express terms of the will it was to be “divided” among “ such ” of her children “ as should be living at a period not exceeding nine months after” testator’s — not her — death. The gift over to testator’s “ heirs ” obviously had reference to the last antecedent, and could only become operative upon default of “ such children ” as should be “ living ” at the “ period ” fixed by the testator. The death of Mrs. Anson simply marked the limit of her interest and the beginning, in possession, of those entitled in remainder. The rule is conceded that where there is bequest in the form of a direction to pay, or pay and divide ’“from and after” the happening of any event, “then the gift being to persons answering a particular description, if a party cannot bring himself within it he is not entitled to take the benefit of the gift.

The interest is vested notwithstanding, although the enjoyment is postponed: ” Packham v. Gregory, 4 Hare, 898. Upon the whole.of this will, it is apparent that the interest of the children was simply postponed to let in their mother’s. Even without the nine months’ clause, such of her children as survived testator would have thereupon taken vested interests in remainder. That clause, which was evidently intended to embrace- any posthumous child who might be born, extended the time for ascertainment of the class ; and, as Walter Man survived the time so fixed, he took a vested interest which, upon his subsequent death, passed by operation of law to his personal representative.</p>

Anson as should be “ living at a period not exceeding-nine months after” testator’s death, and Waltpr Man, who was one of these children, having survived the testator, necessarily thereupon took a vested interest. «</p>
