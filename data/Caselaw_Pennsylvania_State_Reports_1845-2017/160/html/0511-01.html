L. 90. It is grounded mainly on allegations which, in substance, are (1) that said act is unconstitutional, and (2) that the debt, which would necessarily be incurred by the borough in carrying into effect its proposed undertaking, will increase its indebtedness to an amount in excess of the constitutional limit of seven per centum of the assessed valuation of taxable property within the corporate limits. As to both of these allegations, the learned master’s findings of fact and legal conclusions are in defendant’s favor. The first five specifications charge error in overruling the several exceptions to the master’s conclusions of law recited therein respectively. For reasons sufficiently stated in the report and in the opinion of the learned president of the common pleas, approving the same, we think there was no error in refusing to sustain either of said exceptions.</p>

The power of the legislature to authorize municipal corporations to supply gas and water for municipal purposes, and for the use and benefit of such of their inhabitants as wish to use and are willing to pay therefor at reasonable rates, has never been seriously questioned. In view of the fact that electricity is so rapidly coming into general use for illuminating streets, public and private buildings, dwellings, etc., why should there be any doubt as to the power to authorize such corporations to manufacture and supply it in like manner as artificial gas has been manufactured and supplied ? It is a mistake to assume that municipal corporations should not keep abreast with the progress and improvements of the age.</p>
