After this, bill-heads, brands, factory labels, etc., of Heere, Koch &amp; Co. were used.

Heere, Aaron M. Koch and J. C. Becker were engaged in the manufacture of cigars in this city under the firm name of Heere, Koch &amp; Co. Several of the banks of this city, defendants here, obtained judgments against Heere, Koch &amp; Co. for moneys owing by that firm, and, having so obtained judgment, issued <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>execution. When the sheriff came to the Eighth and Oley factory of Heere, Koch &amp; Co., he levied upon everything in the factory building, whereupon a claim was made that certain tobacco and fixtures there found belonged, not to Heere, Koch &amp; Co., but to Heere &amp; Co., a firm which it is said is composed of Julia Heere and Thomas F.

The case turns upon the fact whether or not, when Heere &amp; Co. moved their goods from the factory at Tenth and Penn to the factory at Eighth and Oley, they did so in pursuance of articles of copartnership carried out, and whether the goods were placed in the care of Heere, Koch &amp; Co. in pursuance of that partnership. If they were not so placed, if the articles of copartnership were not carried out, if these goods were not delivered into the care of Heere, Koch &amp; Co., but on the other hand were kept separate from their goods, were not mingled with their goods and were kept in that factory as the property of Heere &amp; Co., then your verdict will be for the plaintiffs. If they were not so kept, but were mingled with the goods so as to make them a contribution of one firm to the other, then your verdict will be for the defendants. That is the whole case.”</p>

The right of the plaintiffs to recover depended on questions of fact which were for the exclusive consideration of the jury. Those questions were fairly and impartially submitted to them with instructions that appear to be free from error. As already observed, the only complaint here is that the learned judge did not withdraw the case from the jury by giving them binding instructions to find for tbe defendants. If he had done that, the plaintiffs would have had just reason to complain. The assignment of error is not sustained.</p>
