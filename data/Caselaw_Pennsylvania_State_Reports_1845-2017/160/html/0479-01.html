      <em>A </em>preliminary injunction to restrain the erection of a stone storage-house for blasting powder, in the outskirts of a borough, is properly refused on the application of the borough, where the affidavits for defendant tend to show that such powder is not highly explosive, and that another building for storing the same kind of powder is maintained in the built-up portion of the borough by other parties without objection.</p>

It appears from the affidavits of E. P. Kingsbury, F. H. Johnson and Wm. H. Taylor, that no dynamite, nitro-glycerine or other explosive, except blasting powder, is intended to be stored in the building, and that it is to be used only and solely for storing blasting powder; that blasting powder is not a high explosive; that the building is built of stone and iron, and to all intents and purposes fire proof; that the blasting powder to be stored therein is to, be packed in cartridges, which in turn are to be packed in iron cases that are fire proof, and which will not be opened while stored in the building; that the powder is made of nitrate of soda, charcoal and brimstone, and that it cannot be exploded by concussion. Mr. Taylor is the president of the cofnpany and Mr. Kingsbury is the secretary thereof. Mr. Johnson .testifies that he has been engaged in the powder business for up<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>wards of seventeen years, and that he has never known of an explosion of a magazine for the storage of blasting powder anywhere in the Lackawanna or Wyoming regions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b505-3" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[211,529,1170,1270]]]'>“As was said in Weir’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/74/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="74 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1034744" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0230-01">74 Pa. 230</a>, and repeated in Dilworth’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/91/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="91 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="487685" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0247-01">91 Pa. 247</a>, the great difficulty in all cases of this character is not in the ascertainment of the true rule of equity, but in the application of that rule to the facts. While it may be easy to draw the.line between what is and what is not a nuisance, which equity ought to enjoin, it is by no means so easy to determine whether the circumstances of any particular case ought to place it on one side or the other of that line. It is rare that any number of men will be found to agree upon such a question. This, however, is only a rule to continue a preliminary injunction., The affidavits filed by way of answer are clear, positive and unequivocal denials of the material allegations of plaintiffs’ bill. The officers of the compan)*- know best to what uses it is intended to put the structure complained of, and if their testimony be true, as I must accept it to be in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the uses to which they will put the building will be harmless and legitimate. If, on final hearing, the contrary be shown, or if at any time the building be put to such a use as will constitute a nuisance, they can still be enjoined. At this stage of the case, in the light of the testimony before me, I see no reason why the defendants should be restrained from completing the building, which is already nearly finished, or from storing blasting powder, of the character, and packed in the manner described in defendant’s affidavits therein.</p>
