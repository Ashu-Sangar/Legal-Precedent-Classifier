Now, that would appear, upon its face, to be such an adjudication of her guilt as would prevent her having a right of action, because it was the solemn judgment of the tribunal before which she was charged, that a breach of the peace had been committed, and that she should be put under bonds. But it is singular, still it is so, that, as a matter of fact, she was discharged. While the record shows that she was held to keep the peace, she was, nevertheless, allowed to go. Whether that was because of kindly feeling and sympathy may not appear; or whether it was done by the magistrate who had adjudged her guilty, is not clear; but it appears that the sergeant and some others had said some kind and complimentary things about her, and she was permitted to go, if somebody would agree for her that she would behave herself. Your first inquiry would, therefore, be to inquire whether it was the act of the magistrate which discharged her, or whether it was his judgment that she should be held to keep the peace. If it was an escape merely, that is to say, if those who had charge of her discharged her erroneously, that would not be a legal discharge. You must judge as to whether it was the act of the magistrate. If it was, that would relieve her from the charge, and entitle her to recover if she showed that the prosecutor acted without probable cause, and through malice. Hence, <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>nevertheless, if you find that she was held in |500 bail, and that the magistrate did discharge her, then the next inquiry is as to whether the defendant had probable cause, and was he actuated by malice. That is entirely for you, and is entirely a question of fact.] ” [1]</p>

After the hearing was thus ended and defendant had gone away, the plaintiff was discharged without the entry of the required bail. Whether this was done by the magistrate or by the police officers appears to have been left in doubt by the evidence, and the learned judge charged the jury that if it <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>was an escape, by the compassion of the police, it was not a legal discharge, but that if it was the act of the magistrate, then it was an end of the prosecution and plaintiff could recover. This view however entirely overlooked the facts, apparently undisputed, that the hearing had terminated in a holding to bail, and that the magistrate had no right without notice to the prosecutor to open the case and render a different judgment. No such illegal action on his part could make the defendant liable for malicious prosecution. On such a state of facts the view taken by the learned court below at the first trial, which resulted in a nonsuit, was correct.</p>
