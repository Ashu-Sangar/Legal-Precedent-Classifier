The writ was served as directed, and deputy Silkman wrote a return to that effect on the back of the writ. Counsel for plaintiff saw the return of the writ either in the office of the sheriff or the prothonotary. He then entered a rule of reference under which arbitrators were chosen who made an award in favor of plaintiff. The sheriff, under advice of counsel and before the return day, made a new return of nihil habet as to the defendant, and this return was pasted over the return first written. Subsequently a rule was entered by defendants to strike off the award, and a rule was also obtained to reinstate the return first made by the sheriff, and to restore the entry on the continuance docket to correspond thereto. The court refused to reinstate the return and struck off the award.</p>

This seems to have been occasioned by some misunderstanding. The deputy sheriff who was first charged with serving the writ testifies that he signed the return claimed by counsel for plaintiff, but that he did not make the return to the prothonotary’s office. The chief deputy sheriff testifies that’ the only return ever made to the prothonotary’s office is the one which is there now; and the chief deputy prothonotary testifies that this is the only one ever received from the sheriff. It may well be, and we do not doubt that counsel for plaintiff were informed of and saw what had been signed by Mr. Silkman, but under the evidence we cannot say that it was the return made by the sheriff. Until the sheriff has actually made his return it is in his control. Of course he was not bound to serve the writ as requested by plaintiff’s attorney, and even though his deputy may have served a copy on the person as requested by them, the sheriff still had it in his power to say whether he would take the responsibility of returning such person as the agent of one of the defendants.</p>
