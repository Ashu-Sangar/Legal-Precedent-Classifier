The certificate shows joint ownership in the stock, and it was assigned as such. Plaintiff, when he accepted the assignment, had a right to assume that the certificate spoke truly as to the ownership. Had he been informed otherwise, he <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>might not have been satisfied with the collateral. There being, then, joint ownership in the stock, the defendants cannot claim the benefits of the exemption law. In fact, it is not capable of division within the meaning of the exemption law. The appraisement gives each a one half interest in the stock, which makes them again owners in common. It is not setting apart any specific property to either defendant. We are of opinion that the cases of Bonsall v. Comly, <a href="/pa/44/0442-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="44 Pa. 442" data-case-ids="484335" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0442-01">44 Pa. 442</a>, and Spade v.

    <p class="summary" id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[275,902,1162,854]]]'>“We think the second exception must'also be sustained. This was not ‘ property owned by or in possession of. the debtor,’ for they had assigned their interest therein for the payment of the debt. The plaintiff had such property in the stock as that no other creditor of defendant could levy upon or sell it free from plaintiff’s lien. Until his debt was paid, he had the right to dispose of the stock and appropriate the proceeds towards the payment of the debt for which it was security. The defendants could waive the benefits of the exemption law, and this they.in effect did by their assignment. The act contemplates a case where a creditor attempts to deprive the debtor of his property against his will; but when the debtor voluntarily passes it over for the very purpose of paying or securing his debt, he has no standing to reclaim it. Otherwise, to secure a debt of fifty dollars a debtor would have to assign at least $350 worth of property. The hardship to the debtor of such a rule shows its unreasonableness.</p>
