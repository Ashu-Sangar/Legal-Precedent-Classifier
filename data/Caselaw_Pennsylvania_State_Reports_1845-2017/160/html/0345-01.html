Plaintiff believed that he still represented the company, and the agent did not notify her husband to the contrary when the latter called April 6th, but agreed to give the necessary notice, and obtain the consent desired. Accordingly, on the following day, he called on an insurance agent who had business relations with the state agent of the company, who lived at Philadelphia, and requested him to notify the company. The insurance agent wrote to Ih’e agent at Philadelphia on the 8th, and his Tetter was received on the 9th. The agent at Philadelphia at once replied, refusing a permit.

We cannot so instruct you. . . . We cannot say to you, under the circumstances in this case, that a notice given to the company’s agent on the 6th of April was not in time. ... It is true that in this case the fire happened the day before the company notified Mr. Bell of its refusal to grant a permit for vacancy, yet that did not terminate the policy in this ease.

The giving of the notice was the duty of the insured; the giving of the consent and the indorsing of it on the policy was optional with the company. Therefore the pivotal question in this case is,.with whom was the riskduring the period of time which elapsed between the giving of the notice of vacancy and the act of the company in refusing its consent to a vacancy? That is,between the 6th and 9th of April. Was it with the plaintiff? We hold not. She could not know in what way the company would exercise its option, and until she was informed of that fact, we hold that her policy was in full force and effect. The company did not exercise its option until the 9th of April — one day after the destruction of ■ the building. To hold otherwise would introduce a dangerous rule in the law of insurance. A great deal of property insured is in the occupancy of tenants; they often abandon the insured premises without notice, and ofttimes .it is difficult to get one tenant in at the same time another goes out, and the courts have adopted very wise rules governing such changes.] ” [6]</p>

    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.12",372,[275,1297,1172,1064]]]'>The policy of insurance issued by the defendant contained a provision relieving it from liability for loss “ if the premises hereby insured become vacated bj^ the removal of the owner or occupant without immediate notice to the company and consent indorsed thereon.” The house insured was occupied by a tenant, who moved out on the 4th of April. On the same day the plaintiff requested her husband to go to Stroudsburg, thirteen miles distant, and give notice of the vacation of the house to R. M. Jacoby, whom she supposed to be the agent of the company, and ask him to obtain the consent of the company. Her husband complied with her request on the 6th. Mr. Jacoby had until a month previous been the agent of the company, and had placed the insurance. He did not notify the plaintiff’s husband that he no longer represented the company, but agreed to give the necessary notice and obtain the consent desired. On the 7th he called on Mr. Bell, an insurance agent, who had business relations with the state agents of the company who lived at Philadelphia, and requested him to notify them. Mr. Bell on the 8th wrote as desired, and his letter was received on the 9th. The agent at Philadelphia at once replied, refusing a permit. On the 8th the house was destroyed by fire.</p>
    <p id="b372-7" data-blocks='[["BL_372.13",372,[324,2370,1123,46]],["BL_373.1",373,[202,379,1169,401]]]'>The sixth assignment of error raises the question of the right <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>of recovery under the terms of the policy after the house became vacant, and the disposition of it is conclusive of the case. The learned judge in the course of his charge said: “Vacancy did not ipso facto avoid the policy by its terms; vacancy without immediate notice to the company and consent indorsed thereon did. The giving of notice was the duty of the .insured ; the giving of consent and the indorsing of it on the policy were optional with the company.”</p>
    <p id="b373-3" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[204,788,1164,198]]]'>The jury was instructed that immediate notice in the policy meant notice within a reasonable time, and that after vacancy followed by notice in a reasonable time the policy remained in force until consent was refused by the insurer.</p>
    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[204,994,1172,1115]]]'>We see no error in this instruction. Conditions involving forfeiture and exemption from liability should be strictly construed against the insurer, but the most liberal construction would not relieve the defendant in this case. The evident and only reasonable construction of the clause in question is that given by the learned trial judge. In case the premises became vacant, immediate notice was to be given, and it was then optional with the insurance company to continue or cancel the policy. The fact of vacancy did not work a forfeiture of the policy, but it imposed upon the insured the duty of notice'and gave to the insurer the right of cancellation. There would be no reason for notice and consent if the policy wer'e already void. Immediate notice must be construed to mean notice within a reasonable time, in view of the circumstances and positions of the parties. What would be reasonable time when the parties live in the same city or town, or have means of ready communication, would be very unreasonable if applied to the parties to this suit, one of whom lived on a farm six miles from a post office, twelve miles from a railroad and thirteen miles from the town in which the agent of the company, who had placed the insurance and to whom she would naturally look for information, resided.</p>

The thirteenth assignment is to the same effect. This was not an accurate statement of the law, and if it were appar<a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>ent that it might have led the jury to a wrong conclusion we should feel obliged to send the case back for retrial. This error, however, does not seem to be fatal. Jacoby was not, on April 6th, the agent of the company, and the plaintiff in her dealings with him took all risks upon that point; but he became her representative for the purpose of transmitting notice, and acting for her he set in motion the agencies which resulted in notice to the insurer on the 9th. What he did was properly in evidence as showing how notice was sent, and also as showing good faith and diligent effort on the part of the plaintiff.</p>
