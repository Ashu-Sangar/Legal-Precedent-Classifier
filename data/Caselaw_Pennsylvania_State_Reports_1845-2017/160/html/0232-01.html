In the meanwhile, the failure to justify by theoretical and conjectural testimony the anticipations of wrong and disaster on which this litigation was originally grounded has given room to a practical demonstration of their baselessness. The experience gathered in the course of these years has disposed of every substantial difficulty in the case. All that remains is a question of abstract technical ñght and of costs. The master, in his report, recommends the dismissal of both bill and cross bill, and an equal division of the costs of the whole proceeding between the parties. His report is now before us, together with eighteen exceptions filed on the one side and twenty-three on the other. In considering these exceptions, few of which merit any discussion, it is unnecessary to rehearse the history of the contending parties with reference to the locality covered by this litigation — of their origins, consolidations, absorptions, locations, constructions, and past strifes. The material facts concerning these details are fully stated in the report, and have, moreover, been so often threshed out in this court as to render their restatement a wearisome and unprofitable toil.</p>

In the light of the testimony in the case it can scarcely be open to dispute that the defendant had the power to build the branch at the time when it undertook to do so. In so far as the legitimacy of the exercise of that power, as dependent upon the bona fides of the attempt, is important here— the element in this case, indeed, mainly dwelt upon by plaintiffs’ counsel at the argument, — the finding of the master in favor of the defendants being based not simply upon deductions and in<a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>ferences from other facts shown or admitted, but also in a large degree upon direct testimony of witnesses examined before him,is entitled to great weight (Phillips’s Ap., <a href="/pa/68/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="68 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1024585" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0130-01">68 Pa. 130</a>, 138), and will not be disturbed unless clear error is apparent. The allegations of plaintiffs’ bill in the particular now uiider discussion are explicitly denied by the answer. Bearing in mind, the rules of equity practice as to the amount of evidence necessary to overcome such denial (Ibid, page 139), a review of the testimony fails to show that the master’s conclusions are wrong.</p>

The finding of the master that the plaintiff is not entitled to the injunction it prays for is based, in part, upon the fact that the construction of the defendants’ branch will not be an insuperable obstacle to the building and operation of plaintiff’s railroad, because, as shown by the evidence, the former may be so accomplished as to enable the plaintiff conveniently to cross it. If this is to be a ground for refusing the injunction, and if it is further true,' as the master finds, that the plaintiff has the right to build its railroad in the manner claimed, and that the possibility of the crossing referred to is a condition of the coexistence of the defendants’ branch and the plaintiffs’ road, then, under the general prayer of the bill, the decree ought to be so framed as to conserve whatever equities the plaintiff may have in the premises. . . .</p>
