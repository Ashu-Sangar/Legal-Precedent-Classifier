Defendant presented his petition to be discharged under the insolvent laws. The court refused his petition, and remanded him for trial in the quarter sessions. The order was made on the Saturday before the June sessions of 1892 began. Defendant entered into a recognizance for his appearance, but on account of the alleged shortness of time no bill of indictment was found, and defendant was ordered to renew his recognizance. A true bill was found by the grand jury at September sessions, 1892. The case, however, was not tried at that sessions. Defendant was never imprisoned. Defendant renewed his application for a discharge.</p>
