It also appeared from the evidence that the claimant had purchased from decedent a farm, giving a judgment for the greater part of the purchase money.

During her lifetime decedent never demanded this money, nor had claimant demanded from her any payment of board. <em>Held, </em>that decedent’s right to demand the payment of the balance of purchase money continued until her death, and was not extinguished by that event, and that the one debt should be applied to the payment of the other.</p>

Harlan, Esq., Jesse Jackson claimed eight hundred dollars for boarding and nursing decedent. • It appeared from the evidence that Jackson had purchased decedent’s real estate in her lifetime, the consideration in the deed being twenty-eight hundred dollars. Two thousand dollars were secured by judgment, and the remainder was to be paid in cash “'if Sarah Colgan ever needed it.” No demand was made in her lifetime. The auditor allowed the claim for nursing, and refused to set off against it the balance alleged to be due on account of the real estate.</p>

If Jesse Jackson was undoubtedly indebted to the estate, this probably might be done. His liability, however, depends upon his agreement made with the decedent. This agreement is not disputed. He was to pay these eight hundred dollars, if Sarah Colgan ever needed them. She was to be the judge of her own necessities, and these necessities were such as would arise in her lifetime. She was to need the money,. not those who came after her as legatees. She never demanded it, and it is to be presumed she never needed it. It is only needed now to enable the legacies to be paid. She left estate enough to pay all her debts, but not enough to pay all the. legacies. We think the necessity contemplated by the parties to this agreement was personal to Sarah Colgan.”</p>

It was admitted before the auditor that this sum was to be paid if Sarah Colgan ever needed it. She therefore had the legal right to demand it, and that right continued until the time of her death. She ■did not demand the money in point of fact but she never surrendered her right to do so, and did nothing to extinguish the debt. The grantee Jackson now claims that Sarah Colgan was indebted to him at the time of her death for eighty weeks boarding and nursing furnished by him, and which he claims was worth ten dollars per week, amounting in all to $800. He •never demanded payment of this claim during Sarah Colgan’s life, and it can well be understood that she omitted to demand payment of the $800. due her on account of the fact that she was receiving boarding and nursing from him. But it will require some effort to believe that if he had presented his bill during her life she would not thereupon have expressed her need of the $800 which he owed her on the land. However that may be, it cannot be questioned that any one who is in debt has need for the use of money for the extinguishment of •the debt. Literally the debt due by Jackson to the decedent was never surrendered or extinguished up to the moment of her death, and we do not understand how the mere fact of the death -could produce such extinguishment. At the very moment of her death other persons became vested with her rights, and as ■to them nothing but the absolute discharge of the debt by her •in her lifetime, or its disposition by will, could relieve Jackson from the obligation to pay it. It is not enough to say she •did not demand it. She had the right to demand it up to the instant of her death, and that right she never surrendered. It was therefore an asset of her estate. The claim of $800 for boarding and nursing was allowed by the auditor and learned ■court below, but they refused the set-off of the $800 owing by Jackson to the decedent, because she never demanded its payment. We cannot assent to that conclusion, and therefore hold that the one debt should have been applied to the payment of the other for which it was certainly needed.</p>
