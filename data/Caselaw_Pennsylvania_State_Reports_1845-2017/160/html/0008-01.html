It <em>i§ </em>true, forfeitures are odious in law when they are unconscionable or work injustice, but where time is of the-essence of the contract, equity will follow the law and will enforce a covenant of forfeiture as essential to do justice :' Brown v.

If a covenant of forfeiture can be sustained between a landlord and tenant, (Brown v. Vandegrift,. supra,) how much more essential is such covenant to the contract now before us. The plaintiff was operating the quarry the profits went into his pocket; the defendant had no share-in these profits. Unless the defendant has some speedy remedy to protect himself, he may, without any compensation, lose his-entire property. The installments may remain unpaid, and all of value in the property may be carted away.</p>

The plaintiff had the advantage of securing a property without any ready money; the defendant stepped in, advanced the means to buy, and no doubt the covenant of forfeiture was introduced as a corresponding advantage to the defendant. The plaintiff had all to gain and nothing to lose. If the quarry proved valueless, he could abandon the property and leave it on the hands of the defendant; if it proved profitable, he could pay for the property with the income from the quarry. Time is material, and of the essence of the contract where the remedies are not mutual: Westerman v.
