You folks know very well who tore them down. Q. Don’t you know who tore them down? A. No, I don’t. Q. When you say ‘you folks know very well who tore them down,’ what do you mean by that? A. I mean that the city knows who tore them down. You represent the city. Q. Do you mean to convey by that that the city tore them down ? A. I do not know that. Q. You do not mean to say that the city of Philadelphia tore those buildings down ? A. The city gave us notice to vacate <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>the street.

They should have taken every element of that kind into consideration when they reached their conclusion, and it would be doing great injustice if they did so, which, they ought to have done, for you to undertake to add now another like sum for the pur<a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>pose of increasing the claim, or the possible claim of the plaintiff for damages.

The plaintiff in his examination in chief had described the buildings, and said they had been torn down; and in his cross-examination had at least intimated that they had been torn down and removed by the city. The testimony complained of was to rebut this. It was in contradiction of statements of the plaintiff made in a cross-examination that was relevant, and was therefore competent.</p>

The witnesses testified as experts to the difference in market value before and after the opening of the street. This is all the light the jury had upon the subject. It was proper for the witnesses to take into consideration every element of advantage and disadvantage. No intelligent opinion could be formed without this, and the learned judge was right in saying that they must be presumed to have done so.</p>
