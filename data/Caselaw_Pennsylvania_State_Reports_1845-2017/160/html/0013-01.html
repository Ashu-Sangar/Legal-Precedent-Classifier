That a direction to invest in good real estate security for the life of Alice Dotts imposed a joint ■duty cannot be denied, and under our authorities one executor ■could not relieve himself from all responsibility in the matter by intrusting the whole duty to his coexecutor. In Weigand’s <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>Appeal, <a href="/pa/28/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="981719" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0471-01">28 Pa. 471</a>, the testator directed his executors to secure $500 and pay the interest yearly to his daughter for life.' One of the executors, a son, owed the father $500 on a bond. The coexecutor made no effort to collect the bond and secure the fund. The money was lost through the insolvency of the executor so indebted to the estate, and the coexecutor was held liable to the legatee for the loss. Weldy’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="102 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="502739" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0454-01">102 Pa. 454</a>, is to the same effect. In such cases the nonacting executor is not liable for the default of his coexecutor, but he is responsible for his own negligence, because the loss resulted from joint negligence where a joint duty was imposed. So in Fesmire’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=184%20Pa.%2086" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="184 Pa. 86">184 Pa. 86</a>, where the testator directed an investment ‘ in good real estate security,’ there was a joint duty imposed to secure such investment. The court say: When they put it in Kerper’s power to collect the money on the mortgage, it became their duty to see that it was again invested in “ good real estate security,” and if they had not neglected this duty the loss would not have been sustained. They did neglect it. The embezzlement was made possible because they neglected it, and their liability grows out of their negligence.’</p>

And it may well be, as the auditor intimates, that the accountant is not liable for the negligence of his coexecutor, Mr. Jenkins, but, as already shown, this is not the test of liability in the case before us. The inquiry is, was the accountant himself negligent? The auditor finds no evidence of negligence. We cannot agree with him.</p>

All other persons holding j udgments against Mr. Wilson entered them of record. These executors, alone, did nothing to protect their claims, although the failure to pay interest should have stirred them to action. There was no difficulty in their way, at least not so far as the $600 bond was concerned. All that was necessary to secure the debt was to carry the bond to the office for record. If this had been done at any time between the death of the testator, in 1887, and April 1,1890, the money would not have been lost.</p>

If the debtor was willing to give a judgment for $600 it is likely he would have given one for the smaller bond. If he accommodated others as early as 1887, why should he refuse the executor of the testator as late as 1890 ? All we know as to this matter is, that no effort whatever was made to comply with the explicit direction of the testator. An unsuccessful effort would excuse. Without effort the accountant is without excuse. It is clear that if the diligence exercised after the death of Mr. Jenkins had been applied before that time, the loss would not have occurred.</p>
