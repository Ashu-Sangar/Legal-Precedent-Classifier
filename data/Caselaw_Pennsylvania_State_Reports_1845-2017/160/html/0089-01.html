A precise analogy is to be found in the city of Philadelphia, where streets may be opened, on their own motion, by councils, or by the court of quarter sessions upon petition, and doubtless similar double methods coexist in other municipalities of the state. Repeals by implication are never favored, and the implication would have to be very strong indeed to justify a court in adjudging an implied repeal of the power to lay out, open and widen streets, which has existed in some form from the colonial days, and is an essential part of our modern conception of a municipality of any grade.’</p>
