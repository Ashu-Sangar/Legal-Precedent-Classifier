To my knowledge he did not have any interest in or receive any value or derive any benefit from the note in any manner. He was never the holder or the owner of the note. I had the note myself and I delivered it to Mr. McNaughton. To my knowledge he was never indebted to Mr. McNaughton in any manner, or to any person through this note. Q. Can you tell us how this note originated ? A. It was to settle a balance in a stock transaction between J. C. McNaughton and myself. That balance was made up of profit and losses in those transactions. Mr. McNaughton came into my office an entire stranger to me, about four or five years ago; he wanted to deal in stock. I was a stock broker. He proposed to deal on margin, making his margin as small as possible, never more than one per cent. That was not a purchase of stock. (That is a sort of gambling in stock.) With the money he furnished me, I did not actually purchase any stock. With that kind of a margin, stocks were never actually purchased by brokers. A person who wants to buy stock through a broker has to put up a margin of from ten to fifteen per cent. McNaughton never asked me to buy stock for him. I never bought or held any stock for Mr. McNaughton. He never demanded any stock from me.</p>

In my talk with him I knew that he understood marginal trans<a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>actions. During the four or five years he dealt with me he never got any stock from me, nor asked for any. If he had asked for any in his transactions with me, he would have had to leave money with me to purchase them. He never had stock enough with me with sufficient margin at any time to purchase any one kind of stock. His margin was scattered amongst different kinds of stock; sometimes ten or twelve different kinds of stock.</p>

That was the process under which Mr. McNaughton and myself came to that settlement under which the note was given. I had had a number of settlements with him during our business transactions, and that is the way it was always done. I kept an account of the stock Mr. McNaughton was dealing in as to the rise and fall in them. This I got from the reports in the stock market, and no stock was ever bought or sold.</p>

Haldeman <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>what the exact consideration of the note in suit was. He says, “ It was to settle a balance in a stock transaction between J. O. McNaughton and myself. That balance was made up of profit and losses in those transactions.” He further said that he never bought any stock for McNaughton and of course he never sold any. He however received money from McNaughton by way of margins and he had a number of settlements with him during their transactions. Of course there was money due from I. L. Haldeman to McNaughton, and for that money the note in suit was given. It was made payable to J. O. McNaughton and was indorsed by T. J. Haldeman, the defendant, at the time of its delivery. McNaughton indorsed it over the name of T. J. Haldeman, as he had a perfect right to do, and then passed it to the plaintiff company. This action is by the indorsee against the indorser, and there is no testimony in the case impeaching the title or the good faith of the plaintiff in acquiring the note. Whether the money for which the note was given represented the margins which J. C. McNaughton had deposited with I. L. Haldeman, or whéther it represented profits on the transactions, or part margins and part profits, the testimony utterly fails to tell and of course we do not, and cannot, know. It certainly does not represent the proceeds of any stocks sold because none ever were sold. We cannot say that it does not represent the money deposited by way of margins, and we are not at liberty to presume an illegal consideration in the absence of testimony to establish it. The witness says he paid McNaughton all the money he ever borrowed of him, but he does not say that he ever paid him any of the money he received as margins. We decided in Peters v. Grim., <a href="/pa/149/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="149 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="832519" data-case-paths="/pa/149/0163-01">149 Pa. 163</a>, that where the profits of stock transactions were paid over by the broker to his customer, leaving the amount of the original deposit in the hands of the broker, the customer could recover this money in an action against the broker. And so here, the broker admits that he received margins from his customer, and does not say that he ever repaid them. He does not say that the note was given exclusively for profits and we cannot assume-that it was.
