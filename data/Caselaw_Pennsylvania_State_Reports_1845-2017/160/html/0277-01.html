      <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>“ At the point of crossing in question, and for a distance of over a mile in either direction, the main lines of the Schuylkill &amp; Lehigh and the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroads parallel each other at a distance apart of only about 21 feet between their nearest rails. The roadbed of the former is about one and one half feet higher than that of the latter. To cross at grade is comparatively easy and cheap. The actual cost of constructing the crossing was about $850, and the entire cost of plaintiff’s branch and crossing together is $11,247.50. In order to cross overhead it would be necessary to attain an elevation above the present crossing of about 21 feet clear, or an elevation of about 25 feet to the top of the track on an overhead bridge. The more gradual the ascent to this elevation the greater would be the starting distance from the point of crossing. Your master gathers from the testimony that for the purpose of safe and convenient use with the usual engines and heavy loads, and in all kinds of weather, a greater grade than two feet to the hundred is not advisable. The attainment of this elevation at such a grade would indicate a starting point some twelve hundred feet to the southward, with a gradual approach, swinging to the westward from the line of the plaintiff’s road before making such a curve toward the bridge as would be safe and convenient. This approach would close projected streets and would occupy and render substantially useless for any other purpose the land now occupied and owned by the plaintiff company and lying to the west of its tracks to the banks of the Schuylkill river. In anticipation of increased business for both roads in the future, room should be left for the multiplication of tracks, thus necessitating a long and expensive overhead structure. Having reached the eastern side, the descent from the bridge must of needs be almost as gradual as the approach on the western side, while at the same time affecting the topography of the city streets and doing damage to private property as before stated. The expense of this method of crossing in excess, of the cost of the present grade crossing, is variously estimated by the witnesses at from about $40,000 to $87,000, irrespective of the damages to the affected property and streets. The variance between these estimates is accounted for in matters affecting the length and breadth, height and depth of the bridge and approaches, and the materials and <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>character of work in their construction. It is safe to conclude that for a permanent overhead crossing, good and substantial, of sufficient length to permit additional trackage for both roads, with gradual approaches and easy curves, so as to be safely and conveniently used with ordinary engines, including incidental damages to be paid to third parties, an outlay of at least $60,000 would be rendered necessary. The superintendent of the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad Company testifies that, if compelled to cross overhead, in view of the expense and the uncertainty of an adequate return from the enterprise, the company would abandon it, and in this he is sustained by a number of other witnesses. [Under all the facts and circumstances of the case it would not be reasonably practicable to avoid a grade crossing in this case.] ” [1]</p>

Your master finds from the testimony that the plaintiff did in fact, and he also finds that the plaintiff did under authority vested in it by the general laws pertaining to the construction of railroads, survey, ascertain, locate, fix, mark and determine upon the routes of two branch railroads as set forth in the bill and as manifested by drawings put in evidence and filed j also that the said routes and branches were formally adopted by the board of directors of the plaintiff company by resolution of July 12, 1889, a certified copy of which is in evidence and annexed herewith, and that the said branches have since been constructed. The testimony of the witnesses who were questioned in relation to the subject establishes the fact that these short lines of road are more than mere sidings, and are entitled to be named branches, and that plaintiff company deems them necessary to increase its business and accommodate the trade of the public. At present they would serve no purposes for public travel. The branches are of considerable length and traverse considerable territory, as is apparent from the drafts in evidence. They cross a number of the projected streets of the city of Reading as well as the premises of a number of private owners. Your master does not, therefore, find as a fact as stated in defendants’ answer that the said branch ‘ is located at grade over the property of the Schuylkill <em>&amp; </em>Lehigh Railroad Company, which land has been appropriated and- used exclusively by the defendant companies for railroad purposes.’ This <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>statement is in a sense -true of the mere crossing, but not of the entire branch or branches.

Centre avenue, which is crossed by the branch to the National Bolt, Nut &amp; Rivet Works, is an old and much traveled road. Exeter street, also crossed by said branch, is likewise opened and leads from Centre avenue toward the Schuylkill river. The only other opened road or avenue in the vicinity leads from said Centre avenue toward the river, but before reaching plaintiff’s ‘branch it abruptly turns southward and thus avoids it. The branch leading to the Reading Foundry Company, Limited, encounters no opened street or avenue. The several railroads occupy and obliterate in this neighborhood what was formerly known as the River road. These conclusions are justified partly from the maps in evidence and the examiner’s notes, and partly from personal inspection of the entire locality made by the master. It appears that defendant’s railroad was constructed there almost <em>twenty </em>years ago and the plaintiff’s railroad about eight years ago. The grade crossing, as sought for and as now existing, occupies mainly the junction of Pike street with what was the River road, but said Pike street remains unopened and is only indicated on the topographical survey of the city.</p>

At the previous consideration of this case no evidence was submitted to your master touching that which is now made an important feature of the controversy, namely, the right of plaintiff company to cross or occupy the city streets in the territory covered by these branches. There is no testimony as to the consent or refusal of consent by city councils in the examiner’s notes of testimony, laid before your master, and, therefore, the previous report is silent upon the subject. It was for that reason that your master declined to consider the legal side of the question, when requested by defendant’s counsel to do so. The same counsel has now made the offer of testimony heretofore recited with plaintiffs’ objections, which offer is de<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>signed to formally introduce the question for adjudication. Whether this offer can be received now and by one whose office is only that of master, and whether it can properly be the basis of findings of fact or of a final decree, are serious points to be well considered hereafter. But inasmuch as the report is mainly referred back in this connection, and the court in its opinion of reference expressly points your master to the records of the interlocutory proceedings in this case, the master is justified in stating that he does find upon the records filed in this case an answer made by defendants to plaintiff’s petition for leave to renew motion for injunction, etc., in which the defendants deny the right of plaintiff to construct these branches, and aver by way of reason that the consent of the councils of the city for plaintiff to occupy the said streets has not been obtained, but that on the contrary the said councils have expressly refused such privilege; and further, that to this auswer are annexed certified copies of the files of select and common councils, certified by the city clerk, manifesting the withholding of such leave.

Manifestly this has nothing to do with the consent of the city to occupy the streets, and nowhere else in the bill or the answer does any matter appear pertinent to that subject. It is true that the act of April 4, 1868, makes it the duty of the railroad company to first obtain the consent of the city before it occupies its streets, but your master cannot believe that in every proceeding seeking to have the manner of crossing another regulated by the courts it is incumbent upon the plaintiff company to show, as a condition precedent, that all its charter restrictions affecting the right of third parties have been overcome. If such were the case, in every proceeding instituted by the railroad company, the preliminaries to be established would be more burdensome and voluminous than the main matters of the issue.’ If such weie the requirements, the railroad at its very start must needs show that every right which will be affected before the completion of its contemplated undertakings has been acquired or quieted.

If it is unnecessary to obtain the consent of councils to cross or occupy the location of streets which have no actual existence but which are only in contemplation, it stands to reason that upon that ground this crossing cannot be objected to, because the tracks leading to the Foundry Company, to say nothing of other portions of the branches, will not interfere with the streets.</p>

The railroad company there, as it is proposed here, constructed its tracks upon such a plotted street. Subsequently the street was actually opened, and the expense of making a crossing over the railroad being $176.26, this case arose upon the question as to whether the city of Chester or the railroad company should bear the expense. The courts put the expense upon the railroad company. This case, therefore, only declares that whatever expenses in opening these plotted streets may be incurred by the city hereafter, by reason of their occupancy now by plaintiff, must be borne by plaintiff, inasmuch as there is fair notice upon the records that the city has the prior right of occupancy. But although for such a purpose the city has a prior right of occupancy, it can hardly be said, with reason, to have an exclusive light of occupancy, so. as to demand that the railroad company shall obtain consent before crossing these designated locations. They may never be opened to public use; the public may never secure the right of passage over them to and fro; the land covered by them may, for an indefinite time, be the property of private individuals, so that no rights of the municipality or of the public will be infringed.

If the plaintiff, therefore, has a right to build its branches across these unopened streets, and a right to occupy the foot of unopened Pike street for the purpose of extending its lines, what is there to prevent the crossing of defendants’ tracks in some manner?

L. 1361, provides that, ‘ in all proceedings in courts of law or equity of this commonwealth, in which it is alleged that the private rights of individuals, or the rights or franchises of other corporations are injured or invaded by any corporation claiming to have a right or franchise to do the act from which such injury results, it shall be the duty of the court in which such proceedings are had, to examine, inquire, and ascertain whether such corporation does in fact possess the right or franchise to do the act from which such alleged injury to private rights, or to the rights and franchises of other corporations results : ’ Sec. 1,1 Purd. 357, pi. 108. It is very clear from a mere reading of this enactment that the right of a private person or corporation to raise this inquiry extends only to the questioning of such acts as interfere with the rights or franchises of the <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>party raising it, and not to that of any exclusively affecting third parties or the public. If any authority is needed for so plain a proposition, it is found in West Pa. R. R. Co.’s Ap., <a href="/pa/104/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="104 Pa. 399" data-case-ids="452211" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0399-01">104 Pa. 399</a>. The standing, then, of the defendant company to call upon the court, under the act of 1871, to inquire iuto the power of the plaintiff corporation to do that which it prays to be permitted to do here, must be given by the fact that that act will constitute an injury to the private rights of the defendant, not by the fact that it may involve danger to the public or wrong to the city of Reading. The threatened injury to the private rights of the defendant is that which is involved in the cutting and crossing of its tracks at grade. Now, it is a mistake to suppose that the legislative and judicial policy discouraging grade crossings springs from any exceptional regard for the property of the railroad companies. There is nothing peculiarly sacred about a railroad track as an article of property. On the contrary, railroads being public highways, are not even, for all purposes, to be treated as private property (P. &amp; G. R. R. Co. v. S. W., etc., Co., <a href="/pa/77/0173-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="77 Pa. 173" data-case-ids="436305" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0173-01">77 Pa. 173</a>, 186), and it ought, by this time, to be understood, in Pennsylvania, that a railroad company, under the general railroad laws, takes the right to lay its tracks subject to the liability of having them crossed and intersected at grade by other railroads, having the power to cross tracks already laid, whenever there is a necessity therefor, so that no needless injury be inflicted and compensation be made for that which is done: See N. C. Ry. Co.’s Ap., <a href="/pa/103/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="103 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="449150" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0621-01">103 Pa. 621</a>, 629. The discouragement of grade' crossings, as a principle, arises from considerations beyond the interests of the railroad companies, viz., from considerations of public safety : P. &amp; C. R. R. Co. v. S. W., etc., Co., ubi supra. For its preservation, the courts have adopted certain rules as to the allowance of grade crossings, and the legislature has confided to them authority over the subject which makes those rules enforceable, and has further enacted regulations controlling the action of railroad companies in laying tracks generally upon public streets. In appealing to the principles thus established, however, simply to prevent the crossing of their own tracks, railroad companies assert no private rights of their own, but stand upon ground common to the entire public ; and the necessity which satisfies the latter being shown as a matter of fact, their entire rights in the <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>premises are compensation and protection against needless injury. Granted that, in the assertion of these rights, they may raise the question submitted to the courts by the act of 1871 regarding the powers of the corporation which is the aggressor, it is nevertheless clear that that question, where a grade'crossing is resisted, must primarily be, whether, regarded as an act affecting the objecting party’s private rights, the power to do it does or does not exist. The question whether the act involves an infringement of a public right, or of a right to be exercised for the benefit of the public by the city or any third party, can, if it arises at all, arise only secondarily, as bearing upon the former and main question, as a makeweight in its decision.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[241,997,1166,869]]]'>“ Obviously, the answer to the main question is to be sought for, in the first instance, in the charter of the corporation attempting to do the act resisted. ‘The act of 1871 contemplates nothing more than that it shall be made to appear from the charter that the corporation has the power to do the particular act in controversy, and which involves some right of the contestant:’ West Pa. R. R. Co.’s Ap., <a href="/pa/103/0621-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="103 Pa. 621" data-case-ids="449150" data-case-paths="/pa/103/0621-01">supra, pp. 406, 407</a>. The act of 1868, which defines the powers exercisable by the plaintiff in this bill, gives, in sections 9 and 10, the power to construct branches and to cross the tracks of other railroads at grade. The. findings and reasoning of the master demonstrate these powers to be here applicable, the question of streets being out of the way. Hence, if there were no such question here, and the local facts being, as I have said, found in favor of plaintiff, there would be an end of the objection of want of power, for the general power to cross tracks of other railroads with a road such as this is given to plaintiff by its charter.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b319-4" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[238,1874,1169,553]],["BL_320.1",320,[257,366,1172,2048]],["BL_321.1",321,[220,389,1173,556]]]'>“ But here comes the auxiliary point. This crossing happens to cut a track located upon a public street, i. e., it happens itself to be located on a public street, and the grant in sections 9 and 10 of the general power to cross tracks must not, by reason of section 12, be construed as authorizing the occupation of streets without municipal consent. My answer is: The power to occupy streets is not the direct and primary question involved in this controversy. That question concerns the power to cross defendant’s track. The effect of section 12, therefore, in considering this question, is to be judged by its relation, not to the power to occupy streets, but to the power to cross other <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>•railroad tracks. Now, whatever may be its relation to the former power (see P. S. V. R. R. Co. v. P. &amp; R. R. R. Co., C. P. Berks Co., No. 341 Eq. Dock. 1884 [affirmed above, p. 232] ), and though it be regarded as enacting a condition precedent to the exercise of that specific power (see Larimer Ry. Co. v. Ry. Co., <a href="/pa/137/0533-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="137 Pa. 533" data-case-ids="821496" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0533-01">137 Pa. 533</a>, 547), its relation to the general power to cross tracks of other railroads is simply that of an exception enacted subsequently to the explicit grant of that power. It is a familiar principle that, whilst he who relies upon a statute must show himself entitled under an exception made in the enacting clause, he need not, when relying upon a substantive grant by an earlier part of the statute, notice an exception made in a later part of it: See 1 Chitty PL (16 Am. ed.), 246, 247. Hence, in this case, it was not necessary for plaintiff to aver the consent of city councils in its bill, nor to prove it as part of its case. But neither could the defendant disprove it, because its injury does not arise from the act forbidden by the exception, but from one permitted by the preceding grant. The principle laid down in Larimer Rjn Co. v. Ry. Co., supra, is not to the contrary. All that is there decided, pertinent to this question, is that the court will not inquire into the authority for the occupation of a street by one company at the instance of another attempting without authority to occupy it — substantially what was decided by this court in P. S. Y. R. R. Co. v. P. &amp; R. R. R. Co., No. 500 Eq. Dock. 1890. Nor does the decision in Germ. R}n v. Cit. Ry., <a href="/pa/151/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="151 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="836709" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0138-01">151 Pa. 138</a>, aid the defendant here. The injury there complained of was that arising from an attempted construction of another railroad upon the same street, for the occupation of which by it there was alleged to be no charter authority, and the existence of this authority was the single question in the case. Here, the injury does not and cannot at all arise from an occupation of the street by plaintiff, but from its attempt to cross defendant’s tracks. Upon what principle it can be claimed to be competent for the defendant to raise a collateral inquiry as to the power of plaintiff to do an act not directly the cause of its only possible injury, under a statute which merely permits it to call upon the court to pass upon tbe plaintiff’s powers to do ‘the act from which such injury results,’ is beyond my comprehension. What was said by the Supreme Court in West. Pa. R. <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>R. Co.’s Ap., ubi supra, seems literally applicable here, substituting only the ‘ city of Reading,’ for the ‘ Commonwealth.’ ‘ When we go beyond this,’ — i. e., the question whether the charter confers the power to do a specific act involving a right peculiar to the contestant — ‘ we assume something with which we have no business in a collateral proceeding; we assume to assert the rights of a third party, the commonwealth, who may or may not, at her option, insist upon the observance of those rights.’ It follows that sections 9 and 10, act 1868, are a complete answer to the only inquiry to which the court can possibly address itself in this case under the act of 1871.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b321-3" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[213,955,1175,1480]],["BL_322.1",322,[275,385,1169,1006]]]'>“ In the next place, even if it be conceded that the defendant is entitled to raise this question, and that the 9th and 10th sections of the act of 1868 are not a complete answer without a further showing of authority under the 12th, its contention here is in no better case. That the right to object to a railroad company’s entry upon a street without the consent of the municipality resides primarily in the latter, will certainly not be denied, any more than that the right of a private party to raise the objection on the ground of specific injury to itself (see Larimer Ry. Co. v. Ry. Co., supra, p, 547) rests, where it exists at all, upon the principle that one of a number in interest may assert, for his benefit, a right of another, which it is the latter’s duty to assert for the benefit of all — the same principle, which, e. g., permits a stockholder in a corporation to proceed against persons wrongfully dealing with the corporate property, where the corporation itself neglects to do so: See 3 Pom. Eq. Jur., secs. 1094-5; 1 Moraw. Pr. Corp., sec. 257; Brown v. Orr, <a href="/pa/112/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="112 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="546764" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0233-01">112 Pa. 233</a>. I do not say that it was the duty of the city to resist the plaintiff’s entry upon this street, and therefore do not admit the right of the defendant to oppose it for the benefit of the public. The case might be different if a railroad company attempted to occupy one of the main thoroughfares of a city without municipal consent. But there is no analogy between such a case and.that of a street unopened and unlikely ever to be opened. Concerning the latter, it cannot be for the court to say collaterally that it is the duty of councils to resist, and that, if they fail to do so, any private person, however trifling his interest, may. But supposing that defendant had a standing to assert the right of the city, it is clear that it could assert the <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>same only in so far as and while it existed in the city. When the latter has lost or parted with the right, it no longer exists anywhere, and of course cannot be set up by the defendant. Now, though the obtaining of the city’s consent to occupy any of its streets be a condition precedent to the lawful exercise of the power to do so by a railroad company, it cannot be pretended that, where the power has been exercised without previous consent, the act cannot be subsequently ratified and legalized by the city. Nor is there any method prescribed by which alone consent can be given by the city, antecedently or subsequently. I agree with the master entirely that the facts of this case establish, in equity, a subsequent ratification by the city of plaintiff’s entry upon its streets for the purpose of constructing the track here in question, by virtue of which, under the principle of Com. v. Turnp. Co., <a href="/pa/153/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="153 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="840321" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0047-01">153 Pa. 47</a>, and a multitude of other decisions, it has divested itself of the right to raise the objection of want of antecedent municipal authority. Of course, the defendant’s right in raising this objection can rise no higher than those of the city to which it primarily belongs, but falls with them.”</p>
