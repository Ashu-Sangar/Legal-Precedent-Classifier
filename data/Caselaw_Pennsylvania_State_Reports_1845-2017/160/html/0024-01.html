Phillips &amp; Co., having a claim against the Swedeland Manufacturing Co., assigned the same to the use of Haverhill Safe Deposit Co. Phillips &amp; Co. subsequently made a general assignment for the benefit of creditors to Louis B. Henry. The Swedeland Manufacturing Co., admitting the indebtedness, petitioned the court for leave to pay the amount into court, which was done, and an issue framed to determine which of the rival claimants was entitled to the fund. It was not denied that the assignment to the Haverhill Safe Deposit Co. was for a debt justly due them, but it was sought to defeat the assignment because Marshall A. Phillips had been coerced into making it by threats of arrest for a criminal offence committed in another state. It appears that he was heavily indebted to eastern creditors, and that he had obtained credit or goods from them under false representations as to his financial condition. Hearing that he was about to or had assigned his property, his attorney and .confidential clerk were informed that, unless the eastern creditors were preferred, Phillips would be arrested on a criminal charge. They so informed Phillips and advised him to make this with other assignments of claims. Thus far the facts are not disputed.</p>

Phillips was not examined as a witness and the only evidence of constraint was the testimony of the lawyer and clerk that they had told Phillips of his threatened arrest and advised him to do what was requested of him. We fail to see in this that Phillips was not a free agent. Non constat that the threat had any effect upon him or that the advice of his friends did not move him to act. The mere fact that he made the assignment of claim does not prove that he was deprived of the exercise of his will. An honest man owing a debt might wish to prefer one creditor to another, even under threats. There was therefore nothing to submit to the jury upon this point, and if the matter had been submitted there would have been no testimony upon which to base a finding that Phillips’ mind had been so acted, upon as to coerce him. He is not here to make the defence.. His assignee for the benefit of the general creditors, even if we concede his standing, is not in a position to make the defence without showing such a condition of affairs as Phillips would be compelled to do were he making the contest for himself. We think therefore that upon this ground alone the direction was proper. .</p>
