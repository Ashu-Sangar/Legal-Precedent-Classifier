It left it liable, as under the act of 1850, for all damages caused by injuring or removing buildings, but allowed it to apply to the payment of damages for land taken a certain proportion of the county tax collected from the taxpayers of the city. This is the substance of the act although the result just stated is reached by a somewhat roundabout process. The method adopted by the act is this : The county is made primarily liable to the landowner for the damages caused by taking his land, the city continuing to be liable, both first and last, for the damages causéd by injuring and removing buildings. In any given year the amount thus advanced by the county (and it is really nothing more than an advance on behalf of the city) is charged against the city, and the city is then credited with the proportion of county tax which its taxpayers have contributed towards opening roads and erecting and repairing bridges' in the county. If the difference is in favor of the city it is entitled to be paid in money (which it may recover by suit if necessary), or to have a credit carried over to the next year, but if the difference is in favor of the county, i. e., if the city has spent in advance a part of its proportion of the county tax for the next year, then the damages for land taken (as between the county and the city) are no longer to be paid by the county but by the city, until there is again a balance in favor of the city, whereupon these damages are once more to be paid by the county, but (as between the county and the city) only ‘ to the extent of such balance.’</p>

      <a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>“ It seems quite clear that this simply amounts to allowing the city-to draw back a varying sum each year from the county tax, and to use it in payment for land taken in opening streets. But the landowner is not bound to inquire into the state of the accounts between the county and city and to look to one or the other as the balance may be found to incline. As between the county and the landowner the county is made primarily liable to any extent which viewers and juries may determine ; but, as between the county and the city, the county is only bound to pay for this particular purpose a varying proportion (but one easily calculated) year by year, of the city’s contribution to the county tax. If this proportion is not enough to repay the county its advances to the landowners, one of two things may be done: Either the balance against the city may be carried over for a year or for several years in the hope that succeeding credits may restore the equilibrium; or if the balance is so large that this would involve a delay the county considers unreasonable, an action may be brought to recover what is due, and a new starting point for the future accounting may be reached. Indeed, there is a third course which the county may adopt if it sees proper: It may sue for any balance in its favor, whether large or small, but ordinarily we presume so strict a settlement would not he insisted upon.</p>

This proportion the county controls, for it has the money in its own hands ; whatever sum it pays beyond this is really lent to the city — lent by compulsion of the statute, and in our opinion may be recovered by suit.</p>

Frey, <a href="/citations/?q=128%20Pa.%20598" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 Pa. 598">128 Pa. 598</a>, as a few extracts from the opinion will show. On pages 597 and 598 Mr. Justice Clark says: ‘ It is conceded that by force of the second section of the act óf 1854 all sums awarded for damages for the opening of streets in the city of Lancaster are to be <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>paid out of the county treasury, with the exception of such damages as may accrue from the removal of or injury to any house, etc., which are to be separately assessed and paid out of the city treasury. The second section as thus construed is a complete adjustment of the rule of responsibility attaching to the city and the county for the opening of streets within the city. ... In the third section it is assumed that under the second the county will expend county funds in payment of damages as therein provided, and the policy of the third section is that the city shall not thus withdraw from the county fund more than she contributes to it; that is to say, the city is responsible to the county that the amount thus expended in its behalf shall not exceed the amount contributed by the city to the county funds for opening roads,’ etc. He then shows that the one hundred and eighteenth word in the third section should be read city ’ instead of ‘ county ’ —a conclusion which we adopt in the present case, as the question is again raised and we are asked to pass upon it — and proceeds to say on page 599 : ‘ But this obligation of the city was to the county, upon which by the second section the primary obligation to pay was imposed.’ After explaining why the county must be primarily liable to the landowner, the learned justice declares that the city must repay the county if the latter has been forced to advance too much; ‘ hence it was provided that the county commissioners should- open an account with the city of Lancaster, showing the amount contributed by the city to the county treasurer towards opening roads, etc., on the one side, and the amount withdrawn from the county treasury for opening streets, etc., in the city on the other side; and, whilst the balance on that account was against the city, the damages incurred in the opening of streets in the city should be payable out of the treasury of the city — payable to the county, of course, who is primarily liable to the property holder.’ The opinion is summarized i'n the concluding sentence: ‘ We are of opinion that the question of the liability of the city in each case can only be raised in a proceeding between the county and the city; that the property holder must resort to the county treasury, and the county must in a proper case resort to the city; and further, that the city upon payment of any such claim is reimbursable out of the county treasury, when the balance is in favor •of the city, to the extent .of such balance.’</p>

Max. 513. “ It is the most natural and genuine exposition of a statute,” says Lord Coke, “ to construe one part of the statute by another pai*t of the same statute, for that best expresseth the meaning of the makers.” ’ The same rule is to be found in Potter’s Dwarris on Statutes, p. 144, in this language: ‘In the construction of a statute every part of it must be viewed in connection with the whole, so as to make all its parts harmonize if practicable and give a sensible and intelligent effect to each.

Doubtless the act does contemplate the keeping of a formal account, and such an account ought to be kept, but we think the provision is directory merely, and that the failure to keep it will not prevent a recovery. It is not always easy to determine whether a provision is mandatory or only directory, but there are two good rules which are often of much assistance in deciding this question. The first is referred to in Bladen v. Phila., 60 Pa. page 466: ‘ Where the words are affirmative and relate to the manner in which power or jurisdiction vested in a public office or body is to be exercised, and not to the limits of the power or jurisdiction itself, they may and often have been construed to be directory.’ See also Pittsburgh v.

Taxes are yearly contributions; almost all public accounts are settled annually, and we think the act contemplates yearly settlements and the striking of a balance once a twelve-month. If this had been formally done there could be no doubt that a right of action would have accrued year by year when the balance was struck, and that the statute would now bar recovery, except for six years preceding date of suit. In effect, however, the county has been treated in this action as if the account had actually been kept as required by the act, and we think it may'fairly be held to all the consequences which in that event would have followed. Moreover, as the balance each year was hardly more — and might indeed be nothing more —than a matter of arithmetical calculation, it does not seem unreasonable to consider the balance as formally struck, although the computations were not actually made. And still further — and perhaps alone of decisive weight — since the duty of keeping the account was laid upon the county, it can hardly set up its own neglect as a successful answer to the plea of the statute, and thus derive a benefit from its failure to obey the law.</p>

L. 352, entitled “ An act relative to the opening of streets in the city of Lancaster.” That act was properly before us for construction in County of Lancaster v. Frey, <a href="/pa/128/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="128 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="567096" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0593-01">128 Pa. 593</a> ; and after full consideration it was there held that the word “ county,” which is the one hundred and eighteenth word in the 3d section thereof, is a clerical mistake, for the word “ city,” apparent on the face of the act. In delivering the opinion of the court our late brother Clark; said: “ It is perfectly manifest that the word ‘ county,’ the one hundred and eighteenth word in the third section, is a mere clerical error in the transcribing of the act. That the damages should be paid out of the treasury of the county and be reimbursable out of the county treasury, etc., is a manifest misuse of words. No such thing could have been in the mind of the legislature, for the proposition involves an absurdity. The obvious meaning and purpose of the act is plain from the context. It needs no argument to show that the word ‘ county ’ was mistakenly written for ‘ city,’ and it is a mistake apparent on the face of the act, which may be rectified by the context.”</p>
