L. 271, and its supplement of May 1, 1876, P. L. 89. They thus assumed the burden of setting forth in their affidavit of defence such compliance with the provisions of the act as entitled them to the benefit of exemption from liability as general partners. Instead of doing so, however, we think their affidavit discloses noncompliance with the requirements of the act and its supplement, in two important particulars: (1) That at least part of the property alleged to have been contributed as capital is not such property as is contemplated by the supplement of 1876; and (2) that they have not properly scheduled all the property which is alleged to have been subscribed or contributed to the capital of the association.</p>

As stated in the certificate, the amount of capital subscribed for by each is as follows: “The said subscribers having purchased the personal property of the R. B.

The personal property purchased from the R. B. Chambers Company, subject to the debts and liabilities of that company, means what may be'left, if anything, of the .assets of the said company after all its debts and liabilities are paid. Such property as that is of no avail in aiding the business or paying' the creditors of the J. N. Remsen &amp; Co. Limited. At best, it is not presently available, and may never be. In Vanhorn v. Corcoran, <a href="/pa/127/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="127 Pa. 255" data-case-ids="565694" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0255-01">127 Pa. 255</a>, one of the scheduled items was: “ Isaac N. Kline et al., doing business as A. H. Heilman &amp; Co., paid in merchandise, lumber, book accounts and bills receivable, transferred to this association, $21,609.18, and in cash $3,390.82, making a total subscription of $25,000.” Referring to this item, Mr. Chief Justice Paxson said: “ A creditor looking at this description could not form any estimate of its quantity, character or value. For all practical purposes it might as well have been omitted.” The defendants “ merely contributed their interest in a firm with estimated assets of $75,000 and certain debts of $53,000. The value of the difference between the two was the allegéd contribution of $21,609.18. . . . The whole of it in equity was liable to creditors and could not be withdrawn from them without fraud until the last dollar of the debts of the firm was paid. So that instead of property, the defendants contributed a mere equity, to wit, what was left of the assets of the firm after the payment of its debts. . . . Had the certificates set forth that their contribution consisted of their interest in a firm subject to the payment of its debts, it would have conformed to the truth, but it would not have been a compliance with the act of 1876. That act contemplates such contributions as shall be available to aid the business and pay the creditors of the limited partnership. Of what use was this contribution ? It could not properly be made available until the debts were paid.”</p>

But further comment is unnecessary. Unless we are willing to let the act of 1876 become a cover for fraud, and a snare for the unwary, <em>wé </em>should adhere emphatically to what we have heretofore said as to the scope and meaning of the act. As was said in Maloney v. Bruce, <a href="/pa/94/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="94 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="486236" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0249-01">supra,</a> the property contributed was intended as the equivalent of cash, and the plain object of the provision requiring a schedule was to enable creditors to ascertain precisely of what the property consisted, and to judge of its value.
