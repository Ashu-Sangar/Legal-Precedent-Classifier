It appeared that, on the day of the accident, defendant company was constructing a long-distance telephone line along the highway where plaintiff was driving. Two gangs of workmen were employed, one a “ pole gang ” whose duty it was to set up poles, and the other a “ digging gang ” who went ahead digging holes. In excavating the holes it was necessary to blast the rock, and for this purpose John Livingston was employed, who used dynamite cartridges, and exploded them in the usual and ordinary way. John Delany was employed in the “pole gang,” and had nothing to do with the explosion of cartridges. There was evidence to warrant the inference that Livingston, finding some of the caps wet, handed them to Delany to determine whether they would explode, and that Delany in testing them frightened plaintiff’s horse and caused the injury.</p>

You will recollect that the name of the companj', defendant, is given as the American Telegraph &amp; Telephone Company. You will also remember that there was testimony to the effect that there was another company called the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, and that it was that company which constructed this telegraph line. The credibility of that testimony is for you, and it is for you to ascertain whether or not this particular company which was sued was the employer of these men.
