By its original charter no salaried officer was eligible to the position of director, but whether this had been changed by the supplements was disputed. On May 2Q, 1891, an act was passed authorizing salaried officers of private or business corporations to serve as directors. On Jan. 8,1892, the Fire Association elected as directors two who had been salaried officers the previous year, and who, the answer averred, “ were afterwards elected to salaried offices,” by the directors, on the same day. Relator claimed that the action of the association involved an acceptance of the constitution of 1874, so as to give him the privilege of cumulating his votes under art. 16, § 4.</p>
