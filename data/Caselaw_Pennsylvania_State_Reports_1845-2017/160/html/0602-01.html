The evidence showed that the mother lived in a mountainous region in the country, while all three of the sisters lived in a city. All of the parties were in very moderate circumstances. Two of the sisters, with almost unbroken regularity, spent the summer with their mother, without paying board. The mother at times gave money and clothing to one of the daughters who was unmarried. It also appeared that when the married daughters were ill, the mother went to the city and nursed them without charge; and that for sixteen years prior to the accident the mother had furnished one daughter with the potatoes used in her household, without charging for them. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict of $2700 in favor of the daughters.</p>

At her death she was fifty-nine years old and in good health. All three daughters had left home, and for some years had resided in Philadelphia; the two married ones, Mrs. Sehnatz and Mrs. Krise, lived with their husbands ; Ellen, who was single, worked at wages from $4.00 to $6.00 per week, and lived alone. There was testimony tending to show that she generally went to her mother’s home about three months during the summer, and while there paid no board; that her mother at times gave her money when she needed it, once as much as twenty dollars, and sometimes clothing. As to Mrs. Krise, there was evidence that for some years she had suffered from a pulmonary disease and had each summer gone to the mother, whose home was in a mountainous region, for the benefit of her health, and remained there for two or three months; that at times in the winter, when ill, her mother had come to Philadelphia and staj'ed with her, doing such household work as was required for her sick daughter; further, that she charged nothing for boarding this daughter at Phoenix Park, or for the service rendered her in Philadelphia.</p>

That act says: “ The persons entitled to recover damages for any injury causing death, shall be the husband, widow, children, or parents of the deceased, and no other relative.”</p>
    <p id="b630-5" data-blocks='[["BL_630.6",630,[286,1452,1164,391]]]'>The act itself makes no distinction between children over age and those under, between those married or single, between those having homes and families of their own and those still members of the parents’ household.

True, in that case the son still continued to live with the parents, but the case is not decided on that fact alone, but is put on that and other facts in evidence, as furnishing a probable ground for expectation of <a id="p607" href="#p607" data-label="607" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*607</a>future support. And the court there cites with approval, Dalton v. South Eastern Railway Co., 98 E. C. L. R. 296, decided under 9 and 10 Vic., cap. 93, which almost in the same words as our statute provides : “ That every such action shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child.” In the English case the deceased son was twenty-eight years of age, unmarried, but living away from his parents. It appeared that for seven or eight years he had visited them often, and at times had taken them presents of provisions, and had given them some money, amounting in all to about twenty pounds a year. It was held that, although the actual family relation had been severed, yet, in view of the parental relation and the conduct of the deceased, which was prompted by no legal duty but resulted wholly from filial affection, the jury had a light to consider what reasonable pecuniary expectation in the parents had been disappointed, and the actual pecuniary damage sustained. Justice Thompson, delivering the opinion of this court, says, the English statute being so neariy the same as ours, this is a precedent which may be safely followed, and concludes “ that if there be a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage, the destruction of such expectation, by negligence occasioning the death of the party, from whom it arose, will sustain the action.”</p>

This mother was not wealthy, but she <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>appears to have been thrifty; she cultivated her four acres of ground, and kept a small store; the single daughter and sick daughter testified that, for years, with almost unbroken regularity, they had spent the summer with her, for which she made no charge; this was an annual contribution of just what it was worth in money for the benefit and comfort of these daughters; as they had for years received it, they had a reasonable expectation of receiving it as long as the life and ability of the mother lasted; by her death they lost it; why could not the jury from the evidence estimate what they had lost in money ? True, it was only about one fourth of the yearly boarding of the two daughters, but it was as capable of computation as any of the elements of damages admissible in this class of cases. So as to the money and clothing contributed from time to time; these were capable of a valuation as certain as the tea and sugar contributed by Dalton to his parents when he visited them, as stated in the leading case already cited. As to Mrs. Schnatz, she testified that regularly for sixteen years, in fall and spring, her mother sent her the potatoes used in her house, for which she paid nothing; that she nursed her at times in illness ; did sewing for her, and performed like services. The jury might find from such evidence, a reasonable expectation of future benefits of like value and character, and thereby approximate a money loss.</p>

They were passed to compensate, in dollars, those who had lost by death those pecuniary beuefits which have their origin in the purest sentiment.</p>
