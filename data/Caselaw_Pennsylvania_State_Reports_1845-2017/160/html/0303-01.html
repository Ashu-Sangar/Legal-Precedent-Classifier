But those decisions also unmistakably show that the ‘ intention,’ which thus becomes controlling, is not the secret design which may dwell in a party’s mind and as to whose existence he alone can speak,but that ‘intention ’ which was either expressly declared by the parties competent to make'it the governing rule, or which flows, patent to all, from the nature and character of the act, the clear purpose to be served, the manifest relation which the articles bear to the realty, and the visible consequences of their severance upon the proper and obvious use of it. This meaning of the word is particularly emphasized in Bldg. Assn. v. Berger, supra, at p. 324. It is most unequivocally stated by Knowlton, J., in Hopewell Mills v. Sav. Bank, <a href="/mass/150/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="150 Mass. 519" data-case-ids="780560" data-case-paths="/mass/150/0519-01">150 Mass. 519</a>, as follows: ‘The intention to be sought is not the undisclosed purpose of the actor, but the intention implied and manifested by his act.

The decision in Benedict v. Marsh, supra, does not suggest such a departure from the ordinary rule as to transactions between men, that one’s undisclosed intent is not to affect the other: Spencer v..Colt, <a href="/pa/89/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="89 Pa. 314" data-case-ids="1063215" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0314-01">89 Pa. 314</a>. In Benedict v. Marsh the contest was between the vendee of real estate as part of which he claimed a certain steam sawmill which he himself had originally sold to the owner of the land, and which the latter had transferred to the defendant. The case turned wholly upon the question of the intended permanency of the sawmill structure, and the testimony was conflicting on that point. In these circumstances, it was held permissible to ask the purchaser of the sawmill as to what he told the plaintiff, at the time of the purchase, concerning his purpose and'intention <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>in the premises, and in connection therewith what he said on the same subject to others. This holding is entirely consistent with the rule as I understand and have endeavored to formulate it. Applying this rule here, it is obvious, that the secret ‘ intention,’ which doubtless existed in Mr. McHose’s mind when he .put the steam-heating apparatus into his house (see findings of fact 5), is not controlling of this case (even had he not done that which requires the inference that, as against this plaintiff, he had abandoned it subsequently : see findings of fact 7, 8), and that the question of realty or not realty depends wholly upon what the facts found show concerning the nature, object, purpose, and relation of the improvement in and to the property regarded as a dwelling house. No doubt this question is primarily and usually one of mixed law and fact: Campbell v. O’Neill, <a href="/pa/64/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="64 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1021232" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0290-01">64 Pa. 290</a> ; Hopewell Mills v. Sav.

That it is a convenience whose presence may enhance the rental value and the comfort of a house may be very true: See Jarechi v. Philh. Soc’y, <a href="/pa/79/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="79 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="438397" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0403-01">79 Pa. 403</a>, 405. That, as a means of heating dwellings, it will in a short time be superseded by something superior to it, seems but a reasonable expectation. Of no such appliances can it be said that they are of such a nature or character as to be necessary to carry out the obvious purpose for which the building was erected, permanently to increase its value for occupation and use, or to constitute lasting accessions to the property. The same considerations of personal comfort, convenience and safety that call for their adoption at one time will require the discarding of them later on. So far as they consist of movable articles merely standing upon the floors, though screwed to pipes, in walls or under floors, their relation to the realty itself is not different from that of any other sort of detachable heating ap<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>paratus, from a portable furnace down to a gas stove, and the consequences of their severance from the realty are precisely the same in kind. There is, in a word, nothing in the act of introducing such articles into a dwelling-house, and nothing in their nature, object, purpose, or relation to the house, which can give rise to an inference that they were put there to. be a part of the realty, or to increase the security of its mortgagee. There is certainly no more reason for indulging such a supposition with respect to such than with respect to gas fixtures. Steam heat is furnished to houses by steam heating companies in the same way in which gas is furnished by gas companies. Indeed, the use of gas is far more general in dwelling houses, and it is far more of a necessity to their enjoyment and occupation as such, than steam heat. Moreover, like in the apparatus here in question, so where gas is used, it is introduced by means of service pipes entering the cellar, vertical pipes conducting it to the upper floors, and distributing pipes carrying it to the various rooms, some of which pipes are exposed, others imbedded in the walls, others laid under the floors. Again, analogously to the proven relation of the radiators and the valves attached to them to the remainder of the steam-heating apparatus, the removal of the brackets and chandeliers, with their burners and stop-cocks, renders the entire <em>system </em>of gas pipes in a house, from which they are' detached, useless for the time: See Sewell v. Angerstein, 18 L. T. (N. S.) 300, per Willes, J. But gas fixtures are very uniformly held to be severable from the realty, whether the question of their annexation to it arises between landlord and tenant, vendor and vendee, or purchaser of the personalty, and mortgagee of the realty: Ewell, Fixtures, pp. 93, note 299, 436, note; Vaughen v.

Of course, express stipulation may <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>make them pass with the realty : Jarechi v. Philh.

Whittier, <a href="/cal/58/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="58 Cal. 126" data-case-ids="2311224" data-case-paths="/cal/58/0126-01">58 Cal. 126</a>; Sewell v. Angerstein, supra; or an intent to do so may be so clear from the attending circumstances and expressions as to have the same effect: Ewell, Fixt., p. 800; Funk v. Brigaldi, 4 Daly (N. Y.) 359; Central etc. Co. v. Hotel Co., (Super. Ct. Cine.) 26 Ohio L. J. 149. But in the absence of such an element, the rule as above stated seems very well settled. In this connection, however, it must not be overlooked what is meant by gas fixtures. There is a clear distinction, pointed out in Yaughen v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/33/0522-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="33 Pa. 522" data-case-ids="988362" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0522-01">supra, at 523</a>, reiterated in Jarechi v.Philh. Soc’y, supra, at p. 408, and recognized in Ewell, Fixt., p. 299, and cases there cited, between gas fittings and gas fixtures — the former term including all the piping down to the points of opening where chandeliers, brackets, etc., used for lighting are designed to be attached, the latter only covering those attachments. It is these exclusively to which the rule I have given applies. The analogy between the arrangements for lighting dwelling houses with gas, and those for heating such with steam, seems to me to be so complete that this distinction must also obtain as to the latter, under the decisions of this state. For this reason I must regard the case of Jenkins v. Gething, 2 John. &amp; H. 520, cited in Ewell, Fixt., p. 129, note, as inapplicable here, and decide that the only portions of a steam-heating apparatus in a dwelling house that do not ordinarily become part of it in such a way as to prevent their being separated as personalty from the real estate, are the radiators with the valves attached to them. Whilst the traps, regulators, service and distributing pipes, risers, and the valves belonging to them may fairly be considered as necessary to the completion of a modern dwelling house where the facilities for steam heating exist, and must, in the nature of things, be substantially the same in every case, varying only in dimensions ; the radiators with their valves are put up in more or less expensive style, according to the taste and means of the person who intends to occupy the house, or according to the purpose for which it may be designed, as a dwelling for his own family, or as a house to be rented to others. Hence upon grounds precisely analogous to those pointed out in Jarechi v. Philh. Society, ubi supra, they and they alone are not to be <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>regarded as intended to be annexed to the realty. Of course, applying these principles to the facts of this case, the radiators here in controversy, being personal property, never became subject to the Provident, etc. Co.’s mortgage; the plaintiff’s purchase of them, with the knowledge and consent of the owner of both them and the house, gave him a good title even before actual severance: Mitchell v. Freedley, <a href="/pa/10/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="10 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="962667" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0198-01">10 Pa. 198</a>; and the purchaser of the realty at the sale of Oct. 15,1892, with notice of plaintiff’s claim of title, cannot complain.</p>
