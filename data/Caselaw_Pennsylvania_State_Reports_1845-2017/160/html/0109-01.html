The platform was part of a tramway used to support coal ashes. The tramway consisted of two endless moving wire ropes to which iron buckets were fastened. It was the duty of the deceased to stand on the platform, disconnect the bucket, and push it around a curve, and regrip it to the rope which would carry it on. The evidence tended to show that the platform was dangerous because of the absence of guard rails, etc.</p>

On the subject as to whether it was too narrow you have the evidence that the father complained that it was dangerous; you have the descriptions •of a number of witnesses, and their opinions that it was dangerous. You have the testimony that it has been widened since ■that time, and that a man has worked on that platform for a year since. All these facts, without repeating them, are for your consideration on the question as to whether it was dangerous or whether it was not. We do not say that it was dangerous. That is a question for the jury to determine under, the facts in this case. Besides it is not enough for you to determine ■that it was dangerous and then say that the Pottsville Iron &amp; ■ Steel Co. are liable, but you must be convinced, by the evidence, that the fact that that platform was too narrow was the reason why Jacob Madara met his death, because by your ver-dict finding damages against the Pottsville Iron &amp; Steel Co. you would be saying that the platform was too narrow, and that caused the death of Jacob Madara. That is what you must find in order to find a verdict in this case.] [2]</p>
