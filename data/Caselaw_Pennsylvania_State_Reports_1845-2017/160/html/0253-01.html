That case, doubtless, is the true authority for the ca.se here, for the reason that the bequest over was given upon the contingency of the first legatees leaving no issue. There Walter Gore devised a leasehold to his nephews, William Gore and Walter Gore, and if either of them should die and leave no issue of their respective bodies, then he gave the leasehold premises to the daughter of his brother William. The nephews having died without issue, the question was whether the limitation over to his niece was too remote. . Lord Chancellor Parker decided that it was not, and said: ‘ The reason why a devise of a freehold, to one for life, and, if he die without issue, then to another, is determined to be an estate tail, is in favor of the issue, that such may have it, and the intent take place; but there is the plainest difference betwixt a devise of a freehold and a devise of a term of years; for in the devise of the latter to one, and, if he die without issue, then to another, the words, “ if he die without issue,” cannot be supposed to have been inserted in favor of such issue, since they cannot by any construction have it.’ The case of Forth v. Chapman has <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>been repeatedly cited and approved by our Supreme Court. In Clark v. Baker, 3 S. &amp; R. 477, Tilghman, C. J., said of it: ‘ These words, “ without leaving issue,” applied to personal estate, have been held to mean issue living at the death of the person to whom the property is given in the first instance. But not so with regard to land. This is the distinction taken in Forth v. Chapman, 1 P. Wms. 667, and it is well founded, because it carries into effect the intention of the testator.’</p>

Let it be noticed that the legacy is in terms absolute, and that it is qualified only by the bequest over on his death without issue. But these are words of entailment, and, therefore, when applied to personal estate, they pass the absolute property. A different construction is usually put upon the phrase “ dying without leaving issue,” when applied to personal property. It is a general, though-not universal, rule that words which, when applied to land, would create an estate tail, will, when applied to chattels, pass the entire interest. How can it be otherwise ? Chattels cannot be inherited. They pass to one set of representatives, and land to another.’</p>

The case is then completely within the rules laid down in Smith on Executory Interests, 599, 600, which are as follows: “ Where personal estate is limited, either directly to, or by way of executed trust for a person indefinitely, or for life, with a limitation over on indefinite failure of his issue, the whole interest vests in the ancestor. But where the limitation over is on failure of children only, or on failure of issue within a given time, the ancestor will have a life estate with a limitation over of a springing interest, or the entire interest with a conditional limitation over.” The limitation over to the children of Charles is not a limitation after an indefinite failure of issue.

This was formerly a finespun distinction, which, in process of time, as personal property increased in estimation, and the liberality of courts extended, has been’ exploded; and it is now perfectly settled that, whether it be a bequest or its use, makes no difference. The principle is that where there is a limitation of a chattel by words which, if applied to freeholds of inheritance, would create an estate tail, in personal estate the whole interest vests absolutely in the first taker. There is a distinction, however, as to the words “dying without leaving issue ” between a devise of real estate and personal estate; in the former generally thejr seem to be construed to mean indefinite failure of <em>issue; </em>in the latter, issue at the time of the death of the first taker.’</p>

If, upon a fair construction of the words of the will, it is manifest that the testator intended a failure of issue within the period allowed for the vesting of future interests, by the rule against perpetuities, the failure of issue intended is, in a legal sense, a definite one, and a gift over is good; and in the ascertainment of the testatorial intent courts are satisfied with any reasonable indication of such intent.

An executory devise of a chattel, to take effect after an indefinite failure of issue, would be void, the contingency being more remote than the law permits. It is granted, however, by the counsel for the defendant, that the contingency mentioned in this will is not too remote, because the dying without issue is not indefinite, but restricted to the time of the death of the first taker. But a question has been made, whether money can be the subject of an executory devise ; of this I entertain no doubt. A sum of money devised <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>to one for life, with remainder to another, may be of great use to the first taker; he may put it to interest or invest it in goods or land, and thus make profit. ...

Should one of my daughters die without issue or will, in that case her inheritance shall come to my other daughters then living, or to their offspring in equal shares, but to prevent misunderstanding, the share of the sister to her children.’ In holding the language of the will to import a failure of issue at the decease of tine daughters, Gibson, O. J., p. 494, said : ‘ The daughter’s will would speak at her death, and the contingency of dying without issue was evidently so closely coupled in the testator’s apprehension with the idea of her dying with or without one, as to have been inseparable from <em>it; </em>and though there may be an indefinite dying without issue, there can be no indefinite dying without a will. The legacy was to go to the survivors if the dying sister made no will and had no children; but if she made a will, or perhaps an appointment in the nature of one, it was to go to her appointee; but to either, necessarily, at her death.’</p>

Snyder, during life, and after her decease, for such issue, if any, as she may have ; I direct that the interest on said legacy shall commence from the dajr of my death, and that the same shall be paid to my daughter in monthly installments of $100.’ Read, J., at p. 112, 113, said : ‘ The natural construction of the first legacy is to give only a life interest to the appellant with remainder to such issue as she may leave at her death. The rule is now certainly settled in England, that a legacy to A. for life, and after his death to his issue, gives the legatee an interest for life only, and that the issue take as purchasers. This was the rule laid down by Lord Thurlow in Knight v. Ellis, 2 Brown C. C. 570, and after various contradictory decisions it is now recognized as the established law of the land.’</p>

Kauffman, 86 Pa., at p. 100-1, Chief Justice Agnew said: ‘Did Leon Kauffman take an estate for life, or absolutely, in the personalty bequeathed to him’by his mother, Hannah Ann Kauffman? We think it was a bequest of the interest or income for life only. That a bequest of income or <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>profits will carry an absolute estate in the principal or corpus of the estate in some cases is well settled; but the ground of the conclusion in such instances is that no contrary intent of the testator appears to sever the product from its source; and the fruits, therefore, carry with them that which bears them. In the interpretation of a will, however, in order to gather the testator’s intention, the words income and interest as distinguished from the corpus or principal, and the enjoyment for life only, have an important bearing: Earp’s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith, 119; Ogden’s Appeal, 20 <a href="/watts/9/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Watts 490" data-case-ids="1850052" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0490-01">Id. 501</a>. Hence, when the intent clearly appears to carry the corpus or principal over to others, the words of the will must be permitted to have their proper force. Here the bequest of the interest only for life, connected with the provision immediately following, is inconsistent with an intent to confer the principal absolutely upon him. The provision is: “ If my son, Leon Kauffman, should die without issue, it is my desire that the whole amount of my investment be given to the Orphans’ Asylum.” ’</p>
