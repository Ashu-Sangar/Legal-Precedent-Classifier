While on their way to the hunting ground, they discussed the danger of four persons hunting together, and the importance of their keeping together. They finally reached the edge of a woods near a hill. Three of the party, including defendant, proceeded eastward up the ascent of the hill, and crossed its crest and disappeared on <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>the other side. Plaintiff remained behind, saying that he would hunt there a little while and join them later. It was understood that in their course they were to keep bearing towards Blue Rock schoolhouse. About the time the three passed up the hill, plaintiff started in a southerly direction through the woods on a line somewhat parallel with the line which the three took after they had crossed the hill and were out of his sight. In a few moments he changed his purpose and undertook to rejoin his comrades who had passed over the crest- of the hill. As he approached the crest of the hill, a gun was discharged by one of the party of three who had advanced over the hill and who were not in sight. Immediately after another gun was discharged. The second discharge was from a gun in the hands of defendant. These shots were directed at a rabbit which had been raised by the party. When the second shot was fired the rabbit had reached the crest of the hill. Plaintiff’s head and shoulders were both in range of the gun at the time it was fired. The shot killed the rabbit and part of the load struck plaintiff in the face, causing the loss of one eye, and physical injury in other respects.</p>

Belonging, as it does, to that large class of personal injury cases, wherein the standard of duty is variable and shifts with the facts developed on the trial, it became a question of fact for the jury to determine whether, in the circumstances, a reasonable and proper degree of care was exercised. The case was accordingly submitted to the jury by the learned president of the common pleas in a clear and concise charge in which they were fully and accurately instructed as to the law applicable to every phase of the testimony. We find no error in either of the rulings complained of in the specifications.</p>
