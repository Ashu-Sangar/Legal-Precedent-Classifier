Rupert, Esq., creditors of Robert Irwin, deceased, claimed that the administrators should be surcharged with the value of two horses which had been omitted from the inventory. Mrs. Irwin testified that a few years before her husband’s death she concluded to procure a couple of colts, ostensibly for the purpose of giving them to her two sons. Accordingly she procured the services of a stallion, owned by a neighbor, for which she paid with her own money. She also got the consent of her husband for the use of his two mares, that the colts might be foaled and reared. The agreement with her husband was, that the colts should be hers when born. Sometime after they were foaled Mrs. Irwin gave the colts to her two boys, John A. and Bayard Irwin.</p>

Irwin, their mother, and one of the administrators of their father’s estate, and exceptions having been taken to her competency to testify as to the agreement made between herself and her husband, the report was referred back to the auditor to pass upon the question. The auditor, in his supplemental report, finds Margaret A. Irwin to be a compe<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>■tent witness, because, first, her interest is not adverse to that of the decedent, and, secondly, she was called to testify against her own interest.

    <p class="summary" id="b107-5" data-blocks='[["BL_107.5",107,[212,556,1166,506]]]'>“ The interest against which Mrs. Irwin testified was that of a creditor of her husband’s estate, which, being insolvent, the reduction of the assets by the loss of these horses would consequently reduce her dividend. If testifying against interest was alone the test of competency, Mrs. Irwin would be a good witness, for the 6th section of the act of May 28, 1887, provides that ‘ any person who is incompetent under clause (e) of section 5, by reason of interest, may nevertheless be called to testify against his interest, and in that event shall become a fully competent witness for either party.’</p>
