It appears that this machine consisted of two parts. There was a rammer by which the stones in the street were to be hammered down and rammed, and there was a locomotive part or motive part, the object of which was to move the machine about the streets in the performance of the work it was intended to do.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b343-9" data-blocks='[["BL_343.10",343,[195,1982,1168,452]],["BL_344.1",344,[292,389,1170,547]]]'>“ With respect to the ramming part of the machine, the defendant contends that there were certain defects in the way in which the work was done, and it has been testified to you, by his witnesses produced before you, that in those respects that part of the machine was defective; the work was not done in a workmanlike manner. The first defect which they allege is that the port hole through which the steam was admitted into the cylinder was to some extent — about two thirds of the space according to the testimony of one witness — closed by a web of <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>iron. It was testified to you that some time was spent in endeavoring to find out where the trouble lay, and that finally, by drilling into the cylinder, this web of iron was removed. It took a half hour to chip it out when it was found, and about half a day was spent in taking the machine apart. But according to this evidence the web was found there, and it is alleged to have been a defect in the construction. On the part of the plaintiffs the men who worked upon the machine have been produced. Some of them have said they examined the', casting and found no such web, and one testified to you if it had been there at the time the work was done he would have found it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b344-4" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[291,953,1167,350]]]'>“ Another defect which has been alleged is that three eighths of an inch was cut away from the top of the piston rod. I believe it is not denied that that was done, but the plaintiffs tell you that that was rendered necessary by the fact that an accident happened to the piston rod after the machine had left their control, and that because of that accident it became necessary to cut away that part of the rod.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[289,1311,1171,606]]]'>“ The third defect which is alleged on the part of the defendant with respect to this part of the machine is that in the space which was cut away from the yoke certain pieces were inserted, which are called ‘dutchmen,’ and it is alleged on the part of the defendant that that was not good workmanship. The plaintiffs, however, tell you that those ‘ dutchmen ’ were inserted because it was found necessary, after the machine had been constructed, to reverse the motion and turn around the piston, and that this rendered necessary the cutting away of certain portions of it, and the insertion of these pieces. They further say to you that it was no detriment. This is substantially the testimony with respect to the ramming part of the machine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.7",344,[289,1926,1169,503]],["BL_345.1",345,[213,396,1172,701]]]'>“ Now, there was the other part of the machine, the motive part. The defendant testifies to you that between the time of the first proposition which was made, and before the making of the second proposition on the 19th of January, 1885, he saw the plaintiffs and told them that the difference between the old machine and the one they were to construct was in the locomotive part; that in the old machine there was a difficulty in moving ; that he told them to find out what was needed and to prepare what was wanting. I do not remember that there is any contradiction of this statement in the evidence presented before <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>you. To a certain extent there is an admission of it on the part of the plaintiffs. They say that the plans and the patterns which were submitted were not complete, that there were parts that were missing, and these parts were to be designed by them. Mr. Joshua R. Johnson, in telling what they did design and construct in accordance with that design, says that they made the stand to hold the cjdinder or the guides for the cross heads, that they added a stand to fasten both cylinders to, that they designed the frames which held the cylinder. He also, in the evidence which was presented in a former trial, said that they prepared the motive power for driving it around the streets in accordance with the plans which they have produced, and he concedes, in the testimony which he has given before you, that that is correct.</p>

[If the defendant is to contend that the plaintiffs were to build an entirely new motive part to suit this machine, it ought to appear clearly before you that that was the understanding and agreement made between the parties. The written propositions do not so state, and I do not remember any evidence in the case which would justify you in so finding. The contract should be reasonably construed, and it means — it is my duty to tell you what it means — that it was the duty of the plaintiffs to examine that motive part, and if they found that there were parts missing, or parts defective, to design them and construct them.] [2] The parts which they were to so design and construct ought to be adapted to the other parts of the machine, and should be so designed and constructed that they would reasonably answer the purpose for which they were intended.</p>

You have also heard — and I do not propose to go over it at any length — the evidence as to the fact that this machine when it went out on the street met with many mishaps and encountered a number of breaks. It is not dis<a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>puted that in many of its parts the machine did break.

If the defects are due to imperfect workmanship on the part of the plaintiffs, or to any want in the materials which they used in the construction of the machine, or if the parts which they were to design, and did design and construct, were not reasonably suitable for the purposes for which they were intended, the defendant would be entitled to deduct from the claim of the plaintiff such an amount as he would be required to expend in repairs inputting the machine in the condition which was arranged for in the plans and designs.

And as another thing you do not pretend to say that the plaintiffs guaranteed this machine would do the work which it was designed to do ? A. They did not guarantee that. . . . Q. No such undertaking on their part that the machine would be successful so far as the paving the street went? A. No. Q. That was the object you had in making he patent, and they did not guarantee it ? They simply guaranteed the work and the materials ? A. That is all.”</p>

    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[287,522,1166,648]]]'>The occasion of the revised bid was that a day or two after the first bid, and after the patterns had been examined, it was found that they were incomplete and that the drawings relating to the locomotive part of the machine were defective. The defendant called on the plaintiffs and was then informed of these facts. “ He then informed the plaintiffs that they should carefully examine all the drawings and specifications, and if there was anything imperfect or defective, to correct it. . . . He then requested them to send him another proposition covering everything needed to construct a complete machine suitable for the work for which it was to be used.” The foregoing quoted statements are taken from the defendant’s history of the case.</p>
    <p id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.6",350,[285,1187,1165,391]]]'>As will be seen by the above quoted portion of the charge, the court below instructed the jurythat “if the defects are due to imperfect workmanship on the part of the plaintiffs, or to any want in the materials which they used in the construction of the machine, or if the parts which they were to design, and did design and construct, were not reasonably suitable for the purposes for which they were intended, the defendant would be entitled to deduct ” etc.</p>
    <p id="b350-6" data-blocks='[["BL_350.7",350,[281,1596,1168,797]],["BL_351.1",351,[210,391,1160,1358]]]'>This portion of the charge is not assigned for error, and it certainly seems to us to express the full measure of the plaintiffs’ obligation under the contract. ' According to the defendant’s personal testimony the plaintiffs did not guarantee, and were not asked to guarantee, that the machine when constructed would do the work for which it was made. The plans and specifications were to be furnished and were furnished by the defendant. When it was found they were imperfect in some respects, the plaintiffs undertook to furnish revised “ drawings and patterns,” to correct the imperfections, and did so, and as to these the charge of the court below held them liable if they were not reasonably suitable for the purposes for which they were intended. We are unable to hold, as is claimed for the defendant, that the words “including revised drawings and specifications,” in the second bid, operated to change the contract so that the finished machine should do its “ work satisfac<a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>torily as a machine.” The revised drawings and specifications were onty rendered necessary by the imperfect condition of the drawings and patterns that had been furnished by the defendant. It was merely to supply those defects that the plaintiffs undertook to furnish such as were needed. We cannot consider that this undertaking sufficed to change the whole nature of the contract. The case of Dubois v. Bigler, Young &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/95/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="95 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="492916" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0203-01">95 Pa. 203</a>, was entirely different from this. There the contractor was to furnish all the drawings for the engines, and guaranteed that the materials and working of the engines should be first class and satisfactory to the purchaser, and the decision was put upon that ground. Thus Mr.. Justice Trunkey, delivering the opinion, said: “ The engines and fixtures were for a particular purpose, to be made and placed by plaintiffs according to their drawings and specifications, the working of which was guaranteed to be first class and satisfactory. Materials, workmanship and plan were embraced in the engines and fixtures, which were warranted to do good work as the motive power for a large sawmill. . , . The plaintiffs contracted for the successful working of the machinery and are liable for its failure, unless success was prevented or hindered by the act or default of the defendant.” All of these important and controlling features are absent from the present case. We think the case was correctly tried by the learned court below. The instructions as to damages are not important in this view of the case, but, if they were, we think they are correct.</p>
