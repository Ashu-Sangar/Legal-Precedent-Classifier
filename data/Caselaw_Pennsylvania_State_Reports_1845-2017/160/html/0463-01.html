That the knowledge of the plaintiff of the existence of the condition of the crossing for more than three weeks prior to the date of the accident is contributory negligence on her part, and will prevent a recovery by her in this action. <em>Answer: </em>That pointis refused. It brings up, however, an important question for your consideration in this case, and I will deal with that at this time. Bearing on the question of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff, the fact is brought out that she had, three weeks prior to the injury which she claims to have received, actual personal knowledge of the existence of the dangerous condition of this crossing. It is also shown that, on the evening, and within an hour of 'the time she claims to have been injured, she knew of another and safe route over which she might pass to and from her home, including the meat market, the first place she visited. In that connection you are to recall and consider whatever evidence has been adduced in the case touching the question of her knowledge, or want of it, three weeks prior to this injury. Was she justified in presuming that, after the lapse of three weeks, the defect or obstruction at the crossing where she was injured was removed? It is the duty of municipalities to repair defects in highways. The presumption is that they do their duty, and the presumption would be, in this case, that if such reasonable time had elapsed for the municipality to have had notice of the defect, it did its duty in this respect, in repairing the defect or removing the obstruction alleged to have existed at this crossing. And yet, however, I submit to you, for you to find and determine, whether the plaintiff, having knowledge of the existence of this defect for three weeks prior, and for three weeks prior to that time, I submit for you to determine whether she was justified in presuming that the obstruction had been removed, and going over the crossing in the manner that she did. If you find that from her knowledge of the situation there prior to the accident, that <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>she ought to have remembered the dangerous condition of the crossing, that it would have been reasonable for her to have done so, and negligence in her not to have done so, then by reason of that she could not recover in this case. If you find, from all the evidence in the case, that it was but reasonable in her to have presumed that the obstruction or defect, which she had known to exist, had been corrected or removed, then, the other elements existing, she might, notwithstanding the fact that she had prior knowledge of the existence of this obstruction, recover in this action.” [1]</p>
