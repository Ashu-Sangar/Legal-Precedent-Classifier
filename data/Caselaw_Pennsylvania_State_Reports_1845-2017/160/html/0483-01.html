The offer does not propose to show that Samuel Callender, or his heirs, had any other possession of the coal except such as they were authorized to have by the lease, to wit, that the said Samuel, and his heirs, may dig what coal they may need for their own use, but not to sell; and it is not proposed to prove by the offer that they exceeded the authority given them bj the lease; their possession, therefore, of the surface, and any occupancy they may have had of the coal, was in subservience to the lease and not in opposition to the same, and no possession of the surface by said Samuel, or his heirs, could, by any reasonable construction, be construed as in opposition to the rights of Thomas Meredith, or his assigns, to the coal underlying, which had been severed by the lease of 1828, which was duly recorded, and which was notice to all the world of such severance.</p>

The lessee also had the right to take possession of the surface, and that he did not take possession of the surface; there were surface rights as well as coal, and if he abandoned one he abandoned the other. We will follow this by showing that there was an increased value of this land; we will show that this land is worth as much as ten to one hundred times as much as it was when this contract was made. One of the purposes of the offer is to show <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>that they did not take possession in accordance with the terms of the lease, and determine and investigate how much coal there was and pay the hundred dollars.

This agreement of 1828 is, to some extent, a permission to go on the land and search for the coal. If Thomas Meredith had undertaken any search in his lifetime, or those claiming under him, and had satisfied themselves that there was no coal there, and then expressed themselves as satisfied with it, and left it, then it might have been an abandonment of their right under it. But there is not a particle of evidence in the case that Thomas Meredith, or any one under him, made any effort to find any coal, or to remove any, until after this suit was brought, and they have a right, under the instrument of 1828, to wait. They may have known that there was coal there, they may have supposed that there was coal there; but that is not enough, gentlemen of the jury. They had the right to wait. It may have become more valuable with time. They were not required to move a ton of coal out of there. There was nothing in the lease calling for any payment for any coal that was removed, except the considerations which were set forth in the agreement — that is, the two hundred dollars down, then the annual rent, then the amount which was to be paid in case the coal proved to be extensive and of the average thickness of ten feet.” [6]</p>

There is nothing whatever in the leases requiring or indicating that Thomas Meredith, or those under him, were to take actual possession at any time prior to the expiration of the hundred years.

There is no clause of <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>forfeiture in this lease; there is no evidence that any rent was ever demanded by anybody.

    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.9",515,[221,913,1171,1586]]]'>The learned counsel for the appellant states the point in controversy very fairly and clearly in the opening sentence of his printed argument. He says : “ The contention in this case is confined to the effect and subsequent history of the Callender lease, dated the first of October, 1828.” His position is that the lease granted only an incorporeal right to the lessee, to be exercised upon the premises covered by the lease. The appellees, on the other hand, contend that it granted the coal in place, under the land, absolutely. The words of the instrument upon which this question depends may be put together thus : “ Samuel Callender .... doth lease and to farm let to Thomas Meredith .... all the land that he now holds .... and the leas? is to continue for the term of one hundred years from this day. Possession of the leased premises shall extend only to their use as a coal field. The lessee shall have full power and possession to search for coal anywhere on the leased premises, in any manner he may think proper, to raise the coal, when found, from the beds ; to enter and carry away coal; and to sell the same for his own benefit and profit. He may occupy whatever land may be useful or necessary as coal yards .... for roads for transporting the coal; and in case it may prove necessary for securing the full enjoyment of the premises aforesaid as a coal field as aforesaid, then the said Samuel covenants and agrees to execute such further writings as counsel learned in the law may deem proper.” The purchase money or price of the coal is fixed at two hundred dollars. If the coal proved abundant and of a given thickness then another hundred dollars was to be paid. In addition to this the sum of one dollar per annum was to be paid as rent. The lessor reserved out of this grant the right for himself and his heirs to take coal for their own use so long as they should reside on the land.</p>

The right of removal was to be exercised within one hundred years. The fact that the instrument is in the form of a lease is not material when the character of the transaction is apparent: Kingsley et al. v. Hillside Coal &amp; Iron Company, <a href="/pa/144/0613-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="144 Pa. 613" data-case-ids="823742" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0613-01">144 Pa. 613</a>; Montooth v.

A written contract, though not under seal, granting the privilege of digging all the coal or ore on the vendor’s land, is equivalent to a conveyance of the title to the coal or ore in fee : Fairchild v.

Such a conveyance operates to sever the surface from the underlying stratum of coal; and after such severance the continued occupancy of the surface by the vendor is not hostile to the title of the owner of the underlying estate, and will not give title under the statute of limitations. To affect the title of the owner of the coal there must be an entry upon his estate, and an adverse possession of it: Armstrong v. Caldwell, <a href="/pa/53/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="53 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1004690" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0284-01">53 Pa. 284</a>.</p>
    <p id="b516-4" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[263,1373,1169,1118]]]'>But the contention that a right to mine coal in the land of another is an incorporeal ■ one cannot be successfully maintained. The grant of such a right is a grant of an interest in land: Hope’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20Pitts%20L.J.%20270" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="33 Pitts L.J. 270">33 Pitts. L. J. 270</a>. When the grant is in terms or in effect a grant of all the coal on the lessor’s land, this amounts to a severance of the coal from the surface, and vests a title to the underlying stratum in the grantee : Sanderson v. The City, <a href="/pa/105/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="105 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="454255" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0469-01">105 Pa. 469</a>. This underlying estate may be conveyed under the same general rules as to notice, as to recording, and as to actual possession, as the surface. After such a severance, the possession of the holder of each estate is referable to his title. The owner of the surface can no more extend the effect of his possession of his own estate downward, than the owner of the coal stratum can extend his possession upward, so as to give him title to the surface under the statute of limitations. The owner of the surface can be affected only by the invasion of the surface. The owner of the underlying stratum is not bound to take notice of the invasion of the estates that do not belong to him ; but when his own estate is invaded he is bound to take notice. The conclusion thus reached disposes of the title by possession set up by the plaintiffs, and of their right to recover in this case.</p>

Stone, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20Pa.%20457" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="152 Pa. 457">152 Pa. 457</a>, and other cases in which oil leases were considered and the rights of the lessors and lessees defined. A lease granting to the lessee the right to explore for oil and, in case oil is found in paying quantities on the leased premises, to drill wells and raise the oil, paying an agreed royalty therefor, has been held to convey no interest in the land beyond the right to enter and explore, unless the search for oil proves successful. If it proves unsuccessful and the lessee abandons its future prosecution, his rights under the lease are gone. So it might be with a similar lease of lands supposed to contain coal. If the lessee entered, explored the leased premises, and, finding nothing, gave up the search, he would no doubt be held to the same rules, upon the same provisions in the lease, as were applied in the cases cited. The difference in the nature of the two minerals, and the manner of their production, has however resulted in considerable differences in the forms of the contracts or leases made use of. When oil is discovered in any given region, the development of the region becomes immediately necessary. The fugitive character of oil and gas, and the fact that a single well may drain a considerable territory and bring to the surface oil that when in place in the sand-rock was under the lands of adjoining owners, makes it important for each landowner to test his own land as speedily as possible. Such leases generally require, for this reason, that operations should begin within a fixed number of days or months, and be prosecuted to a successful end or to abandonment. Coal on the other hand is fixed in location. The owner may mine when he pleases regardless of operations around him. Its amount and probable value can be calculated with a fair degree of business certainty. There is no necessity for haste, nor moving pari passu with adjoining owners. The consequence is that coal leases are for a certain fixed term, or for all the coal upon the land leased, as the case may be. The rule of Venture Oil Co. v. Fretts, <a href="/pa/152/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="152 Pa. 451" data-case-ids="838150" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0451-01">supra,</a> is not capable of application to the lease made by Callender to Meredith in 1828 for several reasons: (1) The Callender lease is in effect a sale of all the coal in the leased premises, and consequently a severance of the surface therefrom. (2) It is for one hundred years. All idea of haste in development or operating is excluded by the terms of tire instrument, <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>and tbe time for commencing the work of mining is left to the discretion of the lessee. (3) The consideration of the grant was not the development of the mineral value of the land, but the price fixed by the agreement and actually paid to the lessor in money.</p>
