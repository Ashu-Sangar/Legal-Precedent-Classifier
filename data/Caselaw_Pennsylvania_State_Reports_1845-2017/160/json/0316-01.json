It appears that the appeal is from an order of the orphans\u2019 court directing appellant as surviving executor of John H. Palethorp, deceased, to file an account. It cannot be doubted that the court had jurisdiction in the premises; nor can it be doubted that the order complained of is merely interlocutory. It follows that the appeal is premature and should be quashed.\nRule absolute and appeal quashed.",
