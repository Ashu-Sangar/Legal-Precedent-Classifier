The proposed amendment therefore, even if applied for in time, which it was not, would be of no service to the plaintiffs, as it would give them no cause of action for which a recovery could be had. The motion to amend by changing the form of action was not made until nearly six months after the judgment of nonsuit was entered, and after the statute of limitations had become a bar to the action. Of course it was too late and was rightly refused.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Seip et al., surviving executrices of Sarah Keipler, deceased, from judgment of C. P. Lehigh Co., Nov. T., 1891, No. 45, entering nonsuit in favor of defendant, William H. Deshler.\nBefore Green, Williams, McCollum, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit against agent for account. Before Albright, P. J.\nAt the trial it appeared that Annie E. Seip was the only contending plaintiff. The other parties named as plaintiffs stated that they opposed the litigation, and that their names were used against their wishes.\nDefendant was a son-in-law of testatrix and was employed \u25a0by her as agent to collect rents, pay taxes and insurance, make repairs to buildings, and to account to her for balance. The evidence disclosed that defendant made statements- at regular intervals to testatrix, and that she and her daughter Emma examined them; that the balance was paid according to these statements; and that Mrs. Keipler was \u201c entirely satisfied \u201d with them. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit. About six months after the entry of the nonsuit plaintiff made the following motion:\n\u201c And now March 7, 1898, Isaac Chism, attorney for plaintiffs, moves the court nunc pro tunc to permit an amendment or change of the form of action in this suit from assumpsit to account render to be made as if moved immediately before the entry of the nonsuit, in order that a proper decision of the cause upon its merits may be rendered, upon the plaintiffs\u2019 paying all costs up to the time of amendment as required by law.\u201d\nThe court refused to take off the nonsuit, or permit the amendment.\nErrors assigned were (l) refusal to take off nonsuit; (2) refusal to permit amendment.\nIsaac OMsm, for appellants,\ncited: 1 Chit.
