        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe policy of insurance upon which this action is founded was issued by the defendant to the Phillipsburg Horse Car Co., the plaintiff, upon an application in writing in which the insured' set out the number of miles of road operated, the number of cars and horses in use, the number of trips per day, the schedule time and other matters intended to give the fullest information to the insurer of the character and extent of the risk, and ended with the statement: \u201c There is no information tending to vary the risk except as herein stated.\u201d\nThe insurance was \u201c against all liability for damages for or on account of fatal or non-fatal injuries suffered by any person or persons, other than employees of the insured, resulting from any and every accident to or caused by the cars, horses, plants, ways, works, machinery or appurtenances used in the business of the insured and described in the application herefor, which is hereby made a part of the policy.\u201d\nThe plaintiff owned three large omnibus sleighs, which were used in place of cars whenever the tracks were obstructed by snow or ice. During some winters they were used for a few days only, during others for weeks, and occasionally for months. They bore the name of the company, and were a part of its appliances for transportation. No mention of these was made in the application for insurance. The recovery against the car company was for injuries sustained by a passenger by the up-' setting of one of these sleighs, and the only question we need \u25a0 now consider is whether the accident for which indemnity is claimed is within the terms of the contract.\nThe verdict could have been properly rendered, andean now be sustained, only upon the ground that the contract of insur- \u2022 anee covered the use of other means of transportation than those mentioned in the application, and was against all risks incident to the general business of the company. The learned judge before whom the case was tried entertained this view, and in a charge in which the merit of clear and distinct statement is conspicuous, instructed the jury that: \u201c The words \u2018 described in the application herefor,\u2019 limiting the liability of the company, do not apply to the machinery, appliances, plant, horses, cars, etc., described in the application of insurance, but they apply to the business of the insured \u2018 described in the application herefor,\u2019 and therefore mean more than accidents, etc., occurring by the use of the property which is described in the application.\u201d\nThis view was based upon the construction of the contract and the fact, of which there was evidence, that sleighs were at times used by street railroad companies in conducting their business in the section of country in which the plaintiff\u2019s road was operated.\nThis view does not seem to us to be correct. The words of the policy limit the insurance to indemnity from liability for damages on account of injuries \u201c resulting from any and every accident to or caused by the horses, cars, plant, ways, works, machinery or appliances used in the business of the insured and described in the application.\u201d The insurance is against ' accidents caused by certain things used in the business and described in the application, not things used in the business which is described in the application.\nThere was testimony that for some years the car company had used sleighs when its tracks were obstructed by snow or ice, and that their use was customary under the same circumstances in neighboring towns ; but it also appeared that the use of sleighs was restricted to that section of country, and that it was only one of the ways in common use of overcoming the difficulties caused by snow and ice. The testimony was far short of establishing a use so general that the parties would be presumed to have taken it into consideration in entering into a contract.\nThe plaintiff was incorporated as a horse car company, and as such had constructed and was operating a street railway by horse power. The use of any other vehicle than a horse car was not authorized by its charter, and could be justified only as a means of overcoming a temporary interruption of its operation resulting from an emergency. The policy by its terms was based upon statements made in the application, which were to be considered as warranties, and it was restricted to injuries caused by or to certain enumerated ways, means and appliances used in the business and described in the application.\nThe defendants would not have been liable under the terms of the policy if the motive power had been changed by the use of steam or electricity instead of horses, and we are not able to see that the result is different when one kind of vehicle is substituted for another.\nThis is not the case of the temporary use of another means of transportation upon a part of the line made necessary by reason of the accidental destruction of ears, tracks or bridges, nor of the use of plows or sweepers to clear the track; but it was an entire abandonment during portions of the winter season of the use of the road as a horse railroad, and the substitution of a distinct and different mode of transportation. Whether the risk would be increased or diminished would depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, but it is evident that the risk in the use of sleighs differs from the risk in the use of cars. It includes the danger of upsetting, the chances of collision with other vehicles, the liability to loss of control of the horses\u2014 risks which are minimized in the use of street cars. The conditions from which accidents would probably result in the use of sleighs differ from those from which they are likely to happen in the use of cars ; and whether the difference is great or small it is for the insurer to decide whether he will accept the risk.\nWe are therefore of opinion that the sixth point, asking for a peremptory instruction for the defendant, should have been affirmed; and as this sustains the eighth assignment of error it is unnecessary to notice the other assignments.\nThe judgment is reversed.",

If the estimate is in excess of the actual earnings, an allowance will be made pro rata upon the renewal of the risk. If the estimate is too low, the assured will pay to the company an additional premium, sufficient to carry the risk for the year.\n\u201cThe risk commences at noon, this 26th day of July, 1892.\n\u201c Agent, N. H. Messenger. Signed, A. D. Chidsey, Sec.\u201d\nThe material provisions of the policy were as follows :\n\u201c Common Carrier\u2019s Liability Policy.\n\u201c In consideration of the warranties made in the application for this policy, and of one hundred and five dollars, The Fidelity & Casualty Co. of New York, hereinafter called the company,\n\u201c Does hereby insure Phillipsburg Horse Car Co. of Phillips-burg, in the county of-, and state of New Jersey, hereinafter called the assured, for the term of twelve months, beginning on the 26th day of July, 1892, at twelve o\u2019clock noon, and ending on the 26th day of July, 1898, at twelve o\u2019clock noon, standard time.\n\u201c 1. Against all liability for damages on account of fatal or non-fatal injuries suffered by any person or persons, other than employees of the assured, resulting from any and every accident to or caused by the cars, horses, plants, ways, works, machinery or appliances used in the business of the assured, and described in the application herefor, which is hereby made a part of this policy.\n\u201c 2. The company\u2019s liability for a casualty resulting in injuries to or the death of one person is limited to five thousand dollars ($5,000) ; and, subject to the same limit for each person, its gross liability for a casualty resulting in injuries to or the death of several persons is ten thousand dollars. \u201d\n\u201c 6. The employment of any person under twenty-one years of age by the insured shall render this policy void so far as a claim under it may arise by any accident which comes about through any such person, and the same shall apply to claims-arising through the tortious acts of any of the insured\u2019s, em* ployees. Nor shall the company be liable for any injuries which-may happen because of an invasion, insurrection, riot or-civil-commotion, or any military or usurping power, nor for any damages caused by the explosion of any steam boiler or boilers, or by fire.\u201d\n\u201c10. This policy shall continue during the period stated: in it, the estimated traffic earnings being the basis for the premium charge for the period stated. If the amount of gross annual traffic earnings exceeds the amount stated in the policy, the insured shall pay the company an additional premium, calculated on such additional gross traffic earnings received, at the rate of the premium stated in this policy. If the estimated amount of the gross annual traffic earnings shall not have been received within the period of this insurance, a proper proportion of the premium paid shall be allowed on the next renewal of the policy.\n\u201c 11. The company\u2019s officers shall have the right at all reasonable times to inspect the boobs of the assured so far as they relate to traffic earnings, and also to inspect the cars, horses, plants, ways, works, machinery and appliances used in his business.\u201d\nPlaintiff was obliged to pay two thousand and seventy dollars ($2,070) to Elizabeth Price for damages for personal injuries received by her from the upsetting of a large omnibus sleigh in which she was a passenger.\nPlaintiff showed, under objection and exception, that in the neighboring towns of Easton and Allentown sleighs were used when tracks were obstructed by snow and ice. The admission of this evidence was assigned for error. Defendant\u2019s evidence tended to show that sleighs were not used in the city of New York, or generally in the United States, and that tracks were cleared by snow plows, or were swept.\nDefendant\u2019s point was among others as follows:\n\u201c 6. Under all the evidence in the case the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: I deny this point because of my direction that, under all the evidence, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d [8]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $2,108.81.\njError assigned was among others (8) instruction, quoting it.\nW. S. KirJcpatriek, for appellant. \u2014\nThe accident for which indemnity was claimed was not within the terms or scope of the policy: Parish v. Wheeler, 22 N. Y. 494.\nWhen the policy is specific as to the subject-matter of the \u25a0risk it cannot be extended by implication, nor is evidence ad-missible to show that the parties intended to have it cover matters not specified: Wood on Fire Insurance, 2d ed. 137.\nAll conditions involving forfeitures as well as exemptions \u2022are to be construed strictly against the insurer and most favorably to the insured. Yet the language of the contract is to be .construed as a whole, is to receive a reasonable interpretation, \u25a0and the risk is not to be extended beyond what is fairly within the terms of the policy : Duran v. Ins. Co., 63 Vt. 437 ; 25 Am. St. R. 774; Wood, Fire Ins., 2d ed. 137, 179; Hare v. Barstow, 8 Jur. 928; Leibenstein v. Ins. Co., 45 Ill. 303; Joel v. Harvey, 5 W. R. 488; Ins. Co. v. Updegraff, 40 Pa. 311; Ins. Co. v. Arthur, 30 Pa. 315; Ins. Co. v. Lenheim, 89 Pa. 497.\nSo clear is it that a sleigh is not a street car, and involves very different elements of danger and risk, that the court, upon plaintiff\u2019s own showing, should have instructed the jury that there was a breach of the warranties which were the considerations for the policy: Rickards, Ins. \u00a7 52; 1 Biddle, Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 548, 557; Day v. Ins. Co., 52 Me. 60; Ins. Co. v. Horan, 89 Pa. 438; Ins. Co. v. Arthur, 30 Pa. 315; Ins. Co. v. Huntzinger, 98 Pa. 41.\nUsage and custom cannot be proven to contravene a rule of law nor to alter or contradict the express or implied terms of a contract free from ambiguity, nor to make the legal rights and liabilities of the parties to a compact other than they are by the terms of the contract: Hopper v. Sage, 112 N. Y. 530; 8 Am. St. R. 771; Hartman v. Ins. Co., 21 Pa. 466 ; Ins. Co. v. Gruver, 100 Pa. 266; Rogers, Exp. Test., 2d ed. 245-254.\nS. J. Steele, Russell G. Stewart with him, for appellee. \u2014\nThe policy must be liberally construed in favor of the insured, so as not to defeat, without a plain necessity, his claim to the indemnity which, in making the insurance, it was his object to procure. When the words are without violence susceptible of two interpretations, that which will sustain the claim and cover the loss must in preference be adopted: May, Ins. \u00a7 175; Ins. Co. v. Cropper, 32 Pa. 351; Burkhard v. Ins. Co., 102 Pa. 262; Humphreys v. Ins. Co., 139 Pa. 264; Wood, Fire Ins. \u00a7150; Ib., p. 145 ; Western & Atlantic Pipe Line v. Ins. Co., 145 Pa. 346; Phila. Tool Co. v. Ins. Co., 132 Pa. 236 ; Bole v. Ins. Co., 159 Pa. 53.\nThe true rule with reference to what constitutes such false statements as will constitute a breach of warranty in a policy of insurance is contained in the following cases: Dilleber v. Ins. Co., 69 N. Y. 256; Ins. Co. v. Grube, 6 Minn. 82; May, Ins. \u00a7 166; Liberty Hall Assn. v. Ins. Co., 7 Gray, 261; Meyers v. Ins. Co., 156 Pa. 420; Ins. Co. v. Gruver, 100 Pa. 267; Ins. Co. v. Losch, 109 Pa. 100; Rife v. Ins. Co., 115 Pa. 530; McKee v. Ins. Co., 135 Pa. 544; Ins. Co. v. Miller, 120 Pa. 504.\nWe introduced testimony to show, first, the general custom among street railway companies to use sleighs temporarily when their tracks were covered with snow and ice, and, secondly, to show that this use was so notorious in this section of the country that the insurance company must be presumed to have had knowledge: Mooney v. Ins. Co., 138 Mass. 375; Whitmarsh v. Ins. Co., 16 Gray, 361; Ins. Co. v. McLaughlin, 53 Pa. 485; Wood, Ins. \u00a7 530, p. 1177; Ins. Co. v. Gruver, 100 Pa. 267.\nMarch 19, 1894:"
