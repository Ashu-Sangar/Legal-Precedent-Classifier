L. 414, were extended so as to include guardians \u201cin the same manner as executors, administrators and assignees.\u201d The latter act therefore embraces the case of fraudulent guardians.\nCriminal law \u2014 Discharge from imprisonment \u2014 -Act of March 81, 1860.\nUnder the act of March 31, 1860, \u00a7 133, P. L. 414, which provides for the discharge of a defendant from imprisonment if an indictment shall not be presented \u201c to the grand jury at the next sessions,\u201d etc., the common pleas have no authority to discharge generally, but only \u201c from imprisonment.\u201d If it does not appear that the defendant has been imprisoned, the act does not apply.\nArgued Feb. 27, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 403, Jan. T., 1894, by-Samuel B. Wentzel, from order of C. P. Berks Co., Insolvent Docket, No. 243, refusing to discharge defendant, Samuel B. Wentzel, from custody.\nBefore Sterjrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for discharge under insolvent laws.\nFrom the paper-books it appeared that defendant was charged with embezzlement of funds received by him as guardian. Defendant presented his petition to be discharged under the insolvent laws. The court refused his petition, and remanded him for trial in the quarter sessions. The order was made on the Saturday before the June sessions of 1892 began. Defendant entered into a recognizance for his appearance, but on account of the alleged shortness of time no bill of indictment was found, and defendant was ordered to renew his recognizance. A true bill was found by the grand jury at September sessions, 1892. The case, however, was not tried at that sessions. Defendant was never imprisoned. Defendant renewed his application for a discharge.\nThe court, Ermentrout, P. J., refused the petition.\nError assigned was refusal of petition.\nGeorge J. Gross, for appellant,\ncited: Act of March 31,1860, \u00a7 133, Purd. Dig. 900; Blumer\u2019s Case, 86 Pa. 371.\nII, P. Keiser, F. K. Flood, district attorney, and J.
