    "head_matter": "Gernert v. Albert, Appellant.\nTrustee \u2014 Mortgage\u2014Scire facias \u2014 Affidavit of defence.\nA trustee who purchases land with trust funds as an investment for the \u2022estate, may give a mortgage to secure the balance of the purchase money, \u00a1although he has no express power to incumber under the instrument by which the trust was created.\nIt seems that a trustee, who is empowered to sell land and re-invest the proceeds in other real estate, may, upon such reinvestment, give a pur\u25a0chase money mortgage for a balance unpaid.\nArgued Feb. 12, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 179, July T., 1893, by \u2022 Abraham Albert, executor and trustee of the estate of Malin'\u25a0da Albert, from order of C. P. Lebanon Co., June T., 1893, No. 346, making absolute rule for judgment for want of sufficient \u25a0affidavit of defence, in favor of plaintiff, Mary Gernert.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\n' Rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence on sei. fa. sur mortgage.\nFrom the record it appeared that Malinda Albert, wife of Abraham Albert, died in 1879, seized of real estate and leaving to survive her, her husband and a number of children. By her will she gave all of her real estate to her husband, Abraham Albert, in trust for her children after his death. Testatrix also gave the executor \u201c authority to sell and dispose of the said real estate at such price or prices as he may deem best to the advantages of my (her) said children and to reinvest said proceeds in other real estate.\u201d The trustee sold the land of which testatrix died seized, for $4,750, and purchased the tract of plaintiff for the sum of $8^210, subject to a widow\u2019s dower of $890. He paid $2,210 in cash, and gave a purchase money mortgage for balance of $1,000, being the mortgage in suit. The deed was executed on April 2, 1884, and the mortgage on April 10, 1884. Both were recorded on April 10,1884.\nDefendant filed an affidavit of defence in which he averred that, under the will of his wife, he had no authority to execute the mortgage, and that it was irregular, inoperative and void as against the trust estate.\nThe court entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, in the following opinion by McPherson, J.:\n\u201c This is a scire facias upon a purchase money mortgage, and the defence is that the.mortgage is not a lien upon the land because the land was bought with trust funds and therefore became trust property the very instant the deed was delivered, passing at once beyond the power of the trustee to incumber it, even for the purchase money.\n\u201c It is no doubt true that, if a trustee has already received the legal title to land belonging to the trust, he may not after-wards incumber it, unless empowered by a court, or expressly or impliedly authorized by the instrument creating the trust. But to say, as is now said, that if a trustee lawfully uses $2,000 of trust funds to buy a farm worth $3,000, he cannot bind the land by a mortgage for the balance of the purchase money unless he has received express authority to incumber, is a proposition which does not commend itself either to the reason or to \u2022the sense of fairness. In such a purchase, the trustee really buys no more than he pays for; in form he receives the whole legal title, but his actual interest in the land is only what remains after he pays to the vendor from tima to time the annual value of the mortgage. In substance the vendor continues to be a part owner of the land; he did own the whole of it, and while he transferred the legal title with one hand, he took back a real, definite interest with the other, so that it may truthfully be said that at no point of time was his grasp so far relaxed as to enable the trust to seize what it did not buy and never was intended to have.\n\u201cIndeed, another fact in the transaction before us shows plainly how untenable is the defendant\u2019s position. The deed for the land (referred to in his affidavit) is made expressly subject to a widow\u2019s dower of $890. Surely he does not contend that the title passed to the trust free of this incumbrance, and yet, if it did not so pass, it is hard to give any reason why the vendor might not refuse to sell except subject to a second incumbrance. If the first was superior to the trust, why is not the second ? In truth the transaction was a unit, the vendor saying, \u2018 I will transfer the whole legal title to you on condition that you pay me a certain sum of money, and take the land subject to the dower which is now upon it, and subject also to my claim of $1,000 for unpaid purchase money,\u2019 and the vendee saying, \u2018I accept these terms.\u2019 How can the latter repudiate one term of this contract on the pretence that part of it took effect, and part of it did not.\n\u201c In fact, the defendant did not offer any argument in support of his position, but contented himself with citing Wilhelm v. Folmer, 6 Pa. 296, as a decisive authority in his favor. The syllabus of that case is imperfect and conveys a wrong impression. Neither is the case well reported, but the facts, so far as they can be gathered, present a situation very different from the one before'us. There, the trust was created by an instrument to which the vendor and vendee were parties, and therefore the vendor knew the terms of the trust aud the powers of the trustee. Here, the trust is created by a will of which the vendor is not averred to have had any knowledge ; the vendor did not formally convey the land to be held in trust; and we are apparently asked to assume that the vendor knew of the trust and knew that the trust funds were being used, merely because the vendee is described in the. deed as \u2018 executor and trustee under the last will and testament of Malinda Albert.\u2019 It would have been easy to aver the vendor\u2019s knowledge of these facts; but, as the case stands, the vendor may as readily have supposed that the vendee (who is the father of the cestuis que trustent) was applying his individual money to the purchase, and was thus enlarging the trust estate of his children. This defect in the affidavit is serious, and is enough in itself to distinguish the case from Wilhelm v. Folmer.\n\u201c But there are other differences quite as important. There, the deed was made to the trustee on Feb. 11th, but he did not give the judgment in controversy until the 18th of that month, and it was not entered until the 25th. Being a judgment, and not a mortgage, this unexplained delay broke the continuity of the transaction, (Love v. Jones, 4 Watts, 465; Jacobs\u2019s Appeal, 23 Pa. 477; Snyder\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 477,) thus bringing the case within the principle of Kauffelt v. Bower, 7 S. & R. 64. Moreover, while the deed to Wilhelm seems to have been in trust, the judgment which he gave appears to have been in his individual name, and this (it is said by the court on p. 301) was the true agreement of the parties. Mr. Justice Bell says:\n\u2018 By the articles stipulating the terms of the purchase the vendor agreed to accept Samuel\u2019s judgment note, as it is called, to secure payment of the balance of the purchase money, which created a mere personal obligation binding the obligor.\u2019 An effort was made to modify this agreement by proof of an \u2018understanding\u2019 that the land was to be bound, but (the court goes on to say), \u2018Were it even conceded that such a parol understanding, if properly had, could be made effective to charge the trust estate with the lien of the judgment, there is nothing in the case showing such agreement by persons entitled to make it.\u2019\n\u201c In the. case before us, the incumbrance is by a mortgage specifically pledging the land, and not by judgment. The mortgage is made upon the same title conveyed by the deed, whatever that title may be; it is expressly declared to be for purchase money; it was made only a few days after the deed, and both were recorded on the same day only a week after the title passed, and thus the continuity of the transaction is undoubted: Act of 1820, \u00a7 1, 7 Sm. L. 303. A vendor can do no more than this to show his purpose not to let go his hold upon so much of his land as he has not been paid for; and in our opinion this is enough to bind the land, even against a trustee who is buying the land in the exercise of his trust, although he may not have an express power to incumber.\n\u201c There is, however, another ground on which this affidavit may be fairly declared insufficient. The will of Malinda Albert devised to the trustee certain land in trust, and empowered him to sell it \u2018 at such price or prices as he may deem best to the advantages of my said children, and to re-invest said proceeds in other real estate. . . .\u2019 This power to\u2018re-in vest\u2019may with great propriety be held to authorize impliedly the mortgage in question. The power to reinvest is general; the trustee is not restricted to the purchase of another piece of land precisely equal in value to the price which he may receive for the farm devised; and if he may buy a somewhat more valuable property, in the belief that the purchase is judicious, he must have the power to pledge the land for the payment of the surplus. That the trust may keep the land without paying for it \u2014and if the mortgage had been for the whole purchase money, the defence would be equally good or equally bad \u2014 is a proposition which can hardly hope to be received with favor before any tribunal, and no court administering equity will accede to it unless compelled to do so by some rigid rule of law or by considerations of public policy.\u201d\nError assigned was above order.\nBassler Boyer, for appellant,\ncited: Whitely v.
