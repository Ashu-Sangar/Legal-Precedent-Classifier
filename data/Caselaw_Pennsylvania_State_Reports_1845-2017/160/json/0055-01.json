Butterworth.\nCorporations \u2014 Acceptance of constitution by accepting benefit of future legislation \u2014 Cumulative voting \u2014 Quo warranto \u2014 Act of May 20, 1891.\nAVhere the charter of a corporation granted prior to the constitution of 1874 provided that salaried officers should not be elected directors, the fact that after the passage of the act of May 20, 1891, P. L. 101, which permitted such election, salaried officers were elected directors, does not make the corporation subject to the provision of the constitution of 1874, relating to cumulative voting.\nSubmitted Jan. 26, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 18, Jan. T., 1894, by Commonwealth ex rel. Henry Fernberger, from order of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., March T., 1898, No. 189, discharging rule to show cause why writ of quo warranto against James Butter-worth should not be granted.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for quo warranto.\nFrom the petition and answer it appeared that at a meeting of the stockholders of the Fire Association of Philadelphia, the relator cumulated his votes, thereby giving him the highest number cast for the position of director. Thirteen directors were to be elected, and a ticket containing thirteen names, not including the relator\u2019s, received a smaller number of votes, James Butterworth being the lowest.\nThe Fire Association of Philadelphia was incorporated by-various acts of assembly, all prior in date to the adoption of the constitution of 1874. By its original charter no salaried officer was eligible to the position of director, but whether this had been changed by the supplements was disputed. On May 2Q, 1891, an act was passed authorizing salaried officers of private or business corporations to serve as directors. On Jan. 8,1892, the Fire Association elected as directors two who had been salaried officers the previous year, and who, the answer averred, \u201c were afterwards elected to salaried offices,\u201d by the directors, on the same day. Relator claimed that the action of the association involved an acceptance of the constitution of 1874, so as to give him the privilege of cumulating his votes under art. 16, \u00a7 4.\nRule for writ discharged. The\u2019 relator thereupon appealed.\nError assigned was above order.\nJames W. M. Newlin, for appellant,\ncited : Acts of March 27, 1820, P. L. 108; April 3, 1833, \u00a7 18, P.
