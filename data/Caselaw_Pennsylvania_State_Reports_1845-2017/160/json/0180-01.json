        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe assignment of error in this ease is to the refusal of the court to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nThe plaintiffs leased to Albert G. Smalley a property in Boston, Massachusetts, for the term of five years, commencing June 1,1886. The lease contained a covenant for the payment of the rent and \u201c also the taxes and water taxes which may be payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term.\u201d The plaintiffs paid the taxes assessed May 1,1886. The lessee paid for the four years following, but, not for the fifth. This action is to recover of the defendant,' who was surety on the lease, the taxes assessed May 1,1891, and paid by the plaintiffs after the expiration of the term.\nIt is not claimed that the lessee was bound to pay more than five years\u2019 taxes. The contention on the part of the plaintiffs is that under the laws of Massachusetts the lessee was not bound to pay the taxes for the first year of his lease, they having been assessed before the commencement of his term, but was bound for the last year\u2019s taxes, assessed before its end.\nIn support of this contention it is averred in the statement that \u201cthe said lease was made and executed in Boston, and its covenants were to be performed there, and it was therefore subject to the laws of Massachusetts, under which a tenant who covenanted by his lease to pay the taxes levied and assessed during his term is liable for all taxes levied and assessed during such term. The said Smalley did not pay, and was not bound to pay, the taxes assessed May 1,1886.\u201d\nIn answer to this averment it is stated in the affidavit of defence that \u201c the said Albert Gr. Smalley, lessee, did not covenant to pay to the plaintiffs the taxes levied and assessed on the demised premises, the words which import such covenant having been scored out in the contract and intended to be eliminated. The taxes now claimed for were not payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term, but were for taxes payable from the property for the year ending May 1, 1892, covering but one month of the lease.\u201d\nIt is not denied that the copy of the lease filed is a true copy, and the court was not informed as to what words were \u201c scored out and intended to be eliminated,\u201d but only as to the defendant\u2019s understanding of the effect of the erasure of certain words which are not given. The assertion that the taxes were not payable for or during the term, with the qualification that they were for the year ending May 1, 1892, is not in denial of the plaintiff\u2019s statement, but is in entire harmony with it, and leaves untouched the essential averment, that under the facts stated? and the written contract, and the law, the defendant is liable.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s case rests upon the averment of the contract .and of its meaning and effect under the laws of Massachusetts, by which it is to be interpreted. The affidavit denies neither the contract as' set out nor the law as stated, and is therefore insufficient.\nIt is unnecessary to more than refer to the remaining grounds of defence. The mere giving of time to the tenant for the payment of taxes did not release the defendant from his obligation, and as this is a contract of suretyship no previous demand of the principal was necessary.\nThe judgment of the court is reversed, and it is now ordered that the record be remitted to the court of common pleas, with directions to enter judgment against the defendant for such sums as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to the court why such judgment should not be entered.",

Synnott.\nLandlord and tenant \u2014 Suretyship\u2014Payment of taxes \u2014 Lease\u2014Alteration \u2014Affidavit of defence.\nPlaintiffs leased to a tenant property in Massachusetts for five years from June 1, 1886. The lessee covenanted to pay the taxes \u201c which may be payable for or in respect of the said premises, or any part thereof, during the said term.\u201d Plaintiffs paid the taxes assessed May 1, 1886; the lessee paid the four years following, but not the fifth. Plaintiffs paid the taxes for the fifth year, and then brought suit against defendant, the tenant\u2019s surety, to recover the amount last paid. Plaintiffs averred in their statement that in Massachusetts taxes were assessed on May 1st, and that 'under the lease, which was executed in Massachusetts, the tenant was bound to pay the taxes levied and assessed during his term. The defendant in his affidavit of defence averred that \u201c the lessee did not covenant to pay to the plaintiffs the taxes levied and assessed on the demised premises, the words which import such covenant having been scored out in the contract and intended to be eliminated. The taxes now claimed for were not payable for or in respect'of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term, but were for taxes payable from the property for the year ending May 1, 1892, covering but one month of the lease.\u201d The affidavit did not deny that the copy of the lease filed was a true copy, and it did not specify what words were \u201c scored out and intended to be eliminated.\u201d Held, that the affidavit of defence was insufficient to prevent judgment.\nSuretyship \u2014 Extension of time \u2014 Payment of taxes \u2014 Previous demand.\nWhere a tenant has covenanted to pay taxes, the mere'giving of time to him for the payment of his taxes does not release the tenant\u2019s surety from his obligation; and, in such ease, where the landlord has paid the taxes, no previous demand on the tenant is necessary before bringing suit against the surety.\nArgued Jan. 2, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 200, Jan. T., 1898, by plaintiffs, John W. Haynes et al., from order of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., March T., 1892, No. 200, discharging rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nRule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence in assumpsit against surety of tenant to recover taxes which the tenant had covenanted to pay.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 statement was as follows:\n\u201c The plaintiffs bring this suit to recover from the defendant the sum of $308.70, with interest from Oct. 31, 1891, upon the following facts\n\u201c The plaintiffs, with the late Oliver Ditson, who were trading as Oliver Ditson & Co., of Boston, Massachusetts, on or about January 31, 1886, leased to Albert G. Smalley a certain piece of partnership land in the said city of Boston on North street, more particularly described in the lease (a true copy of which is hereunto annexed), from the first day of June, 1886, for the term of five years. The rent agreed upon by the said lease was $1,764 a year, payable in monthly installments, and the said lessee, Albert G. Smalley, covenanted to pay, in addition to the rent aforesaid, all \u2018 the taxes and water taxes payable on said premises or any part thereof during the said term.\u2019\n\u201c The said Albert G. Smalley, on the expiration of the term of the lease, June 1, 1891, had paid all the rent aforesaid, and all the taxes, except the tax which was levied and assessed on the said leased premises on the first day of May of said year 1891, by the city of Boston, amounting to $308.70, whereupon the plaintiffs, on October 31,1891, were obliged by law to pay, and did pay the said tax of $308.70 to the said city of Boston. The said lease was made and executed in Boston, Massachusetts, for property situated in Boston, and its covenants were to be performed there, and it was therefore subject to the laws of Massachusetts, under which a tenant who contracts by his lease to pay the taxes on the leased property during his term is liable for all taxes levied and assessed during such term. The said Smalley did not pay and was not bound to pay the taxes assessed May 1, 1886.\n\u201c The defendant in this suit, Thomas W. Synnott, bound himself for the punctual payment of the rent and taxes reserved in the said lease by writing annexed to said lease, of which the following is a true copy:\n\u201c \u2018 In consideration of the execution of the preceding lease, and of one dollar to me paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, I do hereby guarantee to the said Oliver Ditson & Company the true and punctual payment of the rent and taxes reserved at the times mentioned, and in default thereof I promise to pay the same on demand,\u2019 (with signature, etc.)\n\u201c The defendant, Thomas W. Synnott, thereby became liable for the payment of the said \u00cd308.70, which the said lessee had neglected and refused to pay and still refuses to pay. The said Thomas W. Synnott, defendant, has often been requested to pay said sum in accordance with his said undertaking, but has always refused and still refuses to pay said sum or any part thereof, and the same is now unpaid, wherefore the plaintiff brings this suit and craves judgment for the amount as aforesaid.\u201d\nThe copy of the lease filed showed a covenant for the payment of the \u201c taxes and water taxes which may be payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during the said term.\u201d\nThe original lease, produced on the argument in the court below, read, \u201c all taxes and water taxes [and assessments whatsoever, whether in the nature of taxes now in being or not] which may be payable,\u201d etc, the part in brackets being erased.\nThe affidavit of defence averred:\n\u201c 1. The said Albert G. Smalley, lessee, did not covenant to pay to the plaintiffs the taxes \u2018 levied and assessed \u2019 on the- demised premises \u2014 the words which import such covenant having been scored out in the contract and intended to be eliminated.\n\u201c The taxes now claimed for were not \u2018 payable for or in respect of the said premises or any part thereof during said term,\u2019 but were for taxes payable from the property for the year ending May 1, 1892, covering but one month of the term of the lease.\n\u201c 2. I am informed and believe that after the making of the said lease the said plaintiffs and the said Smalley entered into an agreement unknown to me by which the lessee was given time for the paj^ment of the taxes, and that by reason of such agreement the taxes which should have been collected at the proper time are now sought to be recovered against me under my contract of suretyship.\n\u201c 3. I believe that no demand has been made upon the said Smalley, the lessee, for the payment of the said taxes. I have been advised and upon such advice aver that the said Smalley was obliged by the terms of his lease to pay the taxes on the property from June 1, 1886, to the end of his term of tenancy, including eleven-twelfths of the taxes assessed for that year.\n\u201c 4. I am informed and believe that the said Smalley has means and property within the jurisdiction of the courts of Massachusetts which should be exhausted before I am called on to pay any rent or taxes under the lease.\u201d\nRule for judgment discharged.
