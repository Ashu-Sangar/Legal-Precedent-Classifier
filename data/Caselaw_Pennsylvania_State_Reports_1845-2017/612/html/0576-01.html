During the penalty phase of his trial, Appellant sought to establish the statutory mitigating circumstance of extreme mental or emotional disturbance by presenting the testimony of a psychologist, Vincent Berger, Ph.D. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2). The jury rejected Appellant’s claim of a mitigating circumstance, found one aggravating circumstance, and returned a verdict of death.</p>

Appellant claimed that trial counsel had presented Dr. Berger’s testimony even though counsel was aware that Dr. Berger’s evaluation of Appellant had been deficient because he had not tested him for organic brain damage. Appellant alleged that he suffers from a cognitive disorder, such as frontal lobe syndrome, that would have been identified by either appropriate testing or a psychiatrist’s examination, and that evidence of the disorder would have mitigated his offense. He also alleged that Dr. Berger had not performed appropriate testing even though he recognized that Appellant’s mental health history suggests that Appellant has such a cognitive disorder. To support these claims, Appellant proffered the testimony of other experts.</p>

The prosecution also asked Appellant to waive psychologist-client privilege with respect to Dr. Berger’s testimony. When Appellant refused, the Commonwealth asked the PCRA court not only to declare the privilege waived, but also to permit it to hire Dr. Berger as its expert for the PCRA proceedings. The PCRA court granted the motion, and Appellant filed a notice of appeal to this Court. <em>Cf. </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9546(d) (providing this Court with exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from final PCRA orders in capital cases). We ordered briefing and oral argument on whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal as a collateral appeal under Pa.R.A.P. 313, and we now conclude that the exercise of jurisdiction is proper. On the merits, we hold that although the Commonwealth may subpoena Dr. Berger to testify as a fact witness, it may not hire him as its expert for the PCRA proceedings.</p>

Appellant slashed Martin’s throat, killing him. After Appellant was found guilty of first-degree murder, Dr. Berger testified during the penalty phase that Appellant had been born prematurely and was delivered using forceps. Dr. Berger said that after spending three months in the hospital, Appellant was placed in foster homes until he was a year and a half old, when he was placed with the family that later adopted him. Dr. Berger noted that Appellant’s records showed that Appellant had delayed motor development and had displayed an emotional disturbance from an early age. He opined that Appellant’s difficulties were characteristic of children who had been profoundly neglected at an early age, which he suggested might have happened to Appellant when he was in the hospital and then foster care. Notes of Testimony Penalty Phase, 10/8/97, at 4456-4458. Dr. Berger also opined that Appellant’s emotional disturbance might have been the result of brain damage from having been delivered with forceps. <em>Id. </em>at 4463. Dr. Berger said that “nowadays ... we would probably do [ ] neuropsychological testing on him and run an MRI or whatever” to determine if behavior problems in a child born using forceps were caused by brain damage. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, he would not say that any of Appellant’s adult behavior was related to brain damage, although he did testify that Appellant’s delayed development “does suggest that there was something wrong at the time.” <em>Id.</em>

Dr. Berger ultimately concluded that, to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, Appellant has been severely emotionally disturbed, bordering on psychotic, since infancy. <em>Id. </em>at 4541-4542; 4545. He elaborated that although Appellant does not behave in an emotionally disturbed way at all times, when something in the environment triggers him, the emotional disturbance “comes <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>out.” <em>Id. </em>at 4542. Dr. Berger noted that Appellant had been given slightly different diagnoses of mental illness throughout his life, but said that he had not diagnosed Appellant. <em>Id. </em>at 4544. He said that he did not do so because the purpose of a diagnosis is to give a shorthand explanation of a person’s mental illness. He said that because he was going to testify at length about the behaviors demonstrating Appellant’s disturbance, he had seen no reason to make a diagnosis. <em>Id. </em>at 4545. Dr. Berger opined that although Appellant knows right from wrong, his severe emotional disturbance might have in part caused him to overreact to the victim’s behavior, be unable to control himself, and attack and kill the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 4548-4551.</p>

If the trial court refuses to make such a certification, the litigant can obtain review of that decision by filing a petition for review in the appropriate appellate court. Pa.R.A.P. 1311, note. However, the availability of such review insufficiently protects the privilege for the same reasons that an interlocutory appeal by permission is also not an adequate substitute for a right of interlocutory appeal. The appellate court could easily agree — perhaps not incorrectly in some cases — that the issue was not "controlling” or that its resolution would not end the litigation sooner.</p>

Appellant notes that the Commonwealth argued in the PCRA court that Appellant waived "doctor-patient” privilege by challenging Dr. <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>Berger’s performance. Appellant claims that, in so doing, the Commonwealth itself waived any argument that he waived <em>psychologist-client </em>privilege. We disagree. The Commonwealth's mislabeling of the applicable privilege led no one to focus on the wrong issue. Although it used the wording of the Commonwealth's proposed order, which likewise referred to the "doctor-patient” privilege, the PCRA court evidently understood that it was the psychologist-client privilege that was in issue, as it discussed the correct privilege in its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion. Appellant likewise was not confused. He raised the question of the Commonwealth’s alleged waiver for the first time in his Reply Brief in this Court, evidently not having noticed the mistake earlier.</p>
