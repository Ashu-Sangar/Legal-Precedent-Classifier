Five of the victims were children who shared the unlucky fate of having George Banks as their father: Montanzima Banks (age 6), Kissmayu Banks (age 5), Bowendy Banks (age 4), Mauritania Banks (age 1), and Foraroude Banks (age 1). Four additional victims were unfortunate to have been Banks’ current or former <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>girlfriends: Susan Yuhas (age 23), who resided with him, Dorothy Lyons (age 29), who sometimes resided with him, Regina Clemens (age 29), who had resided with him until about two weeks before the murders, and Sharon Mazzillo (age 24), a former girlfriend. Three other victims were murdered because of their relationships to Banks’ girlfriends or ex-girlfriends: Scott Mazzillo (age 7), the nephew of Sharon Mazzillo; Alice Mazzillo (age 47), the mother of Sharon Mazzillo; and Nancy Lyons (age 11), the daughter of Dorothy Lyons. The thirteenth and final murder victim was an unlucky passerby. Banks murdered teenaged Raymond Hall, who saw Banks as he was leaving his residence (presumably after killing eight people), and also shot and seriously wounded the teenaged James Olson, who was with Hall. All of the victims, save one, were under the age of thirty, and seven of the victims were under the age of twelve. The factual circumstances surrounding the murders are set forth in detail in this Court’s opinion, denying Banks’ direct appeal from the sentences of death and related crimes. <em>See Commonwealth v.

On December 1, 2004, we issued a <em>per curiam </em>order assuming plenary jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. § 726, stayed the imminent execution, and directed the trial court to “hold a competency hearing expeditiously in accordance with <em>Ford v.

Many of the delays involved maneuvers by federal counsel seeking to burden the Commonwealth’s ability to have its mental health experts examine Banks in order to prepare a case in rebuttal against counsel’s claim that Banks had become insane. These defense motions, which were not authorized by our order directing a competency hearing, caused delay in both proceedings before Conahan; and the motions and attendant delays continued following our most recent, third direction to hold an appropriate competency hearing. The competency question is important, but narrow, and it should have been resolved sooner. Following our review of the competency determination rendered by the Honorable Joseph M. Augello, this Court concludes that Banks presently is incompetent to be executed under the standards set forth in <em>Panetti </em>and <em>Ford. </em>As further <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>explained herein, we neither accept nor reject Judge Augello’s additional determination related to Banks’ competency to pursue clemency.

Conahan found that Banks was incompetent to be executed and to decide whether to seek clemency. The Commonwealth sought review of that determination. One of the Commonwealth’s primary complaints related to the trial court’s refusal to permit the Commonwealth’s expert to testify on the ground that defense counsel was not present during the expert’s interaction with Banks. This Court concluded that there was no precedent from this Court or the U.S. Supreme Court requiring defense counsel’s presence at a medical examination; we explained that the U.S. Supreme Court cases cited by counsel, <em>Ford </em>and <em>Estelle v.

Additionally, <em>Ford </em>itself provided no guidance on the subject, leaving it to the States to formulate their own procedures to review competency-to-be-executed questions as well as the substantive standards governing such review. Since that time, the High Court has at least clarified some of the outer parameters governing the process that is due when a colorable competency challenge is raised. <em>See, e.g., Panetti, </em>discussed <em>infra. </em>However, <em>Panetti </em>does not direct the specific vehicle for pursuing such relief and the question remains unanswered in Pennsylvania.

This initial delay was then compounded by the circumstances we have already summarized above concerning Judge Conahan and the piecemeal procedural motions and arguments forwarded by Banks’ counsel. This case demonstrates the need for rules that provide a workable framework for the presentation of <em>Ford </em>claims after a warrant for execution has been signed. Any such rules must account for expedited filings by the parties, a mechanism to screen for colorable claims, an accelerated hearing if a hearing is deemed necessary, procedures to account for the minimum due process requirements as most recently set forth in <em>Panetti, </em>and other adjustments that may emerge in future decisional law.</p>

Dr. O’Brien testified that Banks understands he is in prison, and that he is in prison for the multiple murders.

Both experts agreed that Banks was more communicative and his delusions seemed to be less prominent than in past examinations, indicating that his latest course of medication was effective. Turning to their specific testimony, Dr. Mechanick explained that Banks’ “racist” theory was a way of “providing a rational excuse or explanation for why he committed the crimes. He’s not — he’s not providing a response that is a delusional explanation ... his response indicates that he does have a sense of wrongfulness and is excusing it or explaining it for a rational reason.... ” Dr. Mechanick also explained that although there were two competing thoughts in Banks’ mind— the rational thought that he was going to be put to death and the delusional thought that the sentences were vacated— Banks showed an understanding that “he is involved in a process involving the death penalty; that it’s still ongoing. That it hasn’t simply, as we’ve heard from other testimony, been vacated.” Dr. Mechanick further testified that Banks’ belief that his sentences were vacated was an “unrealistic belief. It didn’t seem reasonable for him to believe in 2010, given what’s transpired since 2001, that his death sentence was currently vacated. And I do think there is a portion of him that has that unrealistic belief.... But ... he didn’t add anything of a delusional nature to explain why he would have been excused from the death penalty or why it would have been vacated.” Dr. Mechanick admitted that Banks was not delusion free, but explained that there is a “range of delusional — intensity of delusional belief and prevalence of delusional belief.... In Mr. Banks’ case, there’s been some improvement. He is not free of delusions. He still has them. And at times they’re more prominent and more intense than at other times, but they’re not there of equal intensity all the time.” <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>Thus, in Dr. Mechanick’s opinion, the delusions did not occupy “so much of the stage” as to prevent Banks from a rational understanding of the death sentence and the reasons for it.

He also had religious expressions that he’s been forgiven by God.” Like Dr. Mechanick, he acknowledged that Banks had “conflicting” thoughts, and explained that the delusions were the way in which Banks dealt with his situation, but further opined that he had rational thoughts and understood that the State had the right to execute him as a result of his crimes.

Dr. O’Brien testified to the interplay between the psychosis and cognitive awareness, explaining first that psychotic disorders do not impair cognitive function. In other words, people can simultaneously have both an active psychosis and an intact factual awareness of their circumstances and normally the psychosis and the factual appreciation are parallel. However, in this case, Banks’ “psychosis is intertwined with his appreciation of his factual circumstances, and it deprives him of having a rational understanding of his circumstances.” Dr. O’Brien reiterated that Banks had “an intact factual appreciation” of his conviction and that he is on death row, but then explained that, although “unusual,” Banks’ psychosis had become intertwined with the factual appreciation of his circumstances, rendering his understanding of the penalty and the reasons for it to be irrational. Dr. O’Brien also specifically addressed the Commonwealth’s experts’ testimony, opining that Dr. Mechanick’s analysis was “inadequate” and that Dr. Michals’ testimony was largely fact-focused and did not take into account whether Banks’ psycho<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>sis interferes with his rational understanding of the penalty.

Turning first to the law, Banks avers that the Commonwealth’s position mirrors that of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Panetti v. Quarterman. </em>Banks then argues that the High Court “condemned the Fifth Circuit’s approach” because it erroneously deemed Panetti’s delusional belief system irrelevant to the question of whether he had a rational understanding of his execution. <em>See </em>Banks’ Response to Commonwealth’s Exceptions, at 45-16 (discussing <em>Panetti, </em><a href="/us/551/0930-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="551 U.S. 930" data-case-ids="3573391" data-case-paths="/us/551/0930-01">551 U.S. at 949</a>, <a href="/us/551/0930-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="551 U.S. 930" data-case-ids="3573391" data-case-paths="/us/551/0930-01">127 S.Ct. 2842</a> (2007)).

Banks contests the Commonwealth’s request to adopt Dr. Mechanick’s direct testimony, by pointing out that much of it was undermined by his testimony on cross-examination. Furthermore, according to Banks, some of Dr. Mechanick’s testimony was contradicted by Dr. Michals, the Commonwealth’s own expert. Banks argues that Dr. Mechanick’s testimony erroneously adopts an absolutist view of competency and fails to consider how Banks’ delusional beliefs affect his rational understanding of the death penalty. As an example, Banks cites to Dr. Mechanick’s testimony that Banks’ belief that his sentences were vacated as “unreasonable” instead of “delusional.” <em>See </em>N.T., 493-94, quoted <em>supra. </em>In any event, according to Banks, Judge Augello’s findings were clearly supported by the defense experts, who consistently testified that Banks believes that his sentences have been vacated by God, Jesus, George Bush, or the Governor, and that any sentence of death currently imposed would be for reasons other than his murder convictions, <em>i.e., </em>a conspiracy based on racism or religious belief.</p>

Additionally, at least two of the defense experts suggested that Banks believes that the penalty is unrelated to the murders, and instead is part of a conspiracy on the part of the government.</p>

While we do not question that at some level Banks possesses a cognitive awareness of the simple fact of his prospective execution and the reasons for it, Judge Augello’s determination that Banks nevertheless is not competent to be executed applied the governing federal law as we understand it. Wdiat matters is that, while Banks may have a factual awareness of the death penalty and the reasons for it, as a result of his mental illness, Banks does not have a rational understanding of the death penalty or the reasons for it, as required by <em>Panetti. </em>Furthermore, there is no evidence that Judge Augello’s conclusion was otherwise manifestly unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious, or was motivated by partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill will. For these reasons, we conclude that Judge Augello did not abuse his discretion in finding that Banks was currently incompetent to be executed under the Eighth Amendment.</p>

Instead, the evidence showed that Banks was capable of factual responses as to many aspects of his life and death and communicated appropriately with all of the experts. Dr. O’Brien stated as much on direct examination when he <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>testified that, under his new medication regime, Banks was more cooperative and was able to communicate his symptoms better.

The supplemental order arose out of a separate action filed by Mary Yelland, Banks’ mother, in the Commonwealth Court, broadly challenging clemency proceedings in this Common<a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>wealth when an alleged incompetent person was involved.

You can’t do it because his sentence is not there. If he had a sentence and he believed that he was going to be sentenced to death, then he could initiate a clemency, but he can’t do it now because he says there is no need for it.” N.T., 391.</p>

Upon closer consideration, however, it is not apparent that this Court needs to, may, or should reach this issue. The question of clemency is primarily, if not exclusively, one for the Executive, not the courts. Indeed, the pardoning power arises within an article of the Pennsylvania Constitution enumerating the powers of the Executive. <em>See </em>Pa. Const, art. IV, § 9. Moreover, there is an executive process in place for consideration of such claims. <em>See </em>37 Pa.Code § 81.201-81.304. Notably, that process allows for clemency applications by certain third parties, including “a legal guardian, next friend or other person authorized by law to act on behalf of the applicant,” <em>id. </em>at § 81.282; thus, it is not apparent why competency would be a question. To our knowledge, no clemency process is underway. Given our finding of current incompetency for purposes of execution, the ripeness concerns, and the separation of powers concerns, we will not pass upon the question. Judge Augello’s findings on the question of clemency, therefore, stand as neither accepted nor rejected.</p>

Therefore, a State may require the petitioner to make a "substantial showing of insanity merely to trigger the hearing process” and the hearing process itself may be less formal so long as the State provides "an impartial officer or board that can receive evidence and argument from the prisoner's counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may differ from the State’s own psychiatric examination.” <em><a href="/us/477/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="477 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6208971" data-case-paths="/us/477/0399-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/477/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="477 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6208971" data-case-paths="/us/477/0399-01">at 426, 427</a>, <a href="/us/477/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="477 U.S. 399" data-case-ids="6208971" data-case-paths="/us/477/0399-01">106 S.Ct. 2595</a>. We have already rejected Banks’ various prior challenges to the process this Court has directed in this matter, noting that the restrictions counsel sought were unsupported by the governing case from the High Court which counsel cited. There has been no further challenge to the adequacy of the process provided in this case.</p>

The Court indicated that the prisoner made a "substantial showing" of incompetency and was thus entitled to an adequate means to prove his incompetency. In the <em>Panetti </em>Court’s view, the Texas court failed to afford the prisoner adequate process when it did not allow him to present his own expert, refused to transcribe the competency proceedings, conveyed false information to the prisoner, and provided at least one significant update to the State that it did not provide to the prisoner. <em>Panetti, </em><a href="/us/551/0930-01" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="551 U.S. 930" data-case-ids="3573391" data-case-paths="/us/551/0930-01">551 U.S. at 950-52</a>, <a href="/us/551/0930-01" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="551 U.S. 930" data-case-ids="3573391" data-case-paths="/us/551/0930-01">127 S.Ct. 2842</a>.</p>

Whether Banks has a rational understanding that death would result if he were executed is less clear as Dr. Michals testified that Banks understood that the current manner of execution is by lethal injection. Banks, however, also told Dr. Michals that before lethal injection the manner of execution was electrocution. Banks explained that under the former execution manner, he would not have died as a result of the electrocution, but would have been put to sleep, pronounced dead by a doctor, and set free in a different country. Thereafter Dr. Michals did not follow up on this delusional belief to determine whether Banks understood that his execution by lethal injection would result in his death or would result in a similar fate. N.T., 686-87; <em>see also </em>N.T., 29 (testimony of Dr. O'Brien repeating same delusional notion held by Banks that electrocution would have resulted in his removal from country instead of death).</p>

While all of the experts indicated that Banks was more communicative, cooperative, and better able to respond to questions under his new medications, the conclusions drawn from the "improvement” were a source of disagreement. The defense experts indicated that Banks' ability to communicate highlighted his symptoms even more, indicating that while he could initially respond to a question, when permitted to continue, he rambled incoherently, often diverting the conversation to religious conspiracy topics. Conversely, the Commonwealth’s experts attributed Banks’ increased ability to communicate and cooperation to the fact that his delusions had decreased and his mental condition had improved.</p>
