Dr. Gluckman disagreed, however, with Dr. Navarro’s identification of the source of the hepatitis.

      <em>Id. </em>at 15. He explained that “serum” hepatitis, now known as hepatitis B, is often contracted through contaminated needles. <em>Id. </em>Dr. Gluckman stated that hepatitis B and C, although distinct diseases, are transmitted in a similar manner, most commonly through needle-related drug use. <em>Id. </em>at 19.

      <em>Id. </em>He also explained that the timing of the development of cirrhosis was consistent with acquisition of hepatitis C in 1969 because the medical literature suggests that complications from the disease will not manifest for approximately thirty years. <em>Id. </em>at 21. Dr. Gluckman further opined that there were no occupational exposures that would have caused Decedent to acquire hepatitis C. <em>Id. </em>at 23.

Similarly, Dr. Gluckman acknowledged that none of Decedent’s physical examinations revealed indicia of intravenous drug use. <em>Id. </em>In fact, he admitted that there was no mention of intravenous drug use in Decedent’s medical records. <em>Id. </em>at 30. ■ Dr. Gluckman further recognized that hepatitis B is commonly spread through other means, including sexual contact, and that the word “serum” does not indicate that an injection was involved. <em>Id. </em>at 30, 47.</p>

The WCAB concluded that the WCJ should have sustained Appellant’s hearsay objection because Dr. Gluckman’s conclusion was based on the causation opinion of another physician who was not subject to cross-examination. The WCAB explained that pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 703,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Dr. Gluckman could rely on the facts contained in the note, i.e., that Decedent had hepatitis B and used drugs, but he could not rely on the conclusion contained therein, i.e., that the hepatitis B was acquired as a result of drug use, in the absence of other contemporaneous facts or data on which he could base an independent causation opinion.

Thus, it concluded that Dr. Gluckman’s testimony did not constitute competent evidence because it lacked a sufficient factual predicate.

The court concluded that Dr. Gluckman’s testimony “constituted substantial, competent evidence to rebut the statutory presumption.” <em>Id. </em>at 16. In so holding, the Commonwealth Court observed that Dr. Gluckman reviewed Decedent’s entire medical history and permissibly deduced that the note concerning “serum hepatitis from drug usage” indicated that Decedent contracted hepatitis C from contaminated needles prior to his employment as a firefighter. The court found that the record substantiated Dr. Gluckman’s finding that Decedent did not sustain a puncture wound in his professional capacity. Finally, the court observed that Dr. Gluckman persuasively explained that the progression of Decedent’s condition mirrored the normal time frame for hepatitis C patients who subsequently develop carcinoma. According to the Commonwealth Court, Dr. Gluckman drew upon numerous factors, including his own expertise, to opine with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Decedent’s condition stemmed from intravenous drug use.
