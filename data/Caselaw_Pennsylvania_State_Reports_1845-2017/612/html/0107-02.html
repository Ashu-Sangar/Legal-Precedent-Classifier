Each victim had been shot multiple times. <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>Sherri sustained five gunshot wounds, one of which was a shot to the chest that would have been fatal in a few minutes, and the last of which was an execution-style shot to the head that killed her instantly. Greg Inman had been shot four times, including one execution-style shot to the head.</p>
    <p id="b167-4" data-blocks='[["BL_167.4",167,[160,621,1151,731]]]'>The evidence demonstrated that the shooter gained entry by throwing a typewriter through a sliding glass door. An examination of the residence revealed multiple fired bullets and bullet fragments. There was blood throughout the living room and kitchen, where the victims were killed, including on the floors, walls, light switch, telephone, and sliding glass door. Additionally, blood was found on a washcloth and vanity surface in an upstairs bathroom. The state police collected blood evidence from the following locations in the victims’ home (which will collectively be referred to as the blood evidence): the sliding glass door; the refrigerator door; the kitchen floor; the bathroom vanity; a light switch; the living room floor; the stairs; the railing along the stairs; and a living room wall.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The Commonwealth’s sole direct evidence connecting Appellant to the murders was the testimony of Kim Ulrich. Mrs. Ulrich was Sherri’s friend and neighbor. She testified that she was awakened by the telephone at 2:24 a.m. on August 22, 1991, and when she picked up the receiver the caller said “call an ambulance — Terry shot Greg and me.” Mrs. Ulrich recognized the caller’s voice as Sherri Chamberlain’s. When Mrs. Ulrich asked “Sherri?” the caller failed to respond. Mrs. Ulrich explained that the telephone call lasted approximately 2.5 seconds, and she did not hear any background noise. She <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>further testified that she had spoken to Sherri on the telephone and face-to-face over 100 times within the last year and was certain the caller was Sherri. Mrs. Ulrich immediately told her husband about the telephone call. As Mrs. Ulrich called 911, Mr. Ulrich, a game warden, hurried to Sherri’s and Greg Inman’s residence, where he discovered the victims’ bodies about five minutes after the telephone call. As he drove to the residence, which was 150 yards from his own home, Mr. Ulrich did not hear any gunshots or see anyone leaving the residence. According to his subsequent trial testimony, when he arrived at the home he could smell gunpowder in the air. He observed the telephone handset on the floor next to Sherri. Sometime after the state police and the coroner arrived at the scene to investigate, the coroner used the telephone that was next to Sherri’s body, thus destroying any evidence that could have been obtained from the telephone’s redial function, which, as explored later herein, became relevant to Appellant’s defense. Police immediately apprehended Appellant at his home at 3:55 a.m., where they called him on the telephone, asked him to walk to the end of the driveway to surrender, and arrested him.</p>
    <p id="b168-4" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[276,1470,1153,683]]]'>A criminal complaint was filed against Appellant alleging that he forcibly broke into the victims’ home and murdered them by inflicting multiple gunshot wounds. On August 28, 1991, Appellant sought a dismissal of the complaint at a preliminary hearing because the Commonwealth failed to allege all of the essential elements of the crime; specifically, that the victims were human beings. Curiously, the district justice agreed with Appellant and dismissed the complaint. The Commonwealth immediately re-arrested Appellant. At a preliminary hearing held on September 6, 1991, the district justice granted Appellant’s demurrer, finding that the Commonwealth failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, and again dismissed the complaint.</p>

On May 11, 1993, the Bradford County Investigating Grand Jury recommended that Appellant be charged with two counts of <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>criminal homicide and one count each of burglary, criminal trespass, and possessing instruments of crime. Accordingly, on May 19, 1993, another criminal complaint was issued against Appellant, premised on the same conduct alleged in the prior two complaints and containing statutory references to the specific crimes with which the grand jury recommended Appellant be charged. Appellant was promptly arrested for the third time.</p>
    <p id="b169-4" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[164,773,1153,1261]]]'>On March 25, 1994, about a month before trial was scheduled to begin, the trial court conducted a pre-trial conference at which defense counsel learned for the first time that although the police had requested DNA analysis of the blood evidence, such analysis had never been conducted. Appellant requested a continuance in order to pursue independent DNA testing of the blood evidence, which he surmised would take about six weeks. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. Opinion, Oct. 7, 1996, at 45. The Commonwealth responded that any blood evidence that was sent to the lab for blood typing was probably destroyed. The trial court denied Appellant’s request, concluding that there was adequate time for Appellant to conduct DNA testing before the start of trial. <em><a href="/a2d/731/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="731 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11666508,56854" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0593-01,/pa/557/0034-01">Id.</a> </em>(noting that trial was scheduled to begin April 25, 1994, actually commenced May 3, 1994, and that the defense did not present evidence until May 6, 1994, “precisely six weeks after the defense admittedly knew that it might want to have DNA testing performed”); Trial Ct. Findings, Nov. 19, 2010, at 5 (“The court refused the continuance, concluding that the six weeks requested to obtain DNA testing could be accommodated by the existing trial schedule.”). At no time prior to trial, however, did the defense ask the trial court to order production of the blood evidence from the Commonwealth. <em>See </em>Trial Ct. Findings, Nov. 19, 2010, at 8, n.

With regard to physical evidence in the victims’ home, the Commonwealth presented evidence that each victim was shot and killed in a manner that suggested the shooter knew and bore ill will toward the victims. Additionally, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the killer fired multiple shots and then entered the bathroom to wash away blood, thus explaining how Sherri Chamberlain had the opportunity to place the telephone call to Mrs. Ulrich before the killer returned and delivered the fatal shots to her chest and head. The Commonwealth introduced ballistics evidence that a live round of ammunition found in the residence was from a .38 special Smith &amp; Wesson and that all discharged shells and bullet fragments were fired from the same weapon. The Commonwealth did not introduce the blood evidence or rely on the results of the blood-type analysis.</p>

The Commonwealth also presented circumstantial evidence to corroborate the identification of Appellant as the killer. Specifically, the Commonwealth established that the murders occurred on the day before Sherri Chamberlain would have been eligible to obtain a no-fault divorce; her death on August 22, 1991, meant that all jointly owned property between Sherri and Appellant would be solely owned by Appellant. Further, Appellant’s and Sherri’s children were due to return to Sherri’s physical custody for the school year. The Commonwealth also introduced evidence of Appellant’s <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>malice and ill-will toward Sherri and Greg Inman, including filings in the couple’s divorce proceedings and the testimony of a former co-worker, James Janowsky. Mr. Janowsky testified that he informed Appellant that he knew an individual who may have been willing to use violence to convince Sherri and Mr. Inman to terminate their relationship. Specifically, Mr. Janowsky explained that he had used this individual’s services in the past in connection with his own marital dispute, and at that time, this person had been willing to “have somebody ... put a pillow over ... [Mr. Janowsky’s] wife’s head” or “slap her around a little bit.” Trial Ct. Opinion, Oct. 7, 1996, at 8; N.T. May 3, 1994, Vol. XIII, at 188. Mr. Janowsky testified that Appellant wanted to meet this individual, but Mr. Janowsky declined to arrange the meeting.</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[159,1102,1152,736]]]'>Another of Appellant’s co-workers, Stanley Mullen, testified that Appellant attempted to buy an unregistered handgun, specifically a .357 or .38 caliber, less than two months before the murders, ostensibly to shoot raccoons. Appellant was not interested in buying a properly registered handgun. The Commonwealth also introduced the recorded telephone conversation between Appellant and the state police trooper who called Appellant early in the morning of August 22, 1991, to direct him to surrender. During the conversation, Appellant expressed no surprise or curiosity, asked no questions about why the police were there, and was completely unemotional. According to police testimony, when Appellant exited the house his hair was damp and it was apparent that he was freshly bathed and cleaned.</p>

It was Appellant’s theory that Sally Inman committed the murders and then placed the telephone call to Mrs. Ulrich, pretending to be Sherri, from a payphone. In support thereof, two defense witnesses, who were the victims’ neighbors, timed the shootings at 2:06 a.m., nearly twenty minutes before Mrs. Ulrich received the phone call. Sally Inman’s son, who lived in Alaska, refuted this theory when he testified that <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>he had been on a telephone call with Sally Inman at the precise time of the murders.</p>

We explained that without subjecting this evidence to DNA testing, Appellant had been unable to advance his defense that someone else was the murderer.

Appellant argues, however, <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>that the Commonwealth’s evidence failed to establish that he was the murderer. In this regard, Appellant argues that the only direct evidence against him was Mrs. Ulrich’s testimony about receiving a telephone call from Sherri. According to Appellant, this evidence was insufficient because the record did not demonstrate that Sherri placed the telephone call to Mrs. Ulrich, and, if she did, there was no evidence that he was the “Terry” to whom she referred. Moreover, Appellant claims that the evidence does not explain how Sherri was able to make the telephone call after being fatally shot in the chest and head, and if she made the telephone call before being fatally shot, then, according to Appellant, Mr. Ulrich would have heard gunshots or observed the killer fleeing as he approached the victims’ house. Appellant views Mr. Ulrich’s testimony that he did not hear any gunshots or see anyone leaving the victims’ residence as consistent with the defense witnesses who testified that the shooting occurred closer to 2:06 a.m., thus suggesting that the killer had ample time to flee to a nearby payphone to place the call to Mrs. Ulrich at 2:24 a.m. Referring to the Commonwealth’s evidence about motive, Appellant’s appearance and demeanor when he was arrested, his attempt to buy an unregistered firearm, and his attempt to arrange a meeting with his co-worker’s acquaintance, Appellant argues that this evidence did not demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty.</p>

Mrs. Ulrich testified that on the <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>night of the murders, she received a telephone call from her friend and neighbor, Sherri, who told her to call an ambulance because “Terry” had shot “Greg and me.” Mrs. Ulrich was familiar with Sherri’s voice, having talked to her by telephone and face-to-face many times, and was absolutely certain the caller was Sherri; she never waivered in her identification of Sherri as the caller. Their conversations in the past had often centered on Sherri’s divorce from Appellant; the only “Terry” the two discussed was Appellant.</p>

Medical evidence presented at trial established that Sherri faced her killer when she suffered at least three of the bullet wounds. The Commonwealth proposed that after shooting the victims several times, the shooter attempted to cleanse himself of the victims’ blood in the bathroom, giving Sherri an opportunity to place the telephone call, before the shooter returned to deliver the fatal shots to her chest and head. Standing alone, Mrs. Ulrich’s testimony about the telephone call was sufficient to prove Appellant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

There was evidence that the murders were committed the day before Appellant’s divorce was to be finalized; Appellant harbored ill-will toward Sherri and Greg Inman; and Appellant attempted to purchase an unlicensed firearm of the same caliber as the murder weapon, which was never recovered. At the time of his arrest, Appellant appeared calm, and expressed no curiosity or surprise at being called by the police at 4:00 a.m. and directed to exit his house with his hands visible. Police observed that his hair was still damp from being freshly cleaned. As the trial court observed, the jury could detect in Appellant’s recorded voice during the telephone call from police immediately before his arrest the “expectancy, apprehension, and resignation of one whose otherwise flawless scheme to commit murder was undone by his underestimation of the will of one of his victims to <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>live, to seek desperately for help, and to identify her attacker.” Trial Ct.

The trial court further considered that the defense’s evidence, in contrast, was largely limited to attempting to show that the victims were shot about twenty minutes before Mrs. Ulrich received the telephone call, and that Greg Inman’s ex-wife had a motive to commit the murders. According to the trial court, the defense testimony about the timing of the shooting was internally inconsistent, came from witnesses whose observations at the time were not free from doubt, and did not have the corroboration which accompanied Mrs. Ulrich’s testimony. Specifically, Mr. Ulrich arrived at the scene shortly after the telephone call and smelled fresh gunpowder, indicating that the shootings had very recently occurred. The trial court persuasively reasoned that it was not, therefore, manifestly unreasonable for the jury to accept Mrs. Ulrich’s testimony instead of the defense evidence. Regarding the suggestion that Sally Inman committed the murders, counsel acknowledged that there was no testimony on the record that Ms. Inman was anywhere other than at her residence when the shooting occurred, and Ms. Inman’s son testified that he was on a long-distance telephone call with Ms. Inman from Alaska at the time.

The trial court also found that the Commonwealth believed that the blood evidence <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>originated from the victims, and it therefore had no motive to avoid DNA testing thereof. Moreover, according to the trial court, the prosecutors believed that Appellant’s objective in asking for a continuance was not to obtain DNA testing, but to complain about the lack of DNA testing, a belief the trial court explained was born out by Appellant’s failure to request that the trial court direct production of the blood evidence pretrial.</p>

Although the trial court explicitly found that the Commonwealth did not engage in bad faith with regard to its negligent handling of the blood evidence, Appellant argues that, to the contrary, the Commonwealth’s mishandling of the blood evidence was so grossly negligent that it actually amounted to bad faith. Specifically, Appellant submits that a close examination of the evidentiary record demonstrates that the Commonwealth knew before trial that the blood evidence was material and controversial, and that its cavalier mishandling of the evidence suggests that the evidence was intentionally lost or destroyed. Appellant highlights testimony from the hearing on remand indicating that prosecutors did not refrigerate the blood evidence, did not review the inventory of boxes of evidence received from the state police, and undertook no specific measures to safeguard or preserve the evidence. Although several Commonwealth witnesses testified that they believed the blood on the evidence belonged to the victims, Appellant argues that these <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>lay opinions are irrelevant and contrary to our prior suggestion in <em>Chamberlain I </em>that “the defense reasonably argued that DNA testing might reveal that someone other than appellant was at the scene and committed the murders.” <a href="/a2d/731/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="731 A.2d 593" data-case-ids="11666508,56854" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0593-01,/pa/557/0034-01">731 A.2d at 597-98</a>.

According to the prosecutor, as Sherri Chamberlain came downstairs, the shooter fired a shot at her that missed; as she fled, the shooter fired and missed again; the sixth shot fired was to Sherri’s abdomen, causing her to bleed on her hands and onto the wall, door, light switch, refrigerator, stairs, and elsewhere; as the shooter reloaded, he dropped a live round on the floor; the next shot grazed Sherri’s head; the shooter washed the blood off of himself in the bathroom while Sherri placed the telephone call to Mrs. Ulrich, then returned to shoot Sherri in the chest and head; and, finally, the shooter returned to Mr. Inman and shot him once more, in the head, before leaving.

They testified that they informed the township police chief, Martin Rinebold, who came to their residence to discuss the matter, and that on Chief Rinebold’s suggestion, they also contacted the state police. Chief Rinebold also testified, and flatly contradicted the Buonfiglios, as did a Corporal Robert Grimes, from the state police, who testified that the state police had no report of any contact made by the Buonfiglios.</p>

After hearing about an award offered by state police for information about the murders, Mr. Nichols came forward with this story.

It further argues that its failure to turn over to the defense Mr. Beirne’s name is of no moment because Mr. Beirne was nothing more than the source of a fruitless lead. The Commonwealth also observes that Appellant presented no evidence that he attempted to locate or investigate Mr. York despite being aware of his belief of Ms. Inman’s guilt, and made no effort to interview Ms. Inman.

Similarly, with respect to Mr. Nichols’ statement, the Commonwealth argues that although Mr. Nichols contacted the police, the police never made any record of his statement because the information provided was of no investigative value, and Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the information was either exculpatory or material. <em>See Agurs, </em><a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">427 U.S. at 110-11</a>, <a href="/us/427/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="214" data-cite="427 U.S. 97" data-case-ids="6174831" data-case-paths="/us/427/0097-01">96 S.Ct. 2392</a> (“The mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish ‘materiality’ in the constitutional sense.”).</p>

Second, the trial court found that based on the February 10,1993, police report, Appellant in fact possessed information that Mr. York may have been a beneficial witness.

First, he argues that “the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711 (h)(3)(i), thereby requiring reversal. The arbitrary factor on which Appellant relies is the decision of the prosecutor to seek the death penalty. Second, he argues that “the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d),” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(3)(ii), thereby requiring reversal. The jury found that the following two aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating factors: “[t]he defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony” (burglary), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6); and “[t]he defendant has been convicted of another murder committed in any jurisdiction and committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll). With respect to each aggravating factor, Appellant’s argument is the same: that the felony supporting the (d)(6) aggravator (burglary), and the double murder supporting the (d)(ll) aggravator, were all part of the same criminal incident, and therefore should not have been submitted to the jury as aggravating factors.

In contrast, once a trial begins-and certainly by the time a conviction has been obtained-it is much more likely that the State has discovered and assessed all of the information against an accused and has made a determination, on the basis of that information, of the extent to which he should be prosecuted.
