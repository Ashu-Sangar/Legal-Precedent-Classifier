The Surface Mining Act’s preemption clause expressly preempts the regulation of surface mining; however, the clause does not preempt local regulation of land use via zoning ordinances, which may affect where surface mining is located or sited. We will not infer that an express preemption clause encompasses the traditionally local concerns of land use and zoning when the General Assembly has not clearly incorporated those concerns into the clause. The residential setback provision challenged here does not constitute regulation of surface mining, as that term is defined in the Surface Mining Act. Rather, the setback provision falls clearly within the purview of traditional zoning regulations and merely regulates where surface mining can be sited relative to residential structures. Therefore, we hold that the residential setback provision in the Adams Township Zoning Ordinance is not expressly preempted by the preemption clause of the Surface Mining Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">16</a>

We cannot conclude that full implementation of this policy requires invalidation of a reasonable local zoning ordinance that regulates — not the activities of surface mining — but rather the siting and location of surface mining within the municipality via the imposition of a 1,000 foot setback from residential structures. Local authorities are charged with the responsibility of enacting zoning ordinances for the health, safety or general welfare of the community, giving “consideration to the character of the municipality, the needs of the citizens and the suitabilities and special nature of particular parts of the municipality.” 53 P.S. § 10603(a); <em>Miller, </em><a href="/pa/499/0080-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="499 Pa. 80" data-case-ids="1778823" data-case-paths="/pa/499/0080-01">451 A.2d at 1006</a>. Setbacks are a traditional mechanism by which local authorities seek to fulfill these responsibilities. In the absence of explicit language barring local zoning authorities from establishing reasonable setbacks to address local conditions and needs, we cannot conclude that the balance struck by the General Assembly in the Surface Mining Act was intended to remove this traditional and historical prerogative of local zoning authorities, as it <a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>applies to the location and siting of surface mining. The statutory policy of providing needed coal while balancing that need with the protection of the environment and agriculture does not require elimination of all local input as to the siting of surface mining within the municipality based on reasonable assessment of local conditions. Thus, we do not interpret the Surface Mining Act, via its policy, purpose, objective or other provisions, to have removed all force from general zoning considerations as they apply to local siting of surface mining. Rather, the policies of the Surface Mining Act can rest alongside zoning ordinances that, upon taking into consideration the special nature of the municipality, require surface mining operations to observe a reasonable residential setback.</p>

As discussed above, in our conflict preemption analysis, an explicit objective of the Surface Mining Act is “to enhance land use management and planning,” 52 P.S. § 1396.1, and “enhance” must be accorded its ordinary meaning. Had the General Assembly intended to assume total responsibility and authority over local land use management and planning as they apply to surface mining, the wording of the Surface Mining Act would surely have reflected such an intent. We recognize that the Surface Mining Act sets forth certain parameters with respect to where surface mining may not be conducted. However, we do not interpret these provisions to indicate that the statute has implicitly forbidden all <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>local zoning enactments concerning the location and siting of surface mining.</p>

The comprehensive regulatory scheme set forth in the Surface Mining Act concerns surface mining activities and conservation and reclamation procedures and protocols, including licensing, permitting, reclamation, blasting, notice, bonding, pollution control, remedies, penalties, etc. As we have discussed <em>supra, </em>the location and siting of surface mining within a municipality are not included within the statutory definition of surface mining activities, and we do not discern an intent on the part of the General Assembly to deprive local zoning authorities of their MPC-enabled power and responsibility to consider local conditions when deciding <em>where </em>surface mining should be sited within their communities.</p>

This holding is consistent with our recent decision in <em>Huntley, </em>wherein we held that the express preemption clause of the Oil and Gas Act did not preempt a local zoning ordinance that barred drilling, except as a conditional use, in certain areas of the municipality. <em>Huntley, </em>964 A.2d at 855, 866. We concluded in <em>Huntley </em>that a well’s placement at a certain location was not a “feature” of its operation and that the zoning ordinance at issue served different purposes from those enumerated in the Oil and Gas Act. <em>Id. </em>at 864-66. And, the Oil and Gas Act is not silent as to the matter of where wells can be sited; we recognized that under the provision entitled “Well location restrictions,” the Act sets forth a number of setbacks, barring, for example, the drilling of wells within 200 feet of any existing building or <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>water well or within 100 feet of any stream or body of water, unless a variance or waiver is granted. <em>Huntley, supra </em>at 861; 58 P.S. § 601.205(a) and (b). Thus, although the Oil and Gas Act unquestionably included some restrictions with respect to where oil and gas wells could be sited, we concluded that additional land use restrictions, enabled by the MPC and enacted by the local zoning authority, were not precluded. Our conclusion in the instant case is similar.</p>

In <em>Huntley, </em>the ordinance barred drilling altogether in certain areas of the municipality, unless a variance or waiver was granted.

In a conflict preemption analysis, the Court examines whether the state statute and the local enactment are irreconcilable, and whether the local enactment stands as an obstacle to the execution of the full purposes and objectives of the General Assembly. <em>Fross v. County of Allegheny, </em><a href="/pa/610/0421-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="20 A.3d 1193" data-case-ids="4202122,7283347" data-case-paths="/pa/610/0421-01,/a3d/20/1193-01">20 A.3d 1193</a>, 1203 (Pa.2011). Appellant argues that the Ordinance stands as an obstacle to the execution of the General Assembly’s policies, as expressed in the Surface Mining Act, which “by implication” prohibits setbacks in excess of 300 feet. Appellant claims that, because the Surface Mining Act addresses and sets a 300-foot setback, the state statute is irreconcilable with the Ordinance’s 1,000-foot setback provision, which is thereby preempted. Furthermore, appellant claims that the Ordinance’s 1,000-foot setback denies appellant access to 88 percent of the coal on its parcel, contrary to the Surface Mining Act’s purpose to balance environmental and agricultural interests with energy production goals.

Appellant forwards a claim that the Ordinance upsets the balance sought by the Surface Mining Act between protection of the environment and agricultural productivity and the need for coal as an essential source of energy. In support of this claim, however, appellant offers evidence only of the Ordinance’s impact on its own use of land, an alleged loss of production of 88 percent, while offering as self-evident a claim of harmful effect deriving from lack of uniformity in setback provisions.</p>

First, on balance, the Ordinance’s setback provision plainly appears to forward the General Assembly’s purposes: to aid in the conservation and improvement of land affected by surface mining, to enhance the value of land for taxation, to protect land and to enhance land use management and planning, to prevent and eliminate hazards to health and safety, generally to improve the use and enjoyment of said lands, and to designate lands unsuitable for mining. Tailoring setback provisions to local conditions and departing from uniformity in this respect is not, on its face, fatal to the Surface Mining Act. Second, appellant offers no analysis of the Ordinance’s overall impact in light of the multiple factors actually outlined by the Surface Mining Act, <em>ie., </em>the environmental and agricultural benefits to be derived from the Ordinance as compared to the <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>burden on the overall production of coal in Adams Township or the Commonwealth. In theory, I suppose, such evidence could show that, indeed, the Adams Township Ordinance setback requirements are overly restrictive. But, that is by no means self-evident. Because appellant did not adduce sufficient proof addressing the relevant Surface Mining Act factors, it did not carry its burden of proving that the Ordinance interferes with the purposes and objectives of the General Assembly.</p>

The-Majority's narrow reading of appellant’s first two arguments, <em>i.e., </em>that the Surface Mining Act preempts Section 1413.5(a) of the Ordinance rather than the entire Ordinance, is to a degree understandable, as appellant argues field and conflict preemption concurrently in trying to meet the <em>Duff </em>test. Notably, however, appellant did not restrict its prayer for relief to the striking of Section 1413.5(a) of the Ordinance as invalid. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 19 (“Section 17.1 preempts all regulation of surface mining.”); <em>id. </em>at 23 ("Section 4.2(a) is likewise an expression of legislative intent to preempt the field of regulation of coal surface mining.”).
