Further, the awards provided health benefits for police and firefighter employees retiring after January 1, 2007, for five years.

Section 252 states that “[a] collective bargaining agreement or arbitration settlement executed after the adoption of a plan shall not in any manner violate, expand or diminish its provisions.” 53 P.S. § 11701.252 (emphasis added). The Majority finds that “arbitration settlement” is an ambiguous term which is distinguishable from an arbitration award in the context of Act 47. In the Majority’s view, the reference to “arbitration settlement” in Section 252 and extrapolations from Act 47 and the caselaw do not convey a clear legislative intent to displace the strong policies underlying resolution of labor disputes via Act 111 interest arbitration. For vindication of the City’s position, if there is to be vindication, the Majority leaves it to the General Assembly to amend Section 252 and explicitly include Act 111 arbitration awards within the ambit of legal relations affected by Act 47.</p>

I view an “arbitration award” as a term of art that, in labor relations, accomplishes an adjustment or settlement of grievances or disputes. Reading “arbitration settlement” as encompassing an “arbitration award” in the context of Section 252 of Act 47, in my view, is not contrary to the plain meaning of the phrase, nor is it in conflict with its use in Act 111, as the term is simply descriptive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_3" id="ref_footnote_3_3">3</a>

Yet, Act 111 also does not use this term of art, but, as the Unions explain, it certainly describes and bestows the right to binding resolution by arbitration of disputes with the public employer, as an offset for the prohibition against striking by police and firefighters. 43 P.S. §§ 217.4, 217.7(a), 215.2; <em>Pa.

As the City’s <em>amici </em>point out, personnel costs are a significant expenditure for every local government, and a distressed municipality can make significant gains towards financial recovery by, <em>inter alia, </em>restructuring its labor agreements and reorganizing its personnel. The intent of Act 47 is to authorize and facilitate these actions, in this case, by the City. Like the Majority, I certainly recognize the importance of Act 111 in maintaining the historic balance between labor and municipal employers. But, Act 47 addresses circumstances of financial distress. I am not convinced that the General Assembly intended to charge elected officials with these difficult tasks, while simultaneously permitting certain discrete public employee unions to opt-out of terms with which they do not agree. It is precisely when the public employee unions and the municipal employer cannot agree that Act 47 provides elected officials with the tools needed to make necessary and difficult decisions. Act 47 clearly states that elected officials set priorities and direct expenditures. The contrary interpretation of Section 252 allows arbitrators to decide whether public employee unions should comply with the priorities and expenditure limits set by the distressed municipality plan. In my view, this interpretation is incompatible with the General Assembly’s emphasis on elected officials’ duties when an Act 47 plan is in effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_4" id="ref_footnote_3_4">4</a>

It is counterintuitive that in those most difficult of periods, the General Assembly would retract its preference for a coordinated plan of financial recovery directed by elected officials, and permit both labor and the municipality to continue with business as usual.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[160,845,1151,740]]]'>It is also counterintuitive that the General Assembly would exempt certain stakeholders, <em>i.e., </em>certain public employees, from the collective tightening of the belt and the strictures borne by all other municipal stakeholders under Act 47. Act 47 clearly signals the intent to involve all stakeholders in seeking to ensure the financial well-being of a municipality. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11701.241. Furthermore, the Unions’ opt-out from compliance with a distressed municipality’s plan, like the City’s here, would increase the financial burden on other municipal stakeholders. The interpretation of Section 252 proposed by the Unions is dissonant with both the stated intent of Act 47 and with the presumption to favor public interest over private interests. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11701.102; 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922.</p>

The Unions are understandably weary following nearly twenty years of financial austerity under the City's distressed municipality plan, and <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>permitting the City to direct collective bargaining terms to the Unions under these circumstances undoubtedly can lead to abuse. Act 47 is a statute intended to operate in times of emergency and it probably should have been drafted with a sunset provision. Nonetheless, I am persuaded that the General Assembly intended Act 47 to apply equally whether or not public employee unions agree with a distressed municipality’s plan terms affecting collective bargaining. Moreover, the interpretation of Section 252 forwarded by the Unions and embraced by the Majority would prevail in the first year no less than the twentieth year, eviscerating any but the most diluted Act 47 plans.</p>
