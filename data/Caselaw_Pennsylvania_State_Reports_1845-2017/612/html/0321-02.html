The Superior Court observed § 2710 requires that in the course of committing the predicate offense, “the actor must manifest a malicious intent toward the intended victim and have as its motivation the hatred of the victim’s ‘race, color, religion or national origin.’ ” <em>Ferino, </em>at 937 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. § 2710(a), (c)).

It contains no limiting language to suggest that ethnic intimidation may only be charged when the specific intent to intimidate or harass is the sole reason for the underlying criminal act. Instead, the statute only requires some act of physical contact committed maliciously and accompanied by a specific intent to intimidate or harass because of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. The circuit court properly interpreted the statute as being satisfied if this specific intent is formed during the commission of the underlying criminal act. That is so regardless of any other additional motivations for the underlying criminal act that may have existed earlier.</blockquote>

Neither definition contains limiting language such as “solely” or “only”; all that is required is that the ethnically malicious intent be present, concurrent with the underlying criminal act.

Where one intent is criminal under § 2710 and the other not, the question is not which is primary or dominant.

Such a rule would lead to an absurd result which the legislature did not intend. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (legislature does not intend result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable).
