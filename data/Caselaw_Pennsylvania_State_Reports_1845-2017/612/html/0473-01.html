    <blockquote id="b517-13" data-blocks='[["BL_517.12",517,[222,1361,1106,682]]]'>a. Whether the Superior Court’s holding that Respondent’s consent to a blood alcohol test was invalid was an unreasonable application of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unlawful searches and seizures, where the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that Respondent’s consent was freely and voluntarily given, where there was no force or coercion by police, where Respondent was advised of his right to refuse, and where Respondent was aware that the consent was being requested as a result of a police investigation into a three-vehicle motor vehicle collision with a possible fatality, wherein respondent was one of the operators involved?</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b517-14" data-blocks='[["BL_517.13",517,[219,2074,1106,309]]]'>b. Whether the Superior Court, in finding that Respondent’s consent was invalid because it was not “knowing,” overlooked, misapprehended and/or ignored the record set forth below, and improperly acted as fact finder in reweighing the evidence, thereby invading the province of the suppression court?</blockquote>
