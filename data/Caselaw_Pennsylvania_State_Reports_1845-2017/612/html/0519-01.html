He submits that the “evaluation and counseling requirements seek to balance the stated goal of allowing for frequent and regular contact with a parent <em>(See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 5301 [relating to declaration of policy]) and ensuring the safety, and best interests of the child.” Father’s brief at 6. Father contends that given the statute’s mandate for counseling prior to any award of custody, DOC’s interpretation “would create a complete bar to any kind of court-ordered contact between incarcerated parents covered by subsection (b), regardless of the circumstances.” In addition, “[s]uch a reading would be absurd with an effect contrary to the intention of the statute and the Constitution.” Father’s brief at 5-6.</p>

Similarly, in its evaluation of any request pursuant to section 5303(b.l) (relating to consideration of criminal charge) for temporary custody or modification of a custody, partial custody, or visitation order, the court is required by subparagraph (2) of this subsection to consider “whether the parent who is or has been charged with [additional enumerated offenses] poses a risk of harm to the child.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 5303(b.l)(2). The questions left unanswered by the statute, among others, are how and when the court will make its assessment of the risk of harm to the child under these sections.</p>

Even if we were to agree that the General Assembly must have intended an evaluation as a prelude to providing counseling to an offending parent, there remains the additional uncertainty of whether section 5303(c) was intended to apply to those offending parents who remain incarcerated. Section 5303(b) uses the phrase “has been convicted” of an enumerated offense but makes no mention of incarceration, either past or present. Thus, we are left without any express direction as to what effect, if any, continuing incarceration has on the custody rights of parents who have committed any of the enumerated offenses.</p>

Section 5303(b) reflects a legislative decision that parents convicted of certain crimes, such as homicide, pose a greater risk to a child’s safety. The mischief the General Assembly sought to remedy was the reintroduction of an offending parent into the child’s life without an assessment of that parent’s potential threat to the child in custody and visitation arrangements. Consequently, before potentially granting physical access to the child the court is required to assess the offending parent’s conduct to determine whether he or she still poses a threat to the child’s safety and needs rehabilitative counseling before that parent is awarded any form of custody. The counseling requirement of section 5303(c) serves as an adjunct to the threat-assessment requirement and provides an additional safeguard against the infliction of physical injury upon the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>child. Similarly, section 5303(b.l) requires the court to consider the conduct of the parent when he or she is merely charged with certain enumerated offenses to determine “whether the parent who is or has been charged with [such offense] poses a risk of harm to the child.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 5303(b.l)(2). Again, the objective is to provide an additional procedural safeguard by requiring a preliminary risk-of-harm assessment even where counseling is not mandated.</p>
    <p id="b579-4" data-blocks='[["BL_579.4",579,[171,783,1151,831]]]'>In theory, 23 Pa.C.S. § 5303(b) and (c) could be applied to currently incarcerated felons, but such an interpretation would be unreasonable. We acknowledge, as Father argues, that some of the enumerated crimes would ordinarily involve lengthy terms of incarceration, and the General Assembly would have been aware of this fact. As the third case example referenced above illustrates, however, the General Assembly was also aware that even in the case of a homicide conviction, a lengthy period of incarceration is not always imposed. Moreover, in his attempt to highlight the problem this legislation sought to redress, the bill’s sponsor referenced cases involving only previously incarcerated individuals. We find that this legislative history manifests the General Assembly’s intent to prevent the placement of a child <em>into the home </em>of an offending parent without first having engaged in a risk-of-harm assessment.</p>
    <p id="b579-5" data-blocks='[["BL_579.5",579,[168,1655,1152,734]]]'>Examination of Chapter 53 of the Domestic Relations Code in its entirety reveals that many of its provisions and certain of its commands regarding factors for the court’s consideration lack relevance in the context of a request for prison visitation. Clearly, an award of any type of physical custody is unavailable to an incarcerated parent. Similarly, it would make no sense for a court to take into consideration “which parent is more likely to encourage, permit and allow frequent and continuing contact and physical access between the noncustodial parent and child,” or assess an “adult household member’s present and past violent or abusive conduct” as required by section 5303(a)(2) and (3). Likewise, we find that it was not the General Assembly’s intent for subsections (b) and (c) to be applied to requests for prison visitation.</p>

      <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>We agree with DOC that, due to the strictures of their confinement and the rules of the penal institution, incarcerated parents are unable to engage in the type of physical interaction feared by the drafters of this legislation. Thus, it would serve no significant ameliorative purpose to mandate counseling for every incarcerated offending parent for the limited and closely scrutinized contacts associated with prison visits. A visitation request by an incarcerated parent necessarily stands on different footing than a traditional custody petition. In prison visit cases, the court in fashioning an appropriate order, where it determines visits would be in the child’s best interests, is limited to a determination of the number of visits and perhaps some contacts through telephone calls and written correspondence. In the more typical custody proceeding between separated or divorced parents where neither party is incarcerated, there is a broader spectrum of options available to the court in fashioning its order. Moreover, prison visit requests involve additional factors unique to that scenario that courts must consider in evaluating the overarching best interests of the child. For example, in <em>Etter v. Rose, </em><a href="/pa-super/454/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="454 Pa. Super. 138" data-case-ids="772892" data-case-paths="/pa-super/454/0138-01">454 Pa.Super. 138</a>, <a href="/a2d/684/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="684 A.2d 1092" data-case-ids="7360891,772892" data-case-paths="/a2d/684/1092-01,/pa-super/454/0138-01">684 A.2d 1092</a>, 1093 (1996), the Superior Court recognized some of the factors to be considered in deciding a question of visitation where the parent is incarcerated: (1) age of the child; (2) distance and hardship to the child in traveling to the visitation site; (3) the type of supervision at the visit; (4) identification of the person(s) transporting the child and by what means; (5) the effect on the child both physically and emotionally; (6) whether the parent has and does exhibit a genuine interest in the child; and (7) whether reasonable contacts were maintained in the past. Of course, although not mentioned in <em>Etter, </em>another relevant consideration is the nature of the criminal conduct that culminated in the parent’s incarceration, regardless of whether that incarceration is the result of a crime enumerated in section 5303(b). All of these factors can be evaluated by the court without first providing counseling to the inmate. Consequently, we find the counseling required by section 5303(c) is not a prerequisite to a court’s engaging in its evaluation of a child’s best interest in the context of a request <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>for prison visits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the trial court to conduct a hearing on Father’s request for prison visitation in an expeditious manner without resort to the application of 23 Pa.C.S. § 5303(b) and (c).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Our interpretation of the inapplicability of § 5303(b) and (c) to requests for prison visitation is not meant to suggest that a court considering such a request may not exercise the discretionary authority authorized by Pa.R.C.P. 1915.8, relating to physical and mental examination of persons, where it deems such an evaluation appropriate.</p>

We note that while this matter was pending, Chapter 53 (Sections 5301-5315) was repealed and re-promulgated in a new Chapter 53 codified at 23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5321-5340, eff. January 24, 2011. Act of Nov. 23, 2010, P.L. 1106, No. 112, § 2. In conjunction with this overhaul of the custody laws, the parties filed an ancillary “Joint Motion for Consideration of New Statute and/or to Reopen the Record.” The parties sought our consideration of this new statute to determine whether future proceedings in this case should be governed by the old statute or the new statute. In light of our remand, we grant the motion for consideration of the new statute limited to this purpose. By its express terms, section 4 of the new statute provides the answer: "A proceeding under the former provisions of 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 53 [23 Pa.C.S. §§ 5301-5315] which was commenced before the effective date of this section shall be governed by the law in effect at the time the proceeding was initiated.” Since this proceeding was initiated by Father’s filing of his complaint on February 19, 2004, the former provisions are applicable on remand. Additionally, we deny the request to reopen the record as moot.</p>

I agree with Justice Saylor that there is no basis, in statute or case law, to impose the cost of counseling <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>on the DOC. Had the General Assembly wished the DOC to provide this counseling, it could have readily done so. This ends the analysis. Thus, it is unnecessary to address whether the Domestic Relations Code requires currently incarcerated inmates, such as Father, to undergo counseling when seeking visitation with their children. I also agree with the majority, contrary to any suggestion by the legislative history, the judiciary is all too well aware of the risk domestic violence poses.</p>

Upon the initial remand by the Superior Court, the trial court directed the father to present evidence the he “no longer poses a grave threat of harm” to the child. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion at 523, 31 A.3d at 679 (quoting Order of April 16, 2007, Certified Record at 32). While our courts have used the term “grave harm,” I emphasize that the statute at issue in this case, which has since been repealed, and the recent amendments provide universally for the consideration of whether the parent poses a risk or threat of “harm”. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 5303(b) (providing that “the court shall consider such criminal conduct and shall determine that the parent does not pose a threat of harm to the child before making an order of custody, partial custody or visitation to that parent”) (repealed), 23 Pa.C.S. § 5328 (entitled “Factors to consider when awarding custody” and providing that in ordering any form of custody, a court shall consider “whether there is a continued risk of harm to the child or an abused party”); § 5329 (entitled “Consideration of criminal conviction” and providing that “the court shall consider such conduct and determine that the party does not pose a threat of harm to the child before making any order of custody” to a parent convicted of a listed offense). Accordingly, there is no need for any trial court to find a “grave” threat of harm.</p>

    <p id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.5",583,[173,411,1152,681]]]'>To my knowledge, Pennsylvania courts previously have implemented the rather straightforward, plain-language approach of treating prison visitation as a subset of visitation for purposes of the Domestic Relations Code. <em>See, e.g., Etter v. Rose, </em><a href="/pa-super/454/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="454 Pa. Super. 138" data-case-ids="772892" data-case-paths="/pa-super/454/0138-01">454 Pa.Super. 138</a>, <a href="/a2d/684/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="684 A.2d 1092" data-case-ids="7360891,772892" data-case-paths="/a2d/684/1092-01,/pa-super/454/0138-01">684 A.2d 1092</a> (1996). I disagree with the majority’s holding that there is some (apparently latent) ambiguity in this regard. I also differ, in substance, with the majority’s application of the principles of statutory construction. To me, the legislator’s comments which are quoted at length by the majority provide little insight into the questions at hand; moreover, I fail to appreciate why counseling is not appropriate to visitation between a prisoner-parent and a child.</p>
    <p id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.6",583,[172,1131,1151,365]]]'>From my perspective, this case is less about whether Section 5303 applies to prison visitation than who must pay for the services. In this age of unfunded mandates, this can be a very difficult question. As to the present circumstances, however, I agree with the Department of Corrections that there is no basis — statutory or otherwise — for imposing the burden upon it.</p>
