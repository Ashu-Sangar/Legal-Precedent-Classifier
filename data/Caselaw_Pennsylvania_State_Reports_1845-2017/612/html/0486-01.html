Slippery Rock asserted that the deduction for this student was “contrary to law” because the Public School Code of 1949 (“PSC”), 24 P.S. §§ 1-[ XXX-XX-XXXX ], requires the district “to educate every person, residing in the district, between the ages of six and twenty-one years.” 24 P.S. § 5-501.

Following the Department’s directive, Cyber School filed a response asserting that Slippery Rock’s objection did not fall within any permissible basis for a challenge to the deduction pursuant to the CSL. <em>See </em>Letter, 3/22/07, C.R. at 8.</p>

Slippery Rock filed a response asserting that it had standing to object to the deduction.

As support for this claim, Slippery Rock cites section 5-503 of the PSC, under which the “board of school directors ... may establish and maintain kindergartens for children between the ages of four and six years.” 24 P.S. § 5-503. Since this provision was not made applicable to cyber charter schools under section 17-1749-A(a) of the CSL, Slippery Rock contends that the discretionary authority to set the enrollment age rests exclusively with the school district.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Consequently, Slippery Rock maintains that the Secretary’s interpretation of section 11.14 to include the board of trustees of the cyber charter school is violative of the legislative intent expressed in the plain language of both the PSC and the CSL.</p>

Cyber School avers that the applicable provisions of the CSL give it the authority to establish the kindergarten entry age. Cyber School notes that a cyber charter school is granted “all powers necessary or desirable for carrying out its charter.” 24 P.S. § 17-1714-A. Pursuant to section 17-1716-A(a) of the CSL, the board of trustees of the cyber charter school has the authority to “decide matters related to the operation of the school, including, but not limited to, budgeting, curriculum and operating procedures, subject to the school’s charter.” 24 P.S. § 17-1716-A(a). Cyber School further observes that section 17-1719-A(3) requires that the charter school’s application identify “[t]he grade or age levels served by the school.” 24 P.S. § 17-1719-A(3).

    <p id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.4",540,[270,481,1151,700]]]'>Cyber School recognizes that the Department is the agency entrusted with the supervision of public schools in the Commonwealth such that its interpretation of the PSC and CSL is entitled to deference.

Furthermore, Cyber School contends that Slippery Rock’s position violates the clearly expressed intent behind the CSL by limiting educational opportunities. In a related argument, Cyber School notes a practical “problem” inherent in Slippery Rock’s interpretation.

In our view, this section derives from the fact that a charter school may offer a limited curriculum, electing — under the clear language of the CSL — to serve only particular grade levels. 24 P.S. § 17-1719-A(3). Stated differently, a charter school may operate exclusively as an elementary school, a middle school, a high school, or a combination thereof.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Thus, the statutory provision requiring a cyber charter school to set forth in its application the “age or grades” to be served stems, at least in part, from the fact that a cyber charter school need not offer a complete education to its students. Section 17-1719-A addresses the issue by requiring the school to identify its intended scope in the charter application. As such, while the CSL grants Cyber School the authority to set the “ages or grades” to be served, this authority is limited and cannot be viewed as the “expansive” grant of power urged by Cyber School.</p>

Since the regulation is clear on its face, we find the “modified reading” advanced by the Secretary and adopted by the Commonwealth Court to be in error. There is no justification for reading “board of school directors” to include the board of trustees at the cyber charter school. Such an interpretation runs counter to the express language of the regulation. In finding that it is necessary to include the board of trustees of the cyber charter school to avoid an “absurd” result, the Secretary disregarded the plain meaning of the regulation under the pretext of pursuing the spirit of the CSL. Since there is no ambiguity in the language, we cannot condone such an interpretation.</p>

It is not immediately apparent, however, where the authority of one of these entities ends and the other begins. Thus, it is evident that the General Assembly created a gap when it failed to articulate whether it is a cyber charter school’s or a school district’s policy that prevails in the event of a conflict regarding funding. When faced with such a conflict, we hold that the cyber charter school is bound by the policy of the school district in which the student resides. Our holding is guided by the recognition that the district’s funding obligation is inextricably linked to its duty to provide a public education.</p>

Section 17-1725-A places the burden to fund the education of a student enrolled in a cyber charter school on the school district of residence. 24 P.S. § 17-1725-A. The school district satisfies this obligation by making monthly payments to the charter school, with the precise amount of the payment calculated from a statutory formula. <em>See </em>24 P.S. § 17-1725-A(a)(2), (3), (5). Section 17-1725-A also provides an enforcement mechanism in the event that a school district refuses to comply. When faced with a recalcitrant school district, the CSL authorizes the Secretary to “deduct the amount, as documented by the charter school, from any and all State payments made to the district after receipt of documentation from the charter school.” 24 P.S. § 17-1725-A(5).

Thus, a child is entitled to enroll in the public schools of his or her district of residence only when the child meets the school district’s minimum entrance age to kindergarten. Before such time, the district bears no obligation to educate the child and, by extension, bears no obligation to fund educational programs for the child. In the instant case, the earliest a child may enroll in Slippery Rock’s kindergarten program is the age of five. Since a four-year-old resident of the Slippery Rock School District may not attend the public schools, the district does not have to pay for the child’s admission to Cyber School. Accordingly, while a cyber charter school may set its own entrance age for kindergarten, the school district does not have the commensurate obligation to pay where the cyber charter school’s policy does not align with that of the school district.</p>

Additionally, forcing Slippery Rock to pay for the education of a student who could not, because of her age, enroll in the district would override the district’s admissions policy. There is nothing in the PSC or the CSL that compels or sanctions such a result. A child is not statutorily entitled to a kindergarten education. 24 P.S. § 5-503; 24 P.S. § 13-<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>1327; 22 Pa.Code § 11.13; <em>O’Leary v.

Thus, a child is permitted to enroll in kindergarten only to the extent that a district has exercised its discretion to provide such a program. Where kindergarten is available, the applicable regulations dictate that entitlement to a public education begins when the child meets the minimum entrance age to the district’s kindergarten program. It is then, and only then, that the district’s funding obligation arises. Accordingly, we reject Cyber School’s argument that section 17-1719-A mandates a different result. Thus, while Cyber School may offer educational programs to students who are too young to attend classes in the Slippery Rock School District, Cyber School is precluded from billing the district for those same students.</p>

For these and other reasons, I believe this is a closer case than is reflected on the face of the majority opinion.</p>
