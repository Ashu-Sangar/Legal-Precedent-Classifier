The court examined the terms of the Agreement and concluded that the language in Article XI, Section 1 — that the pension fund “shall be governed” in accordance with state statutes and the City’s ordinances — was general and unclear as to whether the PLSDO was a part of the Agreement. Further, the court noted that the negotiated substantive improvement to the pension plan contained in the Agreement — that “the Firefighters’ Pension Plan will be amended to increase the line-of-duty disability pension from 50% to 75%” — was presented in bold. This was not done so for the PLSDO. According to the court, it was inconsistent and illogical that the parties did not pursue a similar drafting style for the PLSDO had it been a negotiated improvement to the pension plan under the Agreement. Second, the court found informative that Article XI, Section 1 was a carryover sentence that appeared in a prior collective bargaining agreement. Section 5 of the Agreement was reserved for a DROP, but was left blank. The Commonwealth Court opined that, if the parties had negotiated for the PLSDO, “they should have included it in Article XI, Section 5; or in Article I, Section 1 in bold; or in both places in the <a id="p670" href="#p670" data-label="670" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*670</a>[Agreement].” <em>City of Erie v.

    <p id="b714-4" data-blocks='[["BL_714.4",714,[262,513,1151,1857]]]'>Having found the PLSDO was not incorporated into the Agreement, the court determined that an exception to the general duty to bargain expressed in its prior decision in <em>Plainfield Twp.

As discussed in greater detail below, in <em>Plainfield Twp., </em>the Commonwealth Court held an employer did not engage in an unfair labor practice by failing to bargain over an elimination of a pre-contract ordinance providing a pension benefit that was found to be illegal. The court opined that the elimination of the benefit did not constitute an unfair labor practice because the parties had not specifically addressed the subject of pensions in their negotiations, and their collective bargaining agreement made no mention of the benefit, and, thus, the employer gained no bargaining advantage by eliminating the benefit. While recognizing the Agreement in the matter <em>sub judice </em>was not silent regarding pension benefits, the Commonwealth Court herein nevertheless reasoned that, based upon the language in the Agreement and the silence of the parties regarding any explicit negotiations, the matter was governed by <em>Plainfield Twp., </em>and the City was free to unilaterally repeal the pension benefits accorded by Article 149.09 without bargaining with the Union. Important to the Commonwealth Court’s determination was the illegality of the benefit: “Absent evidence that the illegal pension benefit in the ordinance was actually negotiated and then specifically incorporated into the [collective bargaining agreement], the municipality may rescind the ordinance without negotiating with the Union. Without evidence that the terms of the illegal benefit in the ordinance was negotiated, the municipality cannot be said to have gained a benefit from the inclusion of an illegal provision into a [collective bargaining agreement].” <em>City of Erie v.

      <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>The Board’s primary contention is that Act 111, by its express terms, mandates bargaining between an employer and a union over pensions and other benefits. 43 P.S. § 217.1. The Board maintains that the Commonwealth Court acted in contravention of this statutory language when it found that the City had no duty to bargain over the elimination of the existing PLSDO benefit because such benefit was not expressly set forth in the collective bargaining agreement. According to the Board, bargaining obligations under Act 111 are not conditioned upon whether a particular matter was previously negotiated, but, rather, on whether any changes to wages, hours, or working conditions must be negotiated, regardless of whether the matter is addressed in a collective bargaining agreement.</p>

The Board in that case applied a limited exception to the requirement of collectively bargaining over pension benefits, finding that the employer did not violate its bargaining obligation when it unilaterally brought specific pension benefits into conformity with the law, where the benefits pre-dated the collective bargaining agreement, the benefits were not mentioned in the collective bargaining agreement, and no employees utilized the benefits in questions. The Board differentiates <em>Plainfield Twp. </em>from the matter before us, asserting that, in <em>Plainfield Twp., </em>a specific employee pension benefit, and not the employer’s funding mechanism, was found to be unlawful and contrary to Act 205. Here, according to the Board, there is no claim that the PLSDO benefit itself was unlawful. Second, in <em>Plainfield Twp., </em>the benefit at issue had not been previously applied to employees, whereas in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>certain firefighters took advantage of and received the PLSDO benefit both before and after the Agreement was executed. Finally, in <em>Plainfield Twp., </em>there was absolutely no reference to pension benefits in the collective bargaining agreement. Indeed, the Board points to Judge Friedman’s <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>view in that case that the result would have been different if the union had incorporated the ordinance’s provisions into the collective bargaining agreements. <em>Plainfield Twp., </em><a href="/a2d/695/0984-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="695 A.2d 984" data-case-ids="11976849" data-case-paths="/a2d/695/0984-01">695 A.2d at 986</a>.

    <p id="b717-4" data-blocks='[["BL_717.4",717,[174,723,1153,898]]]'>Related thereto, the Board offers that, while the Commonwealth Court focused on the illegality of the PLSDO benefit, the Auditor General only found that the City’s receipt of state aid for PLSDO participants was unlawful; the PLSDO was not in and of itself considered to be illegal. Moreover, as noted by the Board, less than four months prior to the Commonwealth Court’s decision in this appeal, the Commonwealth Court held that the City’s receipt of state aid for PLSDO participants was lawful. <em>City of Erie v.

The Commonwealth Court found that the City had no statutory obligation to bargain over changes in pension benefits because it found that the language used in Article XI, Section 1 was too general, that the DROP plan section of the Agreement was left blank, and that other pension benefits were modified in the Agreement. Yet, according to the Board, the evidence equally supports a finding that the PLSDO benefit was discussed during negotiations and was left blank because the parties decided to allow the PLSDO benefit to be incorporated into the Agreement through the general clause incorporating existing ordinances found in Article XI, Section 1. Similarly, while the Commonwealth Court relied on <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>bolded language in the Agreement stating, “the Firefighters’ Pension Plan will be amended to increase the line-of-duty disability pension from 50% to 75%,” the Board responds that this language is meaningless unless the City and the Union intended to incorporate by reference the underlying pension ordinance that effectuates the benefit in the first instance. The Board concludes the City and the Union discussed the pension benefits and agreed to incorporate the existing ordinance into the collective bargaining agreement by reference. Indeed, the parties continued to apply the PLSDO consistent with the Agreement and the ordinance until the City unilaterally rescinded this benefit while the Agreement remained in effect. This, according to the Board, was in violation of Act Ill’s mandate to bargain, and, thus, the Commonwealth Court erred in holding to the contrary.</p>

The City stresses that the validity of the lower court’s holding does not turn on whether or not a pension benefit is found to be illegal by a court, and acknowledges that, here, the PLSDO was not found to be illegal. Rather, according to the City, it was permitted to rescind a benefit that was implemented independent of the collective bargaining process so long as it demonstrated that the term was not bargained for and that the City did not gain a bargaining advantage as a result of the benefit. The City points to <em>Plainfield Twp., </em>in which, according to the City’s interpretation, the Commonwealth Court determined that, absent evidence that a pension benefit was actually negotiated and specifically incorporated into a collective bargaining agreement, a municipality may rescind an ordinance without negotiating with a union.

Pension benefits are expressly listed in the statute as a mandatory subject of bargaining. Therefore, the City was obligated to bargain over pension benefits. Furthermore, an employer’s unilateral change to a mandatory subject of bargaining constitutes an unfair labor practice. Here, the City enacted Ordinance 75-2006, which repealed the firefighters’ PLSDO benefit and failed to bargain with the Union over its rescission of this pension benefit. Thus, the City committed an unfair labor practice when it unilaterally repealed the PLSDO without bargaining with the Union. Finally, we find that the purported exception to the statutory duty to bargain offered by the City, and employed by the Commonwealth Court, is inapposite to the matter <em>sub judice, </em>as such exception requires as a predicate an illegal term or condition of employment, and here it is uncontested that the pension benefit at issue in this appeal is legal and proper. For the above stated reasons, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.</p>
