Perry had stopped the Lexus at a green light on 7th Street which was around the corner from the club. Perry and Stewart were blocking a lane of traffic while the men conversed with some women who were in the car behind them. Jones, driving the Tracker with the top and windows down, pulled along side the Lexus as the light turned red. Stewart turned to Jones and remarked, “What the f- you looking at?” Jones and Mahalati ignored Stewart. When the light turned green, Jones drove around the Lexus and stopped in front of the entrance to Illusions. Perry pulled the Lexus along the passenger side of the Tracker. Perry asked Mahalati, “What the f— you looking at?” Perry then repeated several times, “What do you want to do?

Moreover, the sentencing court enjoys an institutional advantage to appellate review, bringing to its decisions an expertise, experience, and judgment that should not be lightly disturbed. Even with the advent of sentencing guidelines, the power of sentencing is a function to be performed by the sentencing court. Thus, rather than cabin the exercise of a sentencing court’s discretion, the guidelines merely inform the sentencing decision.</blockquote>

In the same vein, the result of carrying a weapon is also irrelevant as that result is dealt with by imposition of a sentence on another crime when the result of carrying the firearm itself is a criminal act.

At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth advised the court that the applicable sentencing guideline range for Perry’s conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, which had an offense gravity score of 11, was 54 to 72 months, plus or minus 12 months. Although this is the correct range under the <em>fifth </em>edition of the Sentencing Guidelines, because Perry committed his offense on June 8, 1996, his sentence was controlled by the fourth edition of the sentencing guidelines, which was in effect from August 12, 1994 through June 13, 1997. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Maneval, </em><a href="/pa-super/455/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="455 Pa.

Nevertheless, no party raised this issue, either before the lower courts or before this Court. We also note the sentencing court did not specifically state on the record the guideline range for Perry's UFA conviction. A sentencing court is not required to recite on the record the guideline sentencing range, as long as the record demonstrates the court’s recognition of the applicable sentencing range and the deviation of sentence from that range. <em>Commonwealth v. Twitty, </em><a href="/a2d/876/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="876 A.2d 433" data-case-ids="8967202" data-case-paths="/a2d/876/0433-01">876 A.2d 433</a>, 438 (Pa.Super.2005). In that regard, Perry now argues that "neither the certified record nor the sentencing court opinion indicates that the sentencing court was aware of the precise guidelines sentence for [his UFA] conviction." Appellee’s Brief at 8. However, Perry failed to raise this issue in his motion for reconsideration of sentence, or on appeal to the Superior Court. Accordingly, this claim is waived.

As this issue was a challenge to the discretionary aspects of his sentence, Perry did not have an absolute right to appellate review, and his challenge in this regard was properly viewed as a petition for allowance of appeal. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(b); <em>Commonwealth v.

Perry filed a motion for reconsideration, the Commonwealth conceded the court's finding of waiver was erroneous, and the Superior Court ultimately withdrew its opinion. The Superior Court also vacated an award of restitution to the victim. That portion of the Superior Court’s opinion, however, is not before us.</p>

As noted above, Perry’s challenge before the Superior Court was to the discretionary aspects of his sentence. <em>See supra </em>note 8. Subsection (f) of 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781 provides "No appeal of the discretionary aspects of the sentence shall be permitted beyond the appellate court that has initial jurisdiction for such appeals.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9781(f). Thus, pursuant to subsection (f), this Court is precluded from reviewing Perry's challenge to the discretionary aspects of his sentence. Nevertheless, subsection (f) does not preclude this Court's review of the application of legal principles, including the issue of whether a lower court exceeded its standard of review in supplanting the sentencing court’s discretion. <em>See Commonwealth v.

We recognize the Superior Court opined that, even if intent was relevant, there was no evidence to indicate Perry carried a weapon with the intent to employ it criminally. However, this alternative holding by the court, supported only by its brief theory on "the state of our society,” <em>Perry, </em>228 EDA 2005, at 26, as opposed to citations to the record, does not, in our view, render harmless the Superior Court's failure to give sufficient deference to the sentencing court’s imposition of sentence.</p>
