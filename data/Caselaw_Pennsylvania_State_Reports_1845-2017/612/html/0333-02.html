    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[184,1230,1152,687]]]'>On the morning of September 21, 1983, the Lunarios, three elderly siblings, were found stabbed to death in their Throop, Pennsylvania home. The medical examiner estimated that they had died between 11:00 p.m. on September 20, 1983, and 2:00 a.m. on September 21,1983. Evidence and statements by neighbors led the police to question or suspect Appellant and/or his brother, Martin Chmiel. Police found at the scene of the murders a sweater sleeve, which the police were able to determine had been cut from a sweater owned by Martin. The sweater sleeve was used as a mask in the burglary of the Lunario home. The police also learned that Martin was aware that the Lunarios had kept large quantities of cash hidden away in numerous locations throughout the house.</p>

Appellant was known to be in need of money to pay lawyers who were defending him against criminal charges of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent and aggravated assault, terroristic threats, and recklessly endangering another person. During a subsequent search of Appellant’s house, the police discovered $2400 in $50 and $100 bills on top of a hutch.</p>
    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[274,757,1152,927]]]'>When police questioned Martin, based on the discovery at the murder site of the sleeve cut from his sweater, he admitted that he and Appellant had planned to rob the Lunarios to acquire the money needed for Appellant’s legal bills, but that Martin had backed out of the scheme. Martin informed the police that after news of the murders had become public, Appellant told him that he had committed the murders, providing details of the crime. Police determined that these details, as relayed to them by Martin, could only be known by the murderer, as none had been publicly released. However, Martin was able to show that at the time the Lunarios were murdered, he was participating with his brother-in-law, Thomas Buffton, in a “fire watch.” Although Buffton had been a co-conspirator with Martin in previous unrelated criminal activity, Martin’s arrival at the fire watch, if not his continued presence there, was vouched for by two other witnesses, including the Scranton Fire Chief.</p>

Following Appellant’s arrest, a Pennsylvania State Police forensic scientist conducted a microscopic analysis of six hairs retrieved from the sweater sleeve found at the murder scene. When the forensic scientist compared two of those hair strands microscopically with hair strands obtained from Appellant, both sets of hair strands contained identical features. The forensic scientist concluded that the two hair strands found on the sweater sleeve mask were microscopically similar to Appellant’s hair, but not to Martin’s or the Lunarios’ hair.

He asserted that his prosecution for those crimes was the result of a conspiracy involving the police; his brother, Martin; Buffton; and others. In an alibi different from that he had asserted at an earlier trial, Appellant testified that he had been at the home of Patrick Battle from 11:00 p.m. on Tuesday, September 20, 1983, to 1:30 a.m. Wednesday morning on September 21,1983, to watch the double-header baseball games between the Baltimore Orioles and the Detroit Tigers. Appellant further testified that after the baseball games, he drove to Martin’s residence, arriving by 1:45 a.m.</p>

Another witness, Daniel McGlynn, testified that at 4:00 a.m. he observed Appellant in a restaurant located one mile from the Lunarios’ home.

The mitigating circumstances found by the jury were: (1) Appellant did not have a significant history of prior criminal convictions, including felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to another person, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1); and (2) Appellant proved “other evidence of mitigation” caused by his family relationships and abusive upbringing, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8).

Martin Chmiel, his brother-in-law Thomas Buffton, and Appellant’s and Martin’s sister, Nancy, who was then married to Thomas, conspired to burn the Buffton house in order to obtain insurance proceeds. Martin did start a fire at the house, and the Bufftons did receive insurance proceeds for fire damage. The Bufftons then hired Appellant to repair the damage who, in turn, hired Martin to assist. This occurred shortly before the murders of the Lunarios. Appellant and Martin were still working on the house repairs when the murders occurred. Martin and Buffton were later arrested, pled guilty, and sentenced for their arson-related crimes. Nancy was not arrested or prosecuted.</p>

Appellant asserts that the missing piece of critical information was the existence of the Commonwealth’s admission of an “understanding” or deal between it and Martin and it and Buffton. However, at the PCRA hearing, Appellant presented no evidence with respect to any pre-trial contact or “deal” between the Commonwealth and Martin, or any favorable treatment of Martin not already brought out by counsel at trial. With respect to the Commonwealth’s pre-trial contact with Buffton, Appellant’s PCRA evidence consisted principally of details regarding discussions between the Commonwealth and Buff-ton. However, trial counsel had provided evidence to the jury <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>of the fruit of that discussion, namely, the leniency of Buffton’s sentence and Buffton’s subsequent favorable treatment at resentencing through the assistance of the Commonwealth. Further, trial counsel presented to the jury evidence that Buffton had not provided restitution for his significant insurance fraud.

Thus, Appellant’s argument that this testimony was tainted by any understanding or deal the witnesses had had with the <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>Commonwealth is rather thin.

Moreover, Appellant’s allegation that the jury connected the prosecutor’s use of the term “match” in opening statements to his use of the term “match” in closing remarks, after a three-week trial involving numerous witnesses and concepts, and, as a result, became confused, prejudiced, or biased against Appellant, is one deserving of no credence whatsoever.</p>

During his second trial, Appellant was cross-examined by the prosecutor with respect to Appellant’s direct-examination testimony that he had not been at or near the Lunario house on the night of the murders and had never told anyone anything to the contrary. In an attempt to impeach this testimony, the prosecutor asked Appellant to confirm or deny the fact that he had told his first trial counsel two conflicting stories regarding his activities and whereabouts on the night of the murders. One of those stories was that he was actually outside the Lunario house on the night of the murders in order to “case it.” There, he saw a person who appeared to resemble his brother, Martin, run down an alley by the Lunario house, and get in a car. Evidence that Appellant had told this story to counsel came from counsel’s testimony at a 1988 PCRA hearing. On direct appeal from Appellant’s second conviction, this Court determined that the prosecutor’s cross-examination of Appellant on this evidence prejudicially implicated Appellant’s rights to effective assistance of counsel and freedom from self-<a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>incrimination, as well as the attorney-client privilege.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_21" id="ref_footnote_1_21">21</a>

Appellant had been tried and sentenced to death twice before in Lackawanna County. The Commonwealth had utilized highly prejudicial aggravating evidence, which had been reported in the local media, at the penalty phases of both prior trials. Appellant also had a PCRA hearing in Lackawanna County. Due to the amount of media coverage of this case and the extensive time period over which the case had been subject to publicity, voir dire — especially voir dire by written questionnaire — was insufficient to root out possible prior information venire persons had heard about Appellant’s case. Post-sentence and appellate counsel were deficient for not raising this issue, as it had been preserved on the record by trial counsel. There is no reasonable strategic basis for failure to raise on appeal a meritorious issue preserved by trial counsel. Because of the unique procedural history of this case, there is a reasonable probability that this Court would have granted relief on a venue/venire claim on appeal. Prior counsel’s failure to raise this claim was prejudicial.</blockquote>

The factual evidence of the physical testing of the DNA samples and the matching alleles, even without statistical conclusions, tended to make appellant’s presence more likely than it would have been without the evidence, and was therefore relevant. To be relevant, evidence need not be conclusive.

    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[175,626,1154,1000]]]'>In the final track of his argument, Appellant asserts that the PCRA hearing testimony of Dr. Ouligian and Neil H. Blumberg, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist, establish that trial counsel failed to adequately prepare for the penalty hearing by more thoroughly exploring Appellant’s mental condition. Specifically, Appellant contends that the PCRA hearing testimony of these two physicians supports the conclusion that at the time of the murders, Appellant suffered from all but one of the four criteria that establish PTSD, and that the other three criteria, on their own, can lead to “extreme mental, emotional disturbance.” N.T. PCRA Hearing, 8/8/08, at 134 (testimony of Dr. Blumberg). Moreover, Dr. Blumberg opined that the reason Appellant did not meet the final criterion was because of his alcoholism, which, by its numbing effect, purportedly prevented the symptoms of that criterion from materializing. Appellant argues that trial counsel were ineffective for having failed to provide such evidence to the jury, and that appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to recognize this deficiency in trial counsel’s advocacy.</p>

That mitigating factor would be that of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(2).</p>

The court further held that the PCRA hearing testimony of Drs. Ouligian and Blumberg established that neither physician would have been permitted to testify that Appellant had PTSD at the time of the murders because such opinion could not be expressed within a reasonable degree of professional certainty. Moreover, the court observed that Appellant also had failed to show how a diagnosis of alcohol dependence rather than alcohol abuse would have made any difference with the jury. Indeed, the court noted that Appellant “is hard pressed to argue” that his alcoholism, of whatever variety, “impaired his ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct” when he testified under oath at trial (and the previous trial) that he did not commit the murders.

The fact remains, however, that Appellant did not meet the criteria for PTSD at the time of the murders.

The court further determined that the “PCRA testimony presented reflects that Attorney Ackourey opted not to call Robert Chmiel as a witness, not that Mr. Chmiel refused to do so for fear of prosecution.” <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. In sum, the PCRA court concluded that Appellant had failed to show the necessary nexus between the prosecutor’s threat and the fact that Robert did not testify. <em>Id. </em>at 39.</p>

Thus, any mitigation evidence from Robert, in the PCRA court’s view, “would have diluted or detracted from the impact of Felix Chmiel’s far more articulate and compelling testimony during the third trial. As such, mitigation testimony from Robert Chmiel would not have positively affected the sentencing outcome for [Appellant].” <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the court concluded that Appellant had failed to show a reasonable probability that Robert’s mitigating evidence would have contributed to a different penalty being imposed by the jury. <em>Id.</em>

Indeed, we also observed that Appellant even appears to have conceded that <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>Robert’s potential mitigating testimony was essentially cumulative. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 20.

Rather, the prosecutor’s threat on record was that Robert was, in all events and in that moment, facing a perjury charge for past behavior, undoubtedly because of his guilt phase testimony. We do not condone the prosecution engaging in any manner of behavior that could be construed as witness intimidation; indeed, we condemn such behavior. However, had Robert testified at the penalty phase hearing and conformed his sworn testimony to the truth, he would not have been subject to any perjury charges stemming from that testimony. Quite simply, Robert was not constrained from truthfully testifying at the penalty hearing. On the other hand, if Robert could not have been relied upon to tell the truth at the penalty phase, then Appellant’s counsel “may not be found to be ineffective because [they] failed to facilitate a defense based upon lies.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant argues that there is no direct mention in <em>Cox </em>that the trial court had used a written questionnaire in order to ascertain the views and experiences of the venire panel. Moreover, Appellant contends that both <em>Harris </em>and <em>Cox </em>pre-dated <em>Boxley, </em>which Appellant argues has modified the holdings of <em>Harris </em>and <em>Cox </em>without so stating. In response, we observe first that, although <em>Cox </em>does not specifically state that the trial court had used a written questionnaire, the opinion does reproduce the long and detailed questions posed to the venire panel regarding their views toward the death penalty. If these lengthy questions were not written, as they probably were, but as they definitely were in <em>Harris, </em>then that circumstance actually makes Appellant’s argument less persuasive. A written questionnaire would allow a venire person a greater opportunity to reflect and consider his or her views on a difficult issue.</p>
