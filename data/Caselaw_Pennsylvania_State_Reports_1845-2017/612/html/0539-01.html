First, it is the Commonwealth’s position that the concern of Arroyo members about the possibility that Mr. Figueroa might bear witness against them did not depend on the truth of the underlying accusation of criminal conduct. More practically, the Commonwealth explains that an acquittal is not proof of actual innocence. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v. Strand, </em><a href="/pa/464/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="464 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1710344" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0544-01">464 Pa. 544</a>, 547, <a href="/pa/464/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="464 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="1710344" data-case-paths="/pa/464/0544-01">347 A.2d 675</a>, 676 (1975) (explaining that inconsistent verdicts are generally tolerated in the judicial system); <em>see also </em>Brief for Appellee at 21 (“The acquittals mean no more than that that jury, presented with evidence decades after the crime, harbored a reasonable doubt.”). In all relevant respects, the Commonwealth deems <em>McCall </em>to be dispositive. With reference to <em>Dowling, </em>the Commonwealth explains that the opinion does not hold that a future acquittal requires the overturning of a jury’s verdict where the prosecution has presented evidence of a defendant’s misdeeds, or even that a jury must necessarily be apprised of a preceding acquittal for such misdeeds. Rather, the Commonwealth notes, the <em>Dowling </em>Court merely observed that the issuance of an acquittal instruction provided some additional indicia that the evidence was properly admitted. <em>See Dowling, </em><a href="/us/493/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="493 U.S. 342" data-case-ids="11331685" data-case-paths="/us/493/0342-01">493 U.S. at </a><a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a><a href="/us/493/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="493 U.S. 342" data-case-ids="11331685" data-case-paths="/us/493/0342-01">353</a>, <a href="/us/493/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="493 U.S. 342" data-case-ids="11331685" data-case-paths="/us/493/0342-01">110 S.Ct. at 674</a>. The Commonwealth also emphasizes that the trial court provided cautionary instructions at Appellant’s trial, advising the jury of the limited purpose for which the evidence of the murder of Mr. Slafman was admitted. <em>See </em>N.T., June 1,1992, at 87-88.</p>

While such evidence may not go directly to any element of the crimes, prosecutors employ such proofs precisely because of the potentially persuasive effect in explaining and contextualizing human behavior. <em>See generally </em>1 Wharton’s Criminal Evidence § 4:45 (15th ed.2010) (“An inquiry as to motive is often of great importance, particularly in a case based largely on circumstantial evidence.”). Nevertheless, here, it was never disputed that Mr. Figueroa was killed in the basement of the Colon residence in Appellant’s presence and that Appellant, at the very least, assisted in concealing the victim’s body.

Moreover, the record reflects that the Commonwealth used the same edited videotape at the Figueroa trial as was entered into evidence at the initial Slafman trial, <em>see </em>N.T., June 3, 1992, at 138-39; there is a recorded transcript from the Slafman proceedings, <em>see Commonwealth v. </em>Maisonet, Nos. 3477-3482, <a href="/citations/?q=1997%20WL%201433742" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="1997 WL 1433742">1997 WL 1433742</a> (C.P.Phila., May 1992) (transcription of videotape); and such record does not reflect the dramatic portrayals.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

As such, Appellant’s claims of pervasive prejudice are unpreserved.
