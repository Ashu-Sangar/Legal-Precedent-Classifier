In support of this challenge, Piper relied on an opinion from this Court that had been announced a mere six days earlier, pertaining to the same ordinance: <em>C &amp; M Developers, Inc. v. Bedminster Twp. Hearing Bd., </em><a href="/pa/573/0002-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="573 Pa. 2" data-case-ids="197203" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0002-01">573 Pa. 2</a>, <a href="/pa/573/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="820 A.2d 143" data-case-ids="197153,197203,9308734,9308815" data-case-paths="/pa/573/0001-01,/pa/573/0002-01,/a2d/820/0143-01,/a2d/820/0143-02">820 A.2d 143</a> (2002). In <em>C &amp; M, </em>this Court invalidated the Township’s ordinance because it contained certain requirements that unconstitutionally restricted a landowner’s devel<a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>opment rights. Relying heavily on <em>C &amp; M, </em>Piper identified those same constitutional defects and sought permission to develop its land at a significantly higher density than would have been permissible under the invalidated ordinance. The Board of Supervisors, the trial court, and the Commonwealth Court all rejected Piper’s proposed cure to the unconstitutionality and held that Piper could develop its land in accordance with the Township’s alternative amended ordinance which cured the constitutional defects in the 1996 ordinance as identified in <em>C &amp; M </em>and allowed increased development, but not to the extent requested by Piper. On appeal to this Court, Piper argues that the lower courts improperly denied Piper the full relief it requested. Specifically, Piper argues that the decisions below violate the Municipalities Planning Code (“MPC”) and the “pending ordinance doctrine” as set forth in <em>Casey v.

On August 12, 1996, the Township adopted Ordinance 118 (the “AP Ordinance”) establishing an Agricultural Preservation District (the “AP District”). The AP Ordinance, designed to preserve the prime agricultural assets of the Township, contained numerous restrictions on the development of residential properties. Three notable restrictions applied to developers who owned tracts larger than 10 acres: (1) effectively, at least 50% of that land had to be set aside for preservation of <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>agricultural soils; (2) on the remaining buildable land, the minimum lot size for a residential property was to be one acre; and (3) that minimum one-acre buildable area could not include wetlands, lakes, or ponds (the “one good acre requirement”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The trial <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>court rejected Piper’s argument that under <em>Casey </em>the court had to permit Piper to develop its land according to the full measure of its proposed plans because it filed its proposed curative ordinance prior to the Township’s proposed curative ordinance. The trial court interpreted <em>Casey’s </em>pending ordinance doctrine as granting “automatic” relief only to an original successful challenger such as C &amp; M, and not to a subsequent “piggy back” challenger such as Piper. Tr. Ct. Op. at 10, 11. The court reasoned that the <em>Casey </em>rule was designed to protect the original challenger from retaliatory zoning by a local municipality, not to permit a flood of piggyback challenges the moment that an ordinance is judicially declared invalid. The court reasoned that if a judicial decision invalidates an ordinance, landowners are placed on constructive notice that the township will act to cure the defect. The court found that in the instant case, Piper was not entitled to automatic approval of the full measure of its development plans because the Township acted “quickly” to cure the defect by announcing its intention to do so at the next available public meeting.</p>

Piper stresses that it filed its cure challenge on November 7, 2002, one week before the Township set into place its own procedures to cure the invalidity of the AP Ordinance by adopting Ordinance 149. <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>Piper argues that under the pending ordinance doctrine, set forth in <em>Casey </em>and discussed in full <em>infra </em>at 18-20, the Board is precluded from using Ordinance 149 to thwart Piper’s cure challenge to the AP Ordinance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a> Piper further contends that the lower courts’ “acting quickly” standard is unsupported by either case law or the MPC. According to Piper, Section 609.2(3) of the MPC provides that the Board may ignore a landowner’s challenge only if it is filed after the municipality files its own declaration and proposal. Piper complains that the lower courts have now blurred that once-clear dividing line by letting governing bodies ignore private challenges that are filed before the municipal declaration and proposal, so long as the municipality acts quickly. Piper argues that this new, <em>ad hoc </em>rule violates <em>Casey </em>and creates the potential for unchecked mischief. Piper further claims that the Legislature explicitly considered the facts of this case when deciding whether to allow a moratorium period for municipalities to consider how to respond to a court order striking down a zoning ordinance, which the Legislature ultimately rejected. Legislative Journal, 2007 session, 191st General Assembly No. 113, December 11, 2007.

Specifically, Piper argues that because it filed its challenge at the time that it did, Piper had an accrued cause of action and a vested right to relief, which cannot be destroyed retroactively by way of the Township’s later amendment.

Instead, the Township avers that the Board addressed Piper’s cure challenge properly under Section 609.1(c). The Board held over fifty hearings to examine the merits of both the Township’s and Piper’s proposals and concluded that Piper’s curative amendment was unreasonable and that Ordinance 149 cured the defects in the original AP Ordinance. <em>See supra </em>at 1088 n. 11. It further distinguishes <em>Casey, </em>discussed in detail <em>infra </em>at 1093-95, where this Court sought to protect a challenger from a municipality retaliating by zoning around the successful challenger, from this case where the Township cured the flaw in the AP Ordinance by enacting Ordinance 149.</p>

According to Piper, this site-specific relief is available independent of any broader regulatory scheme, including Ordinance 149 and Piper’s proposed curative amendment. Piper’s Reply Brief at 11 (“Piper’s curative amendment is not at issue on this appeal.”). Piper submits that it is entitled to site-specific relief under section 1106-A of the MPC, 53 P.S. § 11006-A, a provision that grants trial courts the power to allow development on a challenger’s land if the court determines that the challenge is valid.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">15</a>

Piper is entitled to this remedy not only because Ordinance 149 happened to provide it, but also because Piper filed a valid challenge to those defects before the Township filed its declaration and proposal and the cure challenge was properly evaluated under Section 609.1. <em>See <a href="/pa/529/0478-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="529 Pa. 478" data-case-ids="1831198" data-case-paths="/pa/529/0478-01">id.</a></em>

Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>Casey </em>and <em>Fernley. </em>In those cases, the municipality purported to cure the <em>de jure </em>defect by permitting the multifamily housing in some sections of the municipality, but still attempted to deny any relief to the successful challenger. Here, in contrast, the Township cured the <em>de facto </em>defects in the AP District that included Piper’s land. While Piper was “thwarted” from developing at the specific density that it proposed, that remedy need not be automatically provided, because it would provide a windfall beyond what is necessary to cure the constitutional defects. <em>See H.R.

Far from supporting Piper’s position, this subsection emphasizes the degree of flexibility and discretion that a court has in fashioning appropriate relief when it determines that a zoning challenge is valid. Under the plain language of this subsection, the court has the option to order that the challenger’s use be approved in its entirety; however, this is not mandatory. Instead, the court may approve only certain portions of the challenger’s plans, while subjecting the remainder to additional restrictions. Here, the trial court took this second option by approving the adoption of Ordinance 149. This approach provided appropriate constitutional relief to Piper while at the same time placing additional restrictions on Piper’s described development.

It states that once the municipality has enacted its own curative ordinance, a landowner may not "accrue” its own right to a cure based on its private challenge, to the extent that the challenge is based on the invalidity of the original ordinance. Again, this protection relates back to the date of the municipality’s declaration and proposal.</p>

Thus, after a court issues a decision invalidating a municipality’s zoning ordinance, the stampede may proceed apace, halted only by the declaration and proposal procedure of Section 609.2(1). Of course, a municipality has an incentive to act quickly to limit the number of challenges by filing such a declaration as soon as possible. Municipalities must balance their confidence that their ordinances are valid with the risk of facing comparisons between it and multiple variations, including, as here, its own amendment, in deciding when to declare and propose.</p>

The Court in <em>Casey </em>construed a 1972 version of the MPC that had been repealed by the time <em>Casey </em>itself was decided in 1974. One section of the 1972 law provided that when a court declared an ordinance invalid, it could, if it chose to do so, "[s]tay the effect of its judgment for a limited time to give the local governing body an opportunity to amend or modify the ordinance” to comply with the court’s decision. <em>Casey, </em><a href="/pa/459/0219-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="459 Pa. 219" data-case-ids="480992" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0219-01">328 A.2d at </a>468 (citing 53 P.S. § 11009(2) (repealed)).

Piper argues that the Open Courts Clause claim is "fairly comprised” within its statement of the issue on appeal to this Court, such that this Court may consider it under Pa.R.A.P. 1115(a)(3) ("The statement of questions [in a petition for allowance of appeal] will be deemed to include every subsidiary question fairly comprised therein.”). While we disagree with that assessment, the more fundamental point is that the issue is waived under Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). In any event, Piper's claim seems to be based on the presumption that by challenging the <em>C &amp; M </em>restrictions, Piper gained a vested right to develop its property at the density that it proposed. As noted above, that is not the case.</p>
