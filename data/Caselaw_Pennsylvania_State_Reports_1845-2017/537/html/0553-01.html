Nonetheless, the referee denied benefits, concluding that the testimony of an audiologist, standing alone, was insufficient to establish employment-related hearing loss, citing <em>Pare v. </em>

The only remaining limitation is that the petition be filed within eighteen months of the Board’s prior order. In rejecting this argument, the Commonwealth Court concluded that the legis<a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>lature simply could not have intended this result even though a literal reading of Section 426 supports this conclusion. The Commonwealth Court found it inconceivable that the Board could retain any sort of jurisdiction in a case wherein the Commonwealth Court has entered a final order. While that argument may seem infallible at first glance, when one considers that the legislature giveth jurisdiction to the intermediate appellate courts, it can also take away jurisdiction. It would seem that the Commonwealth Court seeks to protect its turf. The legislature has spoken clearly and it is not for the courts to rewrite the legislation to suit its fancies.</p>
    <p id="b789-4" data-blocks='[["BL_789.4",789,[183,1003,1155,318]]]'>The Commonwealth Court’s concern that permitting the Board to grant rehearings after a final order of the court would permit the Board to overrule the court is not well founded. The rehearing is to consider evidence not previously presented and considered by either the Board or the court. In effect, a new case would be heard and decided.</p>
    <p id="b789-5" data-blocks='[["BL_789.5",789,[185,1364,1155,319]]]'>It is suggested that the scheme which a literal reading of Section 426 provides may be inimicable to judicial economy, it may be that the legislature, intentionally or not, has made the goal of judicial economy subservient to other concerns addressed by the Act which is, after all, a remedial Act, intended to make whole those who have been injured at work.</p>
