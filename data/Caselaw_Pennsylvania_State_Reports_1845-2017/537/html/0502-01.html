(Miner) to demolish the house. Appellees further alleged that during the demolition, bricks and debris from the house fell onto the abutting sidewalk and street, and that community residents complained to Appellant about the dangerous conditions of the demolition site and the adjacent sidewalk and street. As a result of these complaints, Appellant erected barricades around the bricks and debris so that pedestrians would not walk on the affected sidewalk and street, but would be required to walk around the barricades on unobstmcted sidewalks and the street.</p>

The Honorable Abraham Gafni of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County agreed with Appellant and granted summary judgment in its favor. The Commonwealth Court affirmed that portion of the trial court’s order granting summary judgment for the actions of the police in arriving at the accident scene late, but reversed on the question of whether Appellant’s control of the street and sidewalk area around the demolition site were substantial factors bringing about the accident. That court concluded that sufficient facts were pled in Appellees’ complaint to establish that Appellant’s conduct in maintaining the sidewalk and street created a dangerous condition which, in some part, directly caused Joseph’s injuries and, under such circumstances, it would be better to allow a jury to determine the exact extent of the liability of Appellant to Appellees. <em>Kiley v.

We were careful to explain that as a matter of statutory construction, the Legislature had insulated local agencies from liability for those injuries which could be imputed to it based upon a theory of vicarious liability, but could still be found responsible as a concurrent joint tortfeasor regardless of how many other tortfeasors contributed by their wrongdoings to the injury of another. Applying the classically accepted understanding of a concurrent joint tortfeasor we concluded that a local agency would be responsible in damages to an injured party where its actions have no legal relationship to the actions of other tortfeasors, where the local agency owes a duty to the injured party independent from the duties owed by the other tortfea-sors to the injured party and where the negligence of the local agency is determined to be a direct cause of the injuries sustained by the injured party—in short, does not merely facilitate an injury.</p>

Acts of the local agency which make the sidewalk unsafe for the activities for which it is regularly used, for which it is intended to be used, or for which it may reasonably be foreseen to be used, are acts which make the local agency amenable to suit. Thus, accidents which arise out of the use of the sidewalk in its unsafe condition would constitute a “dangerous condition” and would fall within the exception to local agency immunity.</p>
    <p id="b740-4" data-blocks='[["BL_740.4",740,[240,934,1158,1340]]]'>It is not enough, however, for a claimant to assert that the sidewalk constituted a dangerous condition. Appellees were also required to demonstrate that the dangerous condition of the sidewalk <em>itself </em>caused Joseph’s injuries. We have consistently maintained our view that the focus of the negligent act involving a use of government owned or controlled land (including streets and sidewalks) must be the actual defect of the land itself and that the rule of immunity can be waived only in those cases where it is alleged that the artificial condition or defect of the land itself causes the injury. <em>Mascaro, Snyder, Crowell. </em>Here, it is alleged that the condition of the sidewalk made it impossible for its intended use, but Joseph was not injured while using the sidewalk. In fact, the allegations of Appellees’ complaint indicate that because of the condition of the sidewalk it could not be used and that, therefore, Joseph was walking on the street when he was injured by the Johanson vehicle. Nor is it alleged that there were any defects on the street or that the artificial condition of the street itself caused Joseph’s injuries. What Appellees are really arguing is that the Appellant knew or should have known that by obstructing the sidewalk they were forcing people to walk on the street, thereby creating an inherently dangerous condition and should have taken action to prevent any harm from occurring. As appealing as this theory is, it is not supported by any exception to our immunity statute.</p>

It is conduct alleged to be a direct cause of the severe trauma and devastation of life suffered by Joseph. Appellant and the operator of the motor vehicle bore no legal relation to one another. Each of. them owed an independent duty to Joseph, and, upon proper proof, a jury could reasonably determine that the conduct of Appellant gave rise to a dangerous condition that was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm suffered by Joseph. If such a determination were made, there would exist no basis for indemnification of Appellant by the operator of the motor vehicle.

In <em>Snyder, </em>this Court found that a dangerous condition arising from a deep strip mine in close proximity to a highway did not fall within an exception to immunity. <em>Snyder </em>requires <em>only </em>that the dangerous condition originate from or have as its source Commonwealth realty. Unquestionably, Appellees have alleged and the evidence of record could support a finding that the dangerous condition in the matter <em>sub judice </em>originated from and had as its source Appellant’s property. Thus, I must conclude that the majority is invading the province of the jury to determine whether Appellant was a joint tortfeasor. The only other conceivable conclusion is that the majority has impliedly determined that the conduct of the other driver was a superseding intervening cause of the accident. However, such a determination is clearly unwarranted under the facts of the matter <em>sub judice.</em>

In my opinion, the facts of the matter <em>sub judice </em>are not distinguishable where the catastrophic injuries suffered by Joseph are alleged to have been directly caused by the Appellant’s negligence in erecting sidewalk barricades, which quite arguably could have directed Joseph into the street.

The record before us could easily support the conclusion that in the absence of an alternative walkway, the presence of abandoned vehicles further exacerbated the impact of Appellee’s barricades, thus directing Joseph even further into the street.</p>
