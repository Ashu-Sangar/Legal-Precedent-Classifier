    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[253,909,1157,475]]]'>The claimant, Audley Patton, worked as a welder for Lane Enterprises, Inc. (Lane) until April 24, 1987, when he developed a work-related disability from exposure to zinc fumes. A Notice of Compensation Payable was issued on November 28, 1988, providing for a weekly disability rate of $313.77 based upon an average weekly wage of $470.65. This Notice was calculated from a wage statement completed by Lane including a $2,750 bonus paid to the claimant and prorated over each of the four quarters included in the wage statement.</p>

In affirming the Board, the Commonwealth Court relied upon subsection (d) above and its own holding in <em>Boro of Midland v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Granito), </em>127 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 462, <a href="/pa-commw/127/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="561 A.2d 1332" data-case-ids="1391598" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/127/0462-01">561 A.2d 1332</a> (1989).</p>

The claimant argued that the vacation pay should be included in the quarter it was paid, while the employer contended that it should be prorated over the entire year. In affirming the Board which had accepted the claimant’s argument, initially, Commonwealth Court acknowledged that the Workmen’s Compensation Act is remedial in nature and that no provision of the Act indicated that vacation pay should be prorated throughout the year rather than be included in a particular quarter. The court was then persuaded by two factors: 1) a lack of evidence to contradict a factual conclusion that the employer had treated the vacation pay as wages during the fourth quarter, and 2) reliance upon a <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>provision of § 309(d) which provides that the “average weekly wage shall be the most favorable to the employee.” Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth concluded that the Board committed no error of law when it included claimant’s vacation pay in the quarter it was received.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.4",662,[271,640,1154,310]]]'>Like the court in <em>Boro of Midland, </em>Commonwealth Court in this instance concluded that § 309(d) required the referee to include the bonus in the quarter it was received rather than being prorated over the year. It did so by relying upon the language of subsection (d) which states that “... the average weekly wage shall be the wage most favorable to the employee</p>
    <p id="b662-5" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[269,1036,1156,631]]]'>Unlike Commonwealth Court, we are not persuaded that the above-quoted language of subsection (d) supports the conclusion that a bonus must be included in the quarter paid to ensure the most favorable wage to the employee. Instead, the above-quoted language plainly refers to selecting the highest average weekly wage from the four 13-week periods. The phrase immediately following the above-quoted language states “computed by dividing by thirteen the total wages a said employee earned in the employ of the employer in the first, second, third, or fourth period of thirteen weeks____” Clearly, Commonwealth Court has taken the “most favorable” language above out of context.</p>
    <p id="b662-8" data-blocks='[["BL_662.6",662,[266,1692,1155,524]]]'>Likewise, reliance upon <em>Boro of Midland </em>is misplaced. Unlike the employer in <em>Boro of Midland, </em>Lane did provide evidence that the bonus claimant received was “earned” as the result of job performance during 1986. In fact, the referee specifically found that the bonus was based upon profits and performance during 1986. In contrast, the employer in <em>Boro of Midland </em>argued that claimant’s vacation pay was earned during 1983 when in fact the employer treated it as wages in the fourth quarter of 1984. Accordingly, the <em>Boro of Midland </em>does not control the disposition of this appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b663-3" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[212,361,1153,801]]]'>
      <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>Section 309 does not directly address the issue here of the proper allocation of a “bonus.” There is no dispute that the bonus is calculated on the basis of <em>yearly </em>performance. Section 309(c) indicates that if at the time of injury the wages are fixed by the year, the average weekly wage is calculated by dividing the yearly wage by fifty-two. Effectively, if an employee receives a yearly wage, that yearly wage is prorated over fifty-two weeks under Section 309(c). Although technically claimant’s bonus is not a yearly wage, it is monies earned over a year’s time and paid in one lump sum. In that respect, claimant’s bonus is very similar to a yearly wage. In those instances when a claimant receives a yearly wage, the legislature has indicated that that yearly wage must be prorated over fifty-two weeks. No rational reason has been presented to treat claimant’s bonus any differently.</p>

As such, reading subsection (d) as Commonwealth Court does under these facts would create such an unreasonable result. Although it is undisputed that the bonus is earned over a year’s time, Commonwealth Court would require that the bonus be considered in the quarter it is received. If a bonus based on the overall success of the business over a prior year is “earned” for purposes of entitlement of compensation, why should that bonus not be prorated over that prior year? Reason dictates that it should.</p>
