We held that the municipality owed no duty to the injured plaintiffs. These cases involved municipalities who failed to repair fences and prevent injury of minors caused by third parties. This is properly characterized as non-feasance. Had the School District failed to act in the instant case, I would have no objection to applying the <em>Gardner </em>line of cases and finding no duty. For example, had the School District failed to maintain its fences, and had a hole in one of its fences encouraged children to cross a busy road to enter the grounds through that hole, I would find no duty on the part of the School District if a child were hurt crossing the road. However, here, the Petitioner alleges an act of misfeasance-the purposeful design and construction of a dangerous entrance to school grounds without improvements or warning signs. As such, the law of negligence is quicker to recognize a duty in cases such as the instant case than in three cases relied upon by the Majority.</p>

The instant case involves an invitee who was legitimately crossing a highway to attend an event held by the defendant School District. In <em>Gardner, Lynch </em>and <em>Scarborough </em>it would appear to me that we were leary to create a duty on the part of municipalities to maintain fences so as to prevent minors from trespassing on a third party’s land and exposing themselves to hazards. The policy supporting our decision in those cases appears to be twofold. First, we recognized that it would be incongruous to create a duty on the part of municipalities to maintain fences where they were not required to erect them in the first place. <em>See Scarborough, </em><a href="/pa/523/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="523 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1820316" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0030-01">523 Pa. at 38</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="523 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1820316" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0030-01">565 A.2d at 126</a>. Second, it <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>appears to me that we were concerned with the traditional notion of a lesser duty to a trespasser and the unfairness of creating a duty on the part of a municipality to prevent trespassers from passing onto the property of a third party and injuring themselves. <em>See Gardner, </em><a href="/pa/524/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="524 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="1822782" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0445-01">524 Pa. at 455</a>, <a href="/pa/524/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="524 Pa. 445" data-case-ids="1822782" data-case-paths="/pa/524/0445-01">573 A.2d at 1021</a> (“It follows that the city owes no duty of care to persons who crawl through or walk toward holes in city fences bordering city land and are injured on neighboring land by instrumentalities over which the city has no control ...” The instant case does not present any of the concerns that motivated our decisions in <em>Gardner, Lynch </em>and <em>Scarborough. </em>Instead, this case presents a set of concerns uniquely its own.</p>

    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[251,1224,1156,1173]]]'>In the instant case, I have considered the relevant law and have concluded that a finding of a duty in the instant case on the part of the School District is both proper as a matter of law, and beneficial as a matter of policy. The School District could readily foresee that one of the consequences of placing a pedestrian entrance to its facilities without adequate warning signs at a point that would encourage children to cross a busy road would be injury to children. The School District also had knowledge of the design and the danger it presented to children as the entrance was in plain sight in front of the school. This fact, of course, distinguishes the instant case from <em>Gardner, Lynch, </em>and <em>Scarborough </em>as in those cases it was not established that the municipality had any knowledge that the fences were in disrepair. Also, there is a unique relationship between the School District and the Petitioner in this case as the Petitioner was a student in the District’s schools. The School District invited the Petitioner to a scheduled event on it grounds. Petitioner was crossing Route 19 to attend this event when hit by an automobile. This further distinguishes the instant case from the cited trio of cases as here the Petitioner was legitimately on the road while crossing to a parcel of land where she was an invitee.</p>

      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>Upon reviewing other considerations traditionally employed by courts, I believe that, as a matter of public policy, that a finding of duty in the instant case would be socially beneficial and not unduly burdensome on School Districts such as the defendant. Narrowly drawn, I believe that the creation of such a duty in the instant case will do no more than force our school officials to take a second look at their facilities and insure that their entrances are safely designed and placed so as not to imperil the lives of children. At most, School districts may have to reevaluate the design of entrances to their schools and move or replace them where they present a danger to children. At the very least, a duty here would require no more on the part of School Districts than to provide such improvements or warning signs where they have entrances along busy roadways. Installing signs, crosswalks, or flashing lights at entrances to school facilities does not strike me as a burdensome or excessive cost where the safety of children is at stake. Also, I do not anticipate that the creation of such a duty would result in much new litigation as the facts of the case are fairly unique.</p>

This also distinguishes the instant case from the <em>Gardner, Lynch </em>and <em>Scarborough </em>trio. In those cases the asserted claims were based on Sections 323, 365, 343, and 339 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. We did not consider or interpret Section 364. This Section provides that a “possessor of land is subject to liability to others outside of the land for physical harm caused by a structure or artificial condition on the land, which the possessor realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of harm, if ... the possessor has created the condition.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> Comment a to Section <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>364 explains that “the rule stated in this Section relates only to structures and other artificial conditions, which, as and when created, involve an unreasonable risk of physical harm to persons outside the land because of their plan, construction, location or otherwise.” Here, the location of the entrance created a dangerous condition because it required students to cross Route 19 exposing the injured minor to danger.</p>
    <p id="b320-4" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[263,750,1159,1122]]]'>We would not be the first court to hold that a dangerous entrance created a duty under Section 364. In <em>Langen v. Rushton, </em><a href="/mich-app/138/0672-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="138 Mich.

While exiting, the driver hit the plaintiff who was driving south on the road abutting this entrance. In the median strip of the entrance was a tree which obstructed the view of the driver who hit the plaintiff while leaving the center. The plaintiff maintained that the owners of the center negligently planned the entrance by allowing trees to be planted in the median. The owners of the center argued that they owed no duty to the plaintiff that would support a negligence claim. The court found that such a duty existed citing Section 364 and noting that it was entirely foreseeable that a serious accident could occur between an exiting customer and a highway motorist. The court found no requirement that the artificial condition itself must physically cause the injury. It was sufficient that the planning and location of the condition caused the injury, although the injury was physically created by a third party motorist. This is precisely the situation in the instant case.</p>

I do not believe that the <em>Gardner, Lynch </em>and <em>Scarborough </em>cases are dispositive of the issue at hand.
