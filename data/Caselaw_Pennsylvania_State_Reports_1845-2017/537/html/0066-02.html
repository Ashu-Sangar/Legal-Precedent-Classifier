I believe an issue of due process and fundamental fairness is involved and I would remand for an evidentiary hearing to establish the propriety of the Commissioner’s Account.</p>
    <p id="b299-15" data-blocks='[["BL_299.16",299,[216,1826,1158,420]]]'>In its fiduciary role as Statutory Liquidator of an insolvent, the Commissioner is required to file an account and a plan of distribution. In its account, the Commissioner has shown receipts of $264,823.17 and administrative expenses of $188,-677.71. No itemization and justification for the administration costs has been shown. The Commonwealth Court approved the account without receiving any evidence to justify the expenditures.</p>

Since the claimant has an interest in the fund, it has a right to know if the fund is being erroneously charged with improper administrative costs. After all, the greater the administrative costs, the less is left for distribution to the approved claimants.</p>

Because my colleagues of the majority deny this basic right to the claimants, I dissent.</p>
