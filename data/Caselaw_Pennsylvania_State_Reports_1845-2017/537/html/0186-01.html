The eight appellants— employed as school nurses, guidance counsellors, and school psychologists—-were denied loan forgiveness benefits by PHEAA on the basis that they were not engaged in full-time teaching under the loan forgiveness act. PHEAA’s actions were upheld by the Commonwealth Court, which correctly applied a “clearly erroneous” standard of review to an agency’s interpretation of a statute, as we must do as well. An interpretation by the agency charged with a statute’s implementation is accorded great weight and will be overturned only if such a construction is clearly erroneous. <em>See Wiley House v.

    <p id="b423-4" data-blocks='[["BL_423.5",423,[197,531,1156,732]]]'>This would end our inquiry were it not for the adamant and importunate assertion by appellants that 1 Pa.C.S. § 1932 (“statutes in pari materia”) compels a different result. This rule of statutory construction states: “(a) Statutes or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things, (b) Statues in pari materia shall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.” Appellants argue that the school code, defining, in 24 P.S. § 11-1141, “teacher” to include nurses, guidance counselors, and psychologists, is in pari materia with the loan forgiveness act so that they should be construed together as one act, and the word “teacher” in the latter statute must be understood as the word is defined in the school code.</p>
    <p id="b423-5" data-blocks='[["BL_423.6",423,[193,1297,1159,961]]]'>This argument strongly suggests the fallacy of petitio prin-cipii, begging the question or circular reasoning. If the loan forgiveness act and the school code relate to the same class of persons or things, then they are in pari materia; if they are in pari materia, then they should be construed together as one act; if they are construed together as one act, then the statutory definition of “teacher” in the school code should apply to the loan forgiveness act as well; if the school code definition of “teacher” applies to the loan forgiveness act, then the word “teacher” in the loan forgiveness act includes nurses, guidance counselors, and psychologists in addition to teachers; if the word “teacher” in both acts includes teachers, nurses, guidance counselors, and psychologists, then both acts relate to the same class of persons or things; therefore they are in pari materia and should be construed together as one act so that the school code definition of “teacher” should be applied to the loan forgiveness act and should include nurses, guidance counselors, and psychologists as well as teachers.</p>

    <p id="b424-5" data-blocks='[["BL_424.4",424,[246,823,1158,529]]]'>Without circular reasoning, the loan forgiveness act, by its own terms, relates only to teachers. By contrast, the relevant subdivision of the school code, by its terms, relates to a variety of professional employees in addition to teachers. Furthermore, the loan forgiveness act relates to a special incentive bonus program, distinguishing it from the school code subdivision which, relates to regular compensation for performance of hours, days, and years of contractual service. The two statutes thus relate to different persons and things. Therefore, we do not regard them to be in pari materia.</p>
