Appellant is correct, and a new trial is necessary due to inexcusably derelict representation by defense counsel.</p>
    <p id="b619-13" data-blocks='[["BL_619.12",619,[182,1706,1154,412]]]'>In the early morning hours of August 7, 1987, appellant, Curry Perry, took his neighbor, Michael Shuler, to a private masonic club in Philadelphia as his guest. The two drank together, then argued over Perry’s assertion that Shuler had broken into his apartment, then fought, and Perry stabbed Shuler twice in the chest, fatally wounding him. Perry supported the dying victim out of the club to the sidewalk, where he abandoned the victim and fled.</p>

Within a week after the killing, police twice entered Perry’s Philadelphia <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>apartment, once with a search warrant and once without, gaining access through the cooperation of the landlord, and observed that the apartment had been abandoned. Appellant told William Arnold, a co-worker and friend, that he would not be returning to work because he had been in a fight in a bar and had stabbed a fellow because he had been breaking into his apartment. The police were unable to locate Perry for nineteen months, then received a telephone tip which enabled them to arrest him on March 17, 1989.</p>

On May 25, 1989, defense counsel obtained authorization to retain a private investigator at court expense. Counsel retained an investigator on February 21, 1990, voir dire began on February 26, and the two phases of appellant’s trial occurred from March 1 through March 9, 1990. At appellant’s death sentence hearing on March 8, the Commonwealth proved that appellant had pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1979, which constitutes an aggravating circumstance under 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(ll), and the jury returned a verdict of death. Post-verdict motions were heard on October 28, 1990, and sentence was pronounced on November 15, 1990. This automatic appeal pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(1) followed, but trial counsel failed to file a brief with this court for sixteen months after the appeal was docketed. He was permitted to withdraw after present appellate counsel entered his appearance on May 18, 1992.</p>

Under further prodding by the court, appellant testified that trial counsel had failed to investigate an eyewitness, Doris (mentioned by the bartender, the Com<a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>monwealth’s only eyewitness, during his trial testimony). The court discredited this allegation, as appellant did not know her last name or address, before telling appellant to be seated and directing trial counsel to proceed.</p>
    <p id="b622-4" data-blocks='[["BL_622.4",622,[216,571,1161,1056]]]'>With regard to the use of a private investigator, trial counsel waited nine months after receiving authorization on May 25, 1989, until February 21, 1990, five days before jury selection, to consult with an investigator. Compounding this dilatory performance, trial counsel did not instruct the investigator to seek eyewitnesses, but told him only to interview three specific character witnesses. The investigator located two of the three, both of whom were complimentary toward appellant and were willing to testify. One of them, a clergyman who had employed appellant on a recurring basis over a period of years, would have testified that appellant was “a very nice person who was quiet and a good worker,” who “kept in contact ... almost on a daily basis to secure work.” Trial counsel then failed to interview either of the two witnesses located by his investigator, instructed him not to subpoena them, and disdained to call them to testify at appellant’s trial or death penalty hearing. Appellant asserts an absolute right to have his counsel attempt to interview Commonwealth witnesses, such as Smith, and to attempt to locate other witnesses, such as Doris, through them.</p>

Appellant claims that he was clearly prejudiced by his attorney’s failure to interview him prior to trial and the failure to litigate a meritorious motion to suppress identifications, physical evidence, and statements.</p>

At the post-verdict motions hearing, quoted above, defense counsel admitted the incomprehensible fact that on February 22, 1990, four days before jury selection, he was unaware that appellant’s was a capital <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> He did not request a continuance or other appropriate relief when he belatedly learned that the Commonwealth was seeking the death penalty. Thus, on the eve of trial, counsel was unaware that his client faced the death penalty, apparently considered it a routine case which in his view did not require an interview with his client, and could not prepare for a death penalty hearing since he did not know it was a capital case. Thus he did not interview the character witnesses discovered by his investigator, nor subpoena them to testify for his client. Finally, he presented a travesty of a case at the death penalty hearing, which consisted of the following:</p>

It is not even arguable that counsel’s failure to utilize his investigator for nine months until the eve of trial could have had any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interest. The other allegations of ineffectiveness, fitting broadly under the rubric of failure to prepare for trial, are not even arguably reasonable tactics serving some broad strategic plan for the defense. Failure to prepare is not an example of forgoing one possible avenue to pursue another approach; it is simply an abdication of the minimum performance required of defense counsel.
