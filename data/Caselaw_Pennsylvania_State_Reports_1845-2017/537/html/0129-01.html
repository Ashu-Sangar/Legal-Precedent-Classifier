Our conclusion is bolstered by the fact that Windrim’s argument, if accepted, would actually contravene the legislative intent behind the MVFRL by serving as a disincentive to insure vehicles. As Judge Popovich observed, “[a] possible result ... is that many individuals owning several vehicles will purchase coverage for only one of them. Likewise, relatives living with an insured will be less inclined to purchase insurance for their vehicles, instead seeking uninsured motorist coverage under their relative’s insurance policy.” <em>Windrim, </em><a href="/pa-super/412/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="412 Pa.

In that case, Henrich was a “covered person” under the terms of the policy since she resided in her father’s household. The policy at issue in <em>Henrich </em>contained no express exclusion of the type contained in the policy at issue in the instant case.

In addition, it is axiomatic that the cost of insurance will be reduced as a result of providers not having to pay benefits to uninsured persons who have failed to comply with the law and thereby failed to contribute to the resources necessary for a comprehensive insurance program.

Although not pertinent to my position in the instant concurring opinion, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the operation of the claimant’s own uninsured vehicle, irrespective of fault, is a relevant <em>factor.' </em>Assuming that there was no contractual exclusion at issue here, the fact that Windrim was operating his own uninsured vehicle at the time of the accident, standing alone, would not preclude his recovery of uninsured motorist benefits. Under the MVFRL, uninsured motorist benefits are meant to provide protection for motorists who suffer injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle as a result of the legal liability of an uninsured motorist. Specifically, Section 1731(b) of the MVFRL provides in pertinent part:</p>
      <blockquote id="b373-8" data-blocks='[["BL_373.1",373,[261,1622,1087,189]]]'>
        <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>
        <em>Uninsured Motorist </em>Coverage—Uninsured motorist coverage shall provide protection for persons who suffer injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle and are legally entitled to recover damages therefor from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles.</blockquote>
      <p id="b373-9" data-blocks='[["BL_373.2",373,[228,1821,1121,190]]]'>75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(b). In other words, uninsured motorist benefits are available, not because the injured person is himself uninsured, but rather, because the injuries suffered by him were the legal result of another uninsured motorist. Furthermore, in pertinent part, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1702 defines "uninsured motor vehicles” as:</p>
      <blockquote id="b373-10" data-blocks='[["BL_373.3",373,[261,2018,1086,154]]]'>(3) an <em>unidentified </em>motor vehicle that causes an accident resulting in injury provided that the accident is reported to the police ... and the claimant notifies his insurer within 30 days ... that the claimant ... has a legal action arising out of the accident. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>
      <p id="ajc-dedup-0" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[226,2175,1121,233]]]'>Accordingly, and but for the exclusion contained in the policy at issue, if it were ultimately determined that there was, indeed, a hit-and-run driver who caused the accident and Windrim’s resulting injuries, the fact that Windrim was driving his own uninsured vehicle does not, standing alone, bear on the issue of whether he was entitled to uninsured motorist coverage.</p>
