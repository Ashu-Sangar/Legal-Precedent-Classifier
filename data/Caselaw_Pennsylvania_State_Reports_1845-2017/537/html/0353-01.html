      <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>Alpha is a Pennsylvania business corporation which holds a vehicle dealer license issued by the Board for a location in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. Alpha was charged with violating Section 10(12) of the Board of Vehicles Act, 63 P.S. § 818.10(12), by selling new vehicles without possessing a written authorization or franchise agreement from the manufacturer. At all times relevant hereto, Alpha operated only as a used car dealership. More specifically, it has never had a franchise agreement with the manufacturer, importer or distributor of Yugo automobiles.</p>
    <p id="b587-5" data-blocks='[["BL_587.4",587,[202,919,1155,1322]]]'>In 1988, Alpha purchased twenty-four 1988 Yugo automobiles from a used car dealer in New Jersey, which had acquired the Yugos from two new Yugo franchise dealers in New Jersey. The Yugos had not previously been in the hands of a consumer or titled for use in New Jersey. There is indication in the record that eight of the cars had odometer readings under fifty-two miles (see Appellant’s brief at p. 19), and it appears that the mileage on each car was slight and that most consumers would regard the cars as new for all practical purposes. On November 21 and December 7, 1988, Alpha obtained certificates of title for eighteen of the Yugos. Each of the certificates contained the notation: REGISTRATION NOT TO BE ISSUED—TAX UNPAID. Alpha did not pay sales or use taxes on any of the Yugos in either New Jersey or Pennsylvania. Alpha brought the Yugos into its Stroudsburg dealership and between November, 1988 and April 5, 1989, sold nineteen of the Yugos to consumers. At the time of the sales, Alpha represented that the cars were “used,” and advised consumers that the manufacturer’s warranty had begun to run. Alpha, of course, never had a franchise agreement with the manufacturer, importer or distributor of Yugo automobiles to sell them as new vehicles; and Alpha sold the Yugos in question as it sells autos in the normal course of its used car business in that Pennsylvania sales tax was not paid by Alpha but by the consumer at the time of sale.</p>

On appeal, the Board adopted all of the findings of fact of the hearing examiner, but concluded, based on its own reading of the Vehicles Act, that the Yugos in question were “new” vehicles. The following statutory language supplies the legislature’s definition of a “new vehicle”: “... [T]he term ‘new vehicle’ shall mean a new vehicle which has never been registered or titled in Pennsylvania or any other state on which a tax for education [ie., a sales tax] ... has not been paid prior to the sale.” 63 P.S. § 81.10(12). The Board read this section to establish a two-prong test that defines a new vehicle as one: 1) that has never been registered or titled in Pennsylvania or any other state which imposes a sales tax, and 2) on which the sales tax has not been paid prior to sale to a consumer. Since no tax had been paid on Alpha’s Yugos, they were held by the Board to be new vehicles. The Board entered an order levying a $4,500.00 civil penalty and a ninety day license suspension on Alpha.</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[232,1342,1161,838]]]'>On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed the Board on the grounds that Section 10(12) of the Act provides for a <em>three pronged </em>test for determining whether a vehicle is a new vehicle. The Commonwealth Court’s three-pronged test requires that to be a new vehicle: 1) it must be a new vehicle; 2) it must be one which has never been titled or registered in Pennsylvania or any other state which imposes a sales tax; and 3) the tax has not been paid prior to sale. Relying on Webster’s Third New International Dictionary’s tautological definition of the word “new” as something “recently come into existence,” the Commonwealth Court reasoned that the vehicles here in question were clearly not new. Moreover, the Commonwealth Court could not find any evidence in the record that Alpha engaged in fraudulent practices because it sold the cars as used and had disclosed the running of their warranties.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[232,2213,1158,202]],["BL_589.1",589,[217,352,1154,355]]]'>We granted the Board’s petition for allowance of appeal in the instant case because the Board persuasively argued that the Commonwealth Court exceeded their proper scope of review here in reversing the Board and moreover that the <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>Commonwealth Court reversal thwarts legitimate legislative purposes and specifically ignores the dangers of “grey marketing,” that is, the sale of vehicles out of franchise with no warranty protection and no risk of investment by the dealer, dangers to which consumers may be subjected. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and reinstate the order of the Board.</p>
    <p id="b589-4" data-blocks='[["BL_589.4",589,[218,747,1157,1530]]]'>What constitutes a “new” vehicle may, of course, vary depending on the circumstances. To paraphrase Justice Frankfurter’s dissent in the famous case of <em>Hoffman v. Blaski, </em><a href="/us/363/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="363 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="6165319" data-case-paths="/us/363/0335-01">363 U.S. 335</a>, <a href="/us/363/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="363 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="6165319" data-case-paths="/us/363/0335-01">80 S.Ct. 1084</a>, <a href="/us/363/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="363 U.S. 335" data-case-ids="6165319" data-case-paths="/us/363/0335-01">4 L.Ed.2d 1254</a> (1960), one would have to be singularly unmindful of the treachery and versatility of the English language to deny that as a mere matter of English the words “new vehicle” may carry more than one meaning. The proper place to begin the appropriate inquiry is not, however, with the dictionary but with due deference to the views of the regulatory agency directly involved in administering the statute in question. We have long held that the “contemporaneous construction of a statute by those charged with its execution and application, especially when it has long prevailed, is entitled to great weight and should not be disregarded or overturned except for cogent reasons and unless it is clear that such construction is erroneous.” <em>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Board of Finance and Review, </em><a href="/pa/368/0463-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="368 Pa. 463" data-case-ids="1230387" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0463-01">368 Pa. 463</a>, 471, <a href="/citations/?q=84%20A.2d%20495" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="84 A.2d 495">84 A.2d 495</a>, 499 (1951). The instant Commonwealth Court opinion itself recognizes that “an administrative agency’s expert interpretation of a statute for which it has enforcement responsibility is entitled to great deference and will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.” <em>Mormak v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, </em><a href="/pa-commw/135/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="135 Pa. Commw. 232" data-case-ids="1406802" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/135/0232-01">135 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 232</a>, 237, <a href="/pa-commw/135/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="135 Pa.

Yet, no cogent reason was advanced here by the Commonwealth Court to justify either their clear departure from this sound principle of limited review or, substantially, to overturn the Board’s quite reasonable view of what constitutes a “new vehicle.”</p>
    <p id="b589-5" data-blocks='[["BL_589.5",589,[220,2309,1153,96]],["BL_590.1",590,[226,357,1160,1305]]]'>In addition, the Board’s view on this matter is supported by cogent reasons and a sensible public policy. The Board points <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>out that the Commonwealth Court decision, if allowed to stand, would open the door for a new “grey market” or a “second tier of new car dealers” which would have significant detrimental effects on the existing franchise system that assures that new vehicles sold in the United States were intended by the manufacturer for distribution in the United States. The current franchise system helps assure that vehicles distributed within the system are warranted, meet safety standards, and have parts and services available. The Commonwealth Court’s decision, argues the Board, would permit a vehicle to be distributed in Pennsylvania by individuals not authorized to do so by the manufacturer. The manufacturer would have no control over this unauthorized distribution. A vehicle could be classified as used because it passed from one dealer’s inventory to another. The potential result would be: uncertainty as to the quality of trademarked goods; lack of warranty protection to the consumer; unfair competitive risk to dealers legally operating within the franchise system; and the potential importation of vehicles that do not meet U.S. environmental and safety requirements and which are hence unauthorized by manufacturers for the United States market—this being the “grey market” problem. On this latter point see, <em>Direct Automobile Imports Association, Inc. v. Townsley, </em><a href="/f2d/804/1408-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="804 F.2d 1408" data-case-ids="1662776" data-case-paths="/f2d/804/1408-01">804 F.2d 1408</a> (5th Cir.1986).</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.4",590,[221,1706,1158,698]]]'>Purchasers of vehicles of the type sold by Alpha would also lose the protection of Pennsylvania’s Automobile Lemon Law, 73 P.S. § 1951 <em>et seq., </em>if the Commonwealth Court’s decision were allowed to stand. The Lemon Law requires manufacturers to provide a purchaser, at the time of original purchase of a <em>new </em>motor vehicle, with a written statement of his or her rights under the law—which include repair and return rights for the purchasers of <em>new </em>vehicles. See, 73 P.S. § 1952. In the instant case, vehicles purchased and resold by Alpha would not be “new” under the Commonwealth Court’s view, and hence their purchasers would be left unprotected by the Lemon Law, a result clearly undesirable as a matter of public policy.</p>

However, the Commonwealth Court concluded that these are used vehicles. The warranties began to run. The Automobile Lemon Law does not apply to used vehicles and used car dealers. Furthermore, lack of warranty protection and uncertainty as to quality always exist when purchasing a used car.</p>

However, on this issue I believe it would be appropriate to defer to the Board as the <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>expert administrative agency charged with the execution and application of the Board of Vehicles Act so it can define “new” in a manner consistent with its policy concerns.</p>
