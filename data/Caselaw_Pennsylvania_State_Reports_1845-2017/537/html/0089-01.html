Gibbons directed Leet to pull off the road, approached the car, and observed an open can of beer on the front seat. He asked Leet to exit the car to perform a field sobriety test. Leet complied and successfully performed the test administered by Gibbons. Gibbons asked Leet for his papers, and Leet had no driver’s license. Gibbons made a radio check of the status of Leet’s driving privileges and was informed that Leet’s license had been suspended. About this time, municipal police officer Donald Weber arrived on the scene to assist Gibbons.</p>
    <p id="b323-8" data-blocks='[["BL_323.7",323,[205,1591,1160,624]]]'>With Leet’s consent, Gibbons moved Leet’s car to a safer parking place; while in the car, Gibbons saw a live round of .357 ammunition on the floor and two paper bags behind the front seat. Subsequently, marijuana was found in one of the paper bags, and methamphetamine was found in the tape deck. Officer Weber then issued citations for driving with an expired license, in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1501; driving with an open can of beer, violating 75 Pa.C.S. § 3715; and passing in a no passing zone, a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 3307. Leet was subsequently charged with the additional offenses of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.</p>

    <p id="b324-7" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[242,1397,1158,1015]]]'>In addressing the question whether a sheriff may enforce the motor vehicle code as Gibbons did, the Superior Court treated the issue as one of statutory interpretation. The court reasoned that 75 Pa.C.S. § 6308(a) places a duty on motorists to exhibit their vehicle registration and driver’s license upon request <em>only </em>when requested by a “police officer,” a designation which does not include the sheriff or his deputies. The court also recited dozens of provisions of the motor vehicle code which refer to the powers and duties of “police officers” in the control of traffic and vehicles. The court rejected the argument of the Commonwealth that, on the basis of the common law, “sheriffs and deputy sheriffs have inherent power and authority to arrest without a warrant for all crimes, however, committed in their presence, including Vehicle Code violations.” The court reasoned that “an attempt to imply power where the same has not been granted by statute would be in direct violation of the legislature’s mandate that sheriffs and deputy sheriffs shall perform the duties imposed by statute.”</p>

    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[191,581,1160,1488]]]'>History records that, even prior to the Conquest, the sheriff was a powerful officer, with both judicial and executive powers. Lady Doris M. Stenton, in her historical masterwork <em>English Justice Between the Norman Conquest and the Great Charter: 1066-1215 </em>(1964), provides many details of the powers and duties of the sheriff. The work deals entirely with civil and ecclesiastical law to the exclusion of criminal law, though mention is made of enforcing “the peace of the sheriff’ as well as “the peace of the king.” <em>Id. </em>at 79; <em>The Earliest Lincolnshire Assize Rolls, </em>case 542, pp. 95-96. The sheriff nonetheless played a central role in the English civil courts from before the Norman Conquest until the Magna Carta; the sheriff was, at the beginning of the period, “a great local lord.” Stenton, <em>English Justice: 1066-1215, </em>at 80. Prior to the Conquest and in the decades immediately thereafter, the sheriff was more akin to a judge than a law enforcement officer, <em>id. </em>at 48, 55, 74, sheriffs serving at times as appellate judges, <em>id. </em>at 57. Then, in the gradual development of an official judicial class, pleas of the crown began to be removed from the jurisdiction of the sheriff and to be heard by a local justiciar in each shire. <em>Id. </em>at 65-67. Thus, in the civil realm, at least, the sheriffs role evolved from that of judge to that of court officer with authority “to summon suitors to the court, to collect amercements from defaulters and carry out the judgments of the court.” <em>Id. </em>at 67. Throughout the period 1066-1215, sheriffs were “men with powerful local connections,” <em>id., </em>and often, indeed, with powerful royal connections, <em>id. </em>at 80, 163, 171, 175.</p>

Even in the enforcement of court orders, the sheriff was no “errand boy,” but was authorized and expected to employ often-necessary force. “Many of the early writs ... are addressed to the sheriff ordering him to restore the complainant to seisin.” <em>Id. </em>at 80-81. The procedure replaced the Anglo-Saxon “self-help” remedy, and, in those far-off days, frequently involved the occurrence or risk of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 22-24. <em>&lt;See also id. </em>at 171-172.

The very word <em>justices </em>implies that the sheriff in obeying such writs was acting through the shire court as a judge in the modern sense. In obeying many viscontiel writs he was certainly acting in an executive capacity only, but it must have been difficult for a hard-pressed sheriff to be mindful of the distinction. But whether the suitors of the shire court were giving judgment in a case brought by one of their number by plaint, or the sheriff was acting on a <em>justicies </em>writ, or was leading the <em>posse comitatus </em>without writ to force a lord to replevy plough-beasts, all these pleas were part of the sheriffs work in the shire court.</blockquote>

Before we say more of it we must call to mind two points in our criminal procedure. In the first place, any preliminary magisterial investigation, such as that which is now-a-days conducted by our justices of the peace, is still in the remote future, though the coroners are already making inquest when there is violent death.... Secondly, there is no professional police force. <em>The only persons who are specially bound to arrest malefactors are the sheriff, his bailiffs and servants </em>and the bailiffs of those lords who have the higher regalities.</blockquote>

Though it may be unnecessary to cite additional authority, Blackstone confirms the common law power of the sheriff to make arrests without warrant for felonies and for breaches of the peace committed in his presence. Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Common Law, </em>Vol. IV, at 289. Indeed, such powers are so widely known and so universally recognized that it is hardly necessary to cite authority for the proposition.

Thus, we search the statutes for authority abrogating the common law power of the sheriff, rather than statutory authority for the sheriff to enforce the law—authority he has always possessed under common law. In other words, although the Superior Court searched in vain for a provision which grants the sheriff an enforcement power under the motor vehicle laws, it is instead necessary to search for a statutory provision which removes the enforcement power of the sheriff (which pre-existed the statute). The latter search is equally vain; there is, in the motor vehicle code, no unequivocal abrogation of the sheriffs common law power to arrest. It is evident, moreover, that the power to arrest subsumes the power to stop, detain, and investigate a motorist who breaches the peace while operating a motor vehicle in the presence of the sheriff.</p>

I also agree that Gibbons, regardless of his authorization to stop Leet, was acting under color of law so that state action is implicated and suppression of evidence is <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>appropriate if the stop is illegal. I cannot, however, accept the conclusion of the majority that the common law powers of the sheriff include the power to enforce the Motor Vehicle Code.</p>

Const, art. 9 § 4 (“County officers shall consist of ... sheriffs ... and such others as may from time to time be provided by law.”). The Constitution neither explains nor provides any duties for the sheriff. The General Assembly, however, has recently enacted legislation that provides some guidance.</p>

Chapter 29 of the Judicial Code imposes the duty on the county sheriff or his deputy to “serve process and execute orders directed to him pursuant to law.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 2921. The General Assembly has not conferred upon the office of sheriff or his deputies the authorization to make warrantless arrests for violations of the law. In contrast, such authority has been granted to other law enforcement officials.</p>

      <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>The initial motor vehicle violation in this case is improper passing which is governed by Chapter 33 and is designated by Chapter 65 of the Motor Vehicle Code as a summary offense. Therefore, the most likely place to find the sheriffs authorization to arrest the defendant is the Motor Vehicle Code. There is no such authority for any arrest under the specific chapter governing the rules of the road. Thus, it is governed by Chapter 63 which expressly authorizes only state police officers and other police officers to make arrests under the Motor Vehicle Code. I am therefore constrained to conclude that sheriffs and their deputies are not authorized to make arrests under the Motor Vehicle Code.</p>

However, our criminal code does not recognize the crime of the breach of peace. Conduct does not constitute a crime unless it is a crime under Title 18 or another statute of this Commonwealth. 18 Pa.C.S. § 107(b). The closest offense to a breach of peace that can be found in the statute is disorderly conduct which is prohibited by section 5503 of the Crimes Code. 18 Pa.C.S. § 5503. The Commonwealth did not establish the elements of disorderly conduct at the suppression hearing. Therefore, at the time that Deputy Sheriff Gibbons first instructed Leet to pull over, Leet had committed no offense other than improper automobile passing. Nonethe<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>less, the majority somehow elevates this summary traffic offense into a breach of the peace.</p>

In my view, the common law powers of the sheriff have been abrogated by statute and, on that basis, I respectfully dissent.</p>
