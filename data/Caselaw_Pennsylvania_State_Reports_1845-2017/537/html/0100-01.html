The Superior Court found that in enacting the corrupt organization statute, the Legislature was primarily concerned with the insidious effect of organized crime on legitimate businesses operating within the Commonwealth. Therefore, the court reasoned that the evil targeted by the corrupt organizations statute is the covert introduction of organized criminal activity into the law-abiding business community. The federal drug conspiracy statute, the court continued, targets illegal agreements to violate the federal drug laws. Furthermore, the federal drug trafficking laws are directed at controlling the illegal use of controlled substances to present the detrimental effect of such use. See 21 U.S.A.A. § 801(2). The Superior Court concluded that this activity is totally criminal. It does not directly impact upon legitimate business activity, nor is it an attempt to gain control of that community. <em>Commonwealth v.
