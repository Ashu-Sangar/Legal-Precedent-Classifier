It was in a location where parking was legal, but where vehicles were not commonly parked. The officer stopped nearby to observe. Another car arrived and parked across the street from appellant’s car. It’s driver began to alight but saw the police car and drove away. Appellant also drove away. He soon made a turn without using his turn signal, however, and was immediately stopped by the officer.</p>

He moved his hands close to the steering wheel but then reached quickly between his legs towards the driver’s side floor. Benincasa then ordered appellant to exit from the car. Appellant complied. While the driver’s door was open, the officer noticed a metal pipe approximately twenty-four inches in length and one inch in diameter, wedged between the driver’s seat and the door. The officer then directed appellant to go to the rear of the car and place his hands on the trunk lid. Appellant again complied. A pat-down search was conducted, but no weapons were found.</p>
