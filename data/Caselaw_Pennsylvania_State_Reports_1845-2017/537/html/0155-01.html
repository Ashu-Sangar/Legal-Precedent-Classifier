Bujak asked Catalano to step out of the car, and, because he suspected that Catalano might be intoxicated, administered a field sobriety test. Subsequently, he arrested Catalano for driving under the influence. Catalano pleaded guilty to the speeding charge and to disorderly conduct.</p>

Because some injuries, such as surgery, are known to involve pain and suffering, and because as a general proposition, injury victims are entitled to compensation for <em>all </em>they lose and suffer as a result of a tortious injury, <em>Boggavarapu v.

    <p id="b391-6" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[199,1247,1156,485]]]'>Further, Commonwealth Court determined that a new trial as to liability and damages was required because liability was contested and because liability was inextricably related to the issue of damages. Implicit in this rationale is that the verdict was what is sometimes called a compromise verdict. That is, although the jury believed that the defendant caused the injury, perhaps it was not fully convinced that the defendant was responsible for the totality of the injury, and reduced the damages accordingly.</p>

    <p id="b392-5" data-blocks='[["BL_392.5",392,[239,1064,1151,366]]]'>As to Catalano’s first point, on post-trial motions, Catalano requested a new trial on the issue of damages only. He made no request for a new trial on the issue of liability. Once Catalano demanded a new trial, the court was required first to address the question of whether a new trial must be granted.
