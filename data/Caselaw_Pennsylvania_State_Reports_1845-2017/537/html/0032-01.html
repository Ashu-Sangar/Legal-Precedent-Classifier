The referee found that claimant had promptly given notice to the respondent of his disability claim on July 23, 1985. After receiving all the testimony the referee concluded that the medical testimony of claimant’s expert was more persuasive and credible than that of the employer’s expert. Thus, the referee concluded that the claimant was permanently disabled due to coal worker’s pneumoconiosis and that his. disability had resulted from his employment within the coal industry in Pennsylvania. Further, the referee found that the claimant’s disability had occurred within 300 weeks of his last employment within the coal industry, where he was exposed to the hazards of the disease.</p>

First, the claimant unequivocally stated on direct examination that he was retired. The referee found as a fact that the claimant had retired as of March, 1981. In addition, the claimant was 68 years of age in 1988. After 42 years in the coal mining industry it is highly unlikely that the claimant intended to re-enter the work force. Second, focusing on the employer’s failure to show available work begs the question when the claimant clearly admits voluntary retirement from the work force.

I would not create an automatic presumption that voluntary retirement at a particular age means that one never intends to work again in any other endeavor.</p>
    <p id="b271-8" data-blocks='[["BL_271.9",271,[224,1384,1156,584]]]'>On a more fundamental level, I believe the majority is wrong in their loose reading of our Workmen’s Compensation Act. Nowhere does it say that retirement makes one ineligible for benefits. How could it when there are today few age bars to gainful employment? The majority decision is also contrary to comparable federal law. Under the Mine Safety and Health Act, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20801" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="30 U.S.C. § 801">30 U.S.C.A. § 801</a>, et seq., retirement before becoming totally disabled by pneumoconiosis does not deprive a miner of benefits. See, <em>Palmer Coking Coal Co. v. Director, Office of Worker’s Compensation Programs of U.S. Department of Labor, </em><a href="/f2d/720/1054-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="720 F.2d 1054" data-case-ids="1903884" data-case-paths="/f2d/720/1054-01">720 F.2d 1054</a> (C.A.9 1983).</p>
