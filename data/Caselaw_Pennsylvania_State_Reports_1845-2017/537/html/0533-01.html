Appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) petition in 1987 alleging several errors. Relief was denied without prejudice for procedural errors. In 1989, counsel was appointed to file a supplemental PCHA petition on a prior rape conviction but not for the murder conviction. The Governor signed Appellant’s death warrant in November 1991, scheduling the execution for the week of January 13, 1992. On January 7, 1992, however, Appellant retained counsel who in turn filed a Petition for Stay of Execution and Appointment of Counsel with tMs Court. Specifically, counsel asserted, as the basis for the stay, that the applicability of the finding of torture in tMs case was erroneous.</p>

At the PCRA hearing held pursuant to the remand order, Appellant argued that the death penalty was arbitrarily imposed because the jury improperly found the aggravating circumstance of torture because the trial court failed to define “torture” for the jury and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the inadequate charge in that regard. The <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>PCRA court rejected Appellant’s argument and affirmed the sentence of death on the basis that this Court, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(h), had already determined that the evidence was sufficient with regard to the aggravating circumstance of torture. <em>Commonwealth v. Fahy, </em>Nos. 2283-2289 (Phila.C.C.P. Dec. 8, 1992).</p>
    <p id="b769-5" data-blocks='[["BL_769.4",769,[191,700,1157,1115]]]'>The sole issue now before this Court is whether the PCRA court erred in affirming the sentence of death because Appellant’s trial counsel did not request that the trial court define “torture” as an aggravating circumstance which requires a specific intent to commit torture separate from the specific intent to commit murder. The trial judge’s jury charge in this case informed the jurors that a list of possible aggravating circumstances was included on the verdict sheet on which they were to indicate whether they believed such circumstances applied to the Appellant’s actions. No definition of “torture” was given by the trial judge, nor was a definition requested by defense counsel. An instruction that specific intent to torture the victim was needed in order to properly find torture as an aggravating circumstance was not required by this Court at the time.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Without such an instruction, Appellant claims that the instruction was prejudicially deficient and violative of his rights to the due process of law. He also claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to such a deficient instruction. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the ruling of the PCRA court upholding the Appellant’s sentence of death.</p>

Section 9711(d)(8). This case illustrates perhaps the clearest <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>example of a factual situation that the legislature intended to serve as an aggravating circumstance of torture sufficient to impose the death penalty. In that regard, it is precisely because the facts of this case are so egregious that we are able to conclude that there was no error in trial counsel’s failure to request a definition of the term “torture” for the jury because, pursuant to any conceivable definition of the term, Nicky Caserta was tortured to her death.</p>
    <p id="b770-5" data-blocks='[["BL_770.4",770,[241,807,1156,1450]],["BL_771.1",771,[180,360,1154,354]]]'>Indeed, the evidence produced at trial showed that the final hours of Nicky Caserta’s life were marked by unspeakable horrors, inflicted to satiate the sadistic appetite of the Appellant. She was beaten, raped, mutilated, hung, choked, kicked, strangled and, finally, stabbed multiple times until life finally ebbed from her small body.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> From a vantage point across the street, the Appellant watched as Nicky’s mother left for work on the morning of January 9, 1981. He proceeded across the street and was let in the Caserta home by Nicky. The Appellant was well known to Nicky because he and Nicky’s aunt were living together nearby. The Appellant asked Nicky to go upstairs and look for a pair of pliers for him. As soon as Nicky went up the steps, he locked the front door and followed her. Appellant then seized her, stuffed tissue in her mouth, wrapped a sweater around her face, and forced her to disrobe. Then, he raped her vaginally and anally. The injuries indicate that Appellant also violated his victim with some object that ripped the tissue of her genitals from the interior of the vagina to her rectum. Appellant then allowed the victim to dress, creating a cruelly false impression that the ordeal had ended. When Nicky, in a state of dazed terror, put her parochial school uniform on backwards, Appellant became enraged. He grabbed her and dragged her downstairs to the basement with his free hand around her mouth to stifle her cries. In the basement, while chanting, “Die, bitch,” Appellant tied a series of ligatures around the girl’s throat and watched her struggle for breath. He repeatedly choked Nicky <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>to a certain point and then released his hold, allowing her to fight for breath again. At one point he apparently suspended the girl from a rafter by her neck. Finally, apparently having tired of this depravity, Appellant secured a kitchen knife and stabbed Nicky 18 times in the chest, to her death, with such force that he broke off part of the blade finally causing her death.</p>
    <p id="b771-4" data-blocks='[["BL_771.4",771,[179,755,1159,1322]]]'>Appellant alleges that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request a definition of the term “torture” because if the jury had been given and guided by such an instruction, it might not have found that he tortured his victim. Essentially, Appellant’s claim amounts merely to the argument that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to assert that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury’s finding of torture. We have long maintained that a criminal defendant’s trial counsel cannot be held ineffective for failing to assert a meritless claim. <em>Commonwealth v. Moore, </em><a href="/pa/534/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="534 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="1839657" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0527-01">534 Pa. 527</a>, <a href="/pa/534/0527-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="534 Pa. 527" data-case-ids="1839657" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0527-01">633 A.2d 1119</a> (1993). Here, when this Court reviewed Appellant’s direct appeal for the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the finding of the aggravating circumstance of torture and sustained Appellant’s conviction and judgment of the sentence of death, we found, as a matter of law, that the jury’s finding of torture was sufficiently supported by the trial evidence. <em>Fahy, <a href="/pa/512/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="512 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1800478" data-case-paths="/pa/512/0298-01">supra.</a> See also </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(h)(3)(h) (“[t]he Supreme Court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance.... ”). Because of this Court’s specific review and verification of the sufficiency of the evidence, Appellant’s ineffectiveness claim fails because there is utterly no merit to his underlying claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to assert that the evidence supporting the jury’s finding of torture was legally insufficient.</p>

Nevertheless, despite the apparent unambiguity of the term “torture,” the Appellant contends that a new sentencing hearing is required because his trial attorney did not ask that the jury be instructed that to find “torture” as an aggravating circumstance, it must first find that Appellant additionally had to have the specific intent to inflict torture. Notably, it was not until <em>Nelson, supra, </em>approximately four years after Appellant’s conviction, that this Court decided that juries required guidance that “torture,” as an aggravating circumstance, meant that the accused’s criminal acts must have a separate specific intent to cause pain and suffering in addition to the intent to kill.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

Hence, I would hold that appellant has satisfied the prejudice prong of the test for ineffective assistance of counsel as set forth in <em>Commonwealth v.

A manifest injustice results from the majority permitting Appellant’s sentence of death to stand when the same would be vacated if it arose on direct appeal today. In sustaining Appellant’s sentence of death, the majority focuses on the horrifying facts of this case and loses sight of the legal issue. Simply stated, the law of this Commonwealth requires that an instruction be given defining the aggravating circumstance of torture. No instruction whatsoever was given in the instant case. Counsel was ineffective for failing to object and request such an instruction. Accordingly, I would vacate Appellant’s sentence of death and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing so that the jury would be instructed on the definition of torture as an aggravating circumstance.</p>

What Appellant suggests is precisely the law of this Commonwealth. In <em>Commonwealth v.

Should we therefore resolve the case before us assuming that only juries subsequent to <em>Nelson </em>require this guidance whereas juries prior thereto were somehow otherwise enlightened as to the definition of the term?

It was not until 1987 in <em>Nelson </em>that a case came before us raising the issue of whether counsel was ineffective for failing to request an adequate charge. Appellant did not challenge counsel’s effectiveness in this regard on direct appeal because he was still represented by trial counsel. Rather, he first <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>raised the contention when he was represented by other counsel in his PCRA petition.

We there held that “the term ‘knowingly’ used in § 9711(d)(7) does not require a unique understanding of the word.” 526 Pa. at 508, <a href="/pa/526/0497-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="526 Pa. 497" data-case-ids="1825894" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0497-01">587 A.2d at 711</a>.

I disagree, for the two issues are distinct. This Court has held that, in order to establish a claim of ineffectiveness, the Appellant must show that the underlying claim is of arguable merit; that the particular course of conduct chosen by counsel did not have some reasonable basis designed to effectuate Appellant’s interests; and that counsel’s ineffective stewardship prejudiced <em>him—i.e., </em>that counsel’s ineffectiveness “had an adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings.” <em>Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. 153</a>, 162, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d 973</a>, 977 (1987). The essence of the Majority’s position is that Appellant cannot establish prejudice. However, the fact that this Court may have determined that the evidence presented was sufficient to support a finding of torture is a red herring; that finding does not lead inexorably <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>to the conclusion that Appellant was not prejudiced. The claim here is that a jury, if given further instructions than were provided in this case, might not have found torture or, even if it found torture, might have weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances differently and rendered a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. If either of those outcomes had resulted, this Court would not have been called upon to review the sufficiency of the evidence of torture. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h). This is the heart of Appellant’s ineffectiveness claim.</p>
