Nathaniel Lewis, a neighbor and handy man who often did shopping and errands for Ms. Burt, was with her from 7:00 p.m. until 9:00 p.m. that evening. Mr. Lewis watched television with Ms. Burt while they made up a grocery list. When Mr. Lewis left, Ms. Burt was seated in her wheelchair at the dining room table watching television. Mr. Lewis made sure the doors were locked when he left the house. The next day, January 30, 1988, Mr. Lewis returned with Ms. Burt’s groceries but received no response to his repeated knocking.

When appellant returned, she called Ms. Parker into the bathroom and pulled some money out of her shirt. When Ms. Parker asked appellant where the money came from, appellant stated that she had beaten and stabbed someone. Ms. Parker observed blood stains on appellant’s white pants and yellow jacket. Appellant became hysterical about the blood and asked Ms. Parker to help her wipe it off. Appellant then gave Ms. Parker twenty ($20) dollars to say that appellant had been at Mr. Flowers’ home all night. Appellant also asked Ms. Parker to hold her knife for her; Ms. Parker interpreted that request as a request to dispose of the knife, and refused.

Ms. Young testified that appellant called her at 9:20 a.m. on January 30, 1988. Appellant was upset and explained to Ms. Young that she was running late and would have trouble meeting her appointments. Appellant called back at 10:00 a.m. stating that she was at Ms. Burt’s house and was unable to gain admittance.

The investigation revealed only the death of Ms. Burt in that area during that time frame. The medical examiner testified that Ms. Burt’s death was a homicide. The'cause of death was attributable to various traumas to the head and body, multiple stab wounds and manual strangulation. The stab wounds were the result of two or three different knives.

    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[245,704,1156,798]]]'>The first statement was taken at the appellant’s residence on the day after the body was discovered. When she gave that statement, appellant was not a suspect, she was not in custody, and there was no reason for the police to provide her with <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Although the second statement was made at the police station, again, appellant was not in custody and was not considered a suspect at the time the discussion between her and the officer commenced. Admittedly, the officer testified that by the time appellant finished her statement he began to believe that she was a suspect; however, he never expressed that belief to appellant, nor did he continue the interrogation or interfere with her freedom of movement. In fact, after finishing their discussion the officer drove appellant home. Further, both statements were exculpatory and neither one was introduced against the appellant at trial.</p>

    <p id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[170,767,1156,855]]]'>In her first claim of trial error, appellant asserts that the Court erred in excluding evidence that the decedent was afraid of and had been threatened. by persons other than appellant. During the course of the trial appellant attempted to elicit testimony from the investigating officer that he had suspected the decedent’s nephew of being involved in the murder. Trial counsel posed certain questions on cross examination to Detective Duffy, as to whether or not the Detective had formed the belief that the decedent’s nephew, John Butler, was a suspect in the death of Ms. Burt. This line of inquiry was objected to by the Commonwealth and the objection sustained. Appellant asserts that sustaining that objection prevented her from presenting evidence of another suspect, who may very well have committed the offense. In support of her position appellant relies upon <em>Commonwealth v.

      <em>Boyle </em>holds that evidence that someone other than the defendant may have committed the crime is always admissible. However, appellant’s reliance upon <em>Boyle </em>is misplaced. Appellant was not precluded from presenting evidence that John Butler may have been a suspect, or that he may have had a motive for killing Ms. Burt. Appellant was merely prevented from eliciting the inference that John Butler was a suspect, via cross-examination, where appellant had no relevant admissible evidence as to that supposition. Merely suggesting that someone else may have had a motive is not evidence. Thus, appellant’s allegation of error is without merit, she was not prevented from presenting evidence as to another suspect, and in fact, appellant presented no such evidence in her own case. Appellant was properly prevented <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>from creating inferences of the existence of another suspect absent evidence to support that inference. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The admission of photographs is a matter vested within the discretion of the trial court. The trial court will not be found to have abused that discretion unless the essential evidentiary value of the photograph is clearly outweighed by the inflammatory effect the picture will have upon the minds and passions of the jurors. <em>Commonwealth v.

The decedent’s daughter and Mr. Lewis both testified that Ms. Burt was alive on the day before her body was discovered. The coroner’s testimony also established that death resulted from the beating and stab wounds; thus, she was a life in being before the homicide. The existence of Ms. Burt as a life in being was clearly established through the testimony of various witnesses. The Commonwealth therefore did not need the photograph to establish this fact.

During the course of their search for appellant the police ran an article in the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>on February 11, 1988, with a picture of Appellant, relating their interest in speaking with her regarding the death of Ms. Burt.

To the contrary, the record indicates that Ms. Bair was quite familiar with her mother’s habit in keeping large sums of cash at hand and that she had recently counted the money in her mother’s presence, thus giving rise to her opinion that between $5,000 and $7,000 would have been there at the time of the murder. Ms. Bair further testified that upon discovering her mother’s body she was unable to locate the money in any of the places the decedent frequently hid her cash.

    <p id="b642-7" data-blocks='[["BL_642.6",642,[244,1077,1154,312]]]'>2) The prosecutor asked leading questions of his own witness in an attempt to elicit testimony that the appellant’s clothing on the night of the crime was spattered with blood. The prosecutor was reprimanded by the court for using leading questions, the questions were then rephrased and the testimony was properly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b642-8" data-blocks='[["BL_642.7",642,[244,1419,1154,367]]]'>3) The prosecutor failed to produce business records from appellant’s employer, yet when questioning the employer sought testimony from these same records. Defense counsel objected and demanded the records. The witness was excused from the stand until the records could be obtained and provided for defense review, after which she was recalled and her testimony resumed.</p>
    <p id="b642-9" data-blocks='[["BL_642.8",642,[241,1817,1158,412]]]'>4) The prosecutor deliberately elicited hearsay testimony from a witness that he had consulted the National Crime Information Center computer and discovered the appellant was a wanted person. Defense counsel had objected to this testimony at trial and the objection was overruled.

First appellant asserts that the court failed to define for the jury what is a “significant history of felony convictions.” Appellant offers no argument on this issue other than merely setting forth the assertion. However, in our review of the record we note that counsel for appellant asked the trial court to find as a matter of law that appellant’s two prior convictions for aggravated assault could not be considered a <em>“significant </em>history of felony convictions.” The trial court properly denied that request and charged the jury that it was their function to determine if the two prior aggravated assaults were a sufficient basis from which they could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had a <em>“significant </em>history of felony convictions.” The appellant’s claim on this point is without merit. <em>Commonwealth v.
