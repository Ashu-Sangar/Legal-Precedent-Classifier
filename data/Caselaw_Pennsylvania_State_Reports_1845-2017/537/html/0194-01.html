    <p id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[240,1003,1158,1068]]]'>The following history forms the background of this litigation. In 1937, Francis E. McGillick created an agreement and declaration of trust which established the Francis Edward McGillick Foundation. The settlor’s will, dated May 26, 1936, was incorporated into the provisions of the trust agreement. The agreement instructed the trustees to create two funds of $25,000 each with the proceeds to be paid to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh for the education of young men for the priesthood and young women for the sisterhood. The agreement further instructed the trustees to invest all other assets of the foundation and to pay one-half of the net income to the Catholic Bishop of Pittsburgh and his advisory board for the purpose of creating as many scholarships as the income would maintain. The recipients of the scholarships were to be worthy men and women of the Roman Catholic faith, between the ages of sixteen and forty years of age, to be selected by the Bishop and his advisory board. The students awarded scholarships would be permitted to attend any school or university, and the scholarships were limited to $200 per student per year for a maximum of four years.</p>

If the Bishop and his advisory board were not interested in the plan for the school, the trustees were <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>authorized to carry out the plan without the assistance or participation of the Bishop.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[216,468,1156,369]]]'>The principal asset of the foundation, at the time of McGil-lick’s death, was the stock of the F.E. McGillick Company. The company, in turn, was the sole shareholder of six subsidiary companies. When McGillick died in 1961, the assets of the subsidiaries consisted almost entirely of fifty-eight parcels of residential and commercial real estate throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania, varying widely in value.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[218,864,1154,529]]]'>The trust agreement named as trustees and executors McGillick’s three sons and other close relatives, including Patrick Corbett, McGillick’s son-in-law. Upon McGillick’s death in 1961, Corbett was the only named trustee living, and he became one of the trustees. By the time this litigation commenced in 1987, only Corbett remained of the trustees appointed in 1961; the other trustees serving in 1987 were Robert D. Barozzini, Esquire, appointed in 1969, Francis Corbett, Patrick Corbett’s son, appointed in 1977, and Louis F. Anania, an accountant appointed in 1982.</p>
    <p id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.6",429,[217,1420,1157,630]]]'>In the early 1980’s, at a time when the diocese was experiencing financial difficulties and had an urgent need for funds to operate the diocesan secondary school system, the diocese proposed a restructuring of the foundation and its assets. The diocese informed the trustees that it had no present or future need of a vocational school and deemed it unlikely that the net worth of the foundation will ever be sufficient to establish such a school. The foundation, upon advice of counsel, declined to reorganize, whereupon the diocese petitioned the Orphans’ Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to remove and surcharge the trustees of the McGillick Foundation.</p>
    <p id="b429-7" data-blocks='[["BL_429.7",429,[218,2085,1154,314]],["BL_430.1",430,[248,349,1157,812]]]'>Due to a fire which destroyed many foundation records in 1980, the orphans’ court limited its consideration primarily to the period 1980-1986. Following trial, the orphans’ court entered a decree which removed all four trustees, ordered the filing of an accounting within ninety days, and denied the request for a surcharge. Both parties appealed from the <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>decree. The diocese claimed that the evidence justified imposition of a surcharge against the trustees, and that the payment by the foundation of the trustees’ legal fees was improper; the trustees objected to the standing of the diocese, argued that the doctrine of unclean hands should bar the suit, and claimed that they should be compensated for their services during the pendency of the suit. The Superior Court affirmed the trustees’ removal, the order to file an accounting, and the denial of a surcharge. The Superior Court, however, modified the decree to reverse the foundation’s payment of the trustees’ legal fees in defense of this action, and remanded the case to the orphans’ court to allow the trustees to establish the reasonable value of their services to the foundation during the pendency of these proceedings. Both parties have appealed from the order of the Superior Court.</p>

The trial court concluded that the diocese “may incidentally benefit from the performance of that portion of the Trust which provides for the establishment of the two religious education funds,” and the Superior Court held that although the diocese is not a named beneficiary of the trust, the intimate involvement of the diocese with the disbursements of the scholarships is a special, nonpecuniary interest which creates standing to enforce the charitable trust. <a href="/pa-super/406/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="406 Pa.

The integral involvement of the diocese in the awarding of scholarships and its prerogative to participate in the establishment of a vocational school under the trust create an interest on the part of the diocese which is immediate, direct, and substantial—certainly far greater than the abstract interest of all citizens in having others comply with the law. The settlor, McGillick, could have had his foundation award scholarships directly to students; instead, he directed that the church should select the students who would receive them. The same is true of the vocational school. The settlor clearly had some purpose in authorizing the church to participate in creating such a school rather than granting the power solely to the trustees. We conclude, therefore, that the diocese has standing to bring this action.</p>

As to waste or mismanagement of the estate, there was no waste in the sense the term is used in the law of trusts. Beginning with assets of $873,000 in 1969, the foundation distributed at least $753,000 in scholarship funds from 1970 to 1986, and increased in value to $3,500,000. There was no finding of excessive fees or commissions charged by any of the four trustees. There is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that the continued tenure of any of the four trustees will jeopardize the interests of the foundation; on the contrary, there is equal reason to believe that the foundation will continue to flourish under their stewardship. We do not extol, any more than the orphans’ court or the Superior Court, the performance of these trustees. Nevertheless, application of the statutory standard makes it error to remove the trustees, and there is no supportable ground for imposing a surcharge, as both lower courts concluded.</p>

It is not necessary to delineate what duties imposed by law they did not perform since they performed no duties. Therefore, they failed to perform the duties imposed by law. Anania never prepared an annual accounting for the foundation, though such accounting was required by the trust documents. (Maj. op., p. 200.)
