    <p id="b822-8" data-blocks='[["BL_822.7",822,[269,739,1154,416]]]'>On January 20, 1983, a jury of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County found appellant, Robert Douglas, guilty of murder of the first degree <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> aggravated assault<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>, and possession of an instrument of crime<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>. Following these convictions, a separate sentencing hearing was held pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(a). The jury subsequently found the existence of two aggravating circumstances<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> and no mitigating circumstances and sentenced appellant to death.</p>

The court <em>en banc </em>found appellant’s trial counsel ineffective for permitting the testimony of a probation officer which implied that appellant was involved in prior criminal conduct, and granted appellant a new trial. On appeal by the Commonwealth, the Superior Court reversed the trial court’s decision, and remanded the case for a determination of appellant’s remaining post-trial motions which had not been considered, <a href="/citations/?q=396%20Pa.%20Super.%20653" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="396 Pa.

      <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>The facts giving rise to this case are as follows: At approximately 3 a.m. on August 28, 1980, the victim, Donald Knight, and Michael McLaurin were sitting on the benches in the courtyard of the Raymond Rosen Housing Project in Philadelphia when they were approached by appellant who asked them for money. Knight and McLaurin responded that they had none and appellant left the scene. Appellant returned a few minutes later with a handgun and stated, “If you don’t got no money, get out of here.” Appellant then shot Knight twice killing him. McLaurin, meanwhile, reached for the gun but was shot by appellant in the upper and lower arm. After being shot, McLaurin was able to escape and flag down a passing police vehicle. Since he knew appellant well, he was able to give the officers appellant’s name and address.</p>
    <p id="b823-5" data-blocks='[["BL_823.5",823,[194,1131,1154,530]]]'>The officers, however, were unable to find appellant and he remained at large for nearly a year after the shooting. During this time the police encountered appellant on three separate occasions, but each time appellant was able to escape by threatening the officers with either a sawed-off shotgun or a handgun. In addition, on one occasion four days after Donald Knight’s funeral, Knight’s mother, Mildred Knight, encountered appellant on the street. Appellant taunted her, saying “I just killed Donald,” and “you will be next.” (Notes of Trial Testimony (N.T.T.), 1/14/83, at pp. 249, 289).</p>

Halbert. At the time of trial, McLaurin could not be located and was determined to be unavailable. The Commonwealth, however, was able to introduce his preliminary hearing testimony in which he identified appellant as Donald Knight’s killer. In addition, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of the <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>victim’s mother and of two police officers who stated that following the shooting, appellant was chased twice on foot and in an automobile and that on each occasion, he brandished a weapon at his pursuers.</p>

Defense Counsel replied that he wished to demonstrate that Douglas was “amenable to probation and that the death penalty was not warranted ...” (N.T.T., 1/18/83, p. 492). The trial court advised defense counsel that such evidence was irrelevant at that point in the proceedings and would only become relevant at the sentencing phase of the trial if appellant were convicted of first degree <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>murder.

We disagree. As previously noted, the Commonwealth’s evidence included the preliminaty hearing testimony of victim/witness Michael McLaurin in which McLaurin identified appellant as the murderer of Donald Knight. This identification would appear to have been particularly reliable in light of the fact that McLaurin had known appellant personally prior to the shooting. The Commonwealth also introduced the testimony of the victim’s mother regarding the incident which occurred four days after Donald Knight’s funeral, and evidence of the three incidents in which appellant had fled from the police while threatening them with either a sawed-off shotgun or a handgun. Had defense counsel left this evidence unanswered, appellant would almost surely have been convicted.

Here, there was no live eyewitness testimony at the time of trial and very little circumstantial evidence to support the Commonwealth’s charges against Appellant. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the jury would have convicted Appellant without. regard to his prior criminal record. Further, there was no additional proper evidence as to Appellant’s prior criminal record, and thus, the evidence is not merely cumulative. Finally, the inference of guilt which attaches to the admission of prior criminal activity cannot be considered <em>de minimus </em>in a case with such a dearth of other evidence against Appellant.</p>
