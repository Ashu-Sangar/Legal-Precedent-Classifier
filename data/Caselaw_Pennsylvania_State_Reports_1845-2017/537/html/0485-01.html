The decision to file formal charges is made by ODC after approval by a reviewing member of the Hearing Committee. Disciplinary Board Rule § 87.32. The reviewing Board member has no further involvement in the case. The case is then assigned by the Secretary of the Disciplinary Board, on a rotating basis, to a Hearing Committee, which acts as a trial court. § 89.56. The Hearing Committee’s actions are then reviewed on a <em>de novo </em>basis by the Board. The Board does not become involved in the adjudication until the Hearing Committee files its report with the Secretary of the Disciplinary Board. This procedure does not involve commingling of prosecutorial and adjudicative functions. Due process is therefore not violated.</p>

Shortly thereafter, the office of the Prothonotary of the Superior Court sent Walters a letter informing him that it was returning his unprocessed motion and the Superior Court’s decision.

Furthermore, the testimony of Shultz reveals that it was not until June or July of 1989 that Respondent told Shultz of the Superior Court decision. (N.T. 34).

Respondent thereafter sent a February 7, 1990 letter, wherein he reiterated the facts he previously set forth and added that he informed Shultz that he would not file the Petition for Allowance of Appeal on Walters’s behalf but that Walters could get other counsel. Respondent further stated <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>that Shultz told him that she would visit Walters that weekend, that she would relay that information to him, and that she understood the implication of what he had told her.

In fact, Walters testified that he never told Shultz to tell Respondent that he would abide by Respondent’s decision to not file a Petition for Allowance of Appeal. (Walters at 26).

(N.T. 64). Yet in his letters to ODC, Respondent stated that he contacted Shultz immediately after he received the Superior Court decision, explained that the appeal was not a matter of right, told her of the thirty-day time limit, explained Rule 1114 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, and stated that Shultz understood all of this, conveyed it all to Walters, and that Walters responded that he <a id="p499" href="#p499" data-label="499" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*499</a>would abide by Respondent’s decision.
