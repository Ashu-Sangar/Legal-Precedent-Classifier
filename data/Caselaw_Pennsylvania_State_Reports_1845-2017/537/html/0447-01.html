    <p id="b685-6" data-blocks='[["BL_685.5",685,[231,583,1155,640]]]'>Our discussion begins with an analysis of the 1985 trial court’s treatment of Appellant’s pro se supplemental post-verdict motions as a PCHA petition. We note that the trial court had the authority to take such action pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 2, which requires that the rules “be construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.” In this case, had the trial court dismissed Appellant’s post-verdict motion, Appellant could have simply refiled them as a PCHA petition. Furthermore, as we noted earlier, Appellant has never contested the action of the trial court, either in the direct or the instant appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b685-7" data-blocks='[["BL_685.6",685,[230,1251,1155,746]]]'>The 1992 trial court decided to treat the instant PCRA petition as Appellant’s first, not second, application for post-conviction relief, “because the precise nature of defendant’s supplemental post-verdict motion leaves some question as to whether or not it can be categorized as an initial post-conviction petition for purposes of asserting trial counsel’s ineffectiveness.” Trial Court Opinion, March 11, 1992 at 7. Appellant, apparently relying on the 1992 trial court’s conclusion, also treats this PCRA petition as his first, and does not raise it as an issue on appeal to this Court. Appellee, on the other hand, refers to the instant petition as Appellant’s second application for post-conviction relief in its brief. However, Appellee does not address the appropriate standard of review, and instead jumps directly to the issue of waiver.</p>

First, the 1992 trial court opinion and the briefs of the parties reveal their confusion regarding this issue. Second, Appellant has apparently-relied upon the 1992 trial court’s treatment of his petition, and has neither contested nor briefed the issue. These reasons, combined with the severity of Appellant’s sentence, compel us to review Appellant’s petition as if it were his first application for post-conviction relief.</p>
