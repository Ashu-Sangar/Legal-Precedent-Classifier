Respondent prepared a written agreement executed by Hopkins, which permitted respondent to invest $10,000 of the sale proceeds in mortgage bonds paying 18%, insured by Penn Title Insurance Company, evidenced by delivery of the appraisal, title insurance commitment and mortgage bond to Hopkins, and Hopkins could terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice. At settlement, respondent received a <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>check for $10,000.

Despite frequent calls and letters from Hopkins, respondent did not respond to Hopkins’ inquiries or remit the funds due Hopkins. In August, 1985, respondent paid Hopkins’ moving bill, at Hopkins’ request, in the amount of $1,788. In October, 1985, respondent sent Hopkins a check for approximately $900, covering interest and a small amount of principal, reducing Hopkins’ principal balance to $8,000.</p>

In the letter, she made false and misleading assertions concerning her stewardship of Hopkins’ investment. She also misdated a letter to Hopkins as June 24, 1986 (a month before it was sent) in which she made false statements regarding Hopkins’ investment and promised to repay Hopkins’ investment by July 31, 1986.

In discussing and evaluating these violations, the disciplinary board parted company with the hearing committee, recommending a six-month suspension rather than disbarment. Factors cited by the disciplinary board for lenity included the interweaving of roles by respondent, as attorney and as real estate manager and investor, whereby it was “not always clear which role respondent was engaging in at various times,” and the board’s belief “that at the time Mrs. Passyn made investments on behalf of Mr. Brown and Ms. Hopkins, she believed that she was acting in her real estate investment capacity rather than her capacity as an attorney.” The board also found it “understandable that Mrs. Passyn was reluctant at first to turn over Mr. Brown’s funds to Mr. Rubin since Mr. Rubin was identified with Mr. Brown’s daughter and the daughter was the reason that the protective account was created in the first instance.” Respondent’s failure to return Ms. Hopkins’ funds when promised was described as the result of an unfortunate “change in the real estate market” rather than any “personal fault of her own.” To justify a six-month suspension, the board also cited its view that this is a case of “attorney misjudgment” rather than “conversion of client money,” the fact that “all of the Hopkins money was returned with interest after the sale of the investment property,” and “the strong character testimony presented on behalf of Mrs. Passyn.”</p>

The justification that respondent was wearing two hats is no justification at all.
