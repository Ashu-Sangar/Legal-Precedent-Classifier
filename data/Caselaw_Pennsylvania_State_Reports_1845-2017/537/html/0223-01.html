The physician determined that Latta could not perform his pre-injury job, but that he could perform light-duty work as previously determined in 1977. He further opined that Latta’s 1977 work-related injury had continued. The referee found that Latta was unable to perform his preinjury work as of June 10,1987, the date of the second medical examination specifically referenced by Latta’s physician, but that any claim for benefits prior to the June 10,1987 examination was precluded because that claim was previously litigated <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>in <em>Latta I. </em>On appeal, the Board and the Commonwealth Court affirmed, <a href="/pa-commw/151/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="151 Pa.

However, the Commonwealth Court nevertheless concluded that Latta was unable to satisfy his burden with regard to that period of time, because he had failed to present expert medical evidence to support a finding that his work-related injury continued during that period. Upon review of the record, we agree that Latta’s expert medical evidence supports only a finding that his work-related injury continued as of June 10,1987, the date that Latta was first examined by his physician during the period between March 3, 1983 and June 10, 1987. However, we disagree with the determination of the Commonwealth Court that because Latta’s expert medical evidence supported only a finding that his work-related injury continued as of June 10,1987, he was unable to satisfy his burden with regard to the period between March 3, 1983 and June 10, 1987.</p>

We held that, because the claimant had already established a work-related injury supporting an award of benefits, when seeking reinstatement of those benefits causation will be presumed if the claimant can demonstrate that: (1) through no fault of his own, his earning power is once again adversely affected by his disability; and (2) the disability which gave rise to his original claim, in fact, continues.</p>

While expert medical evidence was present in <em>Pieper, </em>that does not mean that such evidence is required in order for a claimant to establish that the work-related injury that gave rise to the benefits currently suspended and sought to be reinstated does, in fact, continue.</p>
    <p id="b459-4" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[203,703,1154,786]]]'>Given the nature of suspension status, which actually <em>acknowledges </em>a continuing medical injury, and suspends benefits only because the claimant’s earning power is currently not affected by the injury, the testimony of a claimant alone could easily satisfy his burden of establishing that his work-related injury continues. To hold otherwise would improperly require a claimant to re-establish that which has already been agreed to and acknowledged. Therefore, we hold that expert medical evidence is not necessary to establish that the prior work-related injury continues. Rather, once a claimant testifies that his prior work-related injury continues, the burden shifts to his employer to prove the contrary. Where an employer fails to present evidence to the contrary, the claimant’s testimony, if believed by the referee, is sufficient to support reinstatement of the suspended benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Clearly, the degree of inquiry and the difficulty of establishing that a work-related injury continues in any given case are necessarily governed by the nature of the injury and the length of time that has passed since the claimant originally established the existence of the work-related injury. Where a relatively short period of time has elapsed and/or the injury is one that has obviously continued, a claimant’s task is qualitatively simpler than if a considerable period of time has elapsed and/or the injury is one that is less obvious. However, under all circumstances, the claimant’s burden is not very difficult, since the injury has continued to be acknowledged by the fact that benefits have been merely suspended, and the employer has not moved to terminate its liability. This is especially true where an employer presents no evidence to rebut a claimant’s testimony that his work-related injury continues.</p>
