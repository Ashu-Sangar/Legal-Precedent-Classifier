We conclude that a police officer may be indemnified for the payment of a judgment entered in a civil action for assault and battery and false imprisonment absent a judicial determination that the officer’s acts constituted willful misconduct.

The driver stopped Renk as he was entering the police station to report for duty. He informed Renk that David Laney was using an invalid bus pass and had refused to get off of the bus. At the driver’s request, Renk removed Laney from the bus. Laney was subsequently arrested for disorderly conduct. When Laney was escorted to the police station, a scuffle began and Renk’s elbow struck Laney in the mouth. Laney was detained in a cell at the station until Renk had finished dressing in his police uniform and had written the citation for disorderly conduct. The citation was later dismissed when Renk failed to appear at the scheduled hearing.</p>

Under 42 Pa.C.S. § 8550, an employee of a state agency is not entitled to indemnification pursuant <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8548 when he is found to have committed wilful misconduct. The majority today holds that, although appellant has previously been found liable for the torts of assault, battery, and false imprisonment, he may not have committed willful misconduct and thus, is entitled to indemnification under section 8548. It bases this conclusion on the premise that appellant may not have intentionally committed these intentional torts. I am unable to join such a result for I believe a jury’s determination that an individual has committed the torts of assault, battery, and false imprisonment constitutes a judicial determination that the individual has committed willful misconduct because these torts are by definition intentionally committed and are clearly outside the scope of a police officer’s duties.</p>

    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[256,724,1160,756]]]'>Due to this element of intent, the jury’s previous verdict against Officer Renk can only be construed as a determination that he intentionally (i.e. wilfully) used force in excess of that reasonably needed to make an arrest and intentionally arrested appellee without probable cause. Because the City of Pittsburgh does not pay its officers to perpetrate such intentional torts upon citizens, these actions are clearly beyond the scope of a police officer’s duties and amount misconduct which, as previously noted, was wilfully committed. Thus, I would affirm the Commonwealth Court’s decision to deny appellant indemnification on the ground that the previous verdict against him amounted to a judicial determination that appellant had committed willful misconduct. . Since the majority refuses to do so, I must respectfully dissent.</p>

      <p id="b310-8" data-blocks='[["BL_310.8",310,[271,2109,1152,311]]]'>. It is well established that a police officer is privileged to make an arrest when he has probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and to use reasonable force to effectuate an arrest. See Restatement (Second) of Torts §§ 118-121,140-144(1965). Thus, the majority correctly notes that an officer may only be subjected to liability for assault and battery when the force employed by the officer is excessive and may only be held liable for false imprisonment when an arrest is unsupported by probable cause.</p>
