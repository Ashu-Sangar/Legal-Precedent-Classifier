The determination would necessarily differ in various respects from a colloquy conducted at the trial stage. As the Superior Court stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Meehan, </em><a href="/pa-super/427/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="427 Pa.

    <blockquote id="aiq-dedup-0" data-blocks='[["BL_818.6",818,[303,1220,1119,1165]]]'>Rule 318 [governing procedures for waiver of counsel] was designed to apply to trial proceedings rather than post-conviction hearings. In reviewing the questions contained in the Comment to Rule 318, it is apparent that some of the questions are irrelevant when viewed in the context of a post-conviction proceeding. For example, a defendant need not be apprised of the charges against him, the elements of each offense, and the permissible sentencing ranges or fines since, having been convicted, the defendant is presumably aware of both the offenses and any sentence or fine imposed therefor. We therefore conclude that inquiry into all of the areas set forth in the Comment to Rule 318 need not be conducted for a waiver of the right to counsel in a PCRA proceeding to be deemed valid. Nonetheless, the defendant must be apprised of his right to counsel and the risks of forfeiting that right. See <em>Commonwealth v. Monica, </em><a href="/pa/528/0266-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="528 Pa. 266" data-case-ids="1829845" data-case-paths="/pa/528/0266-01">supra.</a> Such inquiry would necessarily include a discussion of whether the defendant understands: (1) his right to be represented by counsel; (2) that if he waives this right, he will still be bound by all normal procedural rules; and (3) that many rights and potential claims may be permanently lost if not timely asserted. <em>See </em>Comment to Rule 318.</blockquote>

      <a id="p587" href="#p587" data-label="587" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*587</a>A request to waive appellate counsel must, of course, be made in a timely and definite manner that does not serve simply to disrupt the appellate process. Cf. <em>Faretta v. California, </em><a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">422 U.S. at 835</a>, <a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">95 S.Ct. at 2541</a>, <a href="/us/422/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="422 U.S. 806" data-case-ids="9431" data-case-paths="/us/422/0806-01">45 L.Ed.2d at 582</a> (timely and unequivocal request to waive counsel at trial). Examination of the sequence of events surrounding appellant’s appeal to the Superior Court reveals that no substantial disruption of the appellate process would have occurred if this case had been remanded to the trial court for a hearing on appellant’s expressed desire to proceed pro se.</p>
    <p id="b819-5" data-blocks='[["BL_819.4",819,[207,910,1154,584]]]'>Appellate counsel filed a brief with the Superior Court on July 1, 1992. Appellant filed his motion to proceed pro se on July 28, 1992, and filed his supplemental brief on or about August 4, 1992. The Superior Court denied the motion to proceed pro se on August 7, 1992, and rendered its decision affirming the lower court on November 2, 1992. Hence, appellant’s motion was filed just twenty-seven days after a counseled brief was filed in his behalf, this being a prompt response to inadequacies which appellant believed to exist in the counseled brief. It was also more than three months before the Superior Court rendered its decision in the case.</p>
