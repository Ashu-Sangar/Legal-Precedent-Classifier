While Wingfield and Appellant were in Appellant’s room, Appellant confessed that in 1983 he had been involved in the robbery and shooting of a cab driver on Wayne Avenue. According to Wingfield, Appellant said that he and two other men, Gregory Fulton and Matthew McNeil, the husband of Wingfield’s sister, had robbed the cab driver and Appellant had shot the driver because he was “tussling.” (N.T. 5/26/88, at 114.) Wingfield testified that he did not report his knowledge of the incident to law enforcement authorities until 1986<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> because he spent the intervening two years investigating his brother-in-law’s role in the killing.</p>

Although trial counsel did receive some written discovery from the Commonwealth, information on Wingfield’s criminal record was given to her orally by the Assistant District Attorney.

First, we do not doubt that Appellant’s claim has arguable merit. Wingfield was the Commonwealth’s primary witness, and his testimony that Appellant had confessed to the crimes charged was devastating to the defense. Further, as will be discussed more fully below, Wingfield was the only witness to provide a solid link between Appellant and the crimes charged. Thus, casting doubt on Wingfield’s credibility was essential to Appellant’s defense. <em>Compare, e.g., Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth argues, and the Superior Court agreed, that this claim has no merit because Wingfield apparently was simply mistaken as to the date of the conversation, and the conversation probably took place in March of 1985, after Wingfield was in fact released from prison. However, the record does not support this conjecture. Wingfield repeatedly and consistently affirmed that the conversation took place in March of 1984. <em>(See, e.g., </em>N.T. 5/26/88, at 113, 115, 118, 120, 124, 129; N.T. 5/27/88, at 14.) Wingfield also stated that he had discussed the incident with his brother-in-law “on the street” in March of 1984. (N.T. 5/26/88, at 123.) Further, that date fits into the timetable to which Wingfield testified concerning how much time he spent investigating the matter before reporting it to the authorities.</p>

Review of the notes of testimony from the preliminary hearing would have alerted trial counsel to the possibility that Wingfield was incarcerated at the time he claimed to have spoken with Appellant at Appellant’s home. At that hearing, as he did subsequently at trial, Wingfield testified that Appellant confessed .his role in the crimes while Wingfield was at Appellant’s house in March of 1984. On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Wingfield about the time periods during which he was incarcerated. He then asked:</p>

We do not agree with the Superior Court’s assessment, for testimony that a <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>second source told Wingfield that Appellant was involved in the killing would have been inadmissible hearsay. The Commonwealth argues that the testimony would not have been hearsay because it would have been offered not for the truth of the matter asserted, but to show that Wingfield heard the same story from someone other than Appellant. However, we fail to see how that fact could rehabilitate Wingfield’s credibility regarding whether he had the alleged conversation with Appellant unless it were offered for the truth of what the source allegedly said.</p>

Wingfield was the only witness who directly linked Appellant to the crimes charged. The majority of the Commonwealth’s witnesses established only that the crimes had occurred, and not the identity of any perpetrator. The police found no gun, fingerprints, or other evidence connecting Appellant to the crime. The Commonwealth argues that Appellant was not prejudiced because one witness who was present at the crime scene did identify Appellant at trial as one of the three men he saw running from the car. However, a review of the record reveals that this witness’s identification was dubious at best.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Further, testimony that <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>Appellant was seen running from the car, without more, would not establish the elements of the crimes with which he was charged, particularly the elements of intent required to support his convictions of first degree murder and criminal conspiracy. It was Appellant’s alleged confession that supplied those elements.</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.6",282,[247,703,1157,743]]]'>The Commonwealth also argues that Appellant was not prejudiced by counsel’s failure because counsel did impeach Wingfield’s credibility by showing that he had given three inconsistent statements to the police, by exploring his possible motive for testifying falsely in return for favorable treatment from the prosecution on assault charges that were pending against him, and by eliciting testimony that revealed that he was a convicted felon. We do not agree that evidence of Wingfield’s incarceration during the crucial time would have been cumulative of this questioning. The omitted evidence would not have been “merely a general assault on the veracity of the witness,” but would have directly contradicted his version of the facts. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.
