Appellant and three other individuals set up a purported drug transaction "with Porter, in order to lure him to a meeting, whereupon they bound and gagged him, confiscated his keys, and stuffed him in the trunk of his car. One of the conspirators, a “friend” of Porter’s, allowed himself to be tied up in front of Porter, so that Porter would not realize his involvement. He was “released” after Porter was locked in the trunk, then taken home so that Porter would later believe that he had been murdered. The remaining conspirators drove Porter’s car, with Porter in the trunk, to the garage of one of <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>the individuals and parked it there. They proceeded in another car to Porter’s mother’s house, and using Porter’s key, burglarized the dwelling. They then used - Porter’s key to burglarize his father’s house, whom they believed to be very wealthy.</p>

Before restraining him again, one of the individuals demanded to know how much Porter was worth to his father, and insisted that he disclose his mother’s and father’s telephone numbers. They told Porter that they had killed his friend and if he did not cooperate, they would kill him too. Porter provided them with his mother’s telephone number and his father’s beeper number. The captors then decided to abandon their ransom plan, in favor of eliminating Porter. To keep Porter from moving around while they drove, they wedged two milk crates into the trunk, further restricting his movement and forcing his body to bounce off of these objects, as they drove around in search of a place to kill him. Unable to find a place to effect the killing, they returned to the garage to await nightfall.</p>

Uncertain as to whether Porter had expired from strangulation as a result of the gagging, Appellant’s cohort shot him four times in the back of the neck with a .25 caliber automatic handgun. The two of them then abandoned Porter’s car and discarded his keys into a sewer. The gun was later discovered in Appellant’s car. Appellant was arrested and confessed his part in the scheme to set up Porter in order to obtain money from his father. Appellant denied that he ever intended to kill Porter; rather he placed the blame on one of his cohorts.</p>

As a mitigating circumstance, the jury unanimously found “other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(e)(8).

In order to establish that the motivation for the killing was to prevent the victim from being a witness against Appellant, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from Appellant that he and one of his cohorts had discussed the need to get rid of Porter because he knew where they lived. Appellant also testified that he was concerned that Porter would “tell” if he were released. (N.T., 11/3/89, p. 40).</p>

All that is required is that “[t]he victim was <em>being held </em>by the defendant for ransom.... ” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9711(d)(3). An overt act toward execution of that purpose is sufficient to sustain the jury’s conclusion that the victim was held for ransom. The acts of Appellant and his cohorts of Mdnapping Porter, then questioning his value to his parents and demanding his parents’ telephone numbers, were sufficient for the jury to conclude that Porter was held for ransom.
