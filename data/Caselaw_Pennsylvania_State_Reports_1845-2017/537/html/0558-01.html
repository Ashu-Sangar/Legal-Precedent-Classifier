    <p id="b794-7" data-blocks='[["BL_794.7",794,[242,1152,1157,635]]]'>On March 21, 1990, postal authorities in Tucson, Arizona concluded that a package addressed to Michael Litzenberger and delivered to the Post Office for express delivery met their informal profile of packages containing illicit drugs. In particular, the package was large (thirty-four pounds), heavily taped, and the return address contained a fictitious company name and address. The postal authorities therefore detained the package and obtained a narcotics dog. Although the dog did not “alert” to the package, he “showed interest in it.” The postal authorities continued to treat the package as if it might contain contraband and delayed its delivery for a total of forty-four hours.</p>
    <p id="b794-8" data-blocks='[["BL_794.8",794,[236,1818,1156,583]]]'>During the delay, the package was re-routed to Camden, New Jersey, and authorities there were notified of the package’s suspicious nature. While the package was en route between Tucson and Camden, it was somehow ripped and the tape had become sufficiently loose to allow the odor of marijuana to escape. The postal inspector in Camden noticed the odor and brought in another narcotics dog who “alerted” to the package. After a controlled delivery of the package, Litzenberger was arrested. A forensic scientist later tested the contents of the package and determined that it contained 25.7 pounds of marijuana.</p>

He was also sentenced to a concurrent term of imprisonment of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months for the criminal conspiracy conviction. Litzenberger filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence, which was denied by the trial court. Litzenberger subsequently appealed to the Superior Court, contending that the trial court failed to suppress evidence which was gained by an unlawful search and seizure; that the Commonwealth failed to comply with the notice provision in § 7508(b); and that § 7508 was unconstitutional as applied to marijuana cases where the total weight of the substance is less than 1,000 pounds. The Superior Court affirmed his convictions, finding no merit to the suppression issue, and holding that his sentence, pursuant to the mandatory minimum set forth in § 7508, was proper <a href="/citations/?q=423%20Pa.%20Super.%20635" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="423 Pa.

A closer analysis of § 9756(b) reveals that although the minimum sentence may not <em>exceed </em>one-half of the maximum sentence, the statute does not require that the minimum sentence <em>equal </em>one-half of the maximum one. For example, a minimum sentence of five years may be a valid sentence if the prescribed maximum is ten years. However, a five year minimum sentence may also be a valid sentence if the maximum sentence is fifteen years, twenty years or one-hundred years. In all of the examples, the minimum sentence would not exceed one-half of the maximum. Thus, this interpretation would force us to engage in sheer speculation as to which maximum sentence the General Assembly intended.
