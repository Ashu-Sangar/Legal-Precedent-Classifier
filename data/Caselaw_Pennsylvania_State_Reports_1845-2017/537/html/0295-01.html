    <p id="b529-11" data-blocks='[["BL_529.11",529,[205,1369,1156,800]]]'>This appeal as of right arises from a declaratory judgment action filed by Appellant, American Casualty Company of Reading, PA (American Casualty) against PHICO Insurance Company (PHICO) and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund (the CAT Fund); Sharon DiRienzo, and David and Suzanne Richard, as parents and natural guardians of Christopher Richard, and in their own right, were joined as potentially interested parties. The action was filed initially in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, invoking that court’s original jurisdiction. It was decided by the court on four motions: PHICO’s motion for summary judgment, American Casualty’s cross-motion for summary judgment, the CAT Fund’s application for summary relief, and American Casualty’s cross-application for summary relief.</p>
    <p id="b529-12" data-blocks='[["BL_529.12",529,[206,2196,1152,205]],["BL_530.1",530,[264,348,1154,87]]]'>The Commonwealth Court on January 24, 1992, entered a summary judgment in favor of PHICO and denied American Casualty’s motion for summary judgment. They also granted the CAT Fund’s application for summary relief, in part, and <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>denied American Casualty’s cross-application for summary relief.</p>
    <p id="b530-4" data-blocks='[["BL_530.4",530,[260,467,1158,999]]]'>The facts of this case are not in dispute. David and Suzanne Richard filed a suit for damages against Sharon DiRienzo and several other defendants in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (the Richard action). That suit has been settled for an amount in excess of two million dollars. The Richards, in their own right and acting as parents and natural guardians of Christopher Richard, alleged that DiRienzo was negligent in providing nursing care and treatment at the time Suzanne Richard was about to give birth to Christopher on January 29 and 30, 1988. At that time, DiRienzo was acting in the course and scope of her employment by Bryn Mawr Hospital as a delivery room nurse. The Richards claimed that, as a result of DiRienzo’s conduct, severe and permanent brain damage was sustained by Christopher, and that pain and suffering and expenses were inflicted upon David and Suzanne Richard. The complaint further alleged that Bryn Mawr Hospital was liable to the Richards as the employer of DiRienzo and also because of its own negligence.</p>
    <p id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[257,1491,1155,574]]]'>At the time of the alleged negligence, DiRienzo was covered by three policies of insurance which were applicable to the claims set forth in the Richard action. American Casualty had issued to DiRienzo a Professional Nurse’s Liability Policy, No. NS03807436 (American Casualty policy). That policy was subject to a limit of $1,000,000.00. The policy covered both DiRienzo’s professional and non-business activities. American Casualty contends that its policy specifically stated in its “other insurance” clause that, in effect, it provided excess insurance only. DiRienzo páid an annual premium of $58.00 for the policy.</p>

A Health Care Provider’s Comprehensive Liability Policy (No. HP2001), provided Institutional Professional Liability Coverage (Coverage C) for the hospital’s professional employees, other than physicians, for <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>liability arising out of rendering or failure to render professional services (the PHICO Primary Policy). The “other insurance” clause in the PHICO Primary Policy stated that its coverage was primary. The limit of that policy was $200,-000.00, which covered DiRienzo as a professional employee of the hospital.</p>

The premium for the PHICO Primary Policy was $121,563.00 for the period of two months and ten days for which PHICO has provided such information (November 20,1987 through February 1, 1988). During the same period, the portion of the premium attributable to Coverage C, “Institutional Professional Liability,” was $63,643.00..</p>
    <p id="b531-6" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[202,1136,1156,801]]]'>PHICO also issued to Bryn Mawr Hospital a second policy (No. EP2001) (the PHICO Excess Policy) which provided for DiRienzo, as a professional employee of Bryn Mawr Hospital, excess “Professional Liability” coverage with a $10,000,000.00 limit. The PHICO Excess Policy consisted of two parts: Coverage A, titled “Professional Liability,” which was the only coverage applicable to DiRienzo in this case, and Coverage B, titled “Umbrella Liability.” Umbrella Liability coverage, however, is not at issue in this matter because that coverage expressly excluded insurance for liability arising from professional services. The premium for the Phico excess policy, for the period of two months and ten days (November 20, 1987 through February 1, 1988) was $120,188.00, of which amount $105,119.00 applied to Coverage A, “Professional Liability,” while $15,069.00 applied to Coverage B, “Umbrella Liability.”</p>

Co. v. United Services Automobile Assn., </em><a href="/f-supp/676/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="676 F.

Next, the Commonwealth Court determined that the American Casualty policy and the PHICO <em>prim,ary </em>policy were concurrent primary policies and that, hence, the “other insurance” clauses in both policies were triggered. As a result of this triggering, the “other insurance” clause contained in the PHICO <em>primary </em>policy had to be interpreted, and it was concluded to be a “pro rata” clause which meant that the PHICO <em>primary </em>policy had to be treated as providing <em>primary </em>coverage to Nurse DiRienzo. <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>Because the American Casualty policy contained “an unqualified excess clause” (145 Pa.Cmwlth. 184, at 195, <a href="/pa-commw/145/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="602 A.2d 904" data-case-ids="1426544" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/145/0184-01">602 A.2d 904</a>, at 909), the Commonwealth Court thought that it had to be interpreted as providing <em>residual primary </em>coverage. Hence, that Court ruled that PHICO’s <em>primary </em>policy paid the first $200,000.00 of indemnity expense and that when that limit was exhausted, that American Casualty’s <em>primary </em>policy as residual primary insurance had to kick in for the next $1,000,000.00.</p>
    <p id="b534-4" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[253,810,1158,794]]]'>Nurse DiRienzo was found not to be a health care provider under 40 P.S. § 1301.701(a) and hence ineligible to participate in the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss (CAT) Fund as such. She was, however, found to be entitled to coverage by the CAT Fund by virtue of being a hospital employee. Hence the CAT Fund was held to be responsible for providing coverage up to $1,000,000.00 for DiRienzo’s negligence (if any) as a hospital employee, but only after the exhaustion of the two policies found to be <em>primary. </em>Because DiRienzo was found not to be a health care provider, however, she was found not to be entitled to a separate, additional $1,000,000.00 of CAT Fund coverage in her individual capacity. Finally, the Commonwealth Court determined that American Casualty’s policy was <em>not excess </em>insurance coverage vis-a-vis the CAT Fund under 40 P.S. § 1301.705.</p>
