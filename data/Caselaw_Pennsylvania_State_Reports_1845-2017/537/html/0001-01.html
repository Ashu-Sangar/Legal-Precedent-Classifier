    <p id="b245-5" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[187,508,1156,1015]]]'>The crimes of murder and robbery have distinct elements of proof. To prove murder of the first degree, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that the defendant killed with a specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). The Commonwealth must show: 1) that a human being has unlawfully been killed; 2) that the person did the killing; and, 3) that the killing was done in an intentional, deliberate and premeditated manner. <em>Commonwealth v.

On October 25, 1983, the body of Edward Miller, a single Mennonite long-distance truck driver from Dundee, Ohio, was found shot to death in a truck trailer located at the Trexler Truck Stop in Kuhnsville, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Miller had received one gunshot in the back. The body was discovered by three of Miller’s brothers who had come to Pennsylvania from Ohio to search for their brother at motels and truck stops when they had not heard from Miller for a few days. They had reported their brother missing to the Ohio and Pennsylvania State Police, and Pennsylvania State Trooper Karvan responded to the Trexler Truck Stop. Trooper Karvan, in the presence of Miller’s brothers, discovered the body. Further investigation of the trailer revealed that there were three bullet holes in the trailer.</p>

      <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>An autopsy disclosed that: the cause of death was a single .38 caliber gunshot wound to the back; the manner of death was homicide; and, while the date of death could not be determined with absolute certainty, the date of death was approximately October 20, 1983. Forensic pathologist Isidor Mihalakis, M.D., testified that Miller’s death was caused when a single .38 caliber bullet pierced his spinal column, pierced his heart, ricocheted off his breast bone and subsequently pierced his heart a second time. Mihalakis established that Miller’s death occurred on or about October 20, 1983.</p>

On October 10, 1983, appellant obtained a ride from truck driver Dennis Knowles at a truck stop in Florida. Appellant rode with Knowles until October 14th, when he was dropped off in Kings Dominion, Virginia. Appellant then obtained a ride with another truck driver, James W. Sacco, and traveled with him to the Truck Stop of America near Elkton, Maryland. He then obtained a ride with a truck driver, known only as Jim, for two days from Maryland through Pennsylvania and on to Youngstown, Ohio. When Jim’s truck broke down in Ohio, appellant took a ride with an unknown trucker eastward to a rest area on Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania. Here, appellant encountered the victim, Edward Miller, in the early morning hours of October 18, 1983.</p>

Miller proceeded in the morning of October 19 to Port Jersey, New Jersey, where he unloaded his trailer as appellant slept in the cab of Miller’s truck. In mid-afternoon on October 19th, they arrived at Kuhn’s Motel in Kuhnsville, Pennsylvania, where. Miller checked into the motel and they both spent the night with appellant sleeping in Miller’s room.</p>

The use of <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>the credit card led to the investigation of one Monica Mannion, a female truck driver from Illinois. Pursuant to the information provided by Mannion, the police were able to determine that she had encountered appellant on October 20, 1983 in the area of Bloomsburg, New Jersey. Mannion related to the police that appellant contacted her via Citizens Band (CB) radio and that she followed him from Bloomsburg, New Jersey to the Trexler Truck Stop on the night of October 20, 1983. She testified that on the night of October 20th, appellant was alone and operating the tractor-trailer rig identified as Miller’s rig. Mannion further stated that when appellant reached the Trexler Truck Stop, he “bobtailed”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the tractor and parked it at the nearby Peter Pan Diner, after having disconnected the trailer on the lot of the Trexler Truck Stop.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Mannion positively identified the tractor and trailer in the same locations as they were found on the night Miller’s body was discovered.</p>

Telephone calls from appellant to Ms. Mannion were charged to Miller’s credit cards. Appellant also possessed other personal property belonging to Miller, identified by members of Miller’s family. Such property consisted of a trucker’s log book, a baseball-type cap, a suitcase, and other items.</p>

About one week later, the Pennsylvania State Police learned of appellant’s incarceration on other charges in Louisville, Kentucky. Upon disposition of the charges in Kentucky, appellant waived extradition and was returned to Lehigh <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>County.

Appellant stated that on the night of October 19,1983, he and Miller had stayed in Kuhn’s Motel in Kuhnsville. The appellant indicated that the next day, while at breakfast in the adjacent Peter Pan Diner, they encountered a trucker named Wilkens who agreed to get Miller a load back to Ohio from Philadelphia. Miller and appellant entered the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Miller’s truck, followed by Wilkens operating his own rig. The two trucks became separated and Miller and appellant continued to travel on the turnpike. Just prior to the Delaware Valley interchange, appellant convinced Miller he would get Miller a load if the trailer was clean of debris. So, Miller pulled off to clean the trailer.</p>

While Miller was in the front right comer of the trailer, he dropped his flashlight and bent down to pick it up. At this moment, appellant, who was in the middle of the trailer, shot Miller in the back with a .38 caliber handgun. Appellant stated he did not know why he shot Miller. He explained that “... sometimes I just do things like that ...” and “the thing that doesn’t make sense is that ■Edward Miller was the nicest person that I ever met.”</p>

He drove the rig to the Quakertown area and telephoned his wife, Brenda. Brenda knew he was upset but did not know why, as he did not tell her about the shooting. Brenda gave appellant a telephone number with an 800 area code to call to get help. Appellant did not call for help but <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>drove instead to New Jersey where he first encountered Mannion. In separate rigs, they drove back to Kuhnsville where appellant abandoned Miller’s truck which contained the decedent’s body. Then, appellant and Mannion headed west to Illinois.</p>
    <p id="b249-5" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[208,638,1154,305]]]'>Many other witnesses testified, including a trucker, Kenneth Weinkle, who picked appellant up few days after the incident in West Memphis, Arkansas. Mr. Weinkle testified that he saw appellant with Miller’s brown leather wallet with Miller’s credit cards in it. Appellant also tried to trade-in Weinkle’s truck.</p>
    <p id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[207,979,1157,529]]]'>The evidence was clearly sufficient to support the convictions. The record particularly reflects that: appellant admitted that he killed Miller by shooting him in the back near his heart at close range for no reason; appellant was driving the victim’s tractor and trailer on the day and the day after Miller was last seen alive; appellant possessed and used Miller’s credit cards; and, Ms. Mannion observed appellant driving Miller’s rig, in possession of the victim’s personal belongings.

In determining the voluntariness of a confession and the waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, a court must consider and evaluate the totality of the circumstances attending the confession and the waiver of the rights. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant, who had prior familiarity with <em>Miranda </em>rights, received his <em>Miranda </em>warnings four times and acknowledged his understanding of his rights when he was interviewed. He conceded that he signed the acknowledgement and waiver, that he had admitted to the killing of Miller, and the statements relating to the killing were accurate. He admitted to the officers that he used a .38 caliber handgun in the shooting and later he sold it to a man in Texas. He concedes that none of the officers physically abused him. The suppression court found no physical or psychological factors which coerced appellant into providing his statements. The suppression court did not err in concluding that appellant’s confession was the product of free and unconstrained choice.</p>

The record reveals, however, that appellant gave two different reasons for confessing, neither of which involved police statements. At the suppression hearing, appellant claimed he confessed because of his morbid fear of electrocution. At trial, he claimed he confessed because of threats against his family by. Nicholas Getter, a relative of his ex-wife, Brenda Williams. Further, the officers did not tell appellant that they knew the subject gun was the weapon used in the killing. Rather, appellant linked the .38 caliber handgun to the shooting. Appellant has failed to demonstrate how his confession was caused by the statements of the police.</p>

Knowles also stated that, during his time with Knowles, appellant showed him a .25 caliber handgun. The next link was trucker James W.

During the time they were together, appellant showed Sacco the .38 caliber handgun, and the same .25 caliber handgun, which Sacco bought from appellant.

Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective because he failed to interview Nicholas Getter, a relative of appellant’s ex-wife who allegedly made threats against Brenda Williams and their son which induced the appellant to make incriminating statements. He also contends trial counsel should have interviewed trucker Wilkens, with whom he had breakfast on the day of the killing, Tammy Marie Schenkel, John Schissler, and witnesses from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Agency, or other governmental agencies. At no point in his argument does appellant demonstrate how any of these witnesses would have assisted the defense.</p>

      <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>The record reflects that the testimony from these people could not have assisted the defense. Testimony about threats from Getter went to the voluntariness of appellant’s confession and would have contradicted testimony appellant provided at a pretrial suppression hearing that he confessed because he feared the electric chair. Wilkens would only have established that appellant and Miller were in the Peter Pan Diner on the morning of the murder but would not have established any alibi. The testimony of Schenkel and Schissler was heard by the trial court in an after-discovered evidence hearing and their testimony would not have assisted appellant. (Indeed, counsel did interview Schissler and appellant tried to convince Schissler to testify at the time of trial without success.) Appellant has failed to demonstrate any error.</p>
    <p id="b260-5" data-blocks='[["BL_260.4",260,[255,1120,1156,623]]]'>Appellant also claims that counsel was ineffective because of his trial strategy, and because of his failure to prepare defense witnesses, to obtain a continuance to delay commencement of trial, and to investigate his case. Testimony which the defendant believes was not helpful by hindsight does not lay the groundwork for an allegation of ineffectiveness. <em>Commonwealth v.

The record reflects no evidence that appellant was prevented from presenting any substantive testimony or evidence which would have contributed to the presentation of an alibi defense. Also, the record reflects no basis for a claim that he would have been entitled to a continuance or that he was prejudiced by counsel’s failure to request a continuance. The trial court concluded that counsel’s examination and cross-examination of witnesses was “thorough and exacting,” and that counsel appeared “well-organized and aptly prepared.” Further, following a review of the record as a whole, the trial court could not say that the course of conduct of <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>appellant’s trial counsel had no reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests and refused to second-guess trial counsel’s strategic maneuvering.

    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[196,582,1156,845]]]'>Appellant also claims trial counsel was ineffective because he should have familiarized himself with appellant’s medical history and should have had appellant psychologically examined. Counsel is not ineffective for failing to assert a defense that would not have been beneficial or for failing to interview witnesses whose testimony would not have been helpful. <em>Commonwealth v. McNeil, </em><a href="/pa/506/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="506 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1790951" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0607-01">506 Pa. 607</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="506 Pa. 607" data-case-ids="1790951" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0607-01">487 A.2d 802</a> (1985). The record reflects no evidence which would have enabled defense counsel to offer a defense of diminished capacity, mental infirmity, insanity or incompetence. Appellant’s defense was that he did not commit the murder, not that he did it and was insane. Further, it cannot be said that in light of all the alternatives available to trial counsel, the strategy actually employed by him was so unreasonable that no competent lawyer would have chosen that course of conduct.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.5",261,[196,1468,1159,802]]]'>Appellant next argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to retain expert witnesses and to familiarize himself with the Commonwealth’s witnesses. When a' defendant claims that some sort of expert testimony should have been introduced at trial, the defendant must articulate what evidence was available and identify the witness who was willing to offer such evidence. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b262-5" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[240,579,1161,1070]]]'>In <em>Jones, </em>this court held that a criminal defendant charged with murder is entitled to have his jury charged on voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter on request of counsel without regard to the evidence presented at trial. The rationale for this ruling was that the jury has the power to reach a compromise verdict and had “mercy dispensing power.” This court subsequently limited <em>Jones </em>by ruling that such instructions may only be given when the evidence would support such a verdict. <em>See Commonwealth v. Carter, </em><a href="/pa/502/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="502 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1784546" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0433-01">502 Pa. 433</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="502 Pa. 433" data-case-ids="1784546" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0433-01">466 A.2d 1328</a> (1983) (trial court may charge on voluntary manslaughter only where evidence exists to support such a verdict) and <em>Commonwealth v.

In appellant’s case, the record reflects no evidence, and appellant has referred to no evidence, which would support a verdict of voluntary or of involuntary manslaughter. Accordingly, had defense counsel requested a charge on either voluntary or involuntary manslaughter at trial, it would have been denied. Counsel is not ineffective for failing to make a futile request.</p>
    <p id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[237,1683,1157,466]]]'>Appellant also argues that counsel was ineffective for conceding the death penalty. The record reflects that, in his statement to the sentencing jury, counsel conceded that, by virtue of the verdicts of homicide and robbery, the aggravating factor of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6) was present. He then attempted to establish several mitigating factors in the appellant’s favor to outweigh the aggravating factor. It cannot be said that such strategy had no reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests.</p>
