After a brief conversation, Mark Lisby, Appellant and Lawrence Boston left the house and began walking west on Cumberland Street.

In a related claim (Appellant’s Brief, No. 4), Appellant argues that the use of his two other murder convictions to support the aggravating circumstance found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(9) (significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person) was also improper because of the existence of an entirely different aggravating circumstance found at 42 Pa.C.S. § 971 l(d)(l 1) (defendant convicted of another murder, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue). Appellant claims that since aggravating circumstance (d)(l 1) limits the use of a single murder to one <em>“committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue,” </em>aggravating circumstance (d)(9) should be construed to contain a similar limitation where the history of violent felony convictions happens to include murders. This claim ignores the language of these two aggravating circumstances, and the clear applicability of aggravating circumstance (d)(9) as discussed above.</p>
      <p id="b409-6" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[210,1850,1123,581]]]'>Nevertheless, Appellant contends that the limiting language of aggravating circumstance (d)(ll) should apply to the extent that murder convictions comprise a part of his violent history, since the limitation was enacted subsequent to, and is more specific than, the more general provisions of aggravating circumstance (d)(9). We agree that aggravating circumstance (d)(ll) is limited to additional murders “committed either before or at the time of the instant offense, ’’ which renders it inapplicable to the facts of the matter <em>sub judice, </em>since Appellant had not been convicted of a murder “committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.” However, we do not conclude that this limitation, which is designed to support aggravation based upon a <em>single </em>murder conviction, can preclude the existence of aggravation based upon a <em>history </em>of violent felony convictions, simply because the history may involve a conviction arising from a murder committed after the offense at issue.</p>
