The complainant, a female college student, left her class, went to her dormitory room where she drank a martini, and then went to a lounge to await her boyfriend. When her boyfriend failed to appear, she went to another dormitory to find a friend, Earl Hassel. She knocked on the door, but received no answer. She tried the doorknob and, finding it unlocked, entered the room and discovered a man sleeping on the bed. The complainant originally believed the man to be Hassel, but it turned out to be Hassel’s roommate, Appellee. Appellee asked her to stay for a while and she agreed. He requested a back-rub and she declined. He suggested that she sit on the bed, but she declined and sat on the floor.</p>

He then unfastened his pants and unsuccessfully attempted to put his penis in her mouth. They both stood up, and he locked the door. He returned to push her onto the bed, and removed her undergarments from one leg. He then penetrated her vagina with his penis. After withdrawing and ejaculating on her stomach, he stated, “Wow, I guess we just got carried away,” to which she responded, “No, we didn’t get carried away, you got carried away.”</p>

It was kind of like a push but not—I can’t explain what I’m trying to say.” She concluded that “it wasn’t much” in reference to whether she bounced on the bed, and further detailed that their movement to the bed “wasn’t slow like a romantic kind of thing, but it wasn’t a fast shove either. It was kind of in the middle.” She agreed that Appellee’s hands were not restraining her in any manner during the actual penetration, and that the weight of his body on top of her was the only force applied. She testified that at no time did Appellee verbally threaten her. The complainant did testify that she sought to leave the room, and said “no” throughout the encounter. As to the complainant’s desire to leave the room, the record clearly demonstrates that the door could be unlocked easily from the inside, that she was aware of this fact, but that she never attempted to go to the door or unlock it.</p>

The Opinion in Support of Affirmance acknowledged that physical force, a threat of force, or psychological coercion may be sufficient to support the element of “forcible compulsion”, if found to be enough to “prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution.” However, under the facts of <em>Mlinarich, </em>neither physical force, the threat of physical force, nor psychological coercion were found to have been proven, and this Court held that the conviction was properly reversed by the Superior Court. Accordingly, the ruling in <em>Mlinarich </em>implicitly dictates that where there is a lack of consent, but no showing of either physical force, a threat of physical force, or psychological coercion, the “forcible compulsion” requirement under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121 is not met.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

The phrase “forcible compulsion” is explicitly set forth in the definition of rape under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121, but the phrase <em>“without the consent of the other person,” </em>is conspicuously absent. The choice by the Legislature to define the crime of indecent assault utilizing the phrase “without the consent of the other” and to not so define the crime of rape indicates a legislative intent that the term “forcible compulsion” under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121, be interpreted as something more than a lack of consent.

    <p id="b384-11" data-blocks='[["BL_384.10",384,[266,1321,1155,744]]]'>As discussed earlier, the crime of indecent assault does not include the element of “forcible compulsion” as does the crime of rape. The evidence described above is clearly sufficient to support the jury’s conviction of indecent assault. “Indecent contact” is defined as “[a]ny touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of the person for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire, in either person.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3101. Appellee himself testified to the “indecent contact.” The victim testified that she repeatedly said “no” throughout the encounter. Viewing that testimony in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, the jury reasonably could have inferred that the victim did not consent to the indecent contact. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s verdict finding Appellee guilty of indecent assault.</p>

The Opinion in Support of Reversal in <em>Mlinarich </em>did not take issue with the implicit holding of the Opinion in Support of Affirmance that something more than a lack of consent is required to prove “forcible compulsion.” The Opinion in Support of Reversal acknowledged a general legislative intent to introduce an objective standard regarding the degree of physical force, threat of physical force, or psychological coercion required under 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121, in that it must be sufficient to "prevent resistance by a person of reasonable resolution,” but argued that the "peculiar situation” of the victim and other subjective factors should be considered by the court in determining “resistance,” "assent,” and "consent,” and that under the specific circumstances in <em>Mlinarich </em>sufficient facts were set forth to allow a finding of the requisite degree of psychological coercion to support the forcible compulsion element of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121. <em>Mlinarich </em><a href="/pa/518/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="518 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1811623" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0247-01">518 Pa. at 270</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="518 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="1811623" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0247-01">542 A.2d at 1347</a>.</p>
