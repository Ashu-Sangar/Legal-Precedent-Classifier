      <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>This case arises from a grievance arbitration award issued July 15, 1991, which overturned all sanctions imposed by the State Police against Trooper David S. Kornguth. Trooper Komguth had previously been before a Court Martial Board on February 28, 1990, which recommended that he be disciplined and dismissed for various actions it deemed to be violations of Pennsylvania State Police Field Regulations. Record at 10a. The Board’s recommendations, including the recommendation for dismissal, were subsequently adopted by the Commissioner. Record at 17a. Despite the dismissal, the State Police notified Kornguth on July 16, 1990, that he was eligible under a prior arbitration award to elect to have his case tried under a contractual grievance procedure that would culminate in binding arbitration. Record at 10a. Kornguth elected arbitration and a hearing was held on June 15, 1991. <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b669-5" data-blocks='[["BL_669.4",669,[195,703,1156,695]]]'>Record at 29a. Because it was not clear from the report whether Trooper Kornguth could return to full-time duty, the State Police requested a clarification from Dr. Cary as to whether Kornguth was capable of returning to full-time, unrestricted duty as a Pennsylvania State Trooper. In response to this request, Dr. Cary sent a letter stating that “Trooper Kornguth is not capable of returning to unrestricted full-time duty and the recommendation is to restrict the use of firearms and to have his behavior monitored by direct supervision.” Record at 30a. Dr. Cary again emphasized that Kornguth’s “behavior be closely monitored for at least six months before consideration is given to reinstating him to full-time regular duty.” Record at 31a.</p>

The State Police filed a Motion to Dismiss which, by court order, was treated as preliminary objections to the Petition for Review. The parties submitted briefs and oral argument was heard on April 16, 1992. Shortly thereafter, the court, in a memorandum opinion, sustained the preliminary objections of the State Police and dismissed the Association’s Petition for Review. <em>Pennsylvania State Troopers’ Ass’n (Trooper David S.

      <em>Id. </em>at 3. The court then concluded that “while it may have been more humane for the [State Police] to accept the psychiatrist’s suggestions, we are convinced that [the State Police were] not compelled to do so by the arbitrator.” <em>Id. </em>Consequently, the Association’s Petition for Review was dismissed. On appeal to this Court, the Association presents three related issues concerning the validity of the Commonwealth Court’s decision.</p>
    <p id="b670-5" data-blocks='[["BL_670.6",670,[247,1344,1155,513]]]'>The Association first contends that, contrary to the assertions of the State Police and the analysis of the Commonwealth Court, the arbitrator’s award does not require that Kornguth immediately and unconditionally resume all of his duties, but only that a determination be made as to whether he can be returned to his regular duty. The Association therefore argues that by not reinstating Kornguth, the State Police refused to follow the direction of its psychiatrist because his reports indicate that Kornguth might be able to resume his full-time duties.</p>
    <p id="b670-6" data-blocks='[["BL_670.7",670,[244,1889,1154,523]],["BL_671.1",671,[182,358,1153,424]]]'>The State Police respond by pointing out that the Association’s argument assumes, without factual basis, that the arbitrator directed the State Police to follow the psychiatrist’s recommendations. We agree and find that the arbitration award does not provide any basis to conclude that the State Police are bound to follow the psychiatrist’s recommendations. Nor can any such requirement be inferred from the unambiguous language of the arbitrator’s award which states, “[i]f the evaluation is such that [Kornguth] can be returned to full-time, regular duty, he will be reinstated as a State Police <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>officer.... ” Record at 23a. The arbitrator’s award created a duty to reinstate Kornguth contingent upon a psychiatric evaluation indicating that he was capable of returning to <em>full-time, regular duty. </em>The psychiatric evaluation of Kornguth stated that he was <em>“not capable </em>of returning to unrestricted full-time duty.... ” Record at 30a (emphasis added). Based upon this conclusion, the State Police were not required to reinstate Kornguth under the terms of the arbitration award.</p>
    <p id="b671-4" data-blocks='[["BL_671.4",671,[182,811,1155,522]]]'>The Commonwealth Court correctly observed that the arbitrator’s award did not include any reference to the contingency which arose from the psychiatrist’s reports, that being Kornguth’s return to work under restrictions. <em>Pennsylvania State Troopers’ Ass’n (Trooper David S.
