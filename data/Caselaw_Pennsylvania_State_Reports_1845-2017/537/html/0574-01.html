      <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>In the underlying medical malpractice action, Boettcher brought a wrongful death and a survival action against Dr. Robert L. King (“the doctor”) for the death of Boettcher’s wife, which occurred in the course of medical treatment performed by the doctor. On March 30,1987, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Boettcher for $500,000.00. Following an appeal to Superior Court and a petition for allowance of appeal to this court, the case was remanded to the trial court for entry of judgment in Boettcher’s favor. On December 21, 1989 the doctor’s insurer, Pennsylvania Medical Society Liability Insurance Company (PMSLIC), paid a total of $265,054.32 to Boettcher. This amount was comprised of $100,000, which was the limit of PMSLIC’s total liability, plus delay damages of $54,390.82, and post-judgment interest from the date of the verdict to the date of PMSLIC’s payment in the amount of $110,655.50.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The court entered judgment in the amount of $674,873.27, and on December 31,1990, the CAT Fund paid Boettcher $520,475.00. PMSLIC had already paid $265,054.32, bringing Boettcher’s total receipts to $785,529.32.</p>

On September <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>15, 1992, Commonwealth Court held that post-judgment interest is due and that it is payable by the CAT Fund.</p>

The sole issue in the case is whether Boettcher is entitled to interest on that portion of the verdict which is in excess of $100,000, and if he is, whether the doctor, the doctor’s liability insurer, PMSLIC, or the CAT Fund is liable to pay the interest. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Commonwealth Court’s determination that the CAT Fund is liable for post-judgment interest.</p>
