        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe question presented in this case is whether a claimant who has voluntarily retired from the work place is entitled to receive benefits for an occupational disease claim under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1\u2014 1031. For the reasons that follow we find that a claimant who has voluntarily retired is not entitled to benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (hereinafter the \u201cAct\u201d).\nThis matter commenced on May 2, 1988 when the claimant filed an Employee\u2019s Claim Petition for Compensation under the Act. At the time he filed the Petition the claimant was 68 years of age. Claimant had worked in the coal mining industry in Pennsylvania from 1939 until March of 1981. Claimant had worked for the appellant, employer, from 1955 until he retired on March 26, 1981. The claimant learned that he was totally disabled as a result of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis on May 20, 1985.\nHearings were held pursuant to the claimant\u2019s petition. Based upon the following findings of fact the referee rendered his decision awarding benefits to the claimant on March 21, 1989. The referee found that claimant had promptly given notice to the respondent of his disability claim on July 23, 1985. After receiving all the testimony the referee concluded that the medical testimony of claimant\u2019s expert was more persuasive and credible than that of the employer\u2019s expert. Thus, the referee concluded that the claimant was permanently disabled due to coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and that his. disability had resulted from his employment within the coal industry in Pennsylvania. Further, the referee found that the claimant\u2019s disability had occurred within 300 weeks of his last employment within the coal industry, where he was exposed to the hazards of the disease.\nThe decision of the referee was affirmed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board). The Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the Board. This Court granted the employer\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal, 533 Pa. 615, 618 A.2d 404.\nThe standard of review of this Court on an appeal of an order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board is limited to determining whether a constitutional violation, an error of law or a violation of Board procedure has occurred and, whether the necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments, 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301 (1990).\nThe employer contends that, as the claimant has voluntarily retired, and at the time he became totally disabled had no intention of returning to the work force, he has suffered no wage loss and is not entitled to benefits under the Act. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument on the basis that the claimant did not unequivocally indicate that he had no plans to re-enter the work force, and further found that, the employer had failed to establish the availability of suitable work. That Court then concluded that the claimant\u2019s retirement status would not preclude him from receiving benefits under the Act.\nWe disagree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s characterization of the facts. First, the claimant unequivocally stated on direct examination that he was retired. The referee found as a fact that the claimant had retired as of March, 1981. In addition, the claimant was 68 years of age in 1988. After 42 years in the coal mining industry it is highly unlikely that the claimant intended to re-enter the work force. Second, focusing on the employer\u2019s failure to show available work begs the question when the claimant clearly admits voluntary retirement from the work force. Given these facts, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that retirement is not a bar to receiving benefits under the Act was improper.\nThe fact that the claimant is disabled in a manner which is compensable under the Act is only one aspect of establishing entitlement to benefits under the Act. In Pennsylvania, disability under the Act has always been synonymous with loss of earning power. Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987); Petrone v. Moffat Coal Company, 427 Pa. 5, 233 A.2d 891 (1967); Unora v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 377 Pa. 7, 104 A.2d 104 (1954); Woodward v. Pittsburgh Engineering and Construction Co., 293 Pa. 338, 143 A. 21 (1928).\nIn Unora this Court discussed the importance of establishing both the medical and the economic aspects of a disability claim in order to ascertain entitlement to benefits under the Act.\n[T]he disability concept is a blend of two ingredients,---the first ingredient is disability in the medical or physical sense, as evidenced by obvious loss of members or by medical testimony that the claimant simply cannot make the necessary muscular movements and exertions; the second ingredient is de facto inability to earn wages, as evidenced by proof that claimant has not in fact earned anything.... The proper balancing of the medical and the wage-loss factors, is, then, the essence of the \u2018disability\u2019 problem in workmen\u2019s compensation.\nUnora, 377 Pa. at 12, 104 A.2d at 107, quoting Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (Vol. 2, \u00a7 57).\nUnora clearly established that entitlement to benefits under the Act is contingent upon proof that the claimant suffered an injury or disease in the work place and the injury or disease affects his or her ability to earn a wage. In the instant case the referee, the Board and the Commonwealth Court focused upon the fact that this claimant suffers from coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis that was clearly caused by his years within the coal mines, and that he is now totally disabled. Upon their conclusion that claimant has suffered an injury in the nature of an occupational disease, they awarded benefits. Nothing in the record speaks to whether or not this claimant\u2019s occupational injury caused \u00e1 commensurate loss of earning power.\nHad the claimant in this case established that he was forced into retirement by his disabling disease we would agree that his retirement would not bar his claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. In Petrone v. Moffat Coal Company, 427 Pa. 5, 233 A.2d 891 (1967) this Court addressed the issue of whether or not a coal miner forced into compulsory retirement at age 46, after 33 years in the mines, would be entitled to benefits. In that case, the Court offered the following guidance for determining when a claimant is unable to earn a wage due to his disability:\nTotal disability is a specific finding and not a general designation. Total disability refers and can only refer to individuals and not to masses or groups. A college professor with rheumatism in his limbs might still be able to teach, a professional author with tuberculosis might still be able to write books, but a compulsorily retired coal miner who has no training for anything but coal mining is totally disabled when he has no aptitude for remunerative work other than the one which requires muscular exertion.\nIf Petrone cannot mine coal or perform work which raises his biceps or the muscles in his back, he is incapable of producing income; he is without earning power.\nPetrone, 427 Pa. at 8-9, 233 A.2d at 893.\nA disability which forces a claimant out of the work force and into retirement is compensable under the Act. But, where the claimant suffers a disability which has no effect upon his earning power, no entitlement to benefits arises under the Act. This particular aspect of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was discussed in Kachinski v. W.C.A.B., 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987) where the Court compared and contrasted the differences between the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the Social Security Act:\nSocial Security is a \u201ccomprehensive contributory insurance plan\u201d, the purpose of which \u201cis to protect workers and their dependents from the risk of loss of income due to the insureds\u2019 old age, death or disability.\u201d The plan represents a \u201cform of social insurance ... whereby persons gainfully employed, and those who employ them, are taxed in order to permit the payments of benefits____\u201d\nOn the other hand, the workmen\u2019s compensation program is not a contributory insurance plan. Rather it is a means for the obtainment of compensation for injuries which has been substituted for common law tort actions between employees and employers....\nIn order to be eligible for disability benefits under the Social Security Act one must be unable \u201cto engage in any substantial, gainful activity.\u201d However, a workmen\u2019s compensation claimant, while he must prove that he was injured during the course of his employment, need only demonstrate that his injury causes him lost earning power.\nKachinski, 516 Pa. at 245-46, 532 A.2d at 376-77 [citations omitted, emphasis added].\nAs further support for his position the claimant asserts that his retirement is not a bar to benefits, as the Act contemplates just such an occurrence by providing for a 300 week period between the time the employee leaves the work place wherein he was exposed to the disease and when the claim for benefits must be filed. 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2). Claimant\u2019s argument is without merit. The 300 week time limitation is very simply, a time period within which a claim must be filed. Time limitations are not elements of the underlying claim. The length of time within which to file an occupational disease merely reflects the. fact that occupational diseases are latent and insidious in nature, often requiring years of incubation before they are discovered. Ciabattoni v. Birdsboro Steel Foundry & Machine Co., 386 Pa. 179, 125 A.2d 365 (1956). We do not read this provision as an entitlement to retirement benefits as a result of the latent discovery of an occupational disease.\nAccordingly, as we find that this claimant offered no evidence that he was forced into compulsory retirement due to his disabling occupational disease, but rather, voluntarily retired from the work force in 1981, he is not entitled to benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Benefits under the Act will only be permitted where the disabling, work related injury or disease, results in a loss of earning power.\nFor the reasons stated herein, the decision of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation as Senior Justice pursuant to Judicial Assignment Docket No. 94 R1800, due to the unavailability of LARSEN, J., see No. 127 Judicial Administration Docket No. 1, filed Oct. 28, 1993.\n. See, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.\n. A claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (WCA) is distinguishable from a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under the Pennsylvania Occupational disease Act (ODA). See 77 P.S. \u00a7 1201 et seq. Under the WCA benefits are awarded, as explained above, where the claimant has a disease or disability which directly affects earning power. Under the ODA benefits are awarded because the claimant suffers an occupational disease and the claimant\u2019s earning power is a consideration reflected only in the amount of benefits received, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1406.\nWe note, however, that this claimant would not be entitled to any benefits under the ODA as he is currently receiving benefits under the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801, and the two Acts are mutually exclusive. 77 P.S. \u00a7 1401(k).\n. Under other circumstances we would remand to the referee for a further clarification of this issue. However, in this case, the claimant in his reply brief asserts that he retired in 1981 because\u2019the employer closed the mining operation where he was employed at that time. This argument, although dehors the record, further illustrates the fact that this claimant never asserted, or could assert, that his disabling condition forced him out of the work force.",

        "text": "PAPADAKOS, Justice,\ndissenting.\nAt the very least, under the majority\u2019s theory of the case, I would remand this matter to the referee for a determination as to whether or not the Claimant, after voluntarily retiring in 1981 from his career employment, ever intended to re-enter the workforce in any other capacity. I would not create an automatic presumption that voluntary retirement at a particular age means that one never intends to work again in any other endeavor.\nOn a more fundamental level, I believe the majority is wrong in their loose reading of our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Nowhere does it say that retirement makes one ineligible for benefits. How could it when there are today few age bars to gainful employment? The majority decision is also contrary to comparable federal law. Under the Mine Safety and Health Act, 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801, et seq., retirement before becoming totally disabled by pneumoconiosis does not deprive a miner of benefits. See, Palmer Coking Coal Co. v. Director, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs of U.S. Department of Labor, 720 F.2d 1054 (C.A.9 1983).\nIn light of the instant employer\u2019s failure to show available work, I would affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court awarding benefits.",
