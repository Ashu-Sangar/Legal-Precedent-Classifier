The case was heard by a judge without a jury who found in favor of the defendant. From the judgment entered following the dismissal of their exceptions, plaintiffs appealed to this Court which upon stipulation of counsel remanded the case for additional findings by the trial court. Following the adduction of additional testimony by the plaintiffs, the lower court made supplementary and definitive findings resulting again in the entry of judgment for the defendant.

On March 8, 1942 he responded to a fire on a steamship. While fighting the fire, a guide rope was placed around his body as he descended or was lowered into the hold of the ship. When he returned home from work that day, he complained to his wife of pains in his stomach. Shortly thereafter lumps appeared in his stomach. On March 31, 1942 Dugan went to the Philadelphia General Hospital where a subtotal gastrectomy was performed upon him. Between March 31, 1942 and July 31, 1942 he spent periods of time in the Philadelphia General Hospital and in a convalescent home. He returned to work on December 16, 1942. From February 18, 1943 until March 1, 1943 he was out of work with an attack of the grippe. On September 10, 1943 he was readmitted to the Philadelphia General Hospital with an acute exacerbation of abdominal symptoms. On September 14, 1943 he was transferred to the convalescent home, but on October 27, 1943 he was brought back to the Philadelphia General Hospital with an intestinal obstruction. He died on November <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>8, 1943. This was eighteen months after the accident.

This section reads as follows: “The widow and the dependent child or children of a member who was killed while in the discharge of his duty, <em>or who died xoithin sixty (60) days after being injured as a direct </em>

    <p id="b457-3" data-blocks='[["BL_457.4",457,[164,749,1149,1143]]]'>Appellants contend that this by-law is invalid as repugnant to the provisions of the defendant’s charter, and as unreasonable. The charter provisions relied on are: <em>“2. </em>The purposes for which the said Association is formed are the accumulation of a permanent fund from the monthly dues of its members, from legacies, bequests, gifts and other sources, for the purpose of placing on the pension list such members as may be retired from the rolls of the Fire Bureau of the City of Philadelphia on account of chronic ailment, permanent disability through accident, or by term of service, and for the widows, or dependent parents and orphans of members who may be killed or die from injuries received whilst in the discharge of their duty. . . 5. There are no shares subscribed or to be subscribed, for the members are to pay in the common fund certain fixed sums to be known as dues or assessments, which are to be levied monthly for the purpose of accumulating, maintaining and upholding the said permanent fund referred to in Article 2 of this Charter.”.</p>

This is recognized in Article II of the by-laws which states: “The object of this Association is to accumulate a fund from the dues of its members and from legacies, bequests, gifts, and <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>other sources, in order that from this fund pensions may be paid <em>under certain </em>conditions to members of the Association and to families of deceased members.

However, blocking this reasonable and humanitarian delivery of benefits stands Section 5 of Article XI of the By-Laws which requires that service-connected death must occur within 60 days following the injury causing the death.</p>

A by-law declared that mere absence, no matter for what period, could not be accepted as proof of death. But the judgment of the lower court in the plaintiff’s favor was approved by this Court, which said: “A by-law to be valid must be reasonable in character (19 B.C.L. p. 1195), but here it is not, as affecting an outstanding certificate (Sambert v. Knights of Modern Maccabees, <a href="/mich/158/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="158 Mich. 568" data-case-ids="1585879" data-case-paths="/mich/158/0568-01">158 Mich. 568</a>) especially that of one who had already been absent for two years. True, the certificate provides, that the member shall abide by by-laws thereafter enacted, and that is valid insofar as his rights depend upon bylaws: but substantial rights which rest upon the contract cannot be abrogated by new by-laws, even where the power to make them is reserved. . . The right to rely upon the presumption of death is substantial, as it may be the only means by which a beneficiary can ever receive, and a policy-holder cannot be deprived of such as by a new by-law.”</p>
