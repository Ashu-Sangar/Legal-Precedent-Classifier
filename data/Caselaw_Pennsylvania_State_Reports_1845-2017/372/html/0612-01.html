Walter Braham, the President Judge, and Hon. John GL Lamoree, the Additional Law Judge. The District Attorney is Sherman K. Levine and he has one Assistant. On Friday, November 30, 1951 Judge Braham was presiding in one of the two courtrooms in a dispute involving the opening of some ballot boxes, following which there were two “non-support” cases to be heard; Judge Lamoree was presiding in the other courtroom, taking guilty pleas and sentencing defendants. Both the District Attorney and his Assistant were in the latter room helping to dispose of the business there being transacted. It appears that it had been more or less customary, in order to expedite the proceedings, for both the District Attorney and his Assistant to officiate in the same room when pleas were being taken and sentences imposed. When Judge Braham was ready to take up the non-support cases he sent a messenger to Judge Lamoree^s room to tell the District Attorney that his attendance was required in Judge Braham-’s court. The District Attorney returned word that he and his Assistant were busy in Judge Lamoree-’s court and they would come over to Judge Braham-’s room as soon as they could. Shortly thereafter Judge Braham sent a similar message to which the District Attorney made the same reply; a third request met with the same response. Finally, some two hours after court had opened, the Assistant came into Judge Braham^s room, followed shortly thereafter by the District Attorney himself. Judge Braham thereupon asked the latter why he had not provided a district attorney for his room, whéreupon, according to a finding of Judge Braham, “He then broke into a rude <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>and insolent denunciation of the Court saying ‘that’s the way with this court, always mixing things up; everything is set on one day’ ”. The Judge then said: “The people of this county are paying for two district attorneys. They are entitled to have one in each courtroom.” To this the District Attorney replied: “The people of this county are getting their money’s worth from the district attorney’s office.” Judge Braham states that people in the courtroom could not help knowing that the District Attorney had ignored his requests for attendance; also that the interchange of remarks above set forth were audible to the many persons there present.</p>

The next day the District Attorney wrote him a letter in which he said that his conduct had not been such as to require any explanation or apology, and that he could not, in justice to himself, submit to any public reproof; the letter proceeded: “Your statements regarding the friendly relations between us are insincere and do not impress me. I believe the fact that your conduct in certain matters is now under investigation by my office had no little to do in motivating your present action.”</p>

Counsel for the latter requested that a judge other than Judge Beaham; be assigned to hear the case, on the ground that the issue was between him and the District Attorney and involved personal feelings, to which Judge Beaham properly replied that the issue was between the Court of Quarter Sessions of the County and the District Attorney, and that there was no personal animosity between himself and the latter; accordingly he refused to disqualify himself. Just before the hearing ivas had the District Attorney sent to Judge Beaham a letter in which he said that the statement in his letter of December 4 about an investigation being conducted by his office was not intended to be in the nature of a “threat” but was merely an ansAver to the Judge’s professed friendship for him and his office which he felt to be insincere.</p>

He found that the defendant had been guilty of three acts of contempt; (1) his “insulting and contemptuous denunciation of the President Judge in open court on November 30 for fixing cases contrary to the wishes of the District Attorney;” (2) his “failure, upon reasonable request, to provide the assistance of a district attorney for the court in Court Room Number 1 on the same day;” (3) “the writing of the insulting letter of December 4”. Sentence was imposed upon the first íavo of these acts, but only such as “would be appropriate for the first of these offenses alone.” The court’s decree Avas that “the defendant, Sherman K. Levine is found guilty of contempt of court on November 30, 1951 and is directed to pay the sum of one hundred dollars for the use of the County and the costs.” <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>From that decree and sentence the District Attorney appealed to the Superior Court which, being divided on the question of the proper disposition of the appeal and there being no majority of the court concurring on any issue which would result in a final decision, affirmed the decree and sentence.

    <p id="b642-4" data-blocks='[["BL_642.5",642,[245,787,1153,1085]]]'>Generally speaking, one is guilty of contempt when his conduct tends to bring the authority and administration of the law into disrespect. The right to punish for such contempt is inherent in all courts. When it is committed in its presence the court may, in punishing the offender, act of its own knowledge without further process, proof, or examination. Such power, “although arbitrary in its nature and liable to abuse, is absolutely essential to the protection of the courts in the discharge of their functions”: <em>Ex Parte Terry, </em><a href="/us/128/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="128 U.S. 289" data-case-ids="3533595" data-case-paths="/us/128/0289-01">128 U. S. 289</a>, 313. It is a power “essential to preserve their authority and to prevent the administration of justice from falling into disrepute”: <em>Fisher v. Pace, </em><a href="/us/336/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="336 U.S. 155" data-case-ids="3939353" data-case-paths="/us/336/0155-01">336 U. S. 155</a>, 159. The Act of June 16, 1836, P. L. 784, §23, recognizes “the power of the several courts of this commonwealth ... to inflict summary punishments for contempts of court” in cases, inter alia, of “the misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice.”</p>

It is true that he <em>might </em>have done this, and there are cases in which such a course has been recommended by our appellate courts: <em>Snyder’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/301/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="301 Pa. 276" data-case-ids="1126384" data-case-paths="/pa/301/0276-01">301 Pa. 276</a>, 289, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%2033" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="152 A. 33">152 A. 33</a>, 37; <em>Commonwealth v.

In each <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>of those instances, however, there had been acrimonious feelings between the judge and the offender, whereas here there is nothing to indicate the existence, prior to this occurrence, of any strained relations. That a judge is not disqualified in contempt proceedings by the fact that the contempt was committed against himself is in accord with the almost unbroken current of authorities cited in 52 A.L.E. 1291; see also <em>Blodgett v. Superior Court of Santa Barbara County, </em><a href="/cal/210/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="210 Cal. 1" data-case-ids="2180208" data-case-paths="/cal/210/0001-01">210 Cal. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20P.%20293" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="290 P. 293">290 P. 293</a>, where the subject is discussed at some length. Nor is there any merit in appellant’s contention that, while Judge Braham might have taken immediate action when the contempt occurred on November 30, he lost the right to proceed by delaying for three days to issue the rule to show cause, in conducting the hearing two weeks later, and in not entering a final adjudication and decree until January 23, 1952. It is always within the discretion of the court whether to take action at once, based upon the judge’s own knowledge of the facts, or to postpone action in order to take testimony and give the offender the opportunity to make a defense: <em>Ex Parte Terry, </em><a href="/us/128/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="128 U.S. 289" data-case-ids="3533595" data-case-paths="/us/128/0289-01">128 U.

In the latter case there was a delay in the finding of contempt and the imposition of punishment for a period of more than eight months after the first act of misconduct had taken place and ten days after the most recent. But the Supreme Court of the United States pointed out (pp. 9, 10) that the term “summary” does not relate to the timing of the action but to a procedure which dispenses with the formality and delay that would result from the issuance of process and the holding of hearings, and that “If the conduct of these lawyers warranted immediate summary punishment ... no possible prejudice to them can result from delaying it until the end <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>of the trial if the circumstances permit such delay.” In the present instance Judge B rah am was well justified, and indeed acted wisely, in choosing to afford a hearing to the District Attorney instead of acting impulsively when his natural feelings of indignation might have overcome the requisite judicial poise and calm.</p>
    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.5",644,[240,732,1154,1250]]]'>Passing these general observations, we come now to consider the merits of Judge Braham’s conclusions based upon his findings of fact, having in mind what was said by Judge Keller <em>In re Adjudication of Contempt of Myers and Brei, </em><a href="/pa-super/83/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="83 Pa. Super. 383" data-case-ids="661263" data-case-paths="/pa-super/83/0383-01">83 Pa. Superior Ct. 383</a>, 387: “. . . as a general rule, — as in cases where the contempt arises from some misconduct committed in the presence of the court, . . . the appellate court will not inquire further than to ascertain whether the record shows such misconduct . . ., and its judgment on the facts is generally conclusive: . . . The question whether the alleged offender really committed the act charged will be conclusively determined by the order or judgment of the court, . . . .” See also <em>Commonwealth v. Newton, </em><a href="/grant/1/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Grant 453" data-case-ids="225870" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0453-01">1 Grant 453</a>, 454. Of course, as Judge Keller further said: “. . . this rule is . . . subject to the qualification that the conduct charged as constituting the contempt must be such that some degree of delinquency or misbehavior can be predicated of it; for if the act be plainly indifferent or meritorious, or if it be only the assertion of the undoubted right of the party, it will not become a criminal contempt by being adjudged to be so.”</p>

      <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>This was equivalent to a public assertion that the court was incompetent in the arrangement of its business, — not merely on that particular occasion but “always”. Certainly a remark of that kind was calculated to belittle the court in the eyes of the persons in the courtroom, and thereby to impair its dignity and authority. It must be remembered that those present were undoubtedly aware of the fact that the court had sent for the District Attorney and was awaiting his attendance. When he entered, instead of courteously explaining his failure to appear sooner, he openly and offensively belabored the court. There is pertinent here what was said in <em>Fisher v. Pace, </em><a href="/us/336/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="336 U.S. 155" data-case-ids="3939353" data-case-paths="/us/336/0155-01">336 U. S. 155</a>, 161: “In a case of this type the transcript of the record cannot convey to us the complete picture of the courtroom scene. It does not depict such elements of misbehavior as expression, manner of speaking, bearing, and attitude of the petitioner. Reliance must be placed upon the fairness and objectivity of the presiding judge. The occurrence must be viewed as a unit in order to appraise properly the misconduct, and the relationship of the petitioner as an officer of the court must not be lost sight of.” Even after he had had time to think the matter over more calmly the District Attorney added to his original offense by contumaciously refusing to apologize or in any way atone for his behavior. It need scarcely be said that it is the duty of a lawyer to maintain toward the courts a respectful and courteous attitude, not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but for the maintenance of <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>its supreme importance: Canon 1 of the American Bar Association Code of Professional Ethics.

It is true, as Judge Beaham states, that it is the function, not of the District Attorney, but of the court to arrange its business, — a duty which devolves upon the President Judge, who, of course, should always consult his colleagues for that purpose and have regard for their own plans and suggestions. Here it does not appear that the District Attorney intended to deny such power to the President Judge, or that, during the two years he had been in office, there had ever been any occasion to rebuke him in that respect or to admonish him as to the limits of his authority. Concerning his failure to come promptly, or to send his Assistant, into Judge Braham’s room when he was summoned, regard must be had to the fact that there were many cases then being disposed of in Judge Lamorek’s room in which lawyers, defendants, witnesses, and other persons were involved and in which he and his Assistant <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>were busily engaged, thus creating for him somewhat of an emergency situation. Undoubtedly it would have been better judgment on his part to have explained to Judge Lamoree that he was being called by Judge Braham<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and to request, therefore, that he be allowed to leave; it would also have been more mannerly on his part to have visited Judge Braham personally rather than return curt replies by the messengers, to have expressed his regrets to him, and to have asked him for instructions under the circumstances. However, his failure to do these things would seem rather to indicate a lack of tact than a deliberate intent on his part to flout the authority of the President Judge. On the whole, therefore, we absolve the District Attorney from a judgment of contempt on the basis of this particular charge, and we note incidentally that Judge Braham did not allow it to weigh in the imposition of the sentence.</p>

It was certainly highly insulting to express to Judge Braham a “belief” that his action in proceeding against the District Attorney was motivated by the fact that his “conduct in certain matters” was then under investigation by the District Attorney’s office; indeed nothing could be more reprehensible than the making of such an ill-founded and offensive charge. It appears that the “investigation” in question arose from the fact that Judge Braham was the Vice President of an organization the purpose of which was to preserve for the public some of the more beautiful sections of the county and to that end to have the County <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>Commissioners condemn those places for a public park; if such an “investigation” by the District Attorney was under way Judge Braham had not been aware of it.

See <em>Fisher v. Pace, </em><a href="/us/336/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="336 U.S. 155" data-case-ids="3939353" data-case-paths="/us/336/0155-01">336 U.

S. 289</a>, 313. But, just as a court’s power in such respect is great, so also is its responsibility for a proper exercise of the power eommensurately heavy. And, as a contempt by an attorney is relatively more culpable than that of a layman, so also is equal punishment, when meted out to an attorney for contempt, proportionately the more severe. The judgment of guilt stands against him as a proven violation of his oath. It is of highest importance, therefore, that a case such as this be scrutinized with special care in order that injustice be not done. That, I fear, the majority of this court has inadvertently failed to do.</p>

      <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>From my reading of the record in this case, I am persuaded that the court below erred grievously in making a contempt proceeding out of the matter involved and in summarily adjudging the respondent guilty. In my opinion, Judge Braham acted both captiously and ill-advisedly. The litigation which he initiated is now before us for review. I have, therefore, no alternative but to express my differing views. The principle involved is of highest importance. A conscience-free and judicially untrammeled bar is as essential to the proper functioning of our judicial system as are judges themselves. The issue far transcends the personalities of the parties immediately concerned.</p>

The order of affirmance entered by that court was not on the merits but merely <em>pro forma </em>in the circumstances. The majority for reversal was split as to whether the judgment should be reversed and the appellant discharged or reversed with a remand for trial of the issue before another judge. As the majority of the Superior Court was unable to agree upon the form of the reversal, a definitive order on the merits was impossible, hence, the affirmance. It is clear, however, that not more than three of the judges of the Superior Court could have been for affirmance while at least four were of the opinion that the judgment of contempt was erroneous: see <em>Levine Appeal, </em><a href="/pa-super/170/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="170 Pa.

Respondent’s counsel at once renewed their suggestion of disqualification for the additional reason that “the lengthy statement and argument just made” by the Judge gave further indication why he should not sit in judgment on the case. As evidence of his avowed personal detachment, Judge Braham retorted that the charge was that the Court of Quarter Sessions, and not he, had been contemned. Counsel then pointed out that there Avere two judges of the district, both equally qualified to sit in Quarter Sessions, and that therefore the case should be set for trial before the additional law judge. But, Judge Braham persisted in his refusal to disqualify himself and began the taking of testimony. He called six witnesses in chief, all of whom he interrogated in direct examination, and he cross-examined the respondent’s witnesses, of whom there were eleven including the district attorney Avhom he cross-examined at length.</p>

At the hearing two weeks later (December 17th) when the court crier was asked,— “Was the Court visibly angry”, Judge Braham interjected, “I would say so.” The probative value of facts based upon recollection may be impaired for a number of reasons other than a want of veracity in the recollector, — a condition which I do not attribute to Judge Braham.

And, although the district attorney literally begged Judge Braham to tell him what he had said that was contemptuous, the Judge failed to enlighten him. The following colloquy taken from the Judge’s extensive cross-examination of the district attorney at the hearing is illuminating: By Judge Braham: “Let me ask one question about Monday, December 3rd, when you say I dictated this statement which you presented. Isn’t all you said, Mr. Levine, ‘may I have a copy of that statement’? and didn’t I say, ‘yes’.” By Mr. Levine: “I did say that and I also said to you, Judge, ‘what did I say, have you a record of what I have said, I cannot remember anything, of saying anything that was contemptuous or insolent’, and you says, ‘good morning, get out of here, I don’t want to argue with you’.” By Judge Braham: “And I asked you, you’re right about whether there was a record made of what was said in court, and I asked Mr. Binder [the court reporter] whether he had any record and he said he didn’t, isn’t that correct?” By Mr. Levine: “That is correct, and then you said, ‘I do not want to argue the question with you, Mr. Levine, get out’.” By Judge Braham: “I think, Mr. Levine, your memory is in error on that, ‘get out’, I said, ‘good morning,’ didn’t I?” By Mr. Levine: “You also said, ‘get out’.” By <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>Judge Braham: “Let me ask you one question about this. Do you say that on the occasion here in court, which was I believe, Tuesday, December 4th, I said to you that your conduct in court didn’t amount — had not amounted to contempt?” By Mr. Levine: “That is what you said, Judge, in the presence of myself, Mr. Binder, Mr. Powers, and Mr. Klebe.” The import of the foregoing, in its unrefuted implications of issues of material fact, is self-evident.</p>

He offered the testimony of the court crier, Mr. Vance, on that point; and he later found in his adjudication that “The evidence of the Court Crier [Mr. Vance] corroborates the President Judge [Braham] as to the statements made.” It does nothing of the sort. What the court crier testified to in material connection under questioning by Judge Braham was, — “Q. . . . Could you tell us what was said when Mr. Levine finally came into court?” By Mr. Vance: “Well, he came in and as I recall, the Court, meaning Judge Braham, accosted [sic] as to why he had failed to respond to the summons that morning to appear in court room no. 1.” Q. “What did he say?” A. “Well, I believe it was a repetition of what he had told me, that they were too busy and that the —it wasn’t the District Attorney’s fault that the court calendar had been loaded down.” The difference in the respective versions of the Judge and his witness is material and, at least, calls for reconcilement which is a task for a disinterested fact-finder.</p>

Neither of these proceedings was taken.” Accordingly, the court held (p. 64), — “But whatever authority the court might have exercised at the time of the commission of said acts to take jurisdiction of her person and proceed as in a case of direct contempt committed in its presence, it had no right to assume jurisdiction of her person for such purpose [later] without any judicial process whereby it could be acquired.

Mr. Justice Jackson, speaking for the majority of the court, said (p. 11), — “We hold that Eule 42 [Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.] allows the trial judge, upon the occurrence in his presence of a contempt, immediately and summarily to punish it, if, in his opinion, delay will prejudice the trial. We hold, on the other hand, that if he believes the exigencies of the trial require that he defer judgment until its completion he may do so without extinguishing his power.” In the <em>Sacher </em>case, the trial judge merely awaited completion of the trial before sentencing defendants’ counsel for the contempts committed during the course of the trial. He acted at the earliest available moment, viz;., immediately upon receiving the jury’s verdict in the matter on trial. No such exigency existed in the instant case. Moreover, unlike here, all of the con-tempts cited and found in the <em>Sacher </em>case were matters of undisputed court record.</p>

Nor did the Judge take any action then to punish the district attorney for any contempt; indeed, so far as the record discloses, the word contempt was not even mentioned in the court room that day. No pending trial prevented the court from acting in the matter. Tlie court adjourned for the day at twelve noon. And the Judge made no move to retain jurisdiction that he might proceed summarily against the district attorney later. The only reason which the Judge gave for not having acted summarily on November 30th was that he was “too angry” and couldn’t trust himself to act justly in the matter at the time. Certainly, that condition was incapable of <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>continuing into the indefinite future the court’s power to proceed summarily. Three days later, the Judge called the district attorney into his chambers and, then, for the first time made known to him his intention to cite the district attorney for contempt unless the latter voluntarily submitted to a rebuke by the Judge in open court which the district attorney refused to do. Justifying the action of the court below, as does the majority of this court, on the basis of the <em>Sacher </em>case mistakenly extends, in my opinion, the ruling of that case far beyond its intended scope. The implied effect of this court’s present holding is that a judge can, at practically any time that suits his convenience or whim, take up for summary punishment an alleged direct contempt said to have been committed at some prior time and, that, without having contemporaneously declared the alleged contempt or having acted to retain jurisdiction to deal summarily with it later.</p>
    <p id="b662-4" data-blocks='[["BL_662.5",662,[279,1340,1154,985]],["BL_663.1",663,[168,346,1148,1265]]]'>(2) The court below, apparently recognizing the inappropriateness of belatedly proceeding summarily, entered the rule on the respondent with specified charges and fixed a hearing thereon. But, the court nonetheless summarily adjudged the respondent guilty by acting upon its own independent recollection of what had occurred in Court Room No. 1 on November 30th without any testimony to support the language that the court ultimately imputed to the distinct attorney. Certainly, a hearing and not a summary proceeding must have been contemplated. In Judge Braham’s statement to the district attorney on December 3rd, he announced, — “I will fix a, time and try you for contempt of court” (see statement ante). Again, in the statement which he made at the outset of the hearing on December 17th, he conceded the existence of an issue as to a material fact which, admittedly, had not occurred in his presence and which, therefore, required a hear<a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>ing for its determination. Thus, he then stated,- — -“I could not have determined that question summarily here in open court on November 30 because I didn’t know whether my messages to the District Attorney in court room No. 2 were delivered.” The necessity for a hearing was manifest. But, the hearing which the Judge conducted proved to be illusory. Summary procedure not having been availed of, it was not permissible for the Judge to make findings from his own memory, unsupported by a,ny testimony adduced at the hearing. It is therein that the fundamental error of this court’s affirmance also lies. The majority mistakenly attribute to a judge, upon the <em>trial </em>of a contempt, the right, which attends only a summary proceeding, to act upon his own recollection without testimony. The majority opinion fails to recognize that where “the issuance of process and the holding of hearings” is resorted to, the incidents of a summary proceeding do not attend. It follows, therefore, that the language, for which alone this court affirms the judgment of contempt, should have been charged openly and timely against the respondent and proven at the hearing like any other material fact.</p>

Indeed, he deemed that to be “the principal issue”. At the beginning of the hearing on December 17th, the Judge said, — -“There are two or three issues which I invite you [sic] gentlemen’s attention. First, is the contempt in open court. I might have imposed sentence on that day, but I was too angry. Then it turns out that there is involved this larger question; whether I, as President Judge, have the right to determine that there shall be a session of Quarter Sessions in this court room, contemporaneously with a session in court room No. 2. I <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>say, the power to decide that point rests with the Court. That seems to be <em>the principal issue, </em>and it’s a question of law” (Emphasis supplied). The first three of the six conclusions of law contained in the adjudication of January 23rd show how far afield from the contempt charge the proceeding digressed, <em>vide: </em>“1. The court and not the district attorney has the power to fix sessions of court. 2. The court and not the district attorney has the ultimate power to assign cases. 3. A president judge has no more power than an additional law judge except that he has the duty of assigning cases and determining the priority of business.” As to the sentence imposed on the respondent, the adjudication states, — “. . . this sentence is intended to demonstrate that the court and not the District Attorney has the power to fix sessions of the court and the ultimate power to assign cases .... The District Attorney continues ... to demand them for himself.” Even if he did, there was a more appropriate way for the court to settle that with dignity and effect. A contempt proceeding, especially one summarily conducted, should not be used to vent a judge’s anger or to placate his ruffled vanity over a supposed invasion of the prerogatives of his office.</p>

He [the district attorney] offered no word of explanation, or regret or of apology. The President Judge could only conclude that the District Attorney had not only run the courts on November 30 but intended to keep on running them. When the President Judge challenged this fatuous idea by his statement of December 3 the District Attorney responded with the letter [of December 4th] quoted in the 21st finding of fact.” Is it not a legitimate inference from the foregoing that <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>the Judge resorted to the contempt proceeding to chastise and discipline the district attorney not for anything that he had said in Court Room No. 1 on November 30th but for having devoted his own and his assistant’s services that morning to the disposition of criminal cases before Judge Lamoree in Court Room No. 2.</p>

The desirability and propriety of that course in circumstances such as here obtained has been judicially recognized and confirmed: see <em>Cooke v. United States, </em><a href="/us/267/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="267 U.S. 517" data-case-ids="6143413" data-case-paths="/us/267/0517-01">267 U.

The majority seek to distinguish the cases, just cited, from the present on the ground that, in those cases, “there had been acrimonious feelings between the judge and the offender, whereas here there is nothing to indicate the existence, prior to this occurrence, of any strained relations.” By the time of the presently pertinent “occurrence”, viz., December 17th, when the Judge refused to disqualify himself, there had been two and a half weeks of extremely “strained relations”. The record fairly exudes personal feeling and pique on the part of the Judge. A few illustrations should suffice. In the adjudication which the Judge handed down after seven intervening weeks in which to “cool off”, he states, in reference to a portion of the district attorney’s letter of December 4th to which he particularly objected,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>— <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>“He [the district attorney] keeps a black book of complaints and when he thinks he has enough against the judge, he flouts and derides his authority and defies him to proceed. This is the District Attorney’s version of ‘The Terror’.” Again, the adjudication queries and answers,- — -“Were an ordinary district attorney, well disposed toward all men, to learn that there was an apparent discrepancy between his plans and the plans of the President Judge, would he not at once have sought him out and endeavored to arrive at an understanding? This the District Attorney never did.” The stultifying implication is plain. As already appears, he charged the district attorney with entertaining a “fatuous idea”. He was especially aggravated by the district attorney’s letter of December 4th, terming it “insulting” and finding it to be an act of contempt which it certainly was not, as this court correctly holds. There is every bit as much reason for disqualifying the Judge from conducting the hearing on the contempt charge in the instant case as there was in the cases above-cited.</p>

    <p id="b671-5" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[173,581,1146,542]]]'>It is important to note that Judge Lamoeee, a veteran jurist and a former district attorney of distinguished reputation, testified at the hearing before Judge Bkaham that it was the practice for the district attorney and assistant district attorney to be in the sentencing court together on sentence day. He testified further that Mr. Levine had always been cooperative with the Court and that in his manner and conduct, Mr. Levine had always been “deferential with respect to the Court.”</p>

Does the Judge have the authority to settle that, or does the District Attorney?”</p>

Of course, it is the Court that has the power and the authority to determine <em>all </em>matters pertaining to the conduct of the Court of Quarter Sessions. All that Judge Braham, as president judge of Lawrence County, needed to do was to issue a Court order on the subject and that would have settled the question definitively and conclusively. The Court may naturally confer with the District Attorney in reaching its conclusion in matters of this kind, but it should not and cannot divide authority and responsibility.</p>

Not one of these witnesses quoted the words or described the conduct which Judge Braham ascribed to Mr. Levine. No one said that Mr. Levine was rude or insolent. One of the Judge’s witnesses was Clifford L. Vance who has been a Court crier of the Courts of Lawrence County for sixteen years. He is the one who carried the message to Mr. Levine and was present when Mr. Levine reported in Court Room No. 1. He testified that when Mr. Levine appeared, it was Judge Braham who spoke first, and the burden of the Court’s remarks was that Mr. Levine should account “for his delinquency” in not responding to the request of Judge Braham. The Judge said, according to Mr. Vance, that “the taxpayers were being defrauded” because both the District Attorney and the Assistant District Attorney were in Court Room No. 2.</p>

The Majority Opinion assumes that despite the direct evidence to the contrary in the record, Judge Bkaiiam’s conclusions must be affirmed because of his “findings.” The “findings” were not made on the day of the alleged occurrence, so therefore do not have spontaneity to support them, and, furthermore, they have no substantiation from the testimony presented at the time the whole episode was exhaustively treated from the witness stand.</p>

In that case the Trial Judge asked Attorney Schlesinger if it was true that he belonged to the Communist Party or any other organization committed to overthrowing the government of the United States by force and violence. This interrogation (done in the absence of the jury, parties and witnesses) was necessitated because in questioning the jurors on their voir dire Attorney Schlesinger had inquired as to whether they had been influenced by the “alleged political associations” of the attorney, those associations obviously referring to press notices regarding his alleged Communistic affiliations. It had been asserted publicly before a Congressional committee that this attorney had said: “While we have a strong Communist Party in New York City, I don’t see how we can wage a successful revolution unless we build the party in Pittsburgh.”</p>

But this Court ignored the finding of the Trial Judge in the <em>Bchlesinger </em>case when the Trial Judge said that Schlesinger had turned his back on the Court, had interrupted the Court when the Court was speaking, stated he would not show any respect to the Court, and so on.</p>

How does that differ from the <em>Bchlesinger </em>case? There, this Court held that the lawyer committed no contempt when he refused to answer the Judge’s questions which put him, at that point, where Levine was when he came into Judge Braham’s court. But whereas this Court found that Schlesinger was not guilty of contempt for acting contemptuously in the presence of the Court, it has found here that Levine was guilty of speaking contemptuously even though the remarks he made were only predicated upon his failure to arrive in Court Boom No. 2 on time, which this Court holds does not constitute contempt.</p>

If the cloak of dignity was rent by conduct that was rude and insolent, the mending should have been accomplished at once. A reprimand from the bench would have been the catalytic, bringing order out of disorder, calm out of turbulence, respect out of assumed disrespect. Judge Braham explained that he could not bring himself to doing this because he was too angry. He could not master the situation because he could not master himseif, but it is possible that the delay increased rather than decreased the choler. Certainly it threw the picture out of focus and it could also have ruffled the pool of memory.</p>

Judge Braham himself said that Mr. Levine had done “good work in his office as District Attorney.” In his adjudication in this case he stated: “The District Attorney in his two years of office has performed much meritorious service.” We have seen how Judge Lamorre also spoke well of Mr. Levine. If Mr. Levine, therefore, was an efficient public servant, a good citizen and a reputable attorney during all his years at the bar and no one has suggested to the contrary, it is improbable that he could suddenly decide to become contemptuous of the very Court in which he must earn his living. On his past performance and his good conduct, a little patience on the part of the CoujT would have been in order and this unfortunate long, drawn-out controversy would never have taken place.</p>

It began with a cheerful “Good Morning” and ended with an equally cheerful “Good Morning,” but in between those “Good Mornings,” there were sandwiched in many omens of a bad morning for Sherman K.
