Under The Third Class City Law,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">*</a> the only (relevant) qualification necessary for a tax assessor in third class cities is a residency in the city for the five previous years and ownership of real estate therein having a value of at least $500. The City Council, realizing that the City Assessor had little if any knowledge of the value of industrial machinery, entered into a contract with Cole-Layer-Trumble Co., a firm of out-of-state industrial appraisers to assist the City Assessor in appraising the machinery of certain plants for taxation purposes. Prom the fact that the City paid the appraisal company $58,000 to appraise the industrial machinery in 109 large industrial plants, it is apparent that such an appraisal required considerable knowledge and experience and a specialized ability <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>in that particular field. This contract also provided, inter alia, that the City Assessor should retain and perform his duties as Assessor.</p>

The interim assessments were affirmed by the Board of Revision of Taxes. Prom the Order of the court below striking off this interim assessment and reinstating the triennial assessment of 1948, the City of Erie took this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b113-4" data-blocks='[["BL_113.5",113,[154,1119,1148,926]]]'>The record in this case is both confused and confusing but we believe the following constitutes an accurate summary of the facts. Assessments of real estate, including land and improvements but not industrial machinery, made in <em>19J¡8, </em>for the triennial period (1949, 1950, 1951) were based upon <em>1933 </em>actual market values. What the Assessor should have done was to ascertain and fix the market value of each property as of 1950 and not as of 1933; and then if he so desired, reduce that value in every instance by a certain fixed uniform percentage or ratio. This reduction of the market value of each property by a certain and uniform percentage is a method often employed, although a strict compliance with the Statute would be to assess the property at its then existing actual market value, after which the proper authorities could, if they so desired, reduce the tax rate.</p>

The City Assessor had visited appellee’s plant on several occasions and had consulted with Cole-Layer-Trumble Co.’s appraisers frequently during their appraisal of appellee’s property, but had little if any personal knowledge of the value of industrial machinery or of the method or system used by the appraisal company to arrive at its final valuation. The appraisal company used replacement cost of machinery less depreciation to determine the actual or market value of the machinery in 1950. In this case, since the 1933 values were used for land, it would seem appropriate to use 1933. value for industrial machinery. However, (almost all of) the industrial machinery of this appellee, and of most plants in Erie, was admittedly not in existence in 1933; consequently the appraisal company selected 1941 which was generally considered a normal year. The Assessor then adopted as his valuation in each industrial plant the value of the industrial machinery found by the appraisal company which, as we have seen, was the replacement cost of such machinery in <em>191^1, </em>less depreciation.</p>

Appellee, the owner of the property, made no effort to prove the market value of its land or buildings or of its industrial machinery or of its property as a whole as of 1933 or 1941 or 1948 or 1950 or of any time whatsoever, but frankly admitted <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>that the 1950 market value would be very considerably above the Assessor’s interim (1950) valuation or assessment. Appellee merely attempted to prove by cross-examination of the Assessor (a) that he had very little knowledge, if any, of the value of industrial machinery; (b) that he had unqualifiedly rubber-stamped and adopted the valuations of industrial machinery made by the appraisal company with virtually no knowledge of how they were arrived at; and (c) that he had used a different and illegal method or yardstick or formula or standard to determine and fix the value of land, and of machinery in large industrial plants, and of machinery in small industrial plants. From the evidence elicited by a cross-examination of the City Assessor, appellee contended and the Court below found (1) that the City Assessor <em>never did in fact </em>make an assessment, and (2) the methods and standards he employed were illegal and non-uniform and (3) the interim assessment of 1950 was illegal and void.

The practical difficulties confronting the Assessor in this case must be obvious. There is no evidence how many large or small industrial plants are located in Erie, nor the number of homes and other properties which have to be separately valued and assessed; but since the population of Erie is approximately 130,000, the number of properties to be separately assessed must be very large. All the record discloses on this point is that the appraisal company made an appraisal (at a cost of $58,000.00) of the industrial machinery in 109 large industrial plants in Erie. It is well known that in the progressive industrial age in which we live, appraisals are often very difficult, and frequently require a special knowledge of engineering or of machinery or of minerals or of various component parts that go to make up the value of real estate.

The city contends that since the assessment of appellee’s property is admittedly less than the market value thereof, there cannot be a lack or violation of uniformity, and the taxpayer (appellee) has no standing to complain since he has not been injured.

In that case the Assessor assessed all virgin coal (as distinguished from “active” coal) throughout the township at the same figure, viz., $260. an acre, notwithstanding the fact that there was a great difference in actual value according to the location of the virgin coal. The Assessor then fixed 50 per cent, of market value as the assessed value. The township contended that such assessments were valid and “ ‘the courts may not alter individual assessments, provided they do not fix the value at a figure in each instance greater than the fair market value of each owner’s property, or, as in the cases before us, higher than the percentage of value, here fifty per cent, uniformly fixed throughout the county, . . . appellant’s not having shown that their assessments as made are in excess of fifty per cent, of the fair market values of their property, have no standing to complain.’ ” Mr. Justice Hughes, in rejecting this contention, said; (p. 28-29) : “We are unable to agree with this view. It is established that the intentional, systematic under<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>valuation by state officials of taxable property <em>of the same class </em>belonging to other owners contravenes the constitutional right of one taxed upon the full value of his property.

The conclusion is based on the principle that where it is impossible to secure both the standard of the true value, <em>and the uniformity and equality required by law, the latter requirement is to be preferred </em>as the just and ultimate purpose of the law.’ ”</p>
