The j'emaining defendant, Gibson, was then, and for fourteen years had been, the county controller. As prescribed by statute, the county commissioners and the county controller constituted the county salary board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> At the annual meeting of the salary board on January 10, 1952, the county treasurer participated as a constituent member, the number and salaries of his deputies and clerks then being under consideration.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> By a vote of three to two, the board adopted a motion made by one of the commissioners to reduce the treasurer’s staff to one deputy and three <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>clerks. From 1940, the office force of the treasurer of Northumberland County had consisted of a deputy and five clerks. The board did not, at this first meeting, determine the compensation that should attach to the clerical positions, which it thus allotted to the treasurer’s office, in the hope that the evident conflict between the board and the treasurer would be resolved amicably. - After several intervening meetings of the board without the attainment of that result, the treasurer on February 25th filed his complaint in this mandamus proceeding; and, on February 29th, the board fixed salaries for one deputy and <em>three </em>clerks in the treasurer’s office. The treasurer and controller left this meeting before the action just indicated was taken. The court heard testimony on the complaint and, on May 7th, entered the order, now here on appeal, which directed the board to fix salaries for one deputy and <em>five </em>clerks in the treasurer’s office. Subsequent to the entry of that order, the salary board met and, under protest, authorized the employment by the treasurer of two extra clerks and the payment of their salaries conditioned upon the entry of indemnification of the county should the board’s appeal to this court be sustained and the order of May 7th set aside.</p>

A careful reading of the record fails to disclose wherein the action of the salary board was either capricious or arbitrary. The board may have been mistaken in its conclusions, but that it acted in good faith cannot justly be denied. It is implicit in the lower court’s opinion that, for the purposes of the case, it assumed <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>that the salary board had authority to fix the number of employees of the office and, accordingly, did not rule on the legal question involved as to whether the salary board had such authority to act at its annual meeting but went ahead and entered the judgment directing the board to take action with respect to fixing the salaries of the larger number of employees of the treasurer’s office which the court undertook to fix and determine. The underlying question for decision, therefore, is whether the salary board has a discretion to exercise in respect of the number of employees to be allowed the treasurer’s office. If it has, then the action of the lower court in interfering with the board’s discretion was error.</p>

An accompanying Act, namely the Act of July 5, 1947, P. L. <em>1331, </em>16 PS note to §303, abolished all existing salary boards in counties of the classes designated by expressly repealing the various prior statutes under which such boards had been set up, and transferred their books, records and property to the boards created by the amendment of 1947. Since then, the law relative to county salary boards is applicable generally to <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>all counties of all classes except for counties of the first class of which there is, and has been, only one, namely Philadelphia County.</p>

Which of these two courses was actually pursued the record does not reveal. In any event, the number of employees in the treasurer’s Office of Northumberland County at the time of the salary board’s <em>annual </em>meet<a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>ing on <em>January 10, 1952, </em>was wliat it had been since 1940, namely, one deputy and five clerks.</p>

(Emphasis supplied). In this way, the appellee urges upon us, as controlling, our ruling in <em>Simon v. Allegheny County, </em><a href="/pa/337/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="337 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1197298" data-case-paths="/pa/337/0436-01">337 Pa. 436</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20A.2d%20868" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 A.2d 868">11 A. 2d 868</a>. But, the <em>Simon </em>case rested upon a markedly different statute than is here involved, namely, the Act of April 29, 1915, P. L. 200, 16 PS §§2265, 2266, which applied only to Allegheny County and was expressly repealed on the same day that the present salary board Act (amendment of 1947 supra) was enacted. Section 2 of the Act of 1915 provided only that “The said board shall meet, from time to time, <em>when required by any county officer, . . </em>. the number or compensation of whose employes is sought to be fixed and determined, and shall forth<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>with consider and fix and determine the same, in manner as they may deem best for the public service; . . .” (Emphasis supplied). There was no authority in the Act of 1915, as there is in the amendment of 1947, for a salary board’s revision of the number and compensation of the employees of a county office at the board’s annual meeting <em>without a request </em>from the official head of the office.</p>
    <p id="b132-4" data-blocks='[["BL_132.5",132,[231,781,1156,1098]]]'>The change, which the 1947 amendment effected in the law applicable to the <em>Simon </em>case, brought the law relative to salary boards in all counties of all classes, save the first, into harmony with what the law had theretofore been in such regard with respect to counties of the fifth class. Prior to the 1947 amendment, salary boards in counties of the fifth class were provided for by Section 7 of the Act of May 20, 1921, P. L. 1006, 16 PS §2347, and Section 7 of the Act of July 11, 1923, P. L. 1054, 16 PS §2397.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Both of these Acts related exclusively to counties of the fifth class. They identically prescribed that it was the duty of the salary board “. . . to meet together <em>on the first Monday of January in each </em>year, and from time to time as they may be required by any of the county officers whose salaries are established by this act, <em>and ascertain and determine the number of deputies or clerics required for the proper dispatch of business by each of such of</em>ficers, and fix the salary of said clerks and deputies” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

On the contrary, a salary board, operating-under the provisions of the amendment of 1947, has the power and duty to fix and determine, <em>at its annual meeting, </em>the number as well as the compensation of the deputies and clerks of a county office without any request from anyone; and that is precisely what the salary board did in the instant case. Moreover, no right of appeal to a court of common pleas from the action of a salary board is any longer provided for as it was under the Acts of 1915,1921 and 1923, all now repealed.</p>

The rule has long been established and calls for little citation of authority. In <em>Horowitz v. Beamish, </em><a href="/pa/323/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="323 Pa. 273" data-case-ids="1169572" data-case-paths="/pa/323/0273-01">323 Pa. 273</a>, 275, <a href="/citations/?q=185%20A.%20760" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="185 A. 760">185 A. 760</a>, Mr. Justice Linn quoted with approval from <em>Runkle v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/97/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="97 Pa. 328" data-case-ids="444832" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0328-01">97 Pa. 328</a>, 332, as follows: “ ‘Where a person or body is clothed with judicial, deliberative or discretionary powers, and he or it has exercised such powers according to his or its discretion, mandamus will not lie to compel a revision or modification of the decision resulting from the exercise of such discretion, though, in fact, the decision may have been wrong’ ” (citing cases). The <em>Runkle </em>case, in turn, had deduced the rule, as above stated, from cases going back to an opinion by Chief Justice Tilghman in <em>Commonwealth v. Cochran, </em>5 Binney 87, 102. Again, in <em>Dechert, Controller of the City and County of Philadelphia v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/113/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="113 Pa. 229" data-case-ids="457620" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0229-01">113 Pa. 229</a>, 235, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.%20229" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 A. 229">6 A. 229</a>, this court said,— “It is well settled that mandamus will lie to compel <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>the performance by public officers of duties purely ministerial in their character, but it is equally well settled that as to all acts and duties necessarily calling for the exercise of judgment and discretion on their part, mandamus will not lie. Whilst the writ may perhaps be awarded to set the latter class of officers in motion, and to compel action upon the particular matters over which they may have jurisdiction, it will in no manner interfere with the exercise of that discretion nor control or dictate the judgment, or decision which shall be reached. It is unnecessary to quote authorities in support of this plain and well established principle of the law; such has been the uniform course of all the decisions, and in this case we do not understand the doctrine to be denied.” For an interesting summary of cases in which a writ of mandamus properly lay, see illustration cited in <em>Commonwealth ex rel.
