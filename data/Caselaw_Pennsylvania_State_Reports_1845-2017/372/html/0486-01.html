Bonin. The official canvass and computation of the returns, which was made on November 7th, disclosed that Bonin had a lead over Flood of 834 votes. The final official computation, which was not completed until November 14th due to the necessity of including the returned soldier ballots, showed Bonin had won by a plurality of 601 votes.</p>

The court fixed a hearing on the petition for November 18th. In the meantime (November 14th), Flood sought leave to amend his appeal petition, which was allowed in due course, the amendment being as follows: “The petitioner, Daniel J. Flood, hereby appeals from the computation of the vote as made by the County Board of Elections on November 7, 1952, and appeals from the refusal of the County Board of Elections to canvass the congressional vote of Luzerne County, and assigns the following reasons in support of his appeal and requests that all the voting machines used in Luzerne County be opened and tabulated. . . . 11. That the refusal of the County Board of Elections to order a canvass of the congressional vote of Luzerne County was arbitrary, capricious and bias [sic] in view of the precedents heretofore established.”</p>

The matter was heard by the court en banc, one member (Lewis, J.). being absent; and oh November 19th, the court, acting by Valentine, P.J., filed an opinion with an accompanying order sustaining the Board’s motion and quashing the appeal. The next day (November 20th), Bonin’s election was certified to the Secretary of the Commonwealth. Flood took this appeal from the action of the court below on November 21st; and, three days later (November 24th), upon petition of the appellant, we entered an order making the appeal a supersedeas in order to preserve the <em>status quo </em>of the voting machines of the district <em>pendente lite.</em>

Prescribed procedures in election matters are creatures of statute and, unless one can point to statutory authority for the course which he chooses to follow, his action is without legal warrant. The appellant has not called to our attention any provision in the election laws of this State which authorizes a recount or a recanvass by the county board of elections of the returns of an election at the instance of a single person even though he be the disappointed candidate. Consequently, the Board’s failure to proceed to a recanvass did not constitute a competent order appealable to the court of common pleas under Section 1407 of the Election Code even if the appellant’s sug<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>gestión to the minority member of the Board, that it so act, be treated as an application by the appellant to the Board.</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[239,517,1162,1484]]]'>Two courses are prescribed by the Election Code for obtaining a recount or recanyass of the yote recorded in any election district on the voting machines used in the district. The one method is under Section 1404 (e) of the Code which provides that “... upon petition of three voters of any district. .. the county board shall . . . summon the election officers of the district [who] ... shall... make visible the registering counters of such [voting] machine, and . . . shall recanvass the vote cast thereon.” The other method is under Section 1702 (a) of the Code which authorizes “The court of common pleas . . . [to] make visible the registering counters of the voting . . . machines used ... at any . . . election, and . . . [to] recanvass the vote cast therein, if three qualified electors of the election district shall file a petition, duly verified by them” etc. Manifestly, the present appellant’s petition followed neither of the prescribed procedures. It was not signed by “three voters” as required by Section 1404 (e) or by “three qualified electors” as required by Section 1702 (a), all of whom are required to verify such petitions. Under a prior similar statutory requirement, we held a like petition “was defective for the reason it was verified by the affidavit of only one of the signers, instead of three, as required by the act”: <em>Edmonds’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/317/0151-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="317 Pa. 151" data-case-ids="8845452" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0151-01">317 Pa. 151</a>, 153, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%20425" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="176 A. 425">176 A. 425</a>.

The matter serves, however, to explain why the appellant proceeded in the manner he did. Eleven years before, the same two majority members of the County Board of <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>Elections, as at present, acted <em>of their own </em>motion, under authority of Section 1404 (e), to recanvass the vote for a particular public office, as shown by the voting machines in the 411 election precincts of the county, when the defeated candidate happened to be the nominee of their own political party. Such direct action is, of course, not only most expeditious but it also obviates a great amount of effort, inconvenience and personal expense to the aggrieved person. Otherwise, to obtain a recanvass of the vote in all of the election districts of Luzerne County would require 411 separate petitions, each signed and sworn to by three qualified electors of each respective district, plus filing fees for each petition, whether upon appeal to the court of common pleas from the action of the board of elections under Section 1404 (e) or upon original filing with the court under Section 1702 (a). It is quite understandable, therefore, why the appellant hoped to have the Board of Elections act of its own motion in the matter of recanvassing the vote for congressman, especially as his margin of defeat was considerably less than was that of the unsuccessful candidate of eleven years before. However, the discretion in such connection rested with the Board. And, while partiality in the discharge of official public duties, whether from partisanship or personal reasons, is, of course, to be condemned, any display of partiality by the Board of Elections in the instant case, if such there was, did not operate to confer upon the appellant a right which the Election Code did not give him.</p>
