L. 665, and the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter adopted by the electors April 17, 1951, effective January 7, 1952. In the study of the problems involved we have been greatly aided, by the comprehensive opinion filed by Judge Milner on behalf of the court below, with some, <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>but not all, of whose conclusions we agree. The appeals here presented concern the offices of the Sheriff, Register of Wills, County Commissioners, Recorder of Deeds, Clerk of the Court of Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions of the Peace, Coroner, Prothonotary of the Courts of Common Pleas, Board of Revision of Taxes and Registration Commission. Because certain special factors require consideration in the case of the Prothonotary, the Register of Wills, the Board of Revision of Taxes and the Registration Commission, we shall initially confine this discussion to the appeals dealing with the other offices named.</p>

It is our judgment that the year governing is the one that began with the effective date of the Charter, January 7, 1952, but that the time thus fixed was directory, not mandatory, and that the employes concerned cannot be deprived of their right to take the test either because of the failure of the proper authorities to conduct the necessary examinations or because of any pre-existing uncertainty as to the law, <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>and that, therefore, a further reasonable period of time must be allowed such employes for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b385-3" data-blocks='[["BL_385.4",385,[193,458,1149,1817]]]'>Notwithstanding the consolidation of the city effected by the Act of February 2, 1854, P. L. 21, the structure of the government of Philadelphia continually grew more and more complex and ultimately completely outmoded. Instead of a unified system there existed dual governments. Entirely different rules and regulations prevailed in the city and the county offices; in the one the employes were under civil service, in the other they were appointed without any examination as to their qualifications; in the one they were barred from political activities, in the other they were wholly unrestricted in that respect; in the one the officers were compelled to seek their legal advice from the City Solicitor, in the other they were allowed to have their own counsel. These anomalies flourished in spite of the fact that all the offices and departments, city and county, participated in the government of the same compact area and its inhabitants. Moreover, the personnel of the county offices were paid, after the Consolidation Act of 1854, not out of any county treasury, for none such existed, but by the city, and their salaries and wages were, except in the case of elected officers, fixed and determined by the city council: (Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 375, as amended by the Act of May 2, 1947, P. L. 134). It is no wonder, therefore, that over a great number of years there has been considerable popular agitation for the correction of this patch-work system and its uneconomic division of functions, and it was presumably in response to that agitation that the City-County Consolidation Amendment, the First Class City Home Rule Act and the Home Rule Charter came into being, bringing in their train’ the problems that have given rise to the present appeals. :</p>

Or whether, as to all these matters, further legislation by the General Assembly or the City Council is necessary to effect those results. The manner in which these questions are raised is by complaints in equity filed by the former county officers against the named city officials for injunctions to restrain the latter from attempting to apply to the plaintiffs these various provisions of the Charter; in the case of the Board of Revision of Taxes and the Registration Commission the proceeding is by petition for declaratory judgment.</p>

These distinctions, it is hoped, will become entirely clear in the course of this discussion.</p>

It provides in clause (1) that “In Philadelphia all county offices are hereby abolished, and the city shall henceforth perform all functions of county government within its area through officers selected in such manner as may be provided by law.” The crucial words there to be noted are <em>“hereby” </em>and “henceforth.” The county offices are abolished, not at some indefinite time in the future when a legislative body might so enact, but <em>“hereby ” </em>that is, by virtue of the constitutional amendment itself, which in this respect, therefore, is obviously self-executing. It will be further noted that all the functions of county government, that is to say, all the activities or duties theretofore performed by the county officers, are <em>thenceforth </em>to be performed by the city; the city is to take over <em>then and there, </em>as part of its own government, the performance of the functions of the county government. This provision also is clearly self-executing. Clause (6) of the amendment provides: “This amendment shall become effective <em>immediately upon its adoption” </em>Clause (7) provides that “Upon adoption of this amendment all county officers shall become officers of the city of Philadelphia.” Here again the amendment is manifestly self-executing, for the change from county to city officers is to take place <em>upon adoption of the amendment </em>— which, incidentally, occurred on November 6, <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>1951 — and therefore without the necessity of any further action, legislative or otherwise. Thus the county offices were effectually brought into the structure of the municipal government. And of course, when the county officers became city officers their employes automatically became thereby city employes.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> It is true that clause (7) further states that “until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide,” the county officers [having now become officers of the City of Philadelphia] “shall continue to perform their duties and be elected, appointed, compensated and organized in such manner as may be provided by the provisions of this Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth in effect at the time this amendment becomes effective, . . In other words the county, now city, officers were to carry on their duties or functions just as before the transformation took place and until such <em>duties </em>or <em>functions </em>should be changed by legislative action. But this provision obviously did not purport to deal with the effect of the change from county to city status on the <em>person nel </em>of the county offices, — an entirely different question from that of the continued operation of the functions or duties imposed on them by then existing law.</p>

Plaintiffs, the former county officers, contend that those changes effected nothing more than one of nomenclature, referring, in support of that proposition, to the cases of <em>Taggart v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, </em><a href="/pa/102/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="102 Pa. 354" data-case-ids="502710" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0354-01">102 Pa. 354</a>, which dealt with the City Controller, and <em>Commonwealth v.

So far, however, from those authorities justifying the contention, they would seem to lead to exactly the opposite conclusion, inasmuch as they held that those officers having been designated by the Act of February 2, 1854, P. L. 21, as city officers but by Article XIV, section 1 of the Constitution of 1874 as county officers, the change thus effected was one <em>not </em>merely of names, but that, now as county officers, they had become subject to the law governing the filling of vacancies in county offices as distinguished from the law applicable to the filling of vacancies in city offices. In the <em>Taggart </em>case it was expressly said (p. 364) : “In determining what class of officials should be designated county officers, the [constitutional] convention manifestly had in view those whose duties were co-extensive with the boundaries of the county, and the character of the duties which they performed, rather than the names by which they were called. The purpose was to deal with duties, using names so far only as to indicate the objects to be attained.”</p>

Certainly something more substantial <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>was intended to be wrought by its enactment.

The one phase is completed in that the county offices are now a part of the municipal government and that all their officers and employes are now city officers and employes and as such bound by the provisions of the Charter concerning such officers and employes. But their <em>activities </em>or <em>functions </em>are not changed; they will operate just the same as before and continue to perform their present duties until the next stage of the project is entered upon, which is to accomplish what may be termed the <em>intra </em>city consolidation, that is, the reorganization or “streamlining” of the municipal governmental structure, now enlarged by the acquisition of the former county offices. Since clause (7) of the City-County Consolidation Amendment provides that the county officers are to continue, now as city officers, to perform their duties “until the General Assembly shall otherwise provide,” it would seem that any proposed reorganizations, regroupings, abolitions, or mergers, of the former county offices, designed the more advantageously to incorporate their functions into the existing municipal structure, must wait upon action by the General Assembly. Whether, however, the legislature has already abrogated its power in that regard and vested it exclusively in the city by the provisions of Article II, section 17, of the Home Rule Act or otherwise, is a question not involved in the present appeals, and as to which, therefore, we express no opinion.</p>

As to the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>Prothonotary, it is provided in Article Y, section 7 of the Constitution that “For Philadelphia there shall be one prothonotary’s office, and one prothonotary for all said courts, to be appointed by the judges of said courts, . . .; the said prothonotary shall appoint such assistants as may be necessary and authorized by said courts; . . . .” While it is true that by Article XIY, section 1, of the Constitution, the prothonotary is designated as a county officer, and that clause (7) of the City-County Consolidation Amendment provides that upon its adoption all county officers should become officers of the City of Philadelphia; the question arises whether, in view of Article V, section 7, the Prothonotary should be considered a county officer <em>within the intendment </em>of the City-County Consolidation Amendment. It is an established principle of constitutional construction that, where a conflict exists between a specific constitutional provision which is applicable to a particular case and certain general provisions which, were it not for such conflict, might apply, the specific provision will prevail: <em>Philadelphia v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/270/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="270 Pa. 353" data-case-ids="1066021" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0353-01">270 Pa. 353</a>, 358, 359, <a href="/citations/?q=113%20A.%20661" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="113 A. 661">113 A. 661</a>, 662; <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v.

Here, such a conflict does exist because, if the provision of the City-County Consolidation Amendment were to be deemed applicable to the Prothonotary, clause (7) thereof would enable the General Assembly or the City Council, as the case may be, so to emasculate his functions as practically to abolish his office altogether, and, while presumably such extreme power would not be lightly exercised, its mere existence would constitute an encroachment upon the independence and the functioning of the judiciary. Furthermore, since the Prothonotary is authorized by Article 5, section 7, to appoint such assistants as may be necessary and authorized by the courts, that authority, if it were to be circumscribed by such regulations as the Civil Service Commission might <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>see fit to apply, could conceivably be impaired or even wholly nullified. Nor do we see any basis for the distinction made by the court below in regard to appointments of certain deputies or assistants specified in legislative acts implementing the constitutionally conferred authority. It is because of the constitutional status specially given the Prothonotary (as distinguished from the Clerk of Quarter Sessions, who is not specifically referred to in the judiciary article of the Constitution, apparently because his office was not regarded as so essential to the functioning of the judicial system as to constitute a fundamental part thereof), that we are led to conclude that the office of the Prothonotary does not fall within the scope of the City-County Consolidation Amendment, and that therefore, not being transformed into a city office, it has not become subject to the provisions of the Charter.</p>

As to its not being listed as a county office in Article XIV, section 1, it would seem sufficient to say that, being a form of organization not common to all the counties of the Commonwealth, its inclusion in that enumeration would scarcely have been in order, the classification there made being presumably intended to refer only to those officers who functioned in <em>every </em>county.

L. 47) did not constitute a county office, was based upon the fact that the Board was entrusted with the duty of making assessments and valuations of property taxable for both State and county purposes; indeed the court there said (p. 141, A. p. 568) that “The appointment of the board is primarily for the state as well as for the county, and though the former looks to the latter for the payment to it of a certain tax, the legislature does not permit the county through its township and ward assessors to assess and value property upon which the state tax has been imposed, but directs that this board shall be appointed <em>for that specific </em>purpose.” In <em>Selig v.

In the very <em>Suermann </em>case above referred to, it was said (p. 201, A. p. 652) that the finding by the Board of Revision of Taxes of the base on which the levy of the tax wa.s to be applied was an executive function “delegated to a <em>municipal </em>agency.” In the latest case in which the question has been raised, <em>Clark v.

The boards of revision originally established for all the counties of the State were composed of the county commissioners and associate judges of each county: Act of July 27,1842, P. L. 441, section 10.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> In counties of the second class, by the Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 626, the members of the Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review are now appointed by county commissioners; in counties of the third class, by the Act of June 26, 1931, P. L. 1379, the members of the Board for the Assessment and Revision of Taxes are also appointed by the county commissioners; in counties of the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth classes the Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, by the Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 571, are composed of the county commissioners themselves. In <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Smillie v. McElwee, </em><a href="/pa/327/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="327 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1176746" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0148-01">327 Pa. 148</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20A.%20628" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="193 A. 628">193 A. 628</a>, it was accordingly pointed out (p. 156, A. p. 632) that in sixty of the sixty-seven counties of the State the assessment of property is in the hands of the county <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>commissioners, and in six counties the assessments are made by a board appointed by the county commissioners, so that in all the counties of the State other than Philadelphia the assessment of property has thus been directly recognized by the legislature as being purely a county function. By what process of reasoning, therefore, is it conceivable that the same function carried on in Philadelphia is in any respect different as to its county status from that of the similar boards in all the other counties? The State long since became unconcerned with county assessments of property as the basis of any State tax. Performing, therefore, a purely local function upon which the entire fiscal system of Philadelphia is dependent, there is no ground whatever for viewing the Board other than as a county office, and, as such, transformed by the City-County Consolidation Amendment into a city office. Certainly the mere fact that it was specifically established by an act of the legislature does not make it a State agency; all non-constitutional offices are necessarily so created.</p>

(9) Providing for the assessment of real or personal property and persons for taxation purposes.” It is argued that because of this provision the city can exercise no power of any kind over the Board of Revision of Taxes. Such a contention scarcely merits discussion. What was obviously intended by that provision of the statute was that the city should not have the power to legislate in regard to the substantive rules governing the making of assessments and valuations of property. For example, the city cannot change the provision of section 13 of the Act of 1939 (under which the Board <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>now operates) that all taxable property shall be valued and assessed by the assessors and by the board at the actual value thereof, in determining which the price for which it would bona fide sell shall be considered but not be controlling.

Like the Board of Revision of Taxes the Registration Commission is not referred to in the Constitution. It was created by the Act of March 30, 1937, P. L. 115, the title of which is “The First Class City Permanent Registration Act”; it gave the Commission “jurisdiction over the registration of electors of such city.” The Registration Commission is no more a State agency than is the Board of Revision of Taxes. In cities of the second class (Act of May 25, 1937, P. L. 814) and in cities of the second class A (Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1132) there are also registration commissions, the members of which, like those of the Registration Commission in Philadelphia, are appointed by the Governor, but in cities of the third class (Act of May 25, 1937, P. L. 849) and in boroughs, towns and townships (Act of April 29, 1937, P. L. 487) the registration commissions consist of the county commissioners themselves in each county. Article VIII, section 7 of <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>the Constitution provides that whereas laws for the registration of electors shall be uniform throughout the State, such laws may be enacted to apply to cities only, provided that such laws be uniform for cities of the same class. The Registration Commission in Philadelphia is a purely city agency. Plaintiffs contend that the members and employes of the Commission are not subject to the provisions of the Charter because, by Section 18 of the Home Rule Act, the city is forbidden to exercise powers contrary to, or in limitation or enlargement of, powers granted by acts of the General Assembly which are — (a) Applicable to a class or classes of cities on the following subjects: <em>. </em>. (7) providing for the personal registration of electors.” There is no merit in this argument. The provision in question means merely that the city cannot, for example, amend or nullify general laws of the State regarding the qualifications which entitle an elector to be registered, or laws concerning, not the <em>personnel </em>of the office of the Registration Commission, but the <em>functions </em>or <em>duties </em>they perform — laws in force throughout the entire Commonwealth. We conclude, therefore, that the members of the Registration Commission are city officers, that their employes are city employes, and that members and employes alike are bound by the provisions of the Charter.</p>
