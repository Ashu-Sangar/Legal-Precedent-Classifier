Ducellier, as surviving spouse of Russell R. Stauffer, who died intestate, her share of the estate under the intestate law. Claimant remarried after decedent’s death. She claimed as surviving spouse under an alleged common law marriage, following an illicit or meretricious relation with decedent. Decedent’s only other next of kin are two sisters, the appellants.</p>
    <p id="b562-11" data-blocks='[["BL_562.20",562,[261,1844,1153,263]]]'>An experienced and able auditor heard the testimony and carefully weighed all the evidence.

Having read and considered the testimony, we appreciate the reluctance and hesitancy of the auditor to accept as true the <em>oral testimony </em>of <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>claimant concerning the existence of the alleged marriage. There can be no serious question that the relationship in its inception was illicit and meretricious. Between February and July 1.934 the parties lived together alone in an apartment over decedent’s garage. The auditor or the court below would have been gullible indeed had they found that no illicit and meretricious relation existed. As the relationship was illicit and meretricious in its inception, it is <em>presumed </em>to have continued so until a change in such relationship was affirmatively established. In the <em>Estate of Mary F. Hughes, </em><a href="/pa-super/98/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Pa.

Superior Ct. 328</a>, where the relations between the parties were illicit and meretricious at the beginning, Judge Linn (later Justice Linn of this Court) said, p. 332: “The legal consequence, the presumption, the inference to be made from that evidence, is, that their relations thereafter remained as they were before — meretricious, and condemned by the law. To the inquiry — how long that legal consequence continued? the law answers — until changed by conduct that the law regards as sufficient proof of the establishment of a lawful relation, i.e. marriage. Appellant does not contend that there was a ceremonial marriage after his divorce; nor does he contend that the parties married ‘by words in the present tense, uttered with a view and for the purpose of establishing the relation of husband and wife’: Murdock’s Est., <a href="/pa-super/92/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="92 Pa.

She said the words were spoken on the steps of the court house on July 18, 1934, as they were leaving that building after obtaining a marriage license. There were no witnesses to the alleged verbal marriage contract. The auditor’s belief in the truth of claimant’s testimony, <em>unsupported, </em>would depend upon the auditor’s belief as to her credibility. In <em>Buradus v. Gen. Cement Prod.
