During their marriage the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company issued a certificate of insurance on the life of Paul in which Jane was designated beneficiary. The insured reserved the right to change the beneficiary without the consent of the beneficiary. The policy remained in force and effect to the time of Paul’s death on May 16, 1951. In 1948 Paul obtained an absolute divorce from Jane. Prior to the granting of the divorce, they had entered into a separation and property settlement agreement wherein Paul agreed “that the Metropolitan Life Insurance policy taken out on his life, the premiums of which are paid by him, which payments are deducted as a standard deduction by his employer, shall continue to be paid by him for and during his life, and that the beneficiary of said policy, his present wife, shall be made irrevocable, subject only to change in the event said parties should ever be <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>divorced and the wife should remarry.” The insurance company was never informed of the agreement. Paul married the defendant, Doris Hundertmark, in 1949. Jane never remarried. On April 6, 1951, Paul revoked the designation of Jane and named Doris as beneficiary of the policy without any inducement by Doris. The case was heard below by a court en banc which entered a final decree awarding the proceeds of the insurance policy, less certain expenses, to Doris Hundertmark, the defendant; and the plaintiff appealed.</p>

Subsequent to the marriage, he again made his daughter the beneficiary of the certificate. On the death of the insured, the widow and the daughter each claimed the benefits under the certificate. The society filed a bill in equity to compel the claimants to inter-plead and for leave to pay the fund into court both of which were done. This court affirmed, per curiam, an award of the money to the widow on the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the chancellor, whose determinative conclusions of law were as follows: “First. Minnie Ulanowsky having agreed, in consideration of being made beneficiary in the policy herein, to marry the insured, and having performed that promise, acquired an equitable right in the benefit represented by the certificate.

These suggested distinctions are mere differentiations without any pertinent legal significance. For the ante-nuptial contract as in the <em>Wolfe </em>and <em>Ulanowsky </em>cases, there is in the instant case an equally binding and effective separation and property settlement agreement. Although entered into during the marriage (necessarily so) and therefore postnuptial, the agreement did not lack consideration. The reciprocal promises and surrender by the husband and wife of marital rights as a part of the anticipated separation constituted valuable considerations for the contract. In exchange for the husband’s promise of the wife’s continued future status as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy, she surrendered her right to maintenance and support as well as her inchoate right of dower.</p>

Neither of those cases is presently in point. The <em>Shay </em>case was a contest between the named beneficiary of a policy and the insured’s later assignee thereof for value. The assignment was held to be an effectual exercise of the insured’s unencumbered right to change the beneficiary. The assignee was accordingly awarded the proceeds of the policy. In the <em>Fidelity Trust Company </em>case the first named beneficiary (a wife), for whom the insured later substituted another beneficiary, failed to prove the contract which she contended bound the insured not to change her as the beneficiary. However, the plain implication of the reasoning of this court in the <em>Fidelity Trust Company </em>case is that, if the eliminated beneficiary of the policy had been able to prove a binding contract on the part of the insured not to change the beneficiary, her right to the proceeds of the policy would have been good as against the substituted beneficiary.</p>

The legal situation is that the first wife was a contractually irrevocable beneficiary for value and the second wife was the “volunteer”.

In both <em>Visnik v. Mance </em>and <em>Mocan v. Nejak, </em>cit. supra, the certificates of insurance were under group policies.

In the <em>Shay </em>case this Court said: (p. 103) “As a result of this provision, plaintiff had no vested right or interest in the insurance but only an expectation of benefit, and when her husband exercised his right to change the beneficiary her expectation became ‘merely a prospect that had vanished’: Fidelity Trust Company v. Travelers Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/320/0161-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="320 Pa. 161" data-case-ids="1163724" data-case-paths="/pa/320/0161-01">320 Pa. 161</a>, 166. <em>In almost all jurisdictions it is held that, when the right to change the beneficiary is reserved, the insured may assign the policy without the beneficiary’s consent </em>. . .” (Italics supplied)</p>
    <p id="b172-4" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[256,1172,1150,264]]]'>In the <em>Fidelity </em>case, this Court, speaking through Chief Justice Maxey, said: 166) “When defendant’s husband exercised his undoubted right to change the beneficiary, the wife’s expectation became merely a prospect that had vanished.”</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.6",172,[255,1449,1150,420]]]'>I repeat that it is unfortunate that one of two deserving women must be denied the benefits of the insurance policy in this case. However, if the law, as I see it, must award the benefits of the policy to Mrs. Doris Hundertmark I see some poetic justice in this: Of the two Mrs. Hundertmarks who vowed to live with Paul Hundertmark “until death did them part,” Doris Hundertmark is the one who did.</p>
