    <p id="b225-10" data-blocks='[["BL_225.15",225,[185,1275,1146,421]]]'>Plaintiff commenced the present proceeding by filing a bill in equity for partition of four parcels of real estate, alleging that under the will of their mother, Sophia Kikel, she and her four brothers (defendants) were tenants in common of these properties.

The pleadings do not disclose the amount of her debts at the date of death. The executor has collected $8,-228.41 in rents and profits of the real estate and has paid out $8,438.14 on account of debts, maintenance of the properties, taxes, fire insurance premiums, and legacies.</p>
    <p id="b226-7" data-blocks='[["BL_226.7",226,[250,1676,1152,544]]]'>It is a rule of long standing that “conversion is always a question of intent”: <em>Hunt’s and Lehman’s Appeals, </em><a href="/pa/105/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="105 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="454272" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0128-01">105 Pa. 128</a>, 141. The three indications of an intent to convert are: (1) a positive direction to sell, (2) an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will, or (3) such blending of realty and personalty as to show clearly that testator intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath that fund as money: <em>Lagges Estate, </em>361.

While the will con<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>tains no positive direction to sell, there is an absolute necessity to sell at least some of the real estate to pay legacies; also the words of the residuary clause indicate an intent to treat realty and personalty as one fund for distribution. Appellant has attempted in her paper book to distinguish the present case from <em>Lagges Estate </em>by saying that there “conversion was effected by an actual sale of real estate”. Such an interpretation of the case overlooks the plain language of the opinion: “. . . we have construed this will as a blending and conversion of real estate into personalty. . .” (p. 208). ,</p>
