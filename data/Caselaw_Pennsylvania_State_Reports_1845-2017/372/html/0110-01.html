Tarr (husband and wife) the sum of $3,213.82 from the estate of Agnes Irvine, deceased, for room, board and laundry supplied the decedent in her lifetime by the Tarrs which she accepted. The award was limited to the period of time permitted a claimant by the statute of limitations. The appellant is Alice Lipps, a niece of the decedent and her sole heir and next of kin.</p>

What the evidence did prove, qua facts, is clear and precise enough. The question involved is as to the legal sufficiency of the proofs to imply a promise to pay. No departure from the long and well established rules of law relative to claims against decedents’ estates, resting in parol, is either suggested or effected by the result reached by the learned court below.</p>

She was not related to the Tarrs either by blood or marriage. She had the exclusive use of a room in the Tarr home as her bedroom and also had the freedom and use of the downstairs which included a bath room. Her meals, which the Tarrs supplied, she ate at their table. She was 78 years old at the time of her death and, during all of the time she lived with the Tarrs with the exception of a few weeks, she was able to move around the house, tidy up her own room and occasionally help with the dishes and cooking. Her laundry work was done by Mrs. Tarr.</p>

She left personalty of a total value of $42. Her only income, while she lived with the Tarrs, was $20 per month which she received as rent for her house. Out of that, she took care of her clothing, paid for the upkeep and taxes on her real estate and gave the Tarrs $3 <em>a month. </em>She wished not to convert her real estate in her lifetime, telling a friend (an almost daily visitor), who was a disinterested witness, that she paid the Tarrs “$3.00 a month for her room rent, and it was not enough,” but that, if she sold her property, by the time “. . . she paid Agnes and Ed [the claimants] she wouldn’t have anything to come and go on at all.” She told another witness substantially the same thing.</p>

There was no relationship between the claimants and the decedent to negative the legal implication that the services would be paid for. Contrary to the statement contained in the appellant’s brief, there is not a word of competent testimony in the record to show that Mrs. Tarr in her childhood had spent any time in the home of Mrs. Irvine or under her care. The suggestion in <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>such regard emanates from avowed hearsay not shown to have been uttered in the hearing of Mrs. Tarr who, incidentally, was excluded as a witness upon objection to her competency.</p>

But, the learned court below concluded, and we think correctly, that the evidence in the case overcame the presumption of payment. As already stated, the findings establish that the board, room and laundry work furnished by the Tarrs and accepted by the decedent were reasonably worth $12 a week. That fact was competently found and is not open to dispute here. It is also undisputed that, while Mrs. Irvine resided with the Tarrs, she had an income of but $20 per month and no capital assets that she could invade for the payment of her keep. From her income, she had nothing left after paying for clothing, the upkeep and taxes on her property and the $3 she gave the Tarrs each month. It is thus mathematically demonstrated that she could not possibly have paid currently the reasonable worth of the services the Tarrs were supplying. Indeed, Mrs. Irvine expressly so admitted to her friend and daily visitor when she acknowledged that the $3 a month she was paying the Tarrs was not enough and further recognized her indebtedness to them when she said that, if she sold her house and lot, <em>by the time she paid the Tarrs, </em>she would have nothing left “to come and go on.”</p>

Mrs. Irvine’s acknowledg<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>ment of her unpaid indebtedness to the Tarrs, as contained in her statements to the two witnesses, whom the auditor accredited, sufficiently refuted the idea that the $3 monthly payment was tendered and accepted in satisfaction of the claimants’ services. As already quoted, the $3 a month was “for her room rent” according to the decedent. In <em>Dowman Estate, </em>supra, the Superior Court said (p. 658) that the auditing judge was not <em>required </em>to conclude that even a $25 monthly payment by the recipient of board, lodging and nursing services was payment in full of a claim for such services made after the recipient’s death. Not only does the evidence in the instant case not disclose any agreement of the parties that the $3 monthly payment was to be in full satisfaction of the services furnished by the Tarrs but Mrs. Irvine’s own statements refute any such idea. The decedent was, of course, entitled to a credit for the $3 monthly payments and, that, the court below properly allowed her estate against the reasonable worth of the claimants’ recoverable services.</p>

It is not only a case of a <em>Mood </em>relationship between the claimants and the deceased but, more important still, the claim there was founded on an express contract which the claimants failed to prove. Where a claimant pleads, but fails to prove, an express contract but does prove performance of valuable services which the beneficiary willingly accepted, the claim cannot be rested on a <em>quantum meruit. </em>As Chief Justice Maxey said in <em>Lach v. Fleth, </em><a href="/pa/361/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="361 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="476443" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0340-01">361 Pa. 340</a>, 348, <a href="/citations/?q=64%20A.2d%20821" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="64 A.2d 821">64 A. 2d 821</a>, “Such an action [on an express contract] and an action on a quantum meruit are utterly distinct” (citing cases). In <em>Roch’s Estate, </em>16 D. &amp; C. 700, 703, Mr. Justice Stearne, <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>then on the Orphans’ Court of Philadelphia County, correctly said that “It is the general rule, based upon sound reason and logic, that one who alleges a contract and fails in his proofs may not thereafter rely upon a quantum meruit,” citing <em>Witten v.

Apparently, the appellant misconceives the rationale of a contract implied from a given factual situation. In her brief she states that the instant claimants failed to prove an express contract. Of course, they did. They never averred one. She points, also, to the finding of the auditing judge that “there is no evidence ... as to any [express] agreement, contract, or understanding . . . between decedent and claimants . . . .” That finding is entirely consonant with an obligation to pay, <em>implied </em>in the circumstances, where an express contract is neither averred nor relied on.</p>

This is the $64 question which the majority cannot answer. The reason adduced by the majority — that it would have been useless to ask for more money since Mrs. Irvine was unable to pay more — is but a partial answer. If Mrs. Tarr was not satisfied, she could have said so and Mrs. Irvine could easily have promised or agreed to pay claimant at her death an additional sum or to leave her her house or a definite legacy. Why didn’t Mrs. Tarr protest and ask Mrs. Irvine for more money or for a legacy if she wasn’t satisfied with what she was being paid? <em>The record </em>discloses the likely reason. Mrs. Tarr’s sister as a child, lived with and was supported by the decedent in the latter’s home for three years; Mrs. Tarr herself as a child had lived with and was supported by the decedent for an undisclosed period of time; she called the decedent Auntie and in the words of one witness, “she [the decedent] said she practically raised her”.

To overcome such presumption, claimants would only have to prove (by clear, precise and indubitable evidence) (1) that payments had not been made by decedent to claimant in decedent’s lifetime, and (2) what the reasonable value of the services was. But to overcome and rebut the presumption of payment in full arising from these regular periodic payments of |3.00 a month, claimants must prove (by clear, precise and indubitable evidence) (1) that <em>claimants had refused to accept these payments as payments in full, or that decedent had promised or agreed to pay more, </em>viz., an additional fixed sum or the reasonable value of the services, and (unless a fixed sum was agreed upon) (2) what the reasonable value of the services was. <em>The record will be searched in vain for such a promise or agreement, or for proof that claimant had refused to accept these periodic payments as payments in full. </em>Moreover, in view of the receipt <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>by claimants of $3.00 a month for 10 years, with no evidence of protest or a demand for more money, it is clear that it could not even be reasonably implied that the decedent and the claimants had agreed, when the services began or at any other time, that the services should be rendered at their fair and reasonable value— certainly there is no clear, precise and indubitable evidence to prove such an agreement or even to permit such an implication. If these words — clear, direct, positive and convincing or clear, precise and indubitable mean what they say, and if they are to be interpreted the way they have been without deviation or qualification for one hundred years, then these claimants certainly failed to make out a case.</p>

This statement was made during the course of a conversation concerning the possible sale of decedent’s house and was as follows: “. . . the only income was out of her house which was $20.00 a month . . . and she said that that was the only income she had, and if she sold it, again she paid Agnes and Ed, she wouldn’t have anything to come and go on at all.” This establishes no protest and demand by claimants and no promise or <a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>agreement by decedent to pay claimants any additional sum of money, definite or indefinte; it is merely an explanation of why she regrettably could not afford to pay the Tarrs more money.

      <em>Braden Estate, </em>363 Pa., supra, is one of a score of cases which are analogous and controlling. In that case Mr. and Mrs. Roberts, (the latter of whom was a niece of decedent) presented a claim for board, lodging and general care of the decedent under an oral contract by which decedent agreed to pay claimants “whatever was right”. No specific sum was agreed upon and they therefore sued on a quantum meruit, alleged an express agreement of employment, and proved that the reasonable value of the services rendered was $10.00 <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>a week. There, as here, the claimants unquestionably furnished the services, but this Court held that those facts plus decedent’s declarations were not sufficient to overcome the presumption of payment.

A moment’s reflection will suffice to convince that a friend is often closer and dearer than a relative, but in the instant case the claimant was more than a friend of the decedent — the decedent had “practically raised her” and although called “Auntie” obviously stood <em>in loco parentis.</em>
