This was a three story building, containing two apartments on each floor, which were rented to tenants. It was unquestionably a tenement within the meaning of the Act of June 3, 1915, P. L. 954, section 4, which defines that term as “any house or building which, or a portion of which, is occupied as a residence by three or more families, living independently of each other, and doing their cooking on the premises, and having a common right in the halls, stairways, yard, cellar, or water-closets thereof, or some of them.” That same act provides, section 35, that “No building of any of the grades referred to in this act shall be used for human habitation unless it is equipped with a fire-<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>escape or fire-escapes as required by law: Provided, That any building of such grades having less than four (4) stories, and used as a rooming-house or tenement, the third story of which shall contain not more than five (5) rooms and a bath-room, and such third story is not occupied by more than ten (10) persons, and has at least one stairway therefrom, shall be exempt from the provisions of the acts of Assembly requiring fire-towers and outside fire-escapes for such buildings, <em>if every apartment above the second floor in any of said buildings shall be equipped with a satisfactory wire, chain, or other safe fire-escape.” </em>Section 48 of the act imposes a penalty of fine or imprisonment or both for violation of any of the provisions of the act.</p>

Mrs. Boyd was there at the time with her two-year old child. Passage through the hall and down the stairs being <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>cut off, Mrs. Boyd went to the window seeking a means of escape, and while standing there was severely burned on her face, arms and back. First tossing her child into the arms of a man on the pavement, she herself jumped onto a canvas which, after some delay, was stretched by men in the street. In so doing she suffered severe injuries when the weight of her falling body broke the canvas.</p>
    <p id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.5",333,[193,786,1145,378]]]'>The present suit was instituted by plaintiffs to recover damages for the injuries sustained by Mrs. Boyd. Besterman died after the suit was instituted, and Joseph Smith, the executor of his estate, was substituted in his place as defendant.

    <p id="b333-5" data-blocks='[["BL_333.6",333,[193,1178,1147,711]]]'>It is obvious that Mrs. Boyd’s injuries would not have occurred had Besterman complied with the provision of the Act of 1915 previously quoted, because, if a wire or chain had been installed as required by the act, Mrs. Boyd could have utilized it and quickly made her way down it to safety. The violation of that provision constituted negligence per se: <em>Jinks v.

The situation becomes an entirely different one in the eye of the law when the legislation in question is, as here, a police measure obviously intended for the protection of human life; in such event public policy does not permit an individual to waive the protection which the statute is designed to afford him. It was said in <em>McGurdy’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/303/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="303 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="1130088" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0453-01">303 Pa. 453</a>, 461, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20707" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="154 A. 707">154 A. 707</a>, 709: “Statutes grounded on public policy are those which forbid acts having a tendency to be injurious to the public good. The prime question is whether the thing forbidden is inimical to the public interest. Where public policy requires the observance of a statute, it cannot be waived by an individual or denied effect by courts since the integrity of the rule expressed by the legislature is necessary for the common welfare.” And in <em>Bell, Secretary of Banking, v. McAnulty, </em><a href="/pa/349/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="349 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="459251" data-case-paths="/pa/349/0384-01">349 Pa. 384</a>, 386, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20A.2d%20543" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="37 A.2d 543">37 A. 2d 543</a>, 544, it was said: “Where the legislature has, by definite and unequivocal language, determined the public policy of this Commonwealth with regard to a particular subject, that pronouncement cannot be set aside and rendered unenforceable by a contract between individuals.” Here the very title of the Act of 1915 — “To protect the public health and safety” — indicates that it was intended to enunciate a public policy. The clause in the lease here invoked by defendant is violative of that policy and is therefore legally inoperative and void.</p>

Because <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>of this error,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial. The learned trial judge, prior to the closing arguments of counsel to the jury, granted defendant’s motion to strike out all such testimony, explained at great length, in the charge to the jury, why it was not admissible, and instructed them to ignore it. Plaintiffs’ counsel concurred with that request of defendant’s counsel that it be stricken from the record. It is true that, where evidence has been improperly admitted which might be prejudicial to the other party, and it is not struck out at or before the close of the testimony, the error is not cured merely by instructions in the charge to disregard it: <em>Pennsylvania R.

The reason for this is that a discussion of the objectionable testimony by counsel in his address to the jury would naturally serve to intensify the evil resulting from its original introduction in evidence. Where, therefore, it is stricken out before counsel addresses the jury, and the court in its charge gives clear and sufficiently forcible instructions that it be disregarded, it is not error for the court, in the exercise of its discretion, to refuse to withdraw a juror, or to dismiss a motion for a new trial: <em>Haun v.
