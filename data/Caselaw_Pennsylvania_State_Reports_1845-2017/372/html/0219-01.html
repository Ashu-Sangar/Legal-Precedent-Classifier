This section has been construed in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Cole, <a href="/pa/350/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="350 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="461175" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0369-01">350 Pa. 369</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20361" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="39 A.2d 361">39 A. 2d 361</a>, and in <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Bushey, <a href="/pa/368/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="368 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1230374" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0067-01">368 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20A.2d%2039" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="82 A.2d 39">82 A. 2d 39</a>. We held in those cases that even though the licensed operator of a motor vehicle was involved “in an accident resulting fatally to any person”, nevertheless, a court may reinstate the license where negligence or recklessness by the operator is not proved. We also held that such negligence, when proved, should be of such a character that, in the discretion of the Court, the defendant should have inflicted upon him the penalty of having his license suspended in the interest of public protection.</p>

[Decedent] was within 10 feet of appellant’s car. . . . When appellant saw the [decedent] on the highway, he swung his car to the left, to the center of the street, and struck [decedent], fatally injuring him.”</p>
    <p id="b245-3" data-blocks='[["BL_245.4",245,[165,1066,1148,810]]]'>In sustaining the suspension the learned hearing judge ruled that appellant was negligent. He based this conclusion upon the fact that appellant was temporarily blinded by the lights of the approaching car; that “it was [appellant’s] duty to bring his car to a standstill since the obstruction from the lights of the approaching car was temporary and would soon come to an end. That is what a careful and prudent operator would have done under the circumstances, and his failure to do so is an act of omission on his part which the Court concludes is negligence.” The court was also of opinion that because appellant saw decedent within ten feet when he put his lights on high beam, he was negligent in not stopping his vehicle within the assured clear distance ahead.</p>
    <p id="b245-4" data-blocks='[["BL_245.5",245,[165,1898,1147,309]]]'>The court decreed that the appeal from the action of the Secretary of Revenue suspending appellant’s license for a period of six months be dismissed, but recommended to the Secretary of Revenue the issuance of a restricted license enabling appellant to operate his vehicle to and from work.</p>

Speaking through Justice Simpson, we said, quoting from a cited case, p. 446: “ ‘to say that it is negligence to drive past an automobile in such a situation [i.e. having blinding headlights] is practically to say that it is negligence to drive along a highway in the nighttime at all.’ ” In <em>Boor v.

Fry, </em><a href="/pa/354/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="354 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="467466" data-case-paths="/pa/354/0066-01">354 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20A.2d%20473" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="46 A.2d 473">46 A. 2d 473</a>, Chief Justice Stern, citing numerous cases in a footnote, said p. 68: “. . . it has been held in a veritable multitude of cases that the failure of a driver to stop within the assured clear distance ahead may be excused if due to a temporary blindness caused by the bright lights of another vehicle.”</p>
