The trial Judge who heard the case without a jury, found a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3096.85. All of the defendant’s exceptions were dismissed by the Court en banc, and judgment Was entered on the verdict. From this order and judgment the defendant appeals.</p>
    <p id="b371-9" data-blocks='[["BL_371.14",371,[192,1504,1150,265]]]'>The basic question is whether defendant’s printed catalogue setting forth the capacity of its boiler was an express warranty and if so, whether such warranty was clearly excluded under the franchise agreement previously made between plaintiff and defendant.</p>
    <p id="b371-10" data-blocks='[["BL_371.15",371,[191,1782,1150,210]]]'>On December 20, 1945, defendant, who is a manufacturer of a patented oil burning device, entered into a franchise agreement with plaintiff who is a dealer or distributor. The agreement provided as follows:</p>

The foregoing guarantee constitutes the only guarantee or warranty given or assumed by the Manufacturer, and it is agreed that there are no implied warranties.”</p>
    <p id="b372-4" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[266,625,1156,873]]]'>Subsequently the defendant in the regular course of distribution published and disseminated its circular or catalogue in which it offered to the trade a SteamPak Generator' SPL 50-5 with a further statement that it had a specified heating capacity of 7300 EDR steam per hour. Plaintiff purchased this boiler relying upon the manufacturer’s statement of its capacity. This reliance upon the manufacturer’s statements of capacity was in accord with the general practice in the trade because the manufacturer of such an article possesses virtually exclusive knowledge of the quality and capacity of its product and the buyer little or none. The Judge, sitting as a jury, further found as a fact that the boiler did'not have the heating capacity described, and his findings, as well as the verdict, were sustained by the Court en banc.</p>

    <p id="b373-4" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[189,950,1151,1209]]]'>The lower court in an able opinion dismissed defendant’s contention on two grounds, one of which was that the interpretation of the franchise agreement sought by it would violate public policy. For reasons hereinafter appearing we need not decide this question, although we cannot refrain from pointing out that if a manufacturer could escape all liability for future warranties by an agreement excluding them it would ofttimes be injurious if not disastrous to the business world and would open wide the door to fraudulent misrepresentations. We decide this case on the ground that the protective or exclusion clause in question relates only to prior or contemporaneous or present express warranties. Such an exclusion provision, while valid as hereinabove set forth, must be strictly construed, and so construed, we have no doubt that it was not intended to apply and did not apply to future express warranties which the manufacturer might make to the distributor or to others purchasing its product in reliance thereon. Moreover, if a contract is ambiguous, a reasonable construction is always to be preferred to ah unreasonable one. •</p>
