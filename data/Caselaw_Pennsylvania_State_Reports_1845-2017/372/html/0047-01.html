Thus, for example, a deed from an agent or a straw man to his principal or a confirmatory deed, whether or not a nominal consideration is recited, is not subject to the tax. On the other hand, a gift is, because it is a real transfer of beneficial ownership. Obviously there is nothing in this contention. It was clearly within the <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>legislative power and prerogative to so classify and confine the imposition of the tax.</p>
    <p id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[265,442,1153,1194]]]'>As to (b), appellants rely upon Article IX, Section 1 of the Constitution which provides: “All taxes shall be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax, and shall be levied and collected under general laws;. . .”. It is argued that the tax being levied statewide, state-wide uniformity is lacking because the tax is based on local assessments which are not uniform. In the first place it cannot properly be said that the tax is based on local assessments. It is based upon the actual consideration paid in the case of a sale and on the actual monetary worth in the case of a gift. As a safeguard against arbitrary or fraudulent representation of the actual consideration in the case of a sale or the actual monetary worth in the case of a gift, it is provided that the tax value shall in no case be lower than the assessed value. Instead of causing lack of uniformity, the formula prescribed assures at least a substantial uniformity by placing a floor below which no taxpayer may arbitrarily go in valuing his property for transfer tax purposes at variance with the facts.</p>

They rely upon Article IX, Section 1 of the Constitution, supra, providing for uniformity of taxation; upon Article IX, Section 2, providing that “All laws exempting property from taxation, . . . shall be void.”; upon Article III, Section 7, providing that “The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law: . . . Exempting property from taxation: . . . Granting to any ... individual any special or exclusive privilege or immunity, . . .”, and upon the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

The sole question, therefore, is whether the Legislature properly classified and exempted transactions between husband and wife and parent and child. It is unquestionably true that for class legislation to be constitutional, the classification must be reasonable, and founded upon a real distinction: <em>Terenzio et al. v. Devlin, Director, et al., </em><a href="/pa/361/0602-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="361 Pa. 602" data-case-ids="476437" data-case-paths="/pa/361/0602-01">361 Pa. 602</a>, 605, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.2d%20374" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="65 A.2d 374">65 A. 2d 374</a>.

Since the basis for classification in the present case was the marital and family relationship, we do not think the Legislature was required to differentiate sales from gifts in exempting transactions between husband and wife and parent and child.
