Garrett died a resident of Philadelphia County on November 16, 1930, intestate as to her residuary estate of over $17,000,000. Nearly 26,000 claims were filed in the Court below by persons claiming the estate as next of kin. The Orphans’ Court appointed a Master and Examiners who held some 2,000 hearings and took the testimony of over 1,100 witnesses. The record composed mainly of testimony and exhibits, totals 390 volumes covering over 115,000 pages. After a painstaking examination of the thousands of claims which were presented, the Master submitted to the Orphans’ Court on September 18, 1950, a 900 page report which included 2,077 findings of fact and 36 conclusions of law. The Master found that the decedent, Henrietta E. Garrett, nee Schaeffer, was survived by <em>three first cousins, </em>Herman Adolph Kretschmar, Howard Sigismund Kretschmar and Johann Peter <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>Christian Schaefer I, and that these relatives were entitled, as next of kin, to her estate under the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 429.</p>

    <p id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.7",465,[177,1322,1153,691]]]'>The Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania vigorously contended for 15 years that Henrietta E. Garrett died without leaving any next of kin to survive her and consequently her residuary estate escheated to the Commonwealth. Thereafter a compromise was executed which in effect recognized that the three above named persons were first cousins and next of kin of Henrietta E. Garrett. The compromise agreement was approved by the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, the Governor of Pennsylvania, the Auditor General and the Assistant Secretary of Revenue of Pennsylvania and the Attorney General of the United States.</p>

When their claim was listed for hearing before the Master on April 2, 1941, they requested a continuance which was refused, and their claim, like countless others under similar conditions, was marked “Passed”. Claimants did nothing to prove their claim until after the Master notified them on November 15, 1949, and again on November 30, 1949, that if they wished to present a petition to reopen their claim they should do so within two weeks. This they failed to do. When their counsel wrote to the Master on November 21, 1950, requesting a hearing, the Master refused because counsel’s “letter suggests no reason which would justify the granting of a rehearing of these claimants”. Claimants ascribe their delay to the refusal of the Master to show them certain exhibits which they needed to complete their genealogical proofs. The Master at his first hearing on January 14, 1937, wisely issued the following notice: “Claimants must prove their claims at their own expense and in accordance with the law and practice of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, TJ.g.A. <em>We will not assist or advise claimants respecting proof or procedure."</em>

It is <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>clear that if the Master or examiner had assisted claimants, or if the Master had allowed every claimant to examine the genealogical tree of Henrietta E. Garrett extending back several hundred years (assuming it was then known) it would (a) have opened wide the door to charges of favoritism and fraud, and (b) the number of claimants who would have traced their ancestry to the Henrietta E.

Equally important, according to their own contention, the closest relationship of any member of the Marsh family to Henrietta E. Garrett was a second cousin. Each of these findings is sufficient to bar these claims. “The law is well settled in Pennsylvania that under the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 429, first cousins take the entire estate to the exclusion of first-cousins-once-removed, and of second cousins: Miles’s Estate, <a href="/pa/272/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="272 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1068413" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0329-01">272 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20A.%20300" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="116 A. 300">116 A. 300</a>; Bell’s Estate, 31 D. &amp; C. 670; Hunter, Pennsylvania Orphans’ Court Commonplace Book, Vol. I, page 674”: <em>Garrett Estate, </em><a href="/pa/371/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="371 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="1237081" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0284-01">371 Pa. 284</a>, 289, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.2d%20531" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="89 A.2d 531">89 A. 2d 531</a>.</p>

Garrett.
