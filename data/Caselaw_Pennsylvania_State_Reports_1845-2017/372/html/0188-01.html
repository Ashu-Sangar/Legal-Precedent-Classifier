The classifications of vendors, the formulae for computing the tax, the details of administration, penalties, etc., are specifically set forth in the Act. The School District adopted a Resolution, dated November 28, 1947, making effective as of December 23, 1947, the provisions of the Act and incorporating them by reference.

The taxpayer-appellant contends that the School District Act and the City Ordinance are unconstitutional because (1) they adopt arbitrary, discriminatory and unjust formulae for computing the tax, and (2) they lack uniformity. The gist of appellant’s argument is that the only fair and uniform tax is a tax based upon the actual gross amount or volume of business transacted during the current tax year and suggests that this result can be attained by having the taxpayer pay on March 15th a tax based upon his estimated annual <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>gross business which can be corrected and the tax finally and definitely computed upon his actual gross business after the expiration of the year in question. This would seem to many persons to be the fairest method which could be devised, but a legislative body is not required to adopt a method or formula which someone else may consider wisest and best. Such a decision, subject to constitutional limitations, is a matter for the determination and judgment not of the taxpayer or of the Courts, but of the Legislature. Appellant’s contention also ignores the fact that for 128 years mercantile license taxes have been computed and imposed in a manner similar to that followed by the Legislature in the Act of 1947, supra; and this principle of payment in advance based upon an estimated volume of business has been repeatedly sustained by this Court. <em>Commonwealth v.
