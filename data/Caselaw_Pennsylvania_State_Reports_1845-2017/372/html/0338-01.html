The note was executed by the President of the defendant and by <em>its Secretary, A. 0. Waterman, </em>with the corporate seal affixed thereto. On March 5, 1951, the defendant corporation through its trustees petitioned the Court of Common Pleas to open the judgment. The judgment was opened; an action of assumpsit was brought on the note and resulted in a compulsory nonsuit. The motion to take off the nonsuit was granted and the case was tried before a jury, which rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant corporation. Plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and his motion for judgment non obstante veredicto were dismissed; plaintiff appealed from the judgment entered on the verdict but argues here only his motion for judgment n.o.v.</p>

This is an utterly inadequate defense for two reasons: (a) There is absolutely no evidence that plaintiff ever knew of the 1940 Resolution; and (b) Defendant is bound where, as here, it received the money loaned and used it to pay its debts. “As was said in Presbyterian Board v.
