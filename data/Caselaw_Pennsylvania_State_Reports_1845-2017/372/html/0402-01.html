A detail of officers rushed to the Patskin farm located in Jefferson Township, Lackawanna County, a farming community, where they found the defendant, who immediately admitted the killing. He directed the officers to the scene of the killing approximately one and one-half miles from the farm home, in an isolated section of the area. There they found the defendant’s wife lying dead on the ground with the top of her head bashed in, two lacerated wounds on the chin and one on the neck above the Adam’s apple. The post-mortem later revealed a compound fracture of the skull with many small fragments of the bone driven into the brain cavity and a crushed larynx.</p>

I knew I would get the electric chair for it. I did it. I took her back that road to kill her. The dirty - - -. I thought I would have to shoot her but I didn’t have to.

On the Salem road and you turned in then to the old road to your farm? A. Yes. Q. And then you stopped the car and you started to argue? A. Right. Q. What was the argument about? A. About fixing me some more; she was a woman to fix a man and send him to jail. Q. Did she send you to jail? A. What do you think I killed her for, just because I was crazy or something? Q. I thought you had a reason for it? A. I had many reasons, that is why I killed her. Q. What was that reason? A. Because she was going for me for my arrest and take the family, away; that was my chief reason. I figured that was the last arrest she made. I am not a young man any more; I was 44 years old, and I made up my mind that she would not do it any more. You take my work records since I was a boy and you will find I have not a bad work record.

Choked her with my i-ight hand. Q. Did you use your left hand too? A. No I can’t make good use of it, it was broken and there is no strength to it. Q. You were working with both your hands in your logging business? A. Trying to. I hud also broke my foot. I know exactly how I did it; I am not here to lie to you, I am not going to change it; I killed her with my hand. Q. That is the truth, is it? A. That is right, you can see. Q. Did you sign any papers after you murdered her? A. No. Q. After you murdered her? A. No. Q. Take a look at this book; it is a book made by the Agrico Company? A. Yes. Q. You wrote something in it, didn’t you? A. Yes, sir. Q. When did you write it? A. After I killed her. Q. Where did you write it? A. Right at the car. Q. Would you mind reading it for us? A. Looks like to whom this may concern. You may think that a murderer is a man or woman who is out his or her mind. That is a mistake. In this particular case a lot of people think that I am a person mentally unbalance is mistaken. I have never been arrested before in my life until I married. I have no brushes with the law and I was a good citizen as any average man, hut this particular bitch needed what she got. She not only destroyed my life but she destroyed my children and that is what really hurts and that is what really hurts me most. Please people I fully realize that I have left 3 poor innocent little children who know no difference but I as a so-called beastly murderer does. How my heart aches for these poor little children, but accord<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>ing to my beastly wife tbe law says a man is only a mnle. He must abide by tbe laws of wbat a woman says. Kindly be advised that what a man says before he commits a so-called murder that he is not insane. He merely went what a normal human mind can stand, yet our filthy laws says that a man is guilty. Q. You left that after you hilled your wife, is that right? A. Yes. Q. You didn’t choke your wife? A. Oh, yes, I did. Q. You hit her over the head. A. That was after to make sure she would not suffer. Q. What did you hit her with? A. With the hatchet, with the back of the hatchet. Q. You also hit her in the front of her face while she was on the ground. A. I choked her and as I did she turned blue black, and then spoke to her that it was the last time you had your laws at me to arrest me. Of course we were having a lot of struggles even before this time. I really didn’t have in mind to kill her but what I had in mind was to reason with her but she refused; she turned for the law. Q. Is this the hatchet that you hit her with? A. That is the one, with the back end. Q. The State policeman is showing you the hatchet. A. That is the hatchet I hit her with, I tapped her with that. Q. You tapped her with the hatchet? A. That is right. Q. On the top of her head? A. Yes. Q. With the back end of the hatchet? A. Yes, sir, that is right, just that she should not suffer. Q. This was after you strangled her? A. Yes, I heard her gurgle, and why let the woman suffer when you see she is almost dead. Q. How many times did you hit her with the hatchet? A. A few times after I heard her gurgle. Q. She was lying at the time on the ground? A. Yes, I stood there choking her and she gurgled. Q. That was while she was on the ground, and that is the same place you showed Mr. Spence of the State Police where it happened? A. Yes from start to finish, there is no other place to search. Q. When you hit her <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>on the head with this hatchet yon wanted to finish her off for good. A. I wanted to make sure she was killed. Q. Did you take this hatchet in the car today to do this job before you met her? A. Yes. Q. You never had this in your car before; you took it to make sure to finish her. A. Not necessarily. I had it in the car; there’s other things in the car. I could have hit her with a wrench. There is a fourway wrench in there and there is a big cold wrench, and there is a big box wrench; there is a variety of things in the car; I didn’t necessarily have to have it. Q. Where did you get the two guns, the two revolvers? A. I took one from a fellow, Jack Kumper. Q. Where does he live? A. Jefferson Township. Q. And yesterday you took the two revolvers out of your house before you met your wife? A. Correct. Q. Where were they in the house? A. In the pantry. Did the kids show you? Q. And you took these two revolvers before you met her before she came from work this afternoon? A. That is right. Q. And you had planned when you took the revolvers to kill her and yourself? A. I planned to kill myself. I thought I’d try once more to reason with her and she refused and that finished it. Q. After your quarrel you choked her and then took the hatchet from the back of the car? A. No, it was in the front of the car, and I hit her over the head and that was to make sure she isn’t suffering. Q. You hit her with the back of the hatchet? A. Yes. Q. Did you wipe the hatchet off after you used it on her head? A. Yes. Q. What did you wipe it off with? A. With sand and gravel. Q. You cleaned it off? A. I kind of rested on it before I went into the car and I guess it was cleaned off by the gravel. Q. And got the blood off it? A. I don’t know if there was blood on it; the blood went out of her nose and face. Q. And her face? A. Her face was covered with blood; it would be naturally after you kill someone. Q. How long did <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>it take you to choke her? A. I don’t know, about 4 or 5 minutes; she didn’t last long. Q. And when you choked her, you planned to kill her? A. Planned to reason with her. Q. When you choked her? A, At the time I was mad enough to kill anyone and to kill myself. Q. And you wanted to kill her. A. I wanted to reason with her, Q. When you were choking her? A. Yes. Q. And then you wanted to kill her? A. Yes. Q. Was her body on the ground when you hit her on the head with the hatchet? A. Yes, she didn’t never move. She never moved from where she was; she was in the same location.</blockquote>

Two psychiatrists, Doctor Ginley and Doctor Shovelin, examined the defendant and testified for the defense that in their opinion from their examination and from statements which defendant made to them concerning himself that defendant was suffering from medical insanity. Doctor Ginley examined ■ defendant five times, although on one occasion defendant refused to talk to the doctor because he thought the guards were eavesdropping. Conversations with members of defendant’s family, including a sister and brother-in-law, helped the doctors form their conclusion. Doctor Ginley testified that defendant “did not know right and wrong in his delusional trend” and that he was a very dangerous mental case. The examinations conducted by each psychiatrist consisted of talking with the defendant, observing his demeanor, procuring from him a complete history of his life with particular attention to his mental aberrations and real or feigned delusions, which they repeated to the jury, and making a very thorough physical examination of the defendant. Doctor Ginley admitted on cross-examination that 75 per cent of his opinion was depended upon and was based upon what the defendant told him, i.e.,.his delusions. The statements which the doctor believed to be delusions were all said by the defendant after his arrest and while he was awaiting trial on the present indictment for murder. Nevertheless, • Doctor; Ginley said .that in his - opinion-defendant is legally insane and was so at the time of the commission of the-killing.;-.-When Doctor Ginley was cross-examined about the statement which, defendant wrote between choking and the “axing” of his. wife in which he called himself a beastly murderer, the doc<a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>tor testified that even though defendant called himself a beastly murderer he did not know the difference between right and wrong. Doctor Shovelin testified that the defendant had medical insanity; “he didn’t think he could distinguish between right and wrong at the time [of the killing] because of his mental disorder”. Defendant graphically and minutely described the killing of his wife to Doctor Ginley, who recited in his testimony the delusionary statements related to him by the defendant.</p>

A doctor’s opinion “depends on the appearance of the man, what his demeanor is, how he has reacted to the situation, etc., etc.” The following question and answer will illustrate the other facts upon which Doctor Shovelin based his opinion:</p>

In fact, he turned himself over to the police or turned himself over to the son with the request that the son notify the police. It is not the type of offense that you would expect a sane person to do who was getting some personal gain and with the normal tendency to conceal something that he had done, and the normal tendency to escape from punishment.”</blockquote>

This alleged error was raised in defendant’s reasons for a new trial but was not argued before the Court en banc. Counsel for defendant in his argument to the jury repeatedly asked why the Commonwealth did not have the defendant examined by a psychiatrist before the trial. The District Attorney said in reply: “We did not know until this trial on Monday of this week that the defendant’s defense in this case was insanity and once this trial started we had no right to ask for an examination of the defendant.” The District Attorney learnéd for the first time when defendant was examining the prospective jurors on their voir dire that the defense was to be insanity and did not believe he had a right under The Mental Health Act of July 11, 1923, P. L. 998, as amended by Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 973, 50 PS, Sec. 48, to ask for a psychiatric examination after the trial <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>had started. It is doubtful whether counsel for defendant was justified in his remarks; it is equally doubtful whether the District Attorney was justified in his reply. In any event, the remarks of the District Attorney fall within the rule stated in <em>Commonwealth v. Crittenton, </em><a href="/pa/326/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="326 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="1174474" data-case-paths="/pa/326/0025-01">326 Pa. 25</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.%20358" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="191 A. 358">191 A. 358</a>, and are not so prejudicial as to warrant a reversal or justify a new trial. The defendant’s actions, statements and confessions — even without the corroborating testimony of the Commonwealth’s expert witnesses and lay witnesses— wholly refute the opinion evidence of defendant’s expert medical witnesses. As Justice (now Chief Justice) Steen said in <em>Commonwealth v. Heller, </em><a href="/pa/369/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="369 Pa. 457" data-case-ids="1232370" data-case-paths="/pa/369/0457-01">369 Pa. 457</a>, 461, 462, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20287" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="87 A.2d 287">87 A. 2d 287</a>: “. . . defendant’s actions in the present case, speaking louder than his words, wholly refute the opinion evidence of the expert medical witness. . . .’’In this case the jury must have believed, as we do, that the delusions were concocted by the defendant for the trial. Defendant’s doctors based their opinion of insanity 75 per cent on defendant’s alleged delusions and placed great reliance upon the fact that defendant did not hide the body; that the killing was brutal and uneconomical; that defendant readily gave himself up; and showed no remorse or sense of guilt for having killed the woman he hated. If evidence such as this were sufficient to prove legal insanity and to prevail over acts and statements clearly evidencing sanity, few “murderers” would ever be convicted.</p>
