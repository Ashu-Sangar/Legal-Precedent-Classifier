Pass, 372 Pa. 318, 93 A. 2d 447.\nUnder , the decision in that case the present intervenors have no right to construct the motel in question because of the provisions of the Harrisburg Zoning Ordinance of 1950. The issue presented in the present case is therefore obviously moot. Accordingly the decree of the court below is affirmed, pro forma, at the cost of appellants.",
