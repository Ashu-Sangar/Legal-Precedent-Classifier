The agreement further provided: <em>“This money </em>is accepted [by defendant] ivith the understanding that withdrawals may be made by . . . [plaintiff’s husband] in the sum of $10,000, or less, at any time on 30 days notice and for larger amounts than $10,000 60 days notice. This agreement, subject to withdrawal provisions abovenamed, may be terminated by . . . [defendant or p]aintiff’s husband] at any time on 10 days notice.” (Italics added). In 1929 an additional $5000 was deposited under the agreement and three years later $2500 was withdrawn by plaintiff’s husband; leaving a balance in the hands of defendant at that time of $77,500. This entire balance was invested in Commonwealth Mortgagé Pool No. 2. On April 16, 1934, the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny County entered an order taking custody and.control of- this mortgage pool and directing its liquidation. Prom that date until November 11, 1938, when plaintiff’s husband died leaving his entire estate to plaintiff, under the liquidation order a total of $23,250 was distributed in five installments on account of principal: In 1940 plaintiff sought withdrawal of $10,000 and defendant granted this request by purchasing from her $10,000 of her participating interest. Thereafter, liquidating dividends of $27,900 on the initial investment were distributed, of <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>which $10,000 was paid to defendant under the assignment, and the remainder to plaintiff, leaving an unpaid balance in her favor’of $26,350. Plaintiff notified defendant in December 1945, that she elected to withdraw in cash the unpaid balance of the principal deposited under the terms of the agreement of June 9, 1928. Upon defendant’s refusal to pay her that sum, plaintiff brought this action.</p>

In that case the agreement under consideration provided that upon revocation plaintiff “shall , . . be entitled to payment of <em>funds </em>so withdrawn by him ...” (Italics added). This Court there held that the donor could not legally demand the return of the principal of the trust in cash. Here, however, the agreement provides for the withdrawal of “money”. “Funds” is a broad term which encompasses choses in action, as well as cash. But “money”, in the absence of a clear expression to the contrary, must be given its usual meaning of “cash” or “currency”. See, for example, <em>Clabby’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/338/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="338 Pa. 305" data-case-ids="1199945" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0305-01">338 Pa. 305</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20A.2d%2071" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="12 A.2d 71">12 A. 2d 71</a>. <em>Crick’s Estate, </em>supra (p. 584), is not controlling, for there we said: “Had the trust agreement specifically stated that donor might demand cash, a different situation would be presented, but no such question.is involved in this appeal.”</p>

In 1940 plaintiff withdrew $10,000 and made an assignment of that amount of her participating interest to defendant. That assignment was not as collateral for a loan, but was a relinquishment of that portion of her interest in the pool, in accordance with her withdrawal. At that time no question was raised as to plaintiff’s right to make such cash withdrawal. On the contrary, defendant recognized its obligation under the agreement to repay that sum. By no stretch of the imagination could the language of the agreement be interpreted to mean that it was the intent of the parties to bind defendant to repay any portion of the money but not to compel it to repay all of the money.</p>
