In that case the defendant insurance company inspected. a steam boiler- to determine whether or not it should insure the boiler owner.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> The boiler exploded killing an employe at work some distance from-the boiler. At the time the boiler had not been accepted by the purchaser. A few days preceding the accident the work on it was completed.- The owner of the plant applied to a casualty company, for insurance. The company sent an agent to pass upon the efficiency of the completed boiler. While the examination was taking place, an explosion occurred. This Court said: “The duty of Simpkins [the casualty company’s employe] was to find.if the contractor had installed a machine which would withstand the resistance for which it was designed. When he arrived, the boiler was in the control of the manufacturer, and-the openings had already- been closed, with the alleged defective flange, and tightly. fastened. The directions given by him were to the employees of Badenhausen to start the test, to learn whether the work contracted for was properly completed, so as to justify the making of an insurance contract, and nothing more.” This Court further said: “One controlling the operation of a boiler is bound to make reasonable inspection to guard against explosions which may cause injury to his own employees, or even third parties. So, the manufacturer is liable where damage is suffered as a result of his negligence (Erie City Iron Works v. Barber &amp; Co., <a href="/pa/102/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="102 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="502668" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0156-01">102 Pa. 156</a>; <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>Losee v.

    <p id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[279,1090,1147,360]]]'>The question for us to decide in the case now under review is this: what is the legal liability of an insurance company by reason of its having assumed on behalf of the owner to discharge the statutory liability of inspecting and reporting on the condition of the elevator, not within the terms of its contract, but under and pursuant to the terms of a statute?</p>

L. 240</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.%20472" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="19 A. 472">19 Atl. 472</a>, plaintiff was injured by the explosion of a steam boiler which had been insured by the defendant insurance company. Although not required to do so by New Jersey law, the defendant insurance company had agreed as a matter of contract to inspect the boiler for the owner at periodic intervals and warn the owner of any defects found. In construing the policy the court said: that it was plain that the defendant company was in nowise obligated by its contract to make any inspections whatever; it acquired the right to do so when it chose to do so, and if it had altogether refrained from making an inspection, it would seem clear that it would have incurred no responsibility either to the assured or to the plaintiff. But the defend<a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>ant having, in the exercise of its-volition, made repeated inspections of the boiler and furnished the required certificates, no one could doubt that, by this course of action, a duty was imposed on it, by operation of the contract itself, to act with ordinary care and skill, both with respect to its inspection and its certificate and that there could be no room to doubt that, for the proximate damages occasioned by the absence of such care and skill, the defendant would be answerable to the assured under the contract. The court further said, in regard to the plaintiff who was a stranger to the contract, that there was a broader ground on which the case could be based. It was that, in all cases in which any person undertakes the performance of any act which, if not done with care and skill, will be highly dangerous to the safety of persons, known or unknown, the law, ipso facto, imposes as a public duty the obligation to exercise such care and skill.</p>

Plaintiff had fallen into an elevator shaft. When he entered the ground floor of the building the elevator door was open and he stepped into the shaft. He brought suit against the owners of the building. The owner died and plaintiff filed an amended complaint in which he named as additional defendants the Moline Elevator Company, under contract with the owners of the building for servicing the elevator, and the Aetna Casualty Surety Company, which carried a liability policy on the elevator at the time of the accident. There was a city ordinance which required the owner to make a report to the city re the condition of the elevator and the insurance company made that-report for the owner as a matter of service under the policy; there was no provision in the policy that required it. The evidence showed that the insurance company made quarterly inspections of the elevator for a period of a year and a <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>half preceding the accident. The jury brought in a verdict in favor of the plaintiff against the Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company. The company appealed assigning as grounds for the appeal (a) that plaintiff had no rights under the policy, (b) that-the company was not liable to the plaintiff because of its inspections, (c) that the city ordinance requiring inspections did not establish any basis for recovery against ‘ defendant, (d) that there was no' causal connection between the inspections and the plaintiff’s injuries. In ruling on these assignments the court said: “Our conclusion is that the respondent’s action is maintainable, not in virtue of any obligation imposed by the policy of insurance, but because of the legal responsibility attaching to its voluntary assumption, as the owner’s agent, of the duty of proper inspection find reporting to the city . . . The ordinance required the quarterly inspection of the elevator and the filing of a report with the city by a competent inspector, who might be a regularly authorized inspector of a liability insurance company in good' standing in the state,- or' an employee or representative of some responsible firm in the business of elevator construction and maintenance satisfactory to the superintendent of buildings of the city . . . The appellant assumed the performance of this duty in accordance with the terms of the ordinance. Having assumed the duty of inspection and reporting <em>to' </em>the city, the appellant would be liable at common law to any one sustaining damages by reason of its neglect, the measure of its duty, in respect to inspection and reporting, being fixed by the ordinance.”</p>

The jury could have found, under the evidence, as it did find, that the elevator door was frequently out of repair and <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>was not adequate for its intended use. The reports made to the city by the appellant’s inspector were uniformly, during the period covered by the evidence, that the elevator was in proper order, thereby assuring the city authorities that they need not concern themselves with its-safety . . . Its reports might, well be found by the jury to have lulled the building department of the city into a sense of security, in respect to the elevator, and that the reports were causes contributing proximately to respondent’s injury.”</p>

Judge Caeuozo, speaking for the New York Court of Appeals, said,: “Its defects could have been discovered by reasonable inspection, and that inspection was omit-, ted . . . The question to be determined is whether the defendant owed a duty of care and vigilance to any one but the immediate purchaser. The foundations of this branch of the law, at least in this state, were laid in Thomas v. <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>Winchester (<a href="/citations/?q=6%20N.Y.%20397" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="6 N.Y. 397">6 N.

[In that case] the sale was made to a druggist, who in turn sold to a customer. The customer recovered damages from the seller who affixed the label. ‘The defendant’s negligence,’ it was said, ‘put human life in imminent danger.’ . . . Cases were cited by way of illustration in which manufacturers were not subject to any duty irrespective of contract, . . . Thomas v. Winchester became quickly a landmark of the law. In the application of its principle there may, at times, have been uncertainty or even error. There has never in this state been doubt or disavowal of the principle itself.” Judge Cardozo cited the cases of <em>Devlin v. Smith, </em><a href="/ny/89/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="89 N.Y. 470" data-case-ids="2184297" data-case-paths="/ny/89/0470-01">89 N.

    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.4",38,[277,1376,1149,425]]]'>Judge Cardozo also cited the case of <em>Heaven v. Pender, </em>11 Q.B.D. 503, and after quoting literally from Lord Esher’s opinion, added this: “He [Lord Esher] then points out that fór a neglect of such ordinary care or skill whereby injury happens, the appropriate remedy is an action for negligence.

Its nature gives warning of the consequences to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully.” He cites the following example: “If A leases a building <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>to be used by the lessee at once as a place of public entertainment . . . injury to persons other than the lessee is to be foreseen, and foresight of the consequences involves the creation of a duty.

When the insurance company failed to perform the duty the additional defendant, the Pennsylvania Warehousing and Safe Deposit Company of Philadelphia, claims it “did undertake”, to wit, “to make periodic inspections of the said elevator of” the company just named, it should reasonably have foreseen that a natural result of this neglect of the duty so allegedly undertaken would be injurious not only to the other party to the contract, but also to persons lawfully using that elevator. Persons lawfully using elevators have a right to assume that the elevators are periodically inspected as the law requires them to be and that, therefore, if an elevator is available and offered for use, the inspection it had been subject to must have determined the fact that it is in safe condition for use. If the.Indemnity Company, because of its contract with the Pennsylvania Company, assumed the duty of undertaking to make these periodic inspections in both the- company’s and the public’s interest, and if it did not do so, and if any person was injured because the elevator was in a condition so unsafe that reasonable inspection of the elevator would have disclosed that fact, the responsibility, either sole, joint or several, as may ultimately be "determined, of the Indemnity Company for the damage resulting to the plaintiff from the unsafe condition of <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>the elevator, is clear.
