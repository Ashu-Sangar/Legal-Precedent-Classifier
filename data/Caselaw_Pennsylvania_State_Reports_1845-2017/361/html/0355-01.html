The question in the present case is whether such a relationship existed between a hospital interne and defendant, a practicing surgeon, during the latter’s performance at the hospital of an obstetrical operation in the course of which the interne, by alleged negligence, injured the new-born child of the patient.</p>
    <p id="b379-4" data-blocks='[["BL_379.8",379,[110,879,1152,758]]]'>The facts—assuming plaintiff’s testimony to be true—are these: Mrs. Joseph K. McConnell consulted defendant in his professional capacity and she and her huband engaged him to attend her during her pregnancy and to deliver her of an expected child. Finding that a caesarian operation would be necessary, defendant suggested that it be performed at the Jewish Hospital in Philadelphia where he was one of the chiefs of the obstetrical staff, and accordingly she entered there on December 2, 1943. While the Jewish Hospital is not a public hospital in the sense of being owned or operated by government, it is a non-profit, charitable institution, with both private-patient and ward service, its facilities being available to all.</p>

The operation was apparently a difficult one; the patient suffered profuse hemorrhages which required defendant’s complete attention. When the child was delivered he .turned it over to the interne for the purpose of tying the cord and applying a solution of silver nitrate to the infant’s eyes. Silver nitrate is an extremely caustic drug .requiring careful dosage, and proper, technique calls for the application of only one or two drops in each eye followed by prompt irrigation. A subsequent analysis of . the silver nitrate used on this occasion revealed that it was a 2.1 solution which, it was testified, was not of excessive intensity. The insertion of silver nitrate or other approved prophylactic agent in the eyes of every new-born child is not only a regularly established practice in obstetrical cases but is required by the rules and regulations of the Department of Health of the Commonwealth, the purpose being to prevent the disease known as ophthalmia neonatorum. According to the testimony of Mrs. McConnell’s nurse the interne in this case filled a syringe and squirted the solution once^ into the child’s left eye and twice into its right eye, putting into the latter “a great many drops”; moreover, he. failed to irrigate the eyes during at least the period of five or ten minutes while this nurse remained in the operating room. The result was that the child lost the sight in her right eye completely, which was so badly burned that it had later to be excised, necessitating a. plastic , operation and the substitution of a glass eye which she will be obliged to wear throughout her life; the left eye was also severely and permanently scarred. Defendant himself testified that the insertion of the silver nitrate drops was not a job-which required any special skill; he said that “it.is done by midwives, nurses, students, physicians, and even those who are not educated in medicine in any way.”</p>

It is their contention that the case should have been submitted to the jury, and that the court was in error’ in negativing defendant’s ‘ responsibility ás a mattér of law. They do not charge defendant <em>personally </em>with any act of negligence either of commission or omission; they-apparently concede that hé is an obstetrician of high repute and that the operation he performed on Mrs. McConnell was entirely satisfactory and not subject to criticism. On the other hand, their testimony made out a prima facie case of negligence against the interne, and therefore the only legal question involved is whether the doctrine of respondeat superior applies, that is ’to'Say, whether, for the purpose of and during the course of the operation, which included the immediate caretaking of the infant child, the interne was, in the view of the law, the servant or employee of defendant.</p>

Mrs. McConnell testified, when asked what defendant “said he would do”, that “he would perform a caesarian operation and care for the baby for the sum of $200.” Defendant himself, when asked what his agreement covered and whether his liability was to continue until the baby was turned over to the family doctor, answered that “I so considered that it was.” It may well have been in contemplation that he might need help in taking care of the new-born infant, and, as it subsequently turned out, such help was essential, but the necessity of employing assistants is one of the ordinary circumstances of both business and professional life; it is to regulate just such situations that the law of agency exists. In' selecting a person to aid him in carrying out that part of his undertaking defendant was presumably free to make his own choice; there is nothing in the record to indicate that he was compelled to employ an interne; as previously stated, he testified, that as far as the insertion of the silver nitrate solution was concerned it would not have been necessary to use any licensed physician at all. What he chose to do was to call for and borrow from the hospital an interne who thereby became—or so at least a jury might find—his temporary servant or employee for the purpose for which he was engaged.</p>

Nor is it a tenable argument that- defendant should be relieved from legal responsibility because; the hospital furnished the services of an interne just as it furnished the silver nitrate-solution and the facilities of its laboratory and just as it furnished Mrs. McConnell with a room and board upon her payment of the hospital charges. The difference between the hospital’s supplying mere mechanical implements or medicines and its furnishing, at defendant’s request, an interne to assist him in the-operating: room.in the discharge of a duty which rested primarily’on defendant’s own shoulders, is obvious, because, by the interne’s becoming subject to his control, he became, responsible for the proper performance by the interne of all acts .done in subordination to-such control, whether defendant actually <em>exercised </em>it or not, and it would make no difference, in view of such control, whether the interne was furnished by the hospital or had been obtained in some other manner. As far as the evidence discloses' it was’ defendant, not the hospital, who assigned the interne; to the task of inserting the silver nitrate solution into the infant’s eyes, and, even if-in the performance of that act he may also have been serving the hospital, that fact would not change his legal status, with respect to defendant, since a borrowed employee may, in the performance of a given act, be serting the interests of both his general employer and his temporary master.</p>

The majority misconceive the functions and duties of a <em>charitable </em>hospital respecting its staff, personnel and <em>equipment when its facilities are made available to one of its staff surgeons who operates, in the hospital, on one of his private patients: </em>They commence with a <em>false premise, </em>upon which they have erected an erroneous hypothesis. It is assumed that a <em>charitable or public hospital ims </em>the same attributes that would exist if the surgeon conducted a- <em>private </em>hospital, where the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>would’ apply. A private hospital, however,” is operated f<em>o</em>r <em>pro fit </em>and consequently the owners are responsible for the negligence of their servants and agents as they would be if engaged <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>in any other business enterprise. Because the <em>staff </em>surgeon operates on his private patient in a <em>charitable </em>hospital for a fee, the majority erroneously decide that when a <em>hospital intern </em>assists in such an operation, the public hospital “lends” the intern (as well as all the hospital equipment and personnel) to the surgeon, who “borrows” from the charitable hospital <em>for the surgeon’s private gain. </em>This is a false assumption. There can be no “lending” or “borrowing” where a charity is involved. Such a transaction would be illegal. All assets of a charitable hospital are held <em>in trust </em>and must be employed solely for the purposes donated. Trust funds may not be <em>given away. </em>Furthermore, charities are not liable for the torts of their employes. Cf. <em>Fire Insurance Patrol v. Boyd, </em><a href="/pa/120/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="120 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="559800" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0624-01">120 Pa. 624</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20A.%20553" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="15 A. 553">15 A. 553</a>, and the many cases following it; <em>Brindle Will, </em><a href="/pa/360/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="360 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="475106" data-case-paths="/pa/360/0053-01">360 Pa. 53</a>, 63.

It is supported entirely by fees from paying patients, by donations from religious and charitable organizations, individual beneficences and other charitable means. Its functions, in common with all public hospitals, are (1) care of the sick and injured and (2) education of physicians, nurses and other personnel. Defendant, one of its staff surgeons, suggested to bis patient the use of this hospital. The patient agreed. She caused arrangements to be made for her entry into the hospital and for the payment of the use of all the hospital facilities. When the time arrived (while the patient was in the hospital) for a necessary Caesarian section, the surgeon, in arranging for the operation, requested an intern named Davidson to assist him at the operation fixed for the following morning. Dr. Davidson told the surgeon that be was no longer on <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>that service but that Dr. Constcur was.
