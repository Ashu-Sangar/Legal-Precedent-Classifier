The question of law involved is whether the testatrix intended a devise in remainder to her heirs at law to go to such persons only as would be her heirs according to the law as it existed at the time of the execution of her will or such as were her heirs under the law in force at the date of her death. The learned court below took the latter view and entered judgment accordingly. <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>The circumstances in which the question arises are as follows.</p>

Bricker of Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, died testate on September 9, 1918, seized of the title in fee to a farm. She left to survive her her husband, Benjamin F. Bricker, but no issue, her nearest of kin being a sister, Bianci A. Wilson, wife of William D. Wilson. The testatrix had executed her will on September 28, 1906; and, at that time, as well, her nearest of kin was her sister. The will provided in presently important part that “. . . In the event that my husband, Benjamin F. Bricker, shall survive me, ... I give, devise, and bequeath all my estate, real, personal, and mixed, to my said husband for his use during his natural life, without the necessity of making an appraisement of the same, and at his death, I direct that the said estate shall go to my heirs at law.”</p>

Wilson (joined by their daughter, Helen I. Spatz, and the latter’s husband) conveyed the farm to Nevin W. Wilson (a son of William E. and Bianci A. Wilson) and Nevin’s wife, Cora. The latter grantees were the defendants below and are the appellants here. Their contention, which the learned trial judge rejected, is that, in construing Mrs. Bricker’s will, the term “heirs at law” should be taken as meaning such persons as would be her heirs according to the law as it existed when she executed her will and that, consequently, Benjamin F. Bricker took but a life estate in the farm, the remainder in fee vesting in Bianci A. Wilson as Mrs. Bricker’s presumptive sole heir at law.</p>

In that' case, a testatrix had devised property to her son and a granddaughter for their lives, further providing that, upon the death of either of them, the share of the one so dying was to go to his or her heirs. The testatrix was held to have intended as remaindermen only such persons as proved to be heirs of the son or granddaughter according to the law existing at the time of the testatrix’s death rather-than at the death of a respective life tenant. The case is in no sense authority for the proposition that the heirs should be determined according to the law existing <em>at the time of the execution of the will. </em>Incidentally, the decision in <em>Troxell’s Estate, </em>supra, would have been different under the provisions of the Act of June 29, 1923, P.
