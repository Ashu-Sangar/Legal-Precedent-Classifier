At a meeting of the board of school directors, on May 29, 1946, the resignation of A. G. Clark, then supervising principal of the district, was accepted, and on the same date appellant, a professional employe of the district since September, 1929, was assigned to duty as “principal of schools”, effective July 1, 1946. A written contract was thereupon entered into between appellant and the board in the form designated by the Teachers’ Tenure Act, Act of 1937, P.

On the same date, following official notice of his suspension, appellant instituted a mandamus action in the court below to compel his reinstatement. After hearing, an order was entered directing the board to reinstate appellant “as a professional employe and to pay him his monthly salary at the rate of $4500.00 per year.” On appeal by the school board to this Court, the order was affirmed: <em>Houtz v.

Contending that this assignment constituted a demotion in type of position, appellant demanded a hearing in accordance with section 3 of the Teachers’ Tenure Act, supra.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> A hearing was duly held and the board made a finding that appellant’s assignment to duty as principal of the three elementary schools did not constitute a demotion. Thereupon he appealed to the Superintendent of Public Instruction who reversed the board and directed that appellant be reinstated “to the position of ‘Principal of Schools’, with the same powers, privileges and responsibilities as he held in that office when he was wrongfully removed therefrom on July 1, 1947.” On appeal by the board to the common pleas, an order was entered reversing and setting aside the order of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and this appeal was taken.</p>

      <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>Appellant contends that as a result of our prior decision he “enjoyed a status as a Professional Employe of the School District unaffected by the School Board’s action of June 11, 1947.” Such is not the effect of that decision. All that was decided was that performance by appellant of- the administrative and supervisory duties assigned to him by the board, to the exclusion of classroom teaching, did not constitute an abandonment of his tenure contract “to teach”, and that abolition by the board of the position of principal of schools did not result in termination of such contract under the circumstances. In this connection, appellant concedes that the order of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, insofar as it ordered appellant’s reinstatement to the position of principal of schools, “goes beyond the statutory authority thus vested in the Superintendent and was both unnecessary and improper.” It is urged, however, that while the board is vested with full power and authority to administer the school affairs of the district and, in so doing, to assign professional employes to any duties for which they may be qualified <em>(Ganaposki’s Case, </em><a href="/pa/332/0550-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="332 Pa. 550" data-case-ids="1186603" data-case-paths="/pa/332/0550-01">332 Pa. 550</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20A.2d%20742" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 A.2d 742">2 A. 2d 742</a>; <em>Ehret v.

Appellant’s contract with the board, on which his rights are dependent <em>(Pittsburgh School District Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/356/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="356 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="470707" data-case-paths="/pa/356/0282-01">356 Pa. 282</a>, 286, <a href="/citations/?q=52%20A.2d%2017" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="52 A.2d 17">52 A. 2d 17</a>), specifically provides that his employment is “subject to the supervision and authority of the properly authorized superintendent of schools or supervising principal.” Since <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>abolition of the position of principal of schools, the only supervisory positions in the district, other than that of supervising principal, are principal of the three elementary schools, principal of the senior high school, principal of the junior high school, combination principal-teacher of two of the elementary schools, and combination principal-teacher of a third elementary school. The position of principal of the three elementary schools is the second highest ranking position in the district, and the highest position, in point of rank, to which appellant could be entitled under his contract. With abblishment of the position of principal of schools, appellant’s assignment to duties as principal of the three elementary schools did not operate to change his relative grade or rank in the school system, and this being so, there has been no “demotion” in the sense prohibited by the statute.

Such a result would be absurd, because no sensible school management could prosper under it.” Similarly, to say in the present case that there can not be taken away from appellant any of the powers exercised by him while the position of supervising principal was vacant, would result in the situation that in the event of a vacancy in the position of supervising principal no person could be temporarily appointed to perform the duties of such position until a duly qualified party could be found and elected. We can find in the statute no such legis<a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>lative intent. As this Court has already said, it was not the intention of the legislature “to confer any special privileges or immunities upon professional employes to retain permanently their positions and pay regardless of a place to work” or “to have the Tenure Act interfere with the. control of school policy”: <em>Ehret v. Kulpmont Borough School District, </em>supra, 524. “The Act does not permit an interpretation which would result in permanent tenure being secured at the sacrifice of sensible school administration”: <em>Com. ex rel. v. Sunbury School District, </em>supra, p. 12.</p>
