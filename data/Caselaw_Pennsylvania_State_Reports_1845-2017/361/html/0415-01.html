Hunt (appellants), petitioned the common pleas court of Fayette County for a citation against Mary M. Mestrezat (appellee) to recover possession of real estate under the Act of April 20, 1905, P. L. 239, as amended, 12 PS, 2571 et seq. An answer was filed and issue joined. A stipulation in the form of a case stated was presented in lieu of evidence and a hearing had. The real estate here involved had been owned by Mary Ann Hunt, a widow, who died intestate, leaving to survive as her only heirs three children: Edward K. Hunt (an appellant), Mary M. Mestrezat (appellee), Josephine D. Mitchell, and eleven grandchildren, children of two deceased sons. Mary M. Mestrezat, a daughter (appellee), is in possession. The County Treasurer sold the premises to the County Commissioners because of delinquency in payment of taxes. Mary E. Hunt, wife of Edward K. Hunt (an heir), made a written offer to purchase the real estate which was accepted by the Commissioners. The amount of the bid was paid by her. The Commissioners deeded the premises to “Edward K. Hunt and Mary E. Hunt, his wife” (appellants). The court decreed that the citation should be dismissed because the appellants held title <em>in trust </em>for all the heirs as tenants in common. This appeal followed.</p>

    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[295,831,1148,1177]]]'>Edward K: Hunt was one of the heirs and therefore a co-owner. Consequently his wife possessed a property right in the land, viz., an inchoate right of statutory dower in her husband’s share. Such an interest, it is true, is not an estate, title or interest <em>in the land, itself, </em>but is a contingent claim, right or expectancy which will ripen into an estate in case the husband dies first. Such right is a thing of value which the courts, under appropriate circumstances, will protect: <em>Briegel v. Briegel et al., </em><a href="/pa/307/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="307 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="1138152" data-case-paths="/pa/307/0093-01">307 Pa. 93</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=160%20A.%20581" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="160 A. 581">160 A. 581</a>. Possessing such a contingent interest, a <em>wife of an heir, </em>may not purchase for her <em>exclusive </em>ownership, an adverse title to <em>all </em>of the heirs, in which land her.husband is a co-owner. The fact that the <em>wife’s </em>money was used to make the purchase is not controlling. In creating an estate by the entireties it is immaterial who pays the consideration: <em>Gallagher Estate, </em><a href="/pa/352/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="352 Pa. 476" data-case-ids="464096" data-case-paths="/pa/352/0476-01">352 Pa. 476</a>, 478, <a href="/citations/?q=43%20A.2d%20132" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="43 A.2d 132">43 A. 2d 132</a>.

The husband (a co-owner) is one of the tenants by.the entireties. The title so taken is adverse to all co-owners and therefore must be held to be in trust for all.</p>

The basis for these decisions is that the spouse takes title <em>with knowledge </em>of the facts which makes the purchase fraudulent as against the other co-owners. This result does not depend on the unity of estate between husband and wife, but upon principles of sound public policy.
