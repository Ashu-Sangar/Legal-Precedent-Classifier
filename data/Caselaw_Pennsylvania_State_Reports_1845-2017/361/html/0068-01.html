Defendants contend that the settlement agreement is not valid because (1) the person who acted for them had no authority to act as an adjuster, and (2) at the time of the settlement they did not know that plaintiff had paid Perkins the balance of the purchase price. The pertinent facts are these: John G. Monrose, Jr., acted as an adjuster for the defendant companies; he attended the settlement conference at which an agreement was reached as to the actual loss and the proportion in which it was to be shared by the various insurance companies; he notified the companies of the result of the conference; he had notice of the agreement of sale, which contained the date on which settlement of the property was to be made, and communicated this information to the Insurance Company of North America; and with this information available the officers of the companies accepted the figures recommended by the adjuster and authorized the execution and delivery of checks in payment of the loss.

      <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>In Goldin’s “The Law of Insurance in Pennsylvania”, Vol. I, Sec. 242, the following principle is stated: “The insurance company has the right to delegate the power of adjustment to persons in its employ, and an adjuster so employed has the power to make arrangements with the insured after loss, and to bind the insurer thereby. The agent of the company must be authorized to adjust the loss, or the conduct of the company with respect thereto must bé such as to reasonably induce the insured to believe he has such authority. Mere declarations of the agent alone are not sufficient, but the declarations of the agent together with the acts and admissions of officers of the company, the correspondence in the company’s own name will be sufficient . . .” Even if Monrose had no express authority, the defendant companies acquiesced in the adjustment by sending out drafts in conformity with Monrose’s report. This constitutes an admission by the companies that the amount' set forth on the draft was due to Perkins under their policies. The notification by Monrose of the agreement of sale was sufficient to put the defendant companies on notice as the agreement stated that settlement on the property was to be made no later than June 1, 1946. The deed was recorded shortly aftér that date and the company could have checked the records or discovered by inquiry the situation before sending out the drafts on August 14, and August 15, 1946.</p>

Plaintiff argues that Perkins had a right of action on the policies entirely apart from the right to enforce the settlement agreement. Plaintiff’s propositions are these: (1) Perkins’ policies were in effect on the date of the fire, and (2) they were not converted by the agreement of sale into policies insuring merely the payment of the balance of the purchase price.</p>
    <p id="b98-3" data-blocks='[["BL_98.3",98,[284,262,1152,1792]]]'>
      <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>The policy in the Insurance Company of North America was dated May 1, 1943. At that time he had an insurable interest in the entire property. No agreement of sale was then outstanding and he insured the entire interest in the property. On March 5, 1946, Perkins entered into an agreement of sale, the effect of which was to convey to the purchaser the equitable interest in the property. The policy issued by the Insurance Company of North America in the name of Wilkins J. Perkins contains the following provision: “It is hereby understood and agreed, anything in this policy to the contrary notwithstanding, that, if the property insured by this policy is, or shall become subject to an Agreement of Sale, this policy shall not be voided thereby nor shall the right of the Assured hereunder to recover be invalidated thereby, nor shall the interest of the vendee or any other parties to the Agreement of Sale except the Assured hereunder be insured by this policy”. The company thus continued to insure Perkins after the property became “subject to an Agreement of Sale”. There is no limitation of coverage in the event that an agreement of sale is entered into. There was no provision for reducing the premium under the circumstances stated. If the last quoted clause, beginning with the word “nor”, be deemed ambiguous it must be construed against its author, the insurance company. We do not regard it as ambiguous. It means that the interests of the vendee were not directly covered by the policy, that between the vendee and the insurance company there was no privity of contract and that whatever claim, either in law or in equity, the vendee might have against the vendor should fire transmute the latter’s building into <em>money, </em>was of no legal concern of the insurer.</p>
    <p id="b98-4" data-blocks='[["BL_98.4",98,[285,2066,1148,263]],["BL_99.1",99,[135,266,1151,375]]]'>The Philadelphia Contributionship takes the position that its liability terminated on the execution of the agreement of sale by virtue of a specific provision in its policy, as follows: “XI. In case the Assured shall sell the property insured, the benefit of insurance shall be <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>lost unless the Policy be assigned at the execution of the deed and brought to the Office for approval and entry within sixty days thereafter.” Inasmuch as the loss occurred prior to “the execution of the deed” and the rights of the parties were fixed as of the date of the loss, the provision invoked by the Philadelphia Contributionship is unavailing.</p>
    <p id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[139,651,1153,1184]]]'>Defendants contend that after the agreement of sale was executed the policies merely covered Perkins only to the extent of insuring the payment of the balance of the purchase price. They further contend that since the balance of the purchase price has been paid, Perkins suffered no loss. The decisions in <em>Insurance Co. v. Updegraff, </em><a href="/pa/21/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="21 Pa. 513" data-case-ids="411613" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0513-01">21 Pa. 513</a>, and <em>Reed v.

In the <em>Updegraff </em>case there was an action on a policy of insurance effected by the vendor after articles for the sale of the property and before conveyance. The agreement of sale provided for the payments on the property in yearly installments. The vendee took possession immediately. The premises insured were entirely consumed by fire before the contract price was completely paid. One of the conditions in the policy was as follows: “The interest of the insured in this policy is not assignable, unless the assignee, before any loss happens, shall give notice in writing of the assignment, in pursuance of the by-laws of this company, and have the same endorsed on, or annexed to this policy.” The policy was not assigned by the vendor to the vendee.</p>

(2) That if the plaintiff, Updegraff, is entitled to recover the loss which he has sustained, if any, then the company has a right to be subrogated <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>to all Ms securities as against Ms vendee, Winegardner. (3) That Winegardner having paid to Updegraff, subsequent to the insurance the sum of $1108, on the articles of agreement for the sale of the premises, such payment reduces the liability of the company pro tanto.</p>

At law the vendor, before payment of the purchase-money and delivery of the conveyance, is, to all intents and purposes, the owner of the estate. It is true that he is a trustee for the vendee, who, as between the parties to the contract, is bound to take the estate subject to every loss which may happen to it without the fault of the vendor, and is consequently entitled to every benefit accruing to it after the agreement ... As the vendor' is a trustee for the vendee, every act of his in relation to the estate will be presumed to be for the benefit of the vendee, subject of course to the ..prior claims of the vendor himself . . . Although the vendor is not bound to insure, or even to continue an insurance already made, he may, like any other trustee having the legal title, insure if he thinks proper, to the full value of the property .'. . An insurance upon a house, effected by the vendor, is prima facie an insurance upon the whole legal and equitable estate, and not upon the balance of the purchase-money. Where, the form of the policy shows it to be upon the house., and not upon the debt secured by it, the burthen of showing that the insurance was upon the latter and not upon the former, rests upon the underwriters. There is no hardship in this. The premium paid, as compared with that usually charged where the insurance is . upon houses, and not upon debts secured by them, is generally decisive of the question, and the rates of insurance are peculiarly within the knowledge of the insurance company. If the <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>insurance was upon the whole estate, the premium would be according to the usual rates for houses of that description and location; if it was only upon the debt due to the vendor, there would be a large reduction, on account of the responsibility of the vendee, and the value of the lot of ground included in the sale, because both of these would, in that case, stand as indemnities to the underwriters. They would be éntitled to a cession of the vendor’s claims, from which an ample indemnity might be recovered. If the lot was worth the balance of the purchase-money, there would be no risk whatever, and the premium would be quite insignificant . . . But there was no evidence tending to prove that the premium was less than the usual rates for houses of the description set forth in the policy, where the whole estate is insured. Nor was there any offer to return any portion of the premium. . . . The instrument before us is an open policy of limited extent. The underwriters agreed to make good to the insured, not all his loss, but all such loss or damage, not exceeding the sum stated, as shall happen by fire to the property,—the loss or damage to be estimated, not according to the balance of purchase-money which may remain unpaid at the time of the damage, nor according to the probabilities of recovering such balance from the vendee, or from the lot, but ‘according to the true and actual value of the said property.’ The policy is in form an insurance upon the house, and not upon the debt; and no evidence whatever was given to change its character, or to show that anything more or less was intended by the parties. It follows that the plaintiff below was entitled to recover, under a trust, as to the surplus, for the benefit of the vendee. The underwriters have shown no equitable right to intermeddle between the vendor and the vendee. Under such circumstances they must be content to respond to the party with whom they made the contract of insurance.”</p>

In <em>Reed v. Lukens </em>defendant owned a farm and had insured the buildings thereon for $3150—$900 of which was on the barn. He contracted with plaintiff for the sale of the property, delivery to be made on April 2, 1862. Before the time appointed for delivery of the deed, the barn was destroyed by fire. On the face of the policy the barn appeared to be insured for $300 and this sum was regarded by the parties as the amount insured upon that building. The policy of insurance was transferred to the vendee. A second assignment of the policy was executed, transferring to the vendee the vendor’s “right, title, and interest in and to a certain claim of $300” against the insurance company arising from the loss of the barn. The company acknowledged itself liable for $900, the amount actually insured on the barn and paid $300 to the plaintiff. The question to be determined was whether or not plaintiff was entitled to the remaining $600.</p>

Whatever advantage might thereafter arise to it would be the plaintiff’s, and whatever loss might befall it, he must sustain; the defendant had no further interest in it, except as a security for the purchase-money; he would neither lose nor gain by any change which might occur to it: Siter, James &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 2 Casey. When, therefore, the barn was burned, it was the plaintiff’s property that was destroyed; defendant lost nothing; the plaintiff was still obliged to take the property and pay the purchase money. The insurance company, however, became liable to pay for the loss to the defendant, because, as is said in Updegraff v.

But as between himself and the plaintiff, the property was not his, but the plaintiffs; he could not appropriate to himself the money which the insurance company became liable to pay on that account ; he had the property in trust, and the right which accrued in consequence of its destruction, took its place, was held in the same way, and liable to be enforced in a court of equity.”</p>

Actually, if the act of the seller in not reducing his insurance after the agreement of sale was entered into is not sufficient to indicate an intent to insure for the buyer’s benefit, there is present in the case the further fact that the seller increased the amount of his insurance a month after the agreement of sale was executed. There seems to be no reasonable explanation for this act other than that he intended to benefit the buyer. Defendants attempt to distinguish the <em>Reed </em>case by concluding that it involved only a question of an assignment and is therefore not applicable here. The assignment in the <em>Reed </em>case was of the seller’s interest in his insurance policy. To determine what was assigned it was necessary to determine first what the seller’s interest was. A barn worth $900 and completely covered by insurance had been destroyed by fire. Despite the fact that the insured-seller received the balance of the purchase price, the <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>court said that his interest in the policy was $900, and then, declared that this was the value of the assignment.</p>

The insurer’s liability is measured thereby. All such contracts of property insurance are considered contracts of indemnity intended solely to indemnify the insured for his actual monetary loss by the occurrence of the disaster. Unless the insured has sustained an actual monetary doss, the insurer has no liability.” The error in this argument is in the defendants’ interpretation of the word “loss”. They give that word too wide a meaning. A contract of fire insurance, in simple language, means this: For the premium paid by the insured, the insurer will, in case the insured’s building is destroyed by fire, indemnify him to the extent that he can show that his wealth has been depleted-by that fire. In other words, the insurance company gives the insured the equivalent in money of the building lost by fire. The “loss” which the insurance company contracted to pay to the owner of the building in the event of its destruction by fire is. the actual worth in money of that building before it was destroyed. Suppose that after a building is destroyed by fire a benevolent relative hears of the insured’s loss and, not knowing or caring whether the building was insured, sends the insured a check for $10,000 as a solace to him, would the insurance company be permitted in its settlement with the insured to deduct the $10,000 which was given to him by his relative as a result of the loss? The only logical answer to that question is “No”. The insurance company would have no right to appropriate to itself any part of the windfall to the insured. Suppose that after the building was destroyed by fire there was found in the ruins, in' a heat-resistant container which, un<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>known to anyone had been concealed under one of the floors of the destroyed building, the sum of $10,000. That would belong to the insured unless some other person could establish a superior claim to it. The insurance company would have no valid claim on that windfall. The destruction of a building by fire may conceivably bring many benefits tó the owner and whatever these may be, the insurance company cannot participate in them.</p>

Suppose further that on the day before the building was destroyed, B had said to A: “I will give you $300,000 for this entire property”, and A replied: “I demand $350,000.” B then said: “If your lot was vacant I would give you that much for it, but it would cost me $50,000 to raze this building, as I would do if I purchased your property, for Í would like to erect a modern office building on the site.” After the building is burned, B says: “Now I will give you $350,000 for this property,” and A sells it to him for that sum. Even if the insurance company could establish these facts, it would have' no right tó demand that' this $50,000 excess price, which A had received after the building was destroyed, should' inure to the insurance company’s benefit and be.deducted from the amount of the insurance which under the policy was due from the insurance company to A.</p>

It is possible that if the defendant is compelled to pay the policy the plaintiffs may, if they insist upon their 'rights against the contractors, get double compensation, unless they should be adjudged to hold the fund recovered for the contractors. But, however this may be, the owners had an insurable interest to the whole value of the buildings on their land, and the defendants neither can compel the plaintiffs to put the loss on the contractors, nor can they resort to the terms of the building contract to diminish the liability for an actual loss within the terms of the policy. The fact that improvements on land may have cost the owner nothing, or that if destroyed by fire he may compel another person to replace them without expense to him, or that he may recoup his loss by resort to a contract liability of a third person, in no way affects the liability of an insurer, in the absence of any exemption in the policy.”</p>

The owner of the car so lost can recover on the policy against the insurance company for the full value of his car at the time it was burned or stolen. If he, under the facts stated, wishes to present to the dealer, who has been so generous, a part or all of the proceeds of the insurance after it is collected, that is exclusively his own affair.
