The complaint set forth that the husband, while shopping-in a self-service Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company Super Market, selected and picked up two bottles of “Yukon Club Sparkling Pale Dry Ginger Ale” bottled by appellees, and thereupon one of the bottles exploded and glass therefrom entered the right leg of the wife appellant causing serious injury. Appellees filed preliminary objections to the complaint asserting that appellants failed to allege (1) any-contract between the parties to the action and (2) any contract between appellants and Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company from which might arise an implied warranty under The Sales Act: Act of 1915, P. L. 543, Section. 15, 69 PS 124. The court below sustained the preliminary objections and judgment was entered in' favor .of appellees. This appeal followed.</p>

On the bottle was the statement, “Bottled for the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Téa Co:, New York, N. Y. by Confair’s Beverage Company, Berwick, Pa., U. S.

An election of remedies in this regard has, however, never been held by this Court to authorize institution of a contract action based upon averments of negligence. Nor, conversely, has it authorized institution of a negligence action based upon averments of contract. Essential distinctions which exist; have been recognized. While there is a distinct tendency toward relaxation of the strictness of the common law as regards pleadings, a plaintiff cannot successfully maintain an action in one form by averring <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>facts establishing a valid cause of action if properly brought in another form.

Rule 3, First, of Section 19 of The Sales Act of 1915, P.

In the latter, the order for the goods, the payment of the price, delivery to the customer, and the passing of title to the goods all occur at -substantially the same time. The modern form of sale in a self-service store is of comparatively recent origin. There is required- of the customer certain acts before he can complete purchase of any goods. The customer selects and collects the goods he desires to purchase and conveys them in a merchandise cart supplied by the retailer, to a checker or cashier. Customers are invited to take possession of the goods that ‘they intend. to purchase. This possession is not the equivalent of delivery of- the article to the buyer. We need not'now decide the- time. at. which the, retailer intends to part with title. There are various methods used in .self-service stores. In some a checker itemizes the goods selected by the customer and presents the customer with a 'statement for the costs thereof, and <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>receives cash in payment therefor. In others there are separate cashiers whose sole function is to receive from thé customer the amount of money shown by the statément of the checker tó be due. It is sufficient in the instant case tó hold that selection by the customer is insufficient to pass title tó the article. In Williston on Sales, Revised Edition (1948), it is said:</p>
