They are appeals from orders authorizing the county commissioners of Westmoreland County to sell for $5,500 in the Fairfield township cases, and for $9,000 in the Bolivar borough cases, certain taxable premises acquired by the commissioners from the county treasurer on sales for delinquent taxes. Although the court authorized sales for the prices stated, the appellants contend that their higher bids of $6,000 for the Fairfield township lands and $25,862.33 for the Bolivar lands should have been accepted; they complain that the orders appealed from recited that the bids by counsel for the taxing authorities (the borough, township and their respective school districts) had not been made in good faith and did not bind the taxing authorities. The records do not contain sufficient facts to support the court’s conclusion that the bids were not made in good faith; nor do they contain any justification for approving the sales at the lower bids in the face of the higher bids of the taxing authorities. As the record must support the action of the court, we cannot sustain the orders appealed from. At the oral argument appellants’ counsel stated that the orders were not based on facts contained in the record; counsel for the appellee commissioners <a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>agreed with that statement, but asserted that the learned judge who made the orders did so because he was familiar with all the circumstances involved which was sufficient justification.</p>

G-. Stutzman for the sum of $8,350.00. They averred that they had acquired the property from the county treasurer; that the records in the treasurer’s office showed presently due tax liens aggregating $19,992.88 against this property; that Stutzman offered $8,350; that by the Act of May 25, 1933, P. L. 1019, as amended by Act of July 18, 1935, P. L. 1168, and the Act of May 15, 1945, P. L. 538, 72 PS 5970 a, b and c, they were empowered to sell such land at private sale on receiving the approval of the court; that the proceeds to be realized should “be prorated among the tax levying authorities in proportion to the respective amounts due them.”</p>

    <p id="b602-4" data-blocks='[["BL_602.4",602,[277,704,1149,588]]]'>The court fixed July 9, 1948, for a hearing in the court house to determine whether the petition should be granted and, at the same time, ordered advertisement pursuant to the Act of May 25, 1933, P.

On July 9, the court ordered “that the bid offered for the real estate is referred to the County Solicitor for the purpose of receiving other bids, the said officer to fix a time and place when he will receive such bids, and give five days’ notice thereof to all parties of record, or their counsel, and to make report thereof to the Court within fifteen days.”</p>

The county solicitor, to whom the reference was made on July 9th was Vincent E. Williams, who presented the case in this Court on behalf of the appellee-commissioners. On August 12th a return signed Vincent E. Williams, by Frederick T. Seymour, was filed. This return recited the order of July 9th, the extension of July 22nd, notice to the parties, and the holding of the meeting on August 6, 1948. In the brief filed in this Court on behalf of the commissioners, Vincent E. Williams states, “On August 6, 1948, the county solicitor then being on vacation, deputized Frederick T. Seymour, with the consent of the county commissioners, to sit and receive bids.” The return made by Mr. Seymour recited that Vincent R. Smith had bid $9,000 for the property and the school district had bid $25,862.33; that he had then requested counsel appearing for the school <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>district and the borough to make a cash deposit and that they declined to do so; that he had requested them to produce a resolution from the taxing authorities authorizing them to bid and that they declined to comply with his request; that he then recommended to the court that authority be given to sell the property to Smith for $9,000. There is nothing in the record showing what, if any, terms of sale had been specified by the court prior to the sale.</p>

There is nothing to show authority in Williams or in Seymour to reject bids or to demand cash or to challenge the authority of counsel appearing in the proceeding for the borough and for the school district. The Act of April 14, 1834, P. L. 333, section 71, 17 PS 1632, provides the method of requiring counsel to show his authority to appear; see <em>Gliwa et al. v. U. S.
