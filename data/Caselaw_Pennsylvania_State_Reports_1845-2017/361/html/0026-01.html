Obviously, the nature of the mortgage interest was such that, upon a default by the mortgagors, the executor would be in position to take over the late trust asset for himself. And, still further, the agreement of sale embraced not only the realty in controversy but the decedent’s household goods and personal chattels (save for a few excepted articles) at their appraised values as fixed by the appraisers, one of whom was Mrs. Blakely,—hardly less than indirect self-dealing, when considered in the light of the executor’s favoritism for the purchaser whose self-aggrandizing capacity was of the executor’s own deliberate choosing.</p>

It was also recognized in <em>Tanner’s Estate </em>that “The cases are uniform in declaring that it matters not [when there is self-dealing] how innocent and bona fide, and free from the suggestion of fault, the transaction may be.” In <em>Chorpenning’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/32/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="32 Pa. 315" data-case-ids="986767" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0315-01">32 Pa. 315</a>, 316, it was said that .“. . . the rule [forbidding self-dealing] is inflexible, without regard to the consideration paid, or the honesty <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>of intent. Public policy requires this, not only as a shield' to the parties represented, but as a guard against temptation on part of the representative.” In <em>Downing Estate, </em>supra, President Judge Rhodes of the Superior Court succinctly summarized the rule at p. 360 as follows.: “The prohibition against self-dealing is absolute; where the trustee violates it, good faith or payment of a fair consideration is not material.” See also Restatement, Trusts, § 170 (1), Comment h. The situation is no different where the breach consists of the fiduciary’s marked preference of a third person over the beneficiary in respect of a disposition of estate property.

Central Trust Company </em>and <em>Chorpenning’s Appeal, </em>supra. Here the title to the property is in a third party purchaser. Whether, despite the executor’s breach of trust, she may keep her bargain, depends upon whether she was a bona fide purchaser: Restatement, Trusts, § 170 (1), Comment e.; Scott on Trusts, §470. To be such, she must have paid value for the property without knowledge of the attendant circumstances constituting the executor’s breaches. For present purposes, the merit of the lower court’s finding that Mrs. Blakely paid a fair and adequate price for the property is assumed. But, she well knew, nonetheless, that the executor was preferring her as a purchaser over the beneficiary who had clearly expressed his desire to retain the property unsold. The plain import, if not the express words, of Mrs. Blakely’s testimony confirms that she had positive knowledge of the trust relation and of the executor’s disregard of the beneficiary’s rights in the matter. Indeed, the <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>notice need not have been actual.
