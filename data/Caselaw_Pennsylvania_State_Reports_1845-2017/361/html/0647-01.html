The Act applies “only where a ‘question of jurisdiction over the defendant or of the cause of action for which suit is brought’ is preliminarily raised . . . the statute was not ‘intended to furnish a short cut to a determination of the issues of law or fact raised by the pleadings, however certain their determination may appear to be’ . . .” <em>Rutherford Water Co. v.

Paragraphs 9 and 10 of the bill alleged, “9. Among the covenants made in the aforesaid lease agreement was and is one whereby the lessee agrees that the cars, rolling stock, and other such articles demised under the said lease agreement shall be kept in good condition and repair, and if destroyed or worn out shall be replaced from time to time by other ears or articles equal in value to the appraised value of the original, and that written notice of said destruction, wearing out, and substitution, and a written description of the substituted article shall be given promptly to the lessor.</p>

The bill also avers that defendant has applied to the Public Utilities Commission for certifi<a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>cates authorizing the transfer by defendant to a proposed corporation to be known as Reading Bus Company, all its property used-in its bus service in its Reading Division, and to Hershey Coach Company “an affiliated corporation,” property used in its Lebanon County bus service. Plaintiff averred in paragraph 15 that “[it] has reasons -to'believe, believes and hence expects to prove that the entire transaction constituting the effort to incorporate ‘ the Reading Bus Co. and the Hershey Coach Co. with attendant transfer of assets thereto, is for the illegal purpose of evading the performance by the plaintiff of its lease with defendant” and “16. If the aforesaid plan of Defendant to transfer properties and rights to Reading Bus Company is carried but, the. latter will then exercise its motor bus. rights so as to give local service between Mohnton and Reading in direct competition with the aforesaid street railwáy service; and thus Defendant will, through its wholly owned subsidiary, injure and decrease the revenue from the said street railway in violation of its express covenánt to use every reasonable effort to maintain and increasé the business and revenue therefrom.” .</p>

Therein the plaintiff avers valid and subsisting contracts which the corporate defendants have bréached and are threatening to breach and which other of the defendants, including the defendant union, have induced and continue to induce the corporate defendants to breach and third persons to violate. Without more, it is settled for this State that a court of equity has jurisdiction of such a complaint: <em>Sun Ship Employees Association, Inc., v. Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, Local No. 2, C. I. O., </em><a href="/pa/351/0084-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="351 Pa. 84" data-case-ids="462746" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0084-01">351 Pa. 84</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=40%20A.2d%20413" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="40 A.2d 413">40 A. 2d 413</a>. The instant case is clearly one of a general class over which a court of equity has jurisdiction, i. e., wrongful breaches of valid and subsisting contracts whose value lies in the maintenance of the relationships which they establish and for whose breach money damages would not afford adequate compensation.”</p>

The two facts (1) that the subject matter is within the cognizance of the common pleas and (2) that defendant appeared, satisfy the inquiry to be made in considering the Act of March 5, 1925. What the decision ultimately may be is not before us now and, on these pleadings, could not be forecast. The bill will not be dismissed merely because it may be that on some of the issues suggested, the Public <a id="p652" href="#p652" data-label="652" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*652</a>Utility Commission lias exclusive jurisdiction. An unseemly clash of jurisdiction is not to he anticipated; on the contrary, the two tribunals will act harmoniously, each within the limits prescribed for its action.</p>
