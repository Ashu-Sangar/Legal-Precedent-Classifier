By her probated will and codicil dated April 12, 1944 (about which there is no contest) testatrix made numerous specific and pecuniary bequests and gave the entire residuary estate (constituting its bulk) to the Honey Brook Methodist Church and appointed the cashier of her bank and her attorney executors. The two contested codicils were probated with the will and uncontested codicil. An unprobated codicil was executed October 26,1944. The probated codicil of October 4, 1944 revoked the residuary bequest to the church. In lieu testatrix gave the church a legacy of $3,000 and cancelled its indebtedness to her of $3,000 (already cancelled in 1943); a hospital in Coatesville was given $1,000; the residue of the estate was devised and bequeathed to six individuals: Annie R. Davis, Blanche D. Moore, Clara Johnson, Helen Skiles, Bessie A. Sweeney and A. Marie Sweeney. The second probated codicil, dated November 9,1944, revoked all bequests to testatrix’s cousins, Annie R. Davis and Blanche D. Moore; bequeathed $5,000 to her cousin, Helen M. Skiles; gave $200 each to Mrs. Arthur White and Bessie Helms; bequeathed certain’ furniture to Helen M. Skiles, Clara Johnson, Á. Marie Sweeney and Bessie A. Sweeney; testatrix’s former ' residuary disposition was revoked and in lieu thereof testatrix named <em>four </em>(instead of six) residuary beneficiaries: Clara Johnson, Helen M. Skiles, Bessie A.

The determination of this question largely depends upon the fact whether or not testatrix .was weak <em>in mind </em>as well as body. Two other possible factors must be considered: was there an imprisonment of testatrix’s body and mind and was fraud practiced upon testatrix?</p>

A cousin, Annie Davis, assisted testatrix about the house and attended to <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>testatrix’s banking and business affairs. In July 1942, testatrix suffered a major stroke which caused a paralysis of her muscles of speech and affected her throat. In October 1942, Dr. Bamberger entered the Army. He testified that, in addition to the stroke, testatrix was <em>then </em>suffering from infirmities of old age; had rheumatism, bladder trouble and marked arteriosclerosis; <em>that her physical infirmities weakened her mental capacity and made her suceptible to influence, </em>especially where the persons exercising it made testatrix more comfortable physically.</p>

In August 1943 testatrix fell out of bed, fracturing a hip, which thereafter caused her to be confined to bed or in her bedroom chair. After testatrix broke a hip her nursing care proved inadequate. Dr. Morton was requested to secure a trained nurse. The doctor recommended Marie Sweéney, of Downing-town, who accepted the service. She commenced her duties on November 30, 1943. Wages were fixed at the then standard rate of $8 per day and maintenance.</p>

On January 24, 1944 Marie Sweeney discharged Anna Phaler and replaced her with Bessie Sweeney, the nurse’s <em>mother—not </em>a practical nurse—at a salary of $31.60 a week, later increased to $38.60.</p>
