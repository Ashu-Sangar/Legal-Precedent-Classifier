From the very beginning their marital voyage seems to have been a stormy one, due largely to the well-founded conviction of respondent that her husband was guilty of infidelity. She claims that he communicated to her a venereal disease which necessitated her undergoing a major operation. She left him on several occasions and finally, on June 21, 1930, they entered into a written agreement of separation under the terms of which they agreed to live separate and apart from one another during the rest of their lives; thereupon she <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>moved to another town and since then they have not lived together as man and wife. Libellant has attempted several times to induce respondent to return to him and resume cohabitation; in addition to requests made in person and by an appeal to her sister, he sent a registered letter to respondent on May 3, 1933, seeking a reconciliation and in later years made further efforts in that direction with the aid of the probation officer of the county. She refused all his invitations and he therefore relies for support of his divorce action on the well established proposition that an agreement for separation may be revoked at any time by a bona fide offer for the resumption of marital relations, and, if the other party, without adequate reason, persists in remaining apart after such revocation, he or she then becomes guilty of desertion, which, if continued for the statutory period, furnishes to the revoking party sufficient cause for a divorce: <em>Butler v. Butler, </em>1 Pars. Eq. Cas. 329, 335; <em>Kurniker v. Kurniker, </em><a href="/pa-super/94/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="94 Pa.

The master who heard the testimony thought that it did; the Common Pleas and Superior Courts held that it did not, the Superior Court stating that “The fact .that the letter was prepared by an attorney, sent by registered mail, a return receipt requested, and the return receipt and a typewritten copy of the letter introduced into evidence at the hearing before the master, was sufficient to warrant the court below in concluding that libellant’s motive in sending the letter was to obtain evidence on which to base his action in divorce, rather than to effect a reconciliation.” But the bona fides of libellant’s requests for the resumption of marital relations does not depend merely on the way in which the letter of May 3, <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>1933, was prepared and sent since the other efforts which he made to induce respondent to return to him must also be taken into consideration; moreover the present proceedings were not commenced until 13 years after the letter was written so that it could scarcely have been designed for the purpose of laying the foundation for any divorce action then in contemplation. On the whole, it would seem that libellant was really sincere in wanting his wife to return to him and that he hoped his invitations to that end would be accepted.</p>

The fact is that, notwithstanding such desire on his part, he was apparently unwilling to confine his affections to Mrs. Stanziola but persisted throughout in being faithless to his marriage vows. In a letter written by him to his wife under date of February 27, 1932 he made shameful and unblushing admissions of sexual relations with another woman and even of unnatural practices, and respondent testified that he repeatedly confessed to her that he was living with another woman; indeed his own testimony in the present proceedings practically amounted to admissions of marital infidelity which are amply supported by corroborative evidence. It is true that he usually accompanied the confessions he made to respondent with assurances of contrition and promises of reformation whereby he was able several times to persuade her to return to him from her occasional periods of separation, but that he nevertheless continued to live in adulterous relations is so manifest from the testimony that it would be the extreme of judicial naivete to conclude otherwise. We are not unmindful of the fact that the reasonable cause which will justify a wife to separate from her husband or to refuse to return to him after living apart under an agreement of separation must be one which would entitle her to a divorce <em>(Butler v.

But, as already stated, no one reading the present record can come to any conclusion other than that at all the times libellant was seeking his wife’s return and no doubt eager to have her back he was persisting in a life of adultery; under such circumstances no self-respecting wife could have been expected to accept his offers. To put it in the terse language of Mrs. Stanziola herself: “I said he couldn’t live with two women”. Her refusals to return to him were justified not only by elementary principles of decency but by a wealth of legal authority: <em>Betzko v.
