He was employed as a garage mechanic by his brother with whom he made his home after separating from his wife about three weeks before. On February 12, 1947, he bought a revolver; his war experience gave him familiarity with weapons. His wife had left the apartment occupied by them and for a period of between two and three weeks resided in. the neighborhood with a widow, Mrs. Hazel Wagner. At about 8.45 on the evening of February 16, 1947, he drove to the home of Mrs. Wagner “to try” as he said “to get [his wife] to come back.” When he reached Mrs. Wagner’s house he saw his wife and Mrs. Wagner “sitting in the front room . . . right inside the window.’’ He-“rang the. bell, or rapped on the door” and Mrs.. Wagner answered by <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>opening the door. He told her. that, he wished to see his wife and testified that Mrs. Wagner said, “If you want to see Pauline, go to see her lawyers.” Among other things,, defendant testified: “I said, ‘Please leave me see her.’ I begged her, and my nerves, I was just .shaking all over, I got pain in the back of my head and I didn’t know—I just blacked, that is all, I just couldn’t see, and thought I heard people coming towards me, and I didn’t know whether they were or not, but there was a lot of racket back of me, and stuff, and I fired a shot to try to get away. Q. Did you direct that-shpt at any person? A. No, sir. Q. Did you come; there with the intention of killing anybody? A.. No, sir. Q. Did you intend to kill your wife? A. No, sir. Q. Did you intend to kill Hazel Wagner? A. No, sir. Q. Where did you find that gun? A. I didn’t know that gun. was in my pocket. Q. When did you first discover that it was in your pocket? A. When I was on the porch of Hazel Wagner’s.” .The jury rejected that account of what occurred .and adopted another account. given by witnesses fully supporting its verdict. The evidence would have justified the jury in finding that the shooting occurred at 8.50. Officer Kinneman testified that he arrived at Mrs. Wagner’s house at about 8.57 in response to a telephone call and found Mrs. Wagner lying on the porch; he asked her what had happened. “A. She said, ‘Grant Logan wanted to see his wife and I told him to go see her lawyer. .1 coaxed him. <em>I begged Mm to give me that gun. </em>Then he shot me.’ ” That was about seven minutes after the shooting. Mrs. Wagner had been shot in the abdomen. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital in York, Pennsylvania, arriving at 9.10 P.M. She died at 10.10 P.M. About ten minutes after her arrival at the hospital Officer Moul asked her what had happened and received the same reply made to Officer Kinneman on the porch at about 8.57 P.M. Miss Selmser, a nurse in the hospital, testified “A... Well, when I was getting her undressed in <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>bed, she said that she was dying. Q. What did she say? A. She said, ‘I am dying.’ Q. Did she say that more than once? A. Yes, during the time that we were undressing to give her the plasma, and gave her other treatments, she said it. I don’t know how many times. Q. Were you present when she died? A. Yes, I was. . . . Q. Would you be able to estimate how soon after she was admitted as a patient it was she made this statement that she was going to die? A Well, it wasn’t any more than ten minutes.” These statements of impending death were made before the deceased spoke to either Officers Moul or Kinneman at the hospital.</p>

He was asked, “Q. What did she state? A. Well, she believed she was going to die and she repeated that statement several times. We, of course, tried to reassure her, but she still believed that she was going to die.”</p>

He was in a hospital in France from which he was sent to England “by plane on a litter”; after some treatment at the 74th.

It was discovered there that he was suffering with peptic ulcers and after some treatment was finally released from the army May 28, 1945. Coming closer to the period of the murder he was asked, “Q. Now, when you started working for your brother at Glen Rock, what type of work did you do for him? A. Mechanic in a garage. Q. What was yóur nervous condition after you started working for your brother? A. It was all right as long as I was left alone. Nothing worked .on my nerves.

I tried to do work for people and I couldn’t finish it. Q. You say you were having trouble getting along with your wife?. A. Yes, I had a little difficulty.” In describing the effect oh him of his separation from his .wife he testified, “Q. What happened after you separated? A. Well, my nerves just went bad. I just couldn’t go anymore, that’s all. My nerves just got the best of me and I just couldn’t eat. I tried to do work for people on automobiles. It didn’t work, I couldn’t do the job.”</p>

On this point one physician was called on behalf of the defendant and two on behalf of the Commonwealth. Appellant now makes several complaints with respect to this evidence. The first relates to the evidence given by Dr. Cohen. He was, and for many years had been, the jail-physician and had had psychiatric experience over a period of twenty-six years. On the morning after the shooting, he examined the' defendant and thereafter examined him once a week until the trial August 25, 1947. He was asked whether, as ¿ result of the examinations he had made “any diagnosis as to [defendant’s] mental condition.”. When asked to state what opinion he had formed on the subject defendant’s counsel objected on the ground that counsel “did not know the facts which were given to him by defendant upon which he bases his opinion and diagnosis.” The court properly overruled that objection.</p>

Zehring, 9 P. F. Smith 74 ‘be predicated of the facts proved or admitted, or of such as appear in evidence hypothetically stated,’ ...” Wigmore on Evidence, section 675, states, “. . . since it is the essential nature of conclusions that they are always relative to and dependent upon the premises, is not every offered opinion or conclusion hypothetical in its nature, whether the witness himself supplies the testimony to the premises or whether they are assumed in the question and then supplied by other testimony?

Dr. Transeau was asked a hypothetical , question that occupies six printed-pages <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>of the record; the question ended as follows: “Q. Now, Doctor, assuming these facts'which I have just stated to you, can you state whether or not on February 16, 1947, at, about eight-forty-five to eight-fifty, at the time a shot was fired front the gun or revolver of the defendant, the defendant was able to form at that time a wilful and deliberate and preméditated. intention to kill?” “A. I believe that he- was not able to form such an opinion . . . A. He was not. able to form any opinion or intention to commit a wilful, deliberate murder¿” The doctor testified that in his opinion defendant was not able to distinguish right from wrong, or understand the nature and consequences of his act; that he was of unsound mind: Asked to give a name to this form of illness he said, “I believe he probably was suffering from the depressed type of manic, depressive,psychosis.” He examined plaintiff a few days prior to the trial when, he said, defendant “seemed to be mentally well then.” The Commonwealth in rebuttal called a physician who was largely engaged in psychiatry. The Commonwealth read to this witness the hypothetical question submitted to the expert called, to testify, on behalf of defendant. The witness, Dr. Heim, testified he was in court during the trial, and that he heard Dr. Transeau’s testimony. He was then asked the same question and he testified that assuming the facts stated in the question defendant was able on February 16, 1947, at 8:45 to 8:50 P.M. to form a wilful, deliberate and premeditated intention to kill; that he had the ability to form an intention to commit the act with which he was charged; that he was at that time capable of distinguishing right from wrong, was mentally competent to comprehend and understand the nature and consequence of his act, that he was then of sound mind. He testified that in his opinion defendant was suffering from plsychoneurosis. He declined to characterize defendants condition at the time of the' murder as manic .depressive psychosis and gave reasons <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>for his view. The subject was covered in the instructions to the jury inter alia, “That is the crux of the whole case, it seems to me, as far as the defense is concerned, and your verdict will largely depend upon how you view the fact as to the defendant’s ability to distinguish between right and wrong at the time the killing occurred.” The plea was not guilty; there was no formal plea of insanity; all the evidence on the subject came in under the plea of the general issue. We have outlined defendant’s contentions at some length so that it may appear that he was given ample opportunity to present his case in defense. Nothing more in defendant’s brief requires discussion. '</p>
