    <p id="b675-8" data-blocks='[["BL_675.11",675,[120,844,1147,427]]]'>This is an appeal from a judgment entered for defendant <em>non obstante veredicto </em>in a suit by a beneficiary against an insurance company on its policy which insured, the life of plaintiff’s husband. Judgment was entered for defendant because the uncontradicted documentary evidence established false and fraudulent statements made by the insured in the insurance application, upon which the insurer relied in issuing the policy.</p>
    <p id="b675-9" data-blocks='[["BL_675.12",675,[123,1281,1147,310]]]'>The policy was issued on April 24, 1943. Insured died within three months thereafter on July 3, 1943. The cause of death was “a respiratory arrest,” with contributing cause “widespread ulcerative caseous tuberculosis bilateral,” which, in lay language, is an advanced state of tuberculosis.</p>

The undisputed evidence established that he was aware of the nature of his illness. At one time he was admitted to the hospital after he had “expectorated about a cupful of bright blood and clots.” The official hospital records disclose his numerous admissions to the hospital, the diagnosis and treatment for tuberculosis. That the insured’s statements were false, and he knew them to be false, cannot be doubted from an examination of this undisputed documentary evidence.
