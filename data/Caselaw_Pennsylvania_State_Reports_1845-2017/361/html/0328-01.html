The judgments were entered against appellant, appellant’s wife and appellee jointly. (Appellant had previously paid one of the twenty-one mortgages on one of the ten properties owned by him). The Melnick Association had its nine judgments consolidated on May 15, 1929. The Link Association likewise had its eleven judgments consolidated. After attachment execution, the judgments of both associations were paid in full during 1929 with monies and other property belonging to appellant.

The court in that case (herein called the contribution case) made findings of fact and conclusions of law, the gist of which were that appellant and the persons comprising Standard were in fact partners; that appellee had acted originally as agent for his undisclosed principals, viz.: the parties composing Standard; that “On July 17, 1925, by <em>oral agreement of all parties, </em>[appellee’s] <em>connection with the partnership was terminated </em>and . . ., Abraham Rabinowitz and Ephraim Fruchbom individually and as co-partners, trading as Standard Provision Company, patently <em>assumed their characters as real owners and partners to the extent of a half interest with [appellant]” </em>(emphasis supplied) ; that the amounts of mortgages against the eleven properties owned by Standard totaled $28,000; and that this amount had been satisfied out of property belonging to appellant.

Upon payment of this “settle<a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>ment amount” within the specified period, <em>appellant agreed to execute and deliver a general release discharging the persons comprising Standard from, </em>”. . . all manner of actions, debts, agreements, promises, claims, and demands, of whatsoever nature, in law or equity, which [appellant] . . . may have. . .

It therefore unequivocally appears that appellant intended to substitute Abraham Rabinowitz and Ephraim Eruehbom as his partners and to <em>discharge </em>appellee, <em>insofar as appellant was </em>concerned, from all liability arising out of transactions involving this land. That a novation was intended and was actually effected becomes apparent when appellant and the substituted partners agreed to abide by the same terms for the sharing of income and expenses and distribution of profits and losses <em>as originally existed between appellant and appellee. </em>Furthermore, titles to these twenty-one properties were conveyed to the new partners and appellant in accordance with the agreement. Finally, when the parties decided to dissolve the partnership, the properties were divided between appellant and Abraham Rabinowitz and Ephraim Eruehbom, <em>not between appellant and appellee. </em>Whatever contractual duties existed between appellant and appellee were therefore discharged and new contractual duties arose between appellant and the principals, as partners, when the new agreement was made. Throughout this case, appellant has consistently <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>asserted that Abraham Rabinowitz and Ephraim Frnchbom <em>were </em>his partners.</p>
    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[274,378,1150,1627]]]'>The novation, of course, had no effect on whatever rights the mortgagees (Melnick and the Link Associations) might have had against appellee, as agent, and Abraham Rabinowitz and Ephraim Fruchbom as undisclosed principals. We are not herein concerned with these rights. <em>Appellant </em>may not, however, assert that, as assignee, he took the assignment <em>subject to these rights. </em>He agreed to the substitution of partners prior to the assignment although he was under no legal duty to do so. By accepting the new partners, in place of appellee, appellant relied on the personal credit of the substituted partners instead of the personal credit of appellee. A person who enters into contractual obligations with an agent, where the agent is acting for an undisclosed principal, may enforce his claim against the agent <em>because he has acted upon the agent’s credit. </em>As this Court said in <em>Beymer v. Bonsall, </em><a href="/pa/79/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="79 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="438430" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0298-01">supra,</a> p. 300: “Undoubtedly an agent who makes a contract in his own name without disclosing his agency is liable to the other party. The latter acts upon his credit and is not bound to yield up his right to hold the former personally, merely because he discloses a principal who is also liable.” The <em>mortgagees would have been entitled to recover against the appellee. </em>But where <em>appellant </em>received the assignment of the judgment with full knowledge of all the circumstances, after he had effectively released appellee from liability <em>because of the novation, </em>he is now estopped from asserting a right which he surrendered. Under such circumstances a reservation in the release of a right against appellee availed the appellant nothing.</p>

With the judgment opened, the execution may not proceed but remains subject to the control of the court. Ordinarily where a judgment is opened after a writ of attachment execution has issued, the attachment may not be quashed or dissolved. It remains a lien upon the property seized, awaiting the final determination of the validity of the judgment: <em>Adams v. James L. Leeds Company, </em><a href="/pa/189/0544-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="189 Pa. 544" data-case-ids="903563" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0544-01">189 Pa. 544</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=42%20A.%20195" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="42 A. 195">42 A. 195</a>; <em>Giles v. Ryan et al., </em><a href="/pa/317/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="317 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="8845278" data-case-paths="/pa/317/0065-01">317 Pa. 65</a>, 68, <a href="/citations/?q=176%20A.%201" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="176 A. 1">176 A. 1</a>, and cases therein cited. In all such cases, if the judgment is ultimately sustained, the defendant remains liable on the judgment and his seized property may be employed in satisfaction thereof. However, where the defendant in the judgment can never be held liable thereon, and consequently his seized property can never be employed to satisfy the same, such attachment execution may be quashed or dissolved. This precise question, between some of the same parties and under the same judgments, arose in <em>Link Building and Loan Association, to use, v. Melnick et al., </em><a href="/pa/325/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="325 Pa. 182" data-case-ids="1172250" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0182-01">325 Pa. 182</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=189%20A.%20470" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="189 A. 470">189 A. 470</a>. Melnick (appellant herein) released his former wife from the judgménts but, nevertheless, issued attachment execution against her property. The execution was quashed by the court below and this Court affirmed. Mr. Justice Linn said, p. 185: . . by agreeing not to proceed against the other in this execution [the present appellant usé-plaintiff], disqualified him<a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>self from proceeding with it against her. She is therefore entitled to the aid of the restraining arm of the court, for, if he broke his contract by going on with the execution, he would become answerable to her for the resulting breach: equity will prevent this circuity of action by now giving effect to the intention of the two parties to the contract.” The instant case is analogous. The result—the dissolution of the attachment— follows precisely as it would have if payment of the judgment had been proved. Proof of the novation, like proof of payment, must have the same effect. Appellant discharged the appellee from liability by the <em>novation </em>which, under the circumstances, is similar to the <em>release </em>in <em>Link Building and Loan </em>Association, <em>to use, v. Melnick et al., </em>supra. What this Court decided in that case has equal application here.</p>
