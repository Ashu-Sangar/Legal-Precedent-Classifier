It appears that the treasurer of the county held several public sales of real estate for unpaid taxes levied and assessed by the several taxing authorities in the county. The Commonwealth purchased the properties at these sales for the purpose of protecting judgment liens obtained thereon by the Department of Public Assistance under The Support Law of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2045. Title was taken in the name of the <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>Commonwealth. Thereafter the county commissioners caused these properties to be assessed for taxation purposes in the various municipalities, townships and other political sub-divisions in the .county. The Department of Public Assistance claimed that the properties were exempt from local taxation because they were public properties used for public purposes, whereas the county insisted that they were subject to taxation in the same manner as other real estate. The parties therefore submitted to the court for determination this question:— “May the County of Schuylkill, or any political subdivision thereof, assess and levy taxes upon real estate held and owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Public Assistance, acquired for the purpose of protecting judgment liens and to better secure the loans or payments made to owners of such real estate when the said judgment liens were entered?” The court’s answer to this question was in the affirmative, and from its judgment and decree so holding the Commonwealth, Department of Public Assistance, appeals.</p>
    <p id="b150-4" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[265,1345,1151,805]]]'>The Department of Public Assistance was created by the Act of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2003, as one of the administrative departments of the Commonwealth, charged with the duty of administering and carrying out the provisions of the Public Assistance Law, the Act of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2051. The Public Assistance Law detailed the powers and duties of the Department of Public Assistance and established the classes of beneficiaries eligible to receive assistance from public funds. By the amendatory Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 434, section 1, it was “declared to be the legislative intent that the purpose of this act [the Public Assistance Law] is to promote the welfare and happiness of all the people of the Commonwealth, by providing public assistance to all of its needy and distressed.”</p>

In that case one such investment was a mortgage which had to be forclosed and the property was purchased at sheriff’s sale by the Commonwealth. As to this the Court said (p. 182, A. p..872): “The purchase of the real estate, at sheriff’s sale, was only incidental to the primary invest<a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>ment, forced on the Commonwealth by the default on the mortgage and the absence of other purchasers at the sheriff’s sale.

It was further held in, that case that real estate acquired from a debtor who had defaulted on a mortgage securing a loan made by the Board was also public property administered for a public purpose, it being irrimaterial that the form of the investment had been changed from money to land.</p>
