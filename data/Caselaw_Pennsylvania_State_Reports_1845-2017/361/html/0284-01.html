Shortly afterwards it moved to Cheltenham Township and in 1915 it moved to Rydal, in Abington Township. In 1915 The Ogontz School was incorporated as a business corporation to operate a private school for young ladies. The owner of the school at- that time was Miss Abby Sutherland. In 1929, when the business corporation transferred title to the property, then consisting of 47 acres, to the non-profit corporation, The Suburban Academy, Inc., later changed to The Ogontz School, Miss Sutherland was the sole shareholder of the business corporation. It was for the specific purpose of taking over the assets of the old business corporation that the non-profit corporation, The Suburban Academy, Inc., later changed to The Ogontz School, was formed. The non-profit corporation, The Suburban Academy, Inc., acquired all the assets of the business corporation and took title to the real estate consisting of 47 acres, subject to a mortgage indebtedness of about $450,000. The consideration for the conveyance by the business <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>corporation to the non-profit corporation was $150,000, secured by the second mortgage bonds given by the nonprofit corporation to the business corporation. The nonprofit corporation assumed all the debts of the business corporation. The latter then turned over to Miss Sutherland the second mortgage bonds of the non-profit corporation in consideration of her surrendering ber stock in the business corporation. These second mortgage bonds have been paid and the school is no longer indebted to Miss Sutherland. Since 1929 The Ogontz School has paid off other indebtedness amounting to $400,000.</p>

At the entrance to the property is a stone house, “Lares”, which is occupied by Miss Sutherland, president of the school, and also by ten girl students and two teachers of the school. This building is also used for the practice of home economics. Other buildings on the 47 acre tract are a chemical laboratory, a small greenhouse, an art studio, a dormitory, a classroom and dining room building, a kindergarten building, a faculty dormitory building, another Home Economics building, a servants’ dormitory, and a barn. A section of the property is woodland and another part of the tract is used for an athletic field, hockey field, tennis courts and competitive drill field.

The basic cost of attending The Ogontz School, including tuition, board and lodging, is $1,900 a year. There are extra tuition charges for students studying voice and piano.

The mortgage indebtedness on the school properties on September 30, 1945, was $40,000.

They were a part of the .47 acres constituting the school campus and had been included in the transfer in 1929 of the school properties to the non-profit corporation. In 1940 Miss Sutherland purchased these properties for $63,662 from the School in order to provide the School with cash funds to meet its then financial needs and she also paid off encumbrances amounting t.o $16,500. In 1945 she gave these properties thus valued at about $80,162 to the School and they now constitute the endowment fund above named. There is also a Chapel Fund, composed of $13,976.56 in cash and. $1,162.50 in United States Bonds, for the future construction .of a chapel for the school.

The statements of Income and Expenses for the years 1944 and 1945 show that the School received from tuitions sufficient revenue to defray all operating expenses and to set up an ample depreciation reserve. The operation of this School in 1945 resulted in a surplus to the School, after depreciation allowances, of $50,941.40. The corresponding figure for 1944 was $14,907.86. In 1943. the total income exceeded expenses, before depreciation, by $7,437.90. Deducting depreciation there resulted a net loss for that year in the amount of $10,799.22.</p>

Any institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of this burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being given a ‘quid pro quo’ for its services in providing something which otherwise the government would have to provide.”</p>

Each year the School provides from two to four full scholarships and from fifty to seventy-five partial scholarships. Respective counsel have submitted a statement showing the value of the full and the partial scholarships for the years 1937 to 1944, inclusive. For the four years from 1941 to 1944 the value of the full scholarships each year was $3,600 and the value of the partial scholarships for those years was, respectively, $48,612, $38,340, $43,-095, and $31,220. The total value of all the scholarships for the eight years was $385,357, or an average of $48,168.75 annually. This is equivalent to about 25 full scholarships, each worth $1,900. Since the Ogontz School, including the Junior College, has 205 students and there are 125 students in the Rydal School, the value of the free scholarships amount to a sum equal to about 10% of the total fees paid by the students. An institution whose free patrons number only about 10% of all its patrons cannot be classed as an institution of purely public charity. Furthermore, it is obvious that the scholarships are maintained out of the payments made by the vast majority of the students who pay the full fees charged them. Therefore, these paying students instead of being the beneficiaries of a public charity are really maintaining a private charity to the extent that their fees are used in part to pay for the free scholarships nominally “given” by the School. In other words, 10% of the students are getting something which <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>they do not pay for and 90% of the students are paying for 10% more than they get. If, for example, an hotel would provide free broad and lodging each day to 10% of its patrons it could not properly be classed as an “institution of purely public charity”. A physician who devoted 10% of his professional efforts to indigent patients could not consider himself as purely, i.e., wholly, engaged in public charity.</p>

The Ogontz School was not founded by public or private charity, except to the extent of $162,500.00 (the difference between its assessed valuation in 1929 and the total of its then mortgage debt). This “non-profit corporation” was formed in 1928 for the purpose of taking over the assets of the old business corporation. The latter’s property at that time was encumbered with a $450,000 first mortgage indebtedness. There were also issued bonds of the face value of $150,000, secured by a second mortgage on this property, and these bonds were given to Miss Sutherland, the sole shareholder of the business corporation. She became president of the new corporation at a salary of $20,000 a year until 1936, when the salary was reduced to $8,000 a year. She also received the use of a house and was provided with maintenance. These bonds and $400,-000 of the first mortgage indebtedness have been paid from the School’s profits. An institution which can from its earnings liquidate $550,000 of an indebtedness, with interest, during a period of fifteen years is clearly not being operated as an institution of public charity. Even if it had received <em>all </em>of its real and personal assets as a gift and then had operated on a self-sustaining-basis, the mere fact of its exclusively charitable origin <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>would not make it an institution “endowed and maintained by public or private charity”. If, for example, the owner of an hotel would present it to a friend as a gift, and the friend continued to operate it as an hotel, charging rates that yielded annual profits or even made it self-sustaining, that hotel would not have the character of “an institution operated for purely public charity”. And this would be true even if the proprietor used the profits of the hotel only to enlarge the hotel and to increase its equipment after paying himself a substantial salary for managing it.</p>

A. </em>case, supra, we said: “In all our decisions on this subject there can be discerned as a prerequisite to the taxation exemption of an institution claimed to be benevolent or charitable that it, or the portion of its property, in respect to which exemption is claimed, must possess an eleemosynary characteristic not possessed by institutions or property devoted to private gain or profit. What is ‘given’ must be more nearly gratuitous than for a price which impresses one as being proportionate to the services rendered. There must be facts which justify a finding that the ‘actual use and occupation’ of the premises is primarily for the designated charitable object and not largely for commercial purposes.” We also said: “A judicial desire to be liberal toward institutions which are doing praiseworthy public work has sometimes led the courts to invest the word ‘charity,’ as used in the above excerpt from the Constitution, with a meaning not warranted either lexicologically or by a consideration of the ideology of the constitutional provision invoked. Webster’s New International Dictionary, 2d edition, defines a ‘charity’ (in the institutional sense) as ‘an organization or institution engaged in the free assistance of the poor, incapacitated, distressed, etc.’ Under this definition the characteristics of an organized charity are: First, whatever it does for others is done free of charge, or at least <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>so nearly free of charge as to make the charges nominal or negligible; second, that those to whom it renders help or services are those who are unable to provide themselves with what the institution provides for them, that is, they are legitimate subjects of charity.”</p>
    <p id="b317-4" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[138,537,1152,809]]]'>We find nothing in this record which indicates that The Ogontz School possesses any eleemosynary characteristic not possessed by other schools devoted to private gain or profit and whose charges are probably no greater than the charges made by this School. Nor do we find that it is an institution engaged (except to an almost inconsequential extent) in the “free assistance of the poor”. With exceptions so negligible as not to be a controlling factor in our decision, what this School does for its students is not done free of charge or so nearly free of charge as to make those charges merely nominal. Certainly the students who pay $1,900 a year for the education and board and lodging they receive at this School cannot (and assuredly do not) regard themselves as objects of charity.</p>

A. </em>case, supra, by saying that “The Ogontz School is not commercial in character and is not operating in competition with any business. It is entirely charitable in nature and its entire property and facilities are used in the forwarding of its charitable purpose.” We cannot accept any of these four assertions. While ordinarily we do not think of schools as “commercial in character”, yet many schools are commercial and to class them as such is no reflection on their usefulness. Any institution which sells food and lodging and instruction for what those things are worth or for a little more than they are worth is engaged in a commercial enterprise. West Point Military Academy is not a commercial institution. Its students pay no fees. Public schools are not commercial; they charge no tuition fees. There are also many schools and col<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>leges which were created by charitable gifts and are so richly endowed that the fees charged the students pay for only a small part of the instruction and training the students receive. Girard College is an institution of purely public charity; its students pay no fees. But there are hundreds of excellent schools and colleges in this country which derive a profit from the fees paid by the students they educate. These schools and colleges are not supported by the state or nation and they are not richly endowed, if endowed at all. Those who own or manage these institutions expect to show a financial surplus at the end of the fiscal year. Those which fail to make money and merely “break even” are still in no sense institutions of public charity any more than an hotel would be which at the end of the year showed no profits made, or even showed a loss. Even if these schools and colleges only make enough money to maintain the buildings and to pay the operating costs, including the salaries of the teachers, and reasonable compensation to the owner-manager of the institution, they are nevertheless not institutions of purely public charity.</p>

It has paid off since 1928 a debt of $550,000. It is also pertinent to note that the president of the school received a salary from 1929 to 1936 (seven “depression years”) of $20,000 a year, plus a home and her maintenance. This is obviously a very large salary for the head of a school of 200 students and a “grade school” of 100 students. Any individual who organizes a small school and charges its students sufficient fees to pay during a period of 15 years a $550,000 debt on its buildings and grounds (almost 80% of its now assessed value) and also sufficient to pay all the operating expenses and to pay himself or herself a salary of practically $25,000 a year for seven years cannot successfully contend that he or she is <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>operating an “institution of purely public charity” and maintaining it “by public or private charity”.</p>

The Ogontz School is certainly in competition with other schools charging similar fees for similar services.. The third statement quoted, that “The Ogontz School is entirely charitable in nature” is clearly not in accord with the facts. The students who pay $1900 a year for board, lodging and tuition have no reason to feel that they are the beneficiaries of charity. Neither can we accept the statement that the school’s “entire property and facilities are used in the forwarding of its charitable purpose”. The School’s purpose is not charitable; it is to provide an education and room and board for its students at a price sufficient to pay for those things and to create a reasonable surplus to take care of the depreciation of the buildings and to pay for desirable additions to. the plant and its equipment. The fact that , a corporation declares no dividends does not make it a charitable institution. If in 1928 Miss Sutherland had purchased a valuable building to be used as a school in which she was to be the only teacher, and if the fees she charged her students were sufficient to liquidate 80% of the purchase price of this building in 15 years, .and to-pay herself a salary of $20,000 a year for seven years, and $8,000 a year for the remainder of the depression period, and during the entire period, to provide her with a home and maintenance, it could not be correctly said that she was operating a school for “purely public charity”.</p>

On these lots were two three-story brick buildings used for school purposes. The property was owned by an ancient corporation, which received grants from William Penn. The grants defined the object of them to be “the establishment and maintenance of a* public school, wherein the children of the rich might be educated at reasonable rates, and the poor gratuitously; the school to be under the care and management of a board of overseers”. The school was operated for about 170 years when in 1874 “it had run down to very few pupils”. In 1874 the overseers made a contract with B. M. Jones as head master, which stipulated that the corporation <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>would furnish the buildings, furniture, school apparatus, fuel and repairs, while it should receive one-eighth of the gross receipts for tuition, including in the estimate the tuition fees of such poor children as were educated gratuitously, at the expense of the corporation; Professor Jones to receive seven-eights of all the receipts, and pay thereout the salaries of all subordinate teachers. It was further guaranteed that the Professor’s compensation should not be less than $2,000 annually. The school’s annual income from bequests and legacies was about $3,800 a year. Under the management of Professor Jones the school “enjoyed almost phenomenal prosperity”. In 1891 there were 300 students, 15 of them paid nothing, and the others paid a total of $48,606.35. Master Jones’ portion of the receipts for that year were $12,633.55, and the balance in favor of the overseers was $2,406.24.</p>

But by the new method, was there any promotion of the charity element which was one of the two objects of the founder? When master Jones in 1874 first took charge there were 17 boys in the school; there are now 360; but the number of free scholars was, in some years, less than the original 17 . . . the income has increased about one thousand per cent, the free scholars not thirty per cent. Success has not been in the line of the charity, but in the building up of a live, efficient school for those able to pay. It seems to us this school is a business enterprise; that the benefit from its success is largely gathered from those whom the founder termed the ‘rich,’ and by the head master, Mr. Jones . . . this institution is not conducted solely for the benefit of the public, any more than is the street passenger railway conducted for the benefit of the public; those of the public who can pay can ride; here, those of the public who can pay tuition fees are benefited by an education, just as they might be benefited <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>in many other excellent private schools in Philadelphia, where exemption from taxation is not thought of. Nor is this institution without an element of private gain; we doubt, if there be anywhere else in the land, in a school of like grade, an educator in receipt of a salary equal to the one thousand dollars per month received in 1891 by master Jones, as his share of the profits in this enterprise—for this last is clearly what it is—notwithstanding this share is denominated salary in the argument, . . . This is a business project, wherein the returns from capital and professional acquirements depend on good fortune and good management, just as in other business ventures. Nor does the school relieve the state from taxation. Under authority from the state, the municipality of Philadelphia, by taxation, provides for the education of every, child within its limits, and this burden is in no appreciable degree lightened by the establishment of private schools. The charity had its foundation when no such complete and beneficent system of education as that created by the commonwealth had an existence, or was dreamed of by William Penn. If such a system had been in operation in the small town on the Delaware, in 1708, or if at that time he had had reason to anticipate such an one would be adopted in the future, it is probable his benevolence would have taken some other direction. At this day, when the city raises by taxation and expends sufficient money to educate every child, rich and' <em>poor-y </em>the private school in no sensible degree relieves the public burden; if it be exempted from taxation, the public burden is increased by imposition of the exempted tax upon others who share not in the gain from the private enterprise.” In that case this Court, reversing the court below, denied the claim to a tax exemption.</p>

The Academy had received as a gift from the state the land upon which the school was originally built and appropriations amounting to $2,500. The location of the school had been changed several times, always with some profit to the institution in the sale of the old and purchase of the new site. The annual enrollment at the time of our decision was about 215. The students were admitted upon applications passed upon by the head master. The tuition fee had been increased in recent years, and charges for boarding students ranged from $650 to $1,060 per year, including tuition, room and board; day students paid from $320 to $440 per year. In the four years after 1925, $23,610.54 was awarded as scholarship aid to 155 boys. A number of the students paid their way through school by waiting on tables and doing other work. There was one student who paid nothing at all. In that case Mr. Justice Drew pointed out in his opinion that: “The officers and trustees of the corporation serve entirely without compensation, and its entire revenue, which is derived almost completely from the charges for tuition, etc., is devoted to the operation, maintenance and improvement of the academy. None of the teachers have any interest in the income of the school; they receive salaries comparable to those paid in other schools of the same type. The school has been very well managed, with the result that there has been, exclusive of sinking fund requirements of $7,000 a year, an annual surplus of income over expenses ranging from $4,000 to $17,000 in the last five years. This profit was devoted to paying off a mortgage debt incurred to finance the erection of new buildings, and for the increase of the facilities of the school.” We said in that case that: “Only if defendant is a 'purely public charity,’ can it successfully maintain its claim to exemption: [citing cases]. In this connection 'purely’ must be construed in the popular sense . . . the word <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>means completely, entirely, unqualifiedly: Donohugh’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="86 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1056636" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0306-01">86 Pa. 306</a>; White v.

However, Ave regard this feature of the case of much less importance than the fact that The Ogontz School, like the Harrisburg Academy, is <em>not </em>operated completely, entirely, and unqualifiedly as an institution of public charity. The appellee attempts to distinguish the <em>Harrisburg Academy </em>case from the instant case by reason of the fact that in the <em>Harrisburg Academy </em>case “the profits of the Academy could under its charter be privately distributed”. Whether or not its profits <em>could </em>be so distributed is immaterial for, as we said in our opinion in that case: “. . . its entire revenue, which is derived almost completely from the charges for tuition, etc., is devoted to the operation, maintenance and improvement of the academy.” In the <em>Harrisburg Academy </em>case the opinion concluded with this statement, which is equally applicable here: “There can be no doubt that the defendant academy is a school deserving of the highest commendation, wisely and unselfishly managed by its trustees, but it is equally clear that it is not an institution of purely public charity, and that its property is not exempt from taxation.”</p>

The Court found further that the college’s income “derived from the charge for the education, board, lodging and other care of the students in attendance, from land cultivated, from books, athletic supplies used by the students and from a small endowment fund for several years has exceeded the actual cost of maintenance leaving out of consideration the addition of buildings, . . .

Since the time of the founding and during the history of the institution, large sums of money have been contributed from time to time for relieving the deficiency in its income. In the year 1840, one fund of $30,000. was contributed to pay off the debt of the corporation, and in 1845, owing to the pressure of financial difficulty, the college was closed and was not reopened until 1847, when an additional sum of $50,000 was contributed as a permanent endowment fund, whereby it was able to recommence operations. This fund has been increased by contributions and legacies to $100,000, and is constantly being drawn upon to meet the deficiencies in the ordinary income of the institution. In the year 1873, the sum of $18,000 was raised for the purpose of paying off accumulated deficiencies, and quite a number of smaller subscriptions have been made at different times for the same purpose. Barclay Hall, a building erected át a cost of $80,000 for the purpose of providing dormi<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>tories and study rooms for the students in 1876, was built almost entirely by subscriptions, as the sum of $73,000 was donated for that purpose. During the three years prior to 1884, a subscription of $8,000 per year was made and paid by friends of the college for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of the college, to meet the deficiency in the income, and to reduce the debt of the institution; and in that year a sum of $50,000 was subscribed and nearly all of it paid as a further contribution to liquidate existing debt, caused by deficiencies in the income of the college, and prior to 1894, five friends agreed each to give $3,000 a year for five years, to apply, first, to all the scholarships that were necessary, and second, to apply to other current expenses.” The Master also found that the loss in operating the College in 1892 was $12,000. The Superior Court, affirming the court below, said: “There can, therefore, be no doubt that the foundation and endowment have been by private charity.” It also said: “The sources of maintenance are from unconditional gifts, from special gifts or legacies in trust for specific purposes, and from the fees paid by a part of the students. . . . The holders of scholarships, whole or partial, as found by the master, constitute, probably about one half of the whole attendance at the college.” Since in that case the institution <em>with all its buildings </em>were paid for by charitable gifts, and since at <em>least half </em>of the students paid no fees whatever, and since the other half of the students paid much less than they would have been required to pay had not the college been created and endowed by charitable gifts, it is obvious that the decision in that case presents no precedent for sustaining the claim made in the instant case for exemption from taxation.</p>

Those who establish and conduct an institution may declare that in doing so they do not intend to make a profit from anyone and they may conduct it without pecuniary profit to anyone, and yet it may not be “an institution of purely public charity”. In determining an institution’s status in this respect it must be viewed from the standpoint of the public. Can the public look upon Ogontz School as an institution where each year three hundred students or the vast majority of them can obtain lodging, food and instruction for nothing (as, for example, 1800 orphan boys do at Girard College), or for a charge so far below the value of the things they get that what they get are charitable gifts? The answer is, “No”. The vast majority of those three hundred students who attend The Ogontz School pay not only for all they get, but they pay for more than they get, at least to an extent sufficient to enable the School to provide what is equivalent to free board, lodging and instruction to about 10% of its students.

The Dufur Hospital was started in 1922 and for 20 years was owned and operated by Mrs. Dufur and her husband. After her husband died she transferred the title to the property to a nonprofit corporation, named Dufur Hospital. The transfer included the entire 53-acre tract upon which the hospital was located, subject to the payment of an existing first mortgage of $30,000, and a second mortgage of $110,000 executed by the corporation to Mrs. Dufur and payable in 12 years. She retained the privilege of naming three of the five members of the Board of Directors of the corporation until the second mortgage of $110,000 should be paid. About a year later Mrs. Dufur became the superintendent of the hospital at a salary of $6,000 a year. Twelve months later this was increased to $15,000 a year. She was also paid a total of $17,760 on her second mortgage. She contended that the hospital operated as a charity and that it extended charity to certain patients. This charity consisted of reducing the charges for room and maintenance where certain patients were not able to pay the full amount.</p>

It was originally founded by the Dufurs as a business enterprise and the corporation merely took title thereto. Admittedly the hospital has no endowment since the corporation merely took the paper title to the hospital covered by mortgages to the extent of the total purchase price. . . . This hospital is maintained and operated solely from the charges to patients treated therein for the services rendered to them. The amount charged and received by the hospital has been substantially in excess of the costs of such services including carrying charges, reduction of mortgages, etc. This excess has been referred to as ‘surplus’ by the corporation.”</p>

No such situation exists in the present case.” This distinction is not a valid one. What a person <em>can </em>do with a certain property in the future has no bearing on the question: Is the property <em>now being used purely for purposes of public charity? </em>It is a property’s present use and not its possible future use which either supports or negatives the claim made for its exemption from taxation.

The court below found that this <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>use of the lot was not a necessity to the church and was not exempt from taxation. On appeal this Court said: “The word ‘necessary’ does not import an absolute necessity, but its meaning cannot be broadened so as to comprehend that which is merely desirable. . . . The meaning is limited to a reasonable necessity and contemplates among other matters the inclusion of sufficient ground for entrance and exit and for light and air. . . . The lot later purchased and for which an exemption is now claimed is a large lot located at the rear of the church and at a point where there is the least need for light, air and approach. If such a lot in its entirety is exempt, little limitation will be placed on the amount of land that may be taken over by a church, thereby easting an additional burden on other taxpayers.” Exemption was denied.</p>
