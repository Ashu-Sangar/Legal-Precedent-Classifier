The only suggestion is that the plaintiff, employed by Albert, <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>was loaned to the appellant, in circumstances in which -the appellant- became his employer, and- therefore not liable in this suit.</p>
    <p id="b400-4" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[297,447,1156,1349]]]'>The plaintiff was employed by Frank Albert as a fireman on a steam shovel. Albert sold to the appellant a steam shovel, then at an airport in Clearfield. This sale, as Mr. Newman, appellant’s witness,’ described it, .“was a spot sale—as is, where.is.”. Albert, the seller, was not required to deliver it at destination; the appellant was to get it where it stood at the airport. The shovel was operated by steam afid the appellant had no employes at that point capable of operating it and applied to Albert, the seller; for assistance in loading-the--steam shovel on a truck and trailer. Albert directed the plaintiff as fireman, and a man named Grubb, Who-could operate the steam shovel, to put the shovel on the trailer, meaning that they should get up steam on the shovel and run it up on the trailer. It was therefore "necessary for the plaintiff to fire the boiler and raise steam; when that was done, Grubb drove it up on the trailer. Neither Grubb nor the plaintiff had anything to do with fastening or securing it to the trailer. Whatever was done so to secure it was done by appellant’s employes. After the shovel was loaded, the trailer was moved by appellant’s men from the airport to the public road and was on the way to the railway station where it was to be shippéd, when the fastenings got loóse and the shovel partly fell off the trailer and injured the plaintiff.</p>

    <p id="b401-3" data-blocks='[["BL_401.5",401,[113,369,1155,1410]]]'>The plaintiff testified that he did not agree to become the employe of the appellant, and there is no contradiction of this. He stated that Albert, his employer, had told him to fire-up the shovel but did not tell him that it had been sold; that when “the accident happened, I was just down on my .fire door, opening.it, when I heard something crack . . .” That was work performed in- the line of his duty to Albert when the accident happened. Millard Grubb, the operator of the shovel, said he knew it was sold but he didn’t know to whom. He said, “My orders [received from Albert] was to come over and load the shovel.” His evidence shows that by “loading” he meant driving the shovel up on the trailer which was in charge of appellant’s men. Quick, the plaintiff, testified that during'the loading he “watched the steam and the pressure, to see that the steam and the pressure were up” and that he did not “see who directed Mr.. Grubb in moving the shovel.” The fact is that appellant’s employes guided him in this movement’ of the shovel. The plaintiff summed up his position with the following: “A. I was told to put steam in that shovel, and they didn’t tell me what they was going to do—didn’t tell me they was going' to load it, bút' I would have stayed in to keep the steam up and'would have stayed on until they told me to get off of it, buf nobody told me to get off. Q. Then you fell off? A. That’s right.” '</p>
