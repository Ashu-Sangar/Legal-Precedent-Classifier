Each side had a sidewalk or foot-way 18 feet wide, leaving 64 feet between curbs. Along each curb was a strip 22 feet wide, paved and improved for vehicular traffic; the remaining, or central strip 20 feet wide was <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>occupied by defendant’s railroad consisting of two sets of standard gauge tracks with the usual dummy between them. The tracks of heavy rail were set on ties in ballast; the dummy and the spaces between rails were not paved or otherwise improved; there were no fences or barriers separating the 20 feet occupied by the railroad from the remainder of Washington Avenue. The north side was occupied by dwelling houses; on the south side was a playground.</p>

L. 21. The record does not contain the early corporate history of the railroad nor the terms and conditions, if any, imposed by the District of Southwark on the occupation of Washington Avenue by the railroad company. As these terms and conditions do not appear, the parties are left to a construction of <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>the Acts of Assembly, in accordance with certain general principles, to ascertain the rights and obligations in parties so circumstanced.

L, 353, 361, authorized the Governor to incorporate the Southwark Railroad (a predecessor of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co.), and authorized the railroad “to construct a railroad, of one or more, tracks, from the river Delaware, in the district of Sputhwark, and thence through the county of Philadelphia to Broad and Cedar-streets, in such direction as they shall deem best to connect with the termination of the city rail-road: Provided, That said company shall be, and are hereby empowered, to construct a rail-road from Broad-street, in the county of Philadelphia, to the river Schuylkill.” This authorization was subjected by section 22 to the restriction in section 14. providing, “. . . it shall be the duty of the said company, to construct and keep in repair good and sufficient passages across the. said rail-road, where any public roads shall intersect and cross the same, so that the passage-of carriages, horses, persons and cattle along- the said roads shall not be obstructed; and also when the said rail-road shall- intersect-any farm, to provide and keep in repair a suitable passage for the use of said- farm.”</p>

L. 39, section 14, which provided for the widening of Washington Avenue ivest of Broad Street. The railroad was “authorized to lay a double track of rails on the centre of the said street [subject hoAvever to the duty] to grade the said, [Washington Avenue] . . . for ordinary traveling and use.” Appellants contend that the legislature by not imposing such conditions east of Broad Street (where the accident occurred) in the Act of 1831 had granted exclusive occupancy to the railroad subject only to the.duty to proidde crossings at street intersections. The word “appropriated,” so used was not employed in the technical sense familiar in proceedings to condemn private property for public use: compare the <em>Johnston v. Callery </em>cases, <a href="/pa/173/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="173 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="875867" data-case-paths="/pa/173/0129-01">173 Pa. 129</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=33%20A.%201036" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="33 A. 1036">33 A. 1036</a> (1896), and <a href="/pa/184/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="184 Pa. 146" data-case-ids="987951" data-case-paths="/pa/184/0146-01">184 Pa. 146</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.%2073" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="39 A. 73">39 A. 73</a> (1898).

The extent of the grant to construct and operate a railroad in the existing street is limited by familiar principles to what is expressly granted; nothing in derogation of public user is implied: <em>Com. v.
