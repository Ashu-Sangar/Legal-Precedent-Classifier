He was sentenced to pay the costs of prosecution, a fine of $300.00, and imprisonment in the Western Penitentiary for not less than seven and one-half years and not more than fifteen years. On appeal to the Superior Court the judgment was reversed because of alleged errors in the admission of evidence.</p>

It is not necessary to relate all the unsavory details of the crime charged. The only question before us is whether the court erred in admitting the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Everett Borg, neighbors of the defendant, who were permitted to testify that the defendant “late in October 1946” had exhibited himself in a nude condition and lasciviously to Mrs. Borg. The back porch of the Borg home and of the defendant’s home were about fifty feet apart. Mr. and Mrs. Borg were called to rebut defendant’s denial on cross-examination that he had ever exposed himself <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>without any clothes on to anybody (with possibly one exception, not material here). The evidence was objected to for the reason that “the defendant in this case is not charged with indecent exposure but with rape, and any evidence of this type would only prejudice the jury against him without any material benefit to the Commonwealth.” Mrs. Borg testified: “I was finishing the dishes and went out on the porch to hang up my tea towel when Mr. Kline appeared in the doorway of his house without any clothes. I became frightened and went in the house. I stood behind the door and he immediately went behind his kitchen door. There is a window there which shows that there was somebody back there. I went out on the porch again and the same thing happened again. I called my husband . . .”. When her husband stood in the downstairs window Kline did not make any appearance. Mrs. Borg continued: “I went out on the porch and he [Kline] would appear in the door, I would go in and he would step back and close the screen door. After this went on for an hour I set a trap for him. In our dining room we have Venetian blinds.” She and her husband watched Kline through the blinds. She was asked: “Did he [Kline] go through any actions or movements?” She answered: “It was just bodily motions.” When she was also asked as to his nakedness she said he may have had shoes on but other than that he had no clothes on at all.</p>
    <p id="b459-3" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[157,1749,1147,479]]]'>Mr. Borg testified that he “peeked through the blind” and saw Kline “in front of the screen door completely undressed”. He said he saw Kline in that nude condition for a period of fifteen minutes. The time was at 3:00 o’clock in the afternoon. He said Kline “pushed the screen door completely open against the railing and stood in front of the screen door”. He also testified that after observing Kline for about fifteen minutes he, the witness, “called the police”.</p>

Henry’s Pennsylvania Trial Evidence, Third Edition, Section 30, pages 48 and 49, says it is “a fundamental principle that a prisoner shall not be required to answer for the commission of an offense that is not specially charged against him in the indictment. But if criminal conduct proposed to be proved forms -in any way a link in a chain of circumstances which connects the defendant with the crime charged, it is admissible. In such case, in order that one act may be evidence of another, -there must be some connection between them which may be traced in a general design, purpose or plan of the person doing the act, or which may be shown by such circumstances as necessarily tend to establish that the person who committed one act must have been guilty of the other. ...

He was sentenced to death. On appeal for a new trial it was alleged that there was an error in the trial because it was improper to admit the evidence against defendant that on the morning of the day the two children came to their death he had solicited their two older brothers to commit sodomy.. This Court in finding no error in the admission of that evidence said: “The courts are bound to recognize, particularly in .crimes relating to matters of sex . . . that the mental state of the accused is an important factor; anything which throws;light upon his state of mind just previous to the commission of the offense with which he is charged strongly illuminates his place in the picture of, the crime and gives better opportunity to estimate the likelihood of his connection with it. . . . In the instant case, it is the theory of the prosecution that the defendant killed these children as a result of his having debauched or attempted to debauch.them, and,—as showing:the state of his mind, just, prior to his .coming in contact with them, as being such as would lead him to the commission of crime upon them,—it was proper and relevant to show his crime-seeking attitude with other children..

The conviction was reversed because of the inadequacy of the judge’s charge, but in the Superior Court’s opinion Judge, now Justice, Linn said: “In his opinion refusing a new trial, the learned trial judge states that the evidence was received because the offenses were of a substantially similar character, closely connected in point of time, and were parts of a continued scheme or practice.’ If the jury had been so informed, and had also been instructed that the evidence of those two children might aid in identifying appellant as the offender against the other two children, or in disclosing his intention and purpose, appellant’s claim would have no foundation.”</p>

Appellant met her on the steps and invited her to his apartment ostensibly to take down some of her references. She did so. He attempted an assault upon her.

      <p id="b466-5" data-blocks='[["BL_466.5",466,[270,969,1154,855]]]'> It may be argued that a man who commits the crime of murder or arson or larceny or embezzlement has also such an abnormal mental or moral nature as would lead him to commit other crimes of the same kind. But it cannot be said that in every instance where a man commits a crime when motivated by hatred or revenge or cupidity that he exhibits such abnormal behaviour as does a man who commits an unnatural sex crime. A man may commit murder because of an altercation or he may commit arson in order to obtain revenge or he may commit larceny or embezzlement because of hunger or pressure of debt and after committing any of these crimes and paying the penalty therefor he may never repeat the offense. On the other hand, criminal records show that persons inclined to perverted sexual behavior often repeat the offense. Thoinot and Weysse on Medico-Legal Moral Offences, page 250, say that “Lasegue in an epoch-making memoir dated 1877” characterized indecent exposure as a “morbid type of genital aberration”. They say that anyone who indulges in it is a “type of degenerate exhibitionist” and these authors declare that “one of the characteristics of exhibitionism is its <em>repetition”. </em>(The emphasis on the word “repetition” is theirs.)</p>
      <p id="b466-6" data-blocks='[["BL_466.6",466,[268,1837,1148,398]]]'>The difference between the probative value of evidence of the commission of other crimes motivated by hatred or revenge or cupidity and the probative value of evidence of a crime motivated by perverted sexual instincts may be a difference only in degree, but as Justice Holmes said in his dissenting opinion in <em>Haddock v. Haddock, </em><a href="/us/201/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="201 U.S. 562" data-case-ids="344922" data-case-paths="/us/201/0562-01">201 U. S. 562</a>, 631: “I have heard it suggested that the difference is one of degree. I am the last man in the world to quarrel with a distinction simply because it is one of degree. Most distinctions, in my opinion, are of that sort, and are none the worse for it.”</p>
