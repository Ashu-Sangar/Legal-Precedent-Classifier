This tower' supported wires carrying electric power, used for general mining purposes, which was transmitted through heavy steel cables into a borehole leading into one of defendant’s mines. The tower, forty five feet high, was erected on concrete piers which were two feet above ground elevation. The tower is perpendicular and of the usual four column or leg construction type. From a tower approximately 1% to 2 miles distant were strung three bare wires, 5/16 of an inch thick, to the top of the tower involved here. These wires were strung to a set of switches, at the tower top and were then brought down on insulators to a set of disconnecting switches; from this point the power was conducted by cables encased in insulated steel armor through the borehole into the mine. The top switches were mechanically operated and were 47 feet above ground level. The lower switches were operated with a pole and were 15 feet above ground level. The nearest point where uninsulated wires weré accessible was at the lower disconnecting switches, 15 feet above the ground and nine inches to the side of the upright column.</p>

The tower is located alongside the tracks of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and between those tracks and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, about 1100 feet from Front Street in Warrior Run Borough. Warrior Run and Sugar Notch boroughs are approximately a mile apart on opposite sides of the railroad tracks, so that these tracks must be and were traversed in traveling back and forth.</p>

Richards, a contractor and builder, whereby Richards agreed to perform construction work about the tower. A portion of the then existing fence was to be removed, a new and larger fence erected and new concrete foundations were to be constructed for transformers. The company agreed to furnish “all new fence material required.” On Thursday, August 8, 1946, this work was completed except for some minor work not pertinent here. The gate was ready to be locked and at about 1 P.M. Richards’ foreman, John Rudowski, informed Robert Smith, construction inspector for the coal company, that the fence was completed. Frank Nagorski, one of Richards’ employes, saw Robert Smith at about noon on August 8th and “. . . told him the fence was ready and the gates were ready for the lock.” On August 8th Rudowski made a routine inspection of the tower and saw the work was complete; as a “precaution” he “picked up a couple of strands of [soft steel] wire and . . . fastened the gates” by twisting the wire about 6 times with his hands. William B. Richards, on August 8,1946, inspected the work after it was completed. He also informed the construction inspector, Smith, that the fence was completed. The coal company’s construction inspector testified that the coal company was to furnish the lock but failed to do so.</p>

No further visits to the tower were made by any of defendant’s employes until after the accident.</p>

Frostbutter and Joseph Jablonski, visited the land adjacent to the tower to pick apples from an apple tree nineteen and a half feet from the tower. The gate of the fence around the tower was open and all four of the boys went in the enclosure and all of them climbed the leg of the tower closest to the gate. On the leg of the tower there were iron studs which ran from the bottom of the tower to the top. These “steps” were ordinarily used by linemen in ascending the column. The boys played around the tower several days a week to almost every day for years and they had always seen the gate locked before. Some of the boys thought the power was shut off because the gate was left wide open. The plaintiff did not know that the tower was dangerous.</p>

The boys stopped by a nearby well, ate apples from the apple tree and then went to the tower. The plaintiff entered the tower enclosure through the gate which was still open and twice climbed up the leg of the tower on the 5 inch iron bolts which protruded from the sides of the column. After he climbed the tower the first time (about 15 feet) he waved a toy cap gun at his companions and said, “Bang, bang, I shot youz all.” He climbed the tower a second time about ten to twelve feet, <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>came in contact with the electric current at about 15 feet and fell to the ground. Several adults were called and assisted in taking plaintiff to the Nanticoke State Hospital. They found the gate open and no evidence of any lock or wire securing the gate. There is no evidence as to how the gate was opened between August 9th and August 12th, but the boys did not open the gate or remove the wire.</p>

The residents also used the Central Railroad tracks, which passed within a few feet of the tower, to and from school and church. For about ten years prior to the date of the accident children of the Borough were in the habit of going to the company’s land near the tower to pick apples and grapes, drink from a nearby spring (96 feet away) play cops and robbers, cowboys and indians, baseball and other games. The Borough playground was not open and in use in the summer of 1946. Grade schools were closed during the summer months.</p>

For years without objective disapproval children had played games within 20 to 400 feet of the tower; for years adults and children alike had used pathways carrying them past and within a few feet of the tower. In view of the overwhelming character of the testimony the jury could reasonably infer that the defendant coal company, through its agents, actually knew that children played in the vicinity of its tower. “Toleration of trespass for sufficient time gives rise to privilege which adds to the duties of the occupier in the maintenance and use of his premises”: <em>Hogan et al. v.

The jury found that oyer a period of more than four days, from August 8 to August 12, the defendant had taken no steps to exclude foreseeable trespassing children from the tower. It permitted two thin strands of twisted wire to bar access to a condition which the company should certainly have realized involved a serious risk of death or bodily harm to a child. The company’s construction inspector was informed by three persons that the gate was “ready for a lock.” He visited the tower, and saw the manner in which the gates were “secured,” but took no steps to have them locked. Whether, under the circumstances, this was negligence, the failure to exercise ordinary care, was for the jury. <em>Altenbach et ux. v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., </em>supra. Having failed to exercise ordinary care in securing the gate, it <em>was </em>foreseeable that children would be attracted to the tower innocent of its dangerous nature or under the misapprehension that the power was turned off.

The error in this contention is that it assumes that there would be no liability for maintaining its tower unguarded; in the circumstances that is incorrect. The modern rule, applicable in such circumstances, limits unrestricted use of land in the interest of safeguarding children from the danger of serious injury. So long as defendant can be charged with the duty to anticipate trespassing children, that they will accept the invitation to enter the enclosure and climb the tower it cannot remain passive. The absence of notice of the open gate, if it be assumed, is immaterial; the negligent act was one of omission, failing so to secure the gate that it would not be opened. It was the defendant’s duty to take reasonable precautions to prevent children from having access to its tower and coming into contact with its manifestly dangerous property. Compare <em>Costanza v. Pittsburgh Coal Co., </em><a href="/pa/276/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="276 Pa. 90" data-case-ids="1077655" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0090-01">276 Pa. 90</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20A.%20819" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="119 A. 819">119 A. 819</a> (1923).

The defendant avoided liability so long as it exercised ordinary care, knowingly or unknowingly. When defendant failed to continue hitherto observed precautions it breached its duty to foreseeable minor plaintiffs likely to be attracted to the dangerous instrumentality which it maintained.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[294,572,1153,1329]]]'>There is no rule which requires that the dangerous condition must be on the ground or within reach of a minor. Such a distinction is artificial, without logic or experience to support it. What this distinction really drives at is the question of whether or not a defendant shall be held reasonably to anticipate that a child will bring himself within the orbit of the danger. The plaintiff’s hand came into contact with the wire approximately 15 feet above the ground; from this it is to be inferred that he climbed about 10 to 12 feet. The act of climbing was not unusual, on previous days other boys had done precisely the same thing. The tower was equipped with pegs or studs intended to facilitate climbing. These pegs were accessible from the ground. It is strange that defendant would argue that he could not anticipate the use of these pegs for precisely the purpose for which they were put there. Judge Pinola, writing for the court below, observed: “From the photograph, as confirmed by our view of the premises, it is quite apparent that any eight-year-old child can climb the tower by stepping-first on the pier, then a foot higher to the horizontal bar which is flat, then to the flat side of the right angle crossbar, then to the flat side of the left angle crossbar, and then to the first step on the column. Exactly the same situation prevails at the other column.</p>

We did measure the concrete pier in defendant’s Exhibit 4A and it happens to be as high as the distance is between two steps on the same side of the column. If the concrete is two feet high, then the distance between the two steps is two feet and the distance between any step and the <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>intervening step on the opposite side of the column must be twelve inches. Counting steps on one side of the column from the top down, there would seem to be about 38 spaces between the alternate steps, and figuring from that standpoint it would seem that there would be about 14 inches between steps. By either process, the distance is found to be such that any child would be able to negotiate the steps.”</p>

That this is true is positively shown in this case by the testimony of five boys, companions of minor plaintiff and all about his age, who stated that they knew defendant’s tower was an electric one and that they were aware of the dangers of electricity.</p>

It is quite possible that he could not distinguish between telephone and electric wires. However, he cannot thus justify deliberately placing himself in close proximity, and in coming into contact with the wires, knowing there was a strong probability of great danger and serious injury. He made the risk and he tested it. Even an adult may have difficulty in recognizing the difference between telephone and electric wires, but when a person, adult or child, realizes that there is a strong likelihood of peril, he may not be heard to assert his doubts as a denial of knowledge of danger.</p>
