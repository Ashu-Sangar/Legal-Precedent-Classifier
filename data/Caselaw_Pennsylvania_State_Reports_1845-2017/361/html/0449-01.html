L. 543; 69 PS, 42 which provides as follows: <em>“A contract to sell or a sale of any goods </em>. . . <em>shall not be enforceable by action unless </em>. . . <em>some note or memorandum in writing of the contract or sale be signed by the party to be charged. </em>.

This action in assumpsit was instituted for breach of contract. In their complaint, plaintiffs rely upon one letter and two telegrams to bring themselves within the requirements of the <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>Statute. One is a telegram dated June 2, 1947, sent-by the <em>plaintiffs </em>to defendant, which reads: “Your-Mr. Parker did not call today. Please enter our order as per our conversation. We sell you approximately 85 tons primers at 14½¢ shipping. We to- take back like amount of rod at your <em>current carload price </em>delivered our plant. (Plaintiffs)” (emphasis supplied). A letter dated June 13, 1947, sent by <em>plaintiffs </em>to defendant reads: “This will confirm the arrangement we made with your Mr. Lewis whereby we are to ship you approximately 170,000 pounds of primers -for which your company is to pay us 14%^ per pound shipping point, and we in turn are to receive from you a like amount of brass rod free machining <em>at the distributor’s price delivered. . . . </em>Yours very truly, (Plaintiffs).” (emphasis supplied). On June 16, 1947, <em>defendant </em>sent plaintiffs the following telegram: “Railroad report car scrap arrived this morning we cannot accept car until complete details and order for brass rod have been received by sales department. (Defendant).”</p>

The first two papers are-merely statements by <em>plaintiffs </em>—not by <em>defendant.- </em>Even if an undisclosed but actual relation was orally proven to have existed between the three papers, nevertheless the writings themselves do not <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>establish that <em>defendant </em>signed any note or memorandum evidencing the existence of an oral agreement.</p>
