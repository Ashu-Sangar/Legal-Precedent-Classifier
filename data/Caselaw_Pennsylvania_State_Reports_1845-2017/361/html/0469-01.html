In so doing the Court quoted the following from <em>Wilson v. School District of Philadelphia, </em><a href="/pa/328/0225-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="328 Pa. 225" data-case-ids="1179655" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0225-01">328 Pa. 225</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2090" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="195 A. 90">195 A. 90</a>, as follows: “The courts are in no position to exercise control over schools and determine the policy of school administration; the judges ordinarily are not equipped for this immense task. The divergent views of the modern educational trends, the different systems advanced for the education of children, the number of students that should be placed in each class so that the advantages of individual attention and instruction might be had, the different grades of instruction based upon mental aptitudes of students,—all these present serious questions which the school board alone can determine, and the employment of an indefinite number of additional instructors would be in their keeping. One factor alone, that of vocational training, with all the expensive equipment accompanying it, necessitates a large number of teachers. All this-, being purely administrative, must be left to persons of experience who have made a life study of it, and certainly is not to be subjected to the consideration of jurists who have little or no training to appraise school system’s or their necessities. It need not be stated that the salaries of teachers and staff members should be adequately provided for, and this comprises one of the most expensive items of maintenance. ... It was emphasized in Hibbs v. Arensberg, <a href="/pa/276/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="276 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1077542" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0024-01">276 Pa. 24</a>, that the exercise of discretion by the school authorities will be interfered with only when there is a clear abuse of it, and the'burden of showing such an abuse is a heavy one. In those few instances where the court has interfered with' the administrative power of school boards, the interference was based on the school boards’ manifestly illegal action in violating the express words of statutes defining their powers or on <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>facts clearly indicating bad faith and violation of their public duty. See Bender v. School Directors, <a href="/pa/182/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="182 Pa. 251" data-case-ids="893359" data-case-paths="/pa/182/0251-01">182 Pa. 251</a>; Lamb v.

It would be presumptuous to superimpose judicial control upon the exercise of discretion by trained educators. The legislature has vested wide powers in the Board of school directors under the Act of May 18, 1911, P. L. 309, sec. 1608, 24 PS 1552; sec. 2222, 24 PS 1992; sec. 1414, 24 PS 1421, with respect to the very matters which are now in issue. Our appellate courts repeatedly have affirmed their exercise of this discretion. Day v. Amwell Township School District, <a href="/pa/283/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="283 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1090503" data-case-paths="/pa/283/0248-01">283 Pa. 248</a>; Hibbs v. Arensberg, <a href="/pa/276/0024-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="276 Pa. 24" data-case-ids="1077542" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0024-01">276 Pa. 24</a>; Lamb v.

In the latter case, judicial interference was confined to those cases where it was ‘apparent that it is not discretion that is being exercised but arbitrary will or caprice.’ Finally, it is our opinion that as a taxpayers’ Bill, the plaintiffs have neglected fatally to allege an actual or threatened pecuniary loss. There are conclusions of waste, but no allegations of fact in support thereof. We cannot comprehend how the plaintiffs will suffer pecuniary loss based upon the continuation of an educational policy or philosophy with which they are not in agreement. The Bill discloses no wrongful expenditure of money or wasting of assets: Schlanger v. West Berwick Borough, <a href="/pa/261/0605-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="261 Pa. 605" data-case-ids="1042273" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0605-01">261 Pa. 605</a>, 608, and the mere fact that there is not universal agreement upon a controversial subject <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>such as education does not give to every taxpayer the right to maintain a Bill to force the adoption of his policies and philosophies.”</p>
