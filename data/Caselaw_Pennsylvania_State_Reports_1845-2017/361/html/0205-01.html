By his will he directed his executors to pay all his debts and funeral expenses, made a number of pecuniary bequests and a specific one. By the fourteenth item of the will he disposed of his residuary estate as follows: “All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal and mixed of whatsoever nature and kind and wheresoever situate I give, devise and bequeath . . . [65% in equal shares to a named sister and her two named sons and the remainder or 35% in equal shares to another named sister and a named nephew]. . . .” There were cross remainders unnecessary to recite. All beneficiaries except appellee are residents of Greece. A bank and two individuals were named executors. The executors were authorized to sell real estate. This provision reads as follows: “. . . I authorize and empower (the executors) and the survivors or survivor of them as such to sell at any time any real estate which may at the time form part of my estate for such prices, upon such terms in such way and manner and for such interests and estates as may be deemed wise and to make good deeds therefor, to the purchasers thereof, without any <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>obligation on the latter to see to or be responsible for the application of the purchase money.”</p>
    <p id="b229-4" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[134,379,1150,262]]]'>The personal property was appraised at $24,481.02. Debts of the decedent aggregated $48,464.18. In addition the inheritance tax was assessed at $2,923.70 and administration expenses amounted to $2,475.66. The real estate was valued at $55,000.</p>
    <p id="b229-5" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[134,653,1151,473]]]'>In June of 1944 the executors sold and conveyed the real estate in question to appellee, who was a residuary beneficiary. The sale and conveyance was made by the fiduciaries under the power of sale. The consideration was $60,000, found by the court .to have been full, fair and adequate. Having converted the real estate, the executors filed an account of their administration in the orphans’ court which remains unaudited. No definitive decree of distribution has been made.</p>

The residuary provision was <em>not </em>a devise of <em>real estate. </em>The will clearly worked an <em>equitable conversion </em>of the real estate into personalty. True, there was no <em>direction </em>to sell. But there was a <em>discretionary power to sell </em>and there existed a <em>necessity </em>to sell in order to pay debts, taxes and administration expenses. Furthermore, the <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>will indicated a clear intent to create a fund to be distributed <em>as money. </em>This is demonstrated not only by the equitable conversion of the real estate, but by the blending of the real and personal estate coupled with a declaration that the residuary beneficiaries (with one exception) were residents of Greece, thus enabling the fiduciaries to make a distribution as directed in the will. This Court has repeatedly decided that a conversion of real estate into personalty is worked (1) by a positive direction to sell (2) by an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will or (3) by such blending of realty and personalty to show clearly that testator intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath that fund as money: <em>Hunt’s Appeals, </em><a href="/pa/105/0128-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="105 Pa. 128" data-case-ids="454272" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0128-01">105 Pa. 128</a>, 141; <em>Cooper’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/206/0628-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="206 Pa. 628" data-case-ids="931728" data-case-paths="/pa/206/0628-01">206 Pa. 628</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=56%20A.%2067" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="56 A. 67">56 A. 67</a>; <em>Chamberlain’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/257/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="257 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1032414" data-case-paths="/pa/257/0113-01">257 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.%20314" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="101 A. 314">101 A. 314</a>; <em>Brennan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/277/0509-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="277 Pa. 509" data-case-ids="1079527" data-case-paths="/pa/277/0509-01">277 Pa. 509</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20A.%20321" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="121 A. 321">121 A. 321</a>; <em>Chesnut et al. v.
