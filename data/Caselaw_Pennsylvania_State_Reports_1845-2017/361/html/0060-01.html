For a period beginning in 1934 plaintiff was a salesman representative of the Essex Wire Corporation in the eastern district, including New York, Pennsylvania and other states. On October 1, 1941, the parties agreed that, effective November 1, 1941, plaintiff’s compensation would be changed from a commission basis to a fixed salary. Plaintiff alleges that though he agreed to the change, the defendant was obligated to pay him the commissions due on orders placed with the company by him prior to the date of the change, but not filled until subsequent to the change. Defendant refused to pay plaintiff any such commissions or to render an accounting therefor.</p>

John G. Searls, who was then Vice-President and Gen<a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>eral Sales Manager of the defendant company, testified that plaintiff had surrendered his claim to the commissions as part Of an arrangement under which he would receive a salary of $7500.00 per year, and defendant would pay his son a salary of $3600.00 per year. Defendant also assumed the expenses of the plaintiff and his son. Searls wrote the plaintiff a letter confirming the new basis of compensation, but this letter was silent as to the relinquishment by the plaintiff of his right to commissions earned on orders obtained before the effective date of his new basis of compensation.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[268,873,1148,480]]]'>Plaintiff remained in the employ of the defendant corporation until his discharge on July 31, 1944. During this period of time the only man with whom plaintiff ever discussed the question of commissions alleged to be due. was Searls. He declared that Searls during that period had assured him that the commissions which the plaintiff alleged to be due for orders previous to the date referred to would be forthcoming although they were never paid.</p>

Of course, that’s what most of us try to do in the. United States these days. The amount of those commissions' which he earned by getting the orders for which he had not been paid, was a rather substantial sum. We contend that it was as much as $30,000.”. Defendant’s counsel then objected and moved for the withdrawal of a juror. This was denied. Then counsel stated to the jury: “As I was about to say a minute ago, the exact amount of those commissions we are, not in a position to tell you because all of the books and records are in the hands of my friend and his client, and therefore, this suit is in part to ask for what is called an accounting. In other words, you won’t be asked to pass on the amount which Mr. Clark has coming to him, if any, on these commissions. You will just <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>have to say that you think, if you agree with us, that he is entitled to something, and that amount will be determined by a court order directing these Companies -to bring their books in and tell us how much..."</p>
    <p id="b85-3" data-blocks='[["BL_85.4",85,[153,485,1151,1523]]]'>At the trial plaintiff presented Over objection testimony as to the commissions for the years-1938 to-1941 inclusive. The trial judge said to the jury: “What'the plaintiff wants you to do is, uphold-his version of what the contract was and then say by your -verdict that -the defendant should account to him for commissions -on the orders that are in dispute. . . . The plaintiff is asking only for an accounting, . . . This -is perhaps one of a few cases you will run into where, the plaintiff is not asking for a certain amount of money. . . . Your verdict will be simply in favor of the plaintiff or in favor of the defendant.” The jury returned a verdict “for the plaintiff”. The defendant asked for a new trial,-first, because the court “erred in failing to withdraw a juror at the request of the defendant when the attorney for plaintiff mentioned the probable amount of the commissions alleged to be due, in his opening address to the Jury ;” second, the court “erred in admitting into' evidence the -commissions paid the plaintiff in the'years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941”; third, the court erred in charging the jury as follows: “he (plaintiff) introduced evidence of the amount of commissions that lie did’ get through the years of ’38, ’39, ’40, ’41, showing a growth during those years of from $15,000 to-$34,000 in commissions, which would have to be reduced, of course, by the amount of the expenses, of which the only evidence in the case is the statement by Mr. Searls that the expenses were from $7500 to $10,000 a year.”</p>

Carothers v. Pittsburgh Ry Co., <a href="/pa/229/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="229 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="971868" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0558-01">229 Pa. 558</a> <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>(1911) is a sample of this familiar rule. The reason given is that such statements may cause the jury to take counsel’s estimate of the damages in place of the evidence itself. In the instant case, however, the amount of damages was in no way at issue. This was immediately explained by counsel to the jury after defendant’s motion to withdraw a juror had been overruled, and it was again explained by the trial judge in his charge. The sole issue was whether or not defendant should account (Golder v. Rabinowitz, <a href="/pa-super/125/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="125 Pa. Super. 573" data-case-ids="996286" data-case-paths="/pa-super/125/0573-01">125 Pa. Super. Ct. 573</a> (1937)), and whether an accounting would give plaintiff 30¢ or $30,000 or nothing at all was of no moment to the jury. To believe that a jury would be swayed by a remark that everyone in sight told them was irrelevant is to take a negligible view of their minds.” We agree with the court below. It is a well-known maxim that the “law is not concerned with trifles” and we think that the remarks objected to may, under the circumstances of this case, be classed as one of those trifles which do not affect in any way the verdict of the jury. The issue as the court said was whether or not plaintiff was entitled to an accounting. Whether his claim for $30.00 or $30,000 or $30,000,000 would not affect the tribunal’s judgment as to whether or not he was entitled to an accounting at all.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

The rationale behind these cases is that in naming an amount claimed, counsel is making a suggestion to the jury which in their minds takes the place of evidence. This, however, is a case in which a single question was to be answered by the jury—was plaintiff entitled to an <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>accounting from the defendant for moneys allegedly due him? Here there is no need to invoke the rule generally applied in actions for damages as no amount of damages was sought and the jury was not asked to fix the amount of any monetary award.</p>
    <p id="b87-4" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[153,546,1150,593]]]'>This Court has said that the propriety of counsel’s arguments and remarks to the jury is to be determined by the trial court under all the existing facts and circumstances at trial and that an application for the withdrawal of a juror is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the refusal of a motion to that effect, because of objectionable remarks to the jury by counsel, is reviewable for abuse of discretion only: <em>Nalevanko v.

To refresh his recollection he was shown memoranda given annually by defendant to plaintiff, showing annual earnings. When objection was made, the trial judge stated : “I am inclined to. think,, Mr- Comber, that the comparison between commissions , during the commission years and salary plus expenses in the salaried years, might bear upon the . inherent credibility of one story as against another.....
