The two men then drove to Harrisburg; on the way defendant threw into a creek the hammer and a flashlight (these were later found and fished out by the police), and Staley also threw in the key. Later they washed, put on other clothes, and threw Humpert’s pocket-book and the clothes they had worn during the commission of the crime into a creek in Cumberland County. Defendant had the heels of his boots changed by a shoemaker in order to prevent identification of his footprints at the scene of the murder, and he also purchased other tires for his car, throwing the old ones away on a dump.

We refused a <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>change of venue because a strong feeling of revulsion is inevitable when such a crime is committed, especially in a rural community, but here there was nothing to indicate that defendant would be unable to obtain a fair trial, and the event so proved, because the jurors were carefully selected, the trial proceeded with calmness and deliberation, the jury considered the testimony for several hours before they returned a verdict, and there was nothing to show that they were influenced in any way by bias or prejudice. As to the motion for a continuance, it appears that the trial began on the 37th day after the commission of the crime, the 29th day after defendant’s arrest, and about 3 weeks after counsel had been retained; there is no pretense that, because of shortness of time, defendant was unable to produce witnesses who might otherwise have been available, or that his counsel could not make any investigation they desired in preparation for the trial. The granting or the refusal of a petition for a change of venue or for a continuance is largely a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court, and, unless that discretion is abused, which here it was not, its action will not be disturbed: <em>Commonwealth v.

Asked whether he wished to make a voluntary, statement, he said that he did, that he wanted “to get it off my mind”. His answers were taken down stenographically and later transcribed and read at the trial by the stenographer from her transcript. He told in detail of all that had taken place the night of the crime and ended by saying: “I was intoxicated very much at the time this happened. I am not asking for leniency. I want what is coming to me bút I will say if I had .been sober I would not have did it.” . After the .questioning was over the group went to the district attorney’s office where defendant made a concise statement. embodying what he had previously recited; this, statement was taken directly ,on the typewriter as he made it; he read it, signed it, and swore to it before a Justice of the Peace. It was offered in evidence and admitted over the objection of defendant’s counsel.' When, later in the trial, defendant testified, he said that at the time he was .arrested on the morning of April 1 he had not yet had his breakfast and during that entire day when he was confined in the State Police Barracks at. Harrisburg he was without food .and, for part of the time, without drinking water; he stated that he asked, to get in touch with his parents and made a request for a lawyer but was not granted permission ; he further testified that the facts alleged in the statement he. made the-following day were not known .to him personally. but had been suggested to him by Staley who was. confined in, a cell adjoining his at the Police.Barracks,.Staley-.telling him that that was the story which <em>.he </em>had given to the police and .urging him to “try'to-keep our statements alike”. In view of these alleged facts the admission-in evidence of defendant’s -signed- statement is now assigned.as error.. It is to be noted that the stenographer’s transcript of defendant’s answers to the-questions propounded to him had already been admitted without objection and covered everything <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>set forth in the later signed statement which, therefore, really added nothing to the record; furthermore, that the statement was unquestionably true because it was corroborated, partly by the finding of the articles in the creek, partly by the action of defendant in changing the heels of his boots, destroying his automobile tires and throwing away his clothes, partly by the conditions found at the place of the murder, and partly by the testimony of witnesses in regard to defendant’s activities on the day of the murder prior to his departure with Staley for the Humpert farm. Defendant admitted that he was questioned only in the morning of April 1 for a period of 3 to 3% hours; he does not say that he was deliberately denied food and drink upon his requesting it and it was only after he had eaten breakfast the next morning that he was taken to the Humpert farm and there asked the questions which he freely answered; he does not claim that there was any threat made or inducement offered in order to obtain a confession. We do not have, therefore, a case here of protracted confinement, of questioning for an unreasonable period of time or at any unreasonable hour, of parading the accused back and forth to a cell, or any other act of oppression which would justify a claim that he was denied due process of law; the confession which he made was not “the result of torture, physical or psychological”: <em>(United States v.

The trial judge charged the jury that defendant’s confession should be ignored by them if they believed that it was secured by threats, promises, inducements, or any other means which would have been likely to cause him to give an untruthful statement, and they should take it into consideration only if they found, under the evidence, that it had been voluntarily given without fear or intimidation. This was in accord with the rule laid down by this Court in many cases, namely, that where the Commonwealth’s witnesses show that a confession is <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>made voluntarily without such threats or inducements as might secure a false confession, it must he admitted; if afterwards the defendant testifies, or produces other witnesses who testify, that it was <em>not </em>voluntarily made, it becomes a question for the jury, who must be instructed that, if they find the confession was not voluntarily made, they must wholly disregard it: <em>Commonwealth v.

The objection of defendant’s counsel was based upon the fact that in both cases sentence had been suspended and defendant placed on probation; therefore reliance is placed upon the technical proposition that, to constitute an admissible record of a conviction, there must be not only a verdict and judgment of guilt but also the imposition of a sentence. This indicates a complete misapprehension of the purpose for which the jury is to receive information of other offenses committed by the defendant on tidal, namely, that they should be able intelligently to fix the penalty, and, to that end, that they ought to know what manner of man it is upon whom <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>they are being asked to impose sentence,—his criminal proclivities, his demonstrated attitude toward law and order, and,- on the other hand, such mitigating factors as may exist in the nature of impaired health, mental deficiencies, state of intoxication, or other circumstances. Accordingly it has never been held that a defendant’s commission of other crimes can be shown only by official records; on the contrary, proof thereof has been received in the shape of oral statements or written confessions made by defendant <em>(Commonwealth v.

It is clear, therefore, that the admission inherent in a voluntary plea of guilty is not only proper evidence but perhaps the best evidence for the purpose intended, since it is a confession made in formal manner and, when accepted and entered by the court, is a conclusive determination of guilt and the equivalent of a conviction: 14 Am. Jur. 952, §272; <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em><a href="/us/274/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="274 U.S. 220" data-case-ids="81134" data-case-paths="/us/274/0220-01">274 U. S. 220</a>, 223. It follows that such a plea would be evidential as an admission even if it had not been acted upon by the court at all. For these reasons, as well as to contradict testimony of defendant in which he had attempted to minimize his participation in the previous robberies, it was proper for the court to allow the Commonwealth in rebuttal to place in evidence a written confession'which he had made shortly after their occurrence stating the facts in regard to the two offenses as to which he had pleaded guilty and another one of the same nature committed at or about the same time.

There was nothing objectionable in this because it is not conceivable that defendant was prejudiced thereby. As the court below said in its opinion refusing a new trial: “He [Staley] was not handcuffed and there was nothing to indicate that he was in custody or, in fact, to indicate that he was other than a spectator.” In <em>Commonwealth v.

One of them is to the court’s refusal to charge that if the jury found that defendant’s intoxication was. so great as to Fender it <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>impossible for Mm to form a wilful, deliberate and premeditated intent to take the life of deceased the grade of the homicide would be reduced to murder in the second degree. So to have charged would obviously have been error for the case was not one in which the Commonwealth was obliged to prove a specific intent on the part of defendant to commit murder. Intoxication is not a defence to relieve a defendant from responsibility for crime except that in some cases of felonious homicide, if it so clouds the intellect as to deprive it of the power of deliberation or premeditation, it may serve to reduce the crime of murder from first to second degree. Where, however, a murder is committed in the perpetration of a robbery or a burglary it is, irrespective of any question of intent, murder in the first degree, and therefore the fact that this defendant may have been drinking to excess was of no legal significance as bearing upon the degree of his crime: <em>Commonwealth v. Wooding, </em><a href="/pa/355/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="355 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="468896" data-case-paths="/pa/355/0555-01">355 Pa. 555</a>, 557, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20A.2d%20328" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="50 A.2d 328">50 A. 2d 328</a>, 329. The court instructed the jury that if defendant intended merely to steal, to commit larceny, it would not be sufficient to support the charge of first degree murder, but the evidence here showed more than a larcency; there was both a robbery and a burglary. It is true, as defendant argues, that the question of intoxication was important in connection with the determination of the penalty, and it is said that the court should have stressed this phase of the matter to the jury, but the element of intoxication and all other possibly mitigating circumstances were covered by the court’s statement in its charge, several times repeated, that the jury were to determine the penalty only as the result of a full consideration of <em>all </em>the facts and circumstances disclosed by the testimony and <em>all </em>the information brought out about him at the trial; this would include his mental capacity and his state of intoxication as tending to prove a condition of diminished responsibility; it was not necessary for the trial judge to <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>discuss in detail each of the factors, pro and con, that would properly enter into their consideration of the penalty to be imposed: <em>Commonwealth v.

On the contrary, the charge was extremely fair, temperate, and judicial in tone, and this in spite of the revolting nature of the crime and the implausibility of the defence presented. The sentence in the charge to which counsel especially objects is this: “I might say to you that in this case the Court cannot see how you can fail to find a verdict of murder in the first degree.” Admittedly, this was a strong statement on the part of the trial judge. It is to be noted, however, in the first place, that since, from defendant’s confession and the uncontradicted evidence in the case, there could be no real doubt but that he had murdered Humpert, the court was amply justified in expressing a vigorous opinion. In the second place, as will appear from the paragraph hereinafter quoted in which this sentence appeared, the court’s meaning obviously was that <em>if </em>defendant was guilty of murder the jury could hardly fail to find a verdict of murder <em>in the first degree </em>since it was committed in the course of a robbery and burglary. In the third place, the objection loses all force when the sentence in question is read in connection with what immediately preceded and followed it and which emphasized that the responsibility of decision was solely that of the jury. What the trial judge said, in its entirety, was this: “And again <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>I want to say this, that it is the power and responsibility and the duty of the jury in all cases of this type to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant and if they determine that the defendant is guilty of murder to determine the degree of that murder. Anything that I have said in my charge has not been meant to take away from you, or to interfere with you in any way in the performance of that duty. I have said to you several times that if you find certain facts that would illustrate or be certain things—I said that simply for the purpose of illustration. You still have the power and the duty to determine the facts; to determine whether the defendant is guilty of murder or not guilty of murder and if guilty to determine in what degree. I might say to you that in this case the court cannot see how you can fail to find a verdict of murder in the first degree. Again I say to you that in stating that opinion of the court’s thought I again do not mean to take away from you in any way your function, your power, or your responsibility of finding the guilt or innocence of the defendant and the degree of that guilt if you find him guilty of murder. But that is the court’s own thought.” Previously in the charge the court had said: “You understand from that section of the statute that I read to you that in case you find the defendant guilty of murder, it is your duty and yours alone to fix the degree of the murder. Nothing that the Court may hereafter say should be understood by you as intended in any way to relieve you of that responsibility or to interfere with you in the exercise of that responsibility. That is a function solely of the jury and you have the right and the power under the law to determine not only the guilt or innocence of the defendant on the charge of murder but also to find in your verdict the degree of that offense.” Near the end of his charge the trial judge repeated once more the same admonition: “The first thing I want to again call to your attention—I expressed an opinion on the matter <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>of your verdict. When I expressed it I told you that that was not binding on you in any respect whatever and was not meant to interfere in any way with your verdict. You have the duty, the power and the responsibility in this case of finding the defendant guilty or not guilty of murder. If you find him guilty of murder of the first degree of fixing the penalty. Now the Court expressed the opinion of the Court and it is not binding on you in any respect whatsoever.” And, finally, the court told the jury explicitly that “You have a choice of four verdicts. Not guilty; guilty of murder in the second degree; guilty of murder in the first degree with life imprisonment; guilty of murder in the first degree with the death penalty; and you could return your verdict accordingly.” Then, addressing counsel, the court asked: “Does that cover the balance of the situation?” to which both attorneys indicated that it did.</p>

The only limitation of the right is that <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>there must be reasonable ground for his statement and that it is not made as a binding direction but leaves the jury free to act.” In <em>Commonwealth v.

Moyer, </em><a href="/pa/357/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="84" data-cite="357 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="472087" data-case-paths="/pa/357/0181-01">357 Pa. 181</a>, 187, 188, <a href="/citations/?q=53%20A.2d%20736" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="53 A.2d 736">53 A. 2d 736</a>, 740, which represents perhaps the most extreme illustration of a vigorous expression of opinion by a trial judge which was upheld by this Court, the judge said in his charge: “I understand counsel here asked for acquittal, . . . but that is entirely a matter for you, you will reach a verdict and it is your verdict but we do not know why the question was ever propounded to you at all, why they [the two defendants] should be acquitted. . . .; under the evidence in the case, we will not submit that to you at all.” And later he added: “We have told you that you have authority to say whether this was murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree or voluntary manslaughter, but we cannot conscientiously say to you that we agree with any suggestion made by counsel for the defendants that the men ought to be set free on the charges preferred against them. However, we are leaving the matter entirely to you. We are expressing our opinion, and you will not <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>be influenced by anything we will say, but we are quite sure you look to the judge for guidance . . . but we cannot acquiesce in conscience with the suggestion that these men should be acquitted. They are charged with this offense; the matter is entirely with you, and you are free to do as you please.” This Court affirmed verdicts of guilty with the death penalty for both defendants.</p>
    <p id="b432-4" data-blocks='[["BL_432.4",432,[282,662,1147,371]]]'>In the present case the learned trial judge told the jury many times, and in clear and impressive language, that they were not bound by any expression of opinion on his part but that the power, the duty, and the responsibility of decision lay solely with them; therefore, under all the authorities, it is clear that he complied with all the requirements in that regard.</p>
    <p id="b432-5" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[281,1044,1147,251]]]'>The evidence in this case amply justified the jury in returning a verdict of murder in the first degree. As far as the imposition of the death penalty is concerned, this Court, as already stated, is not the tribunal to review that decision.</p>
    <p id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[350,1316,675,42]]]'>Judgment and sentence affirmed.</p>
