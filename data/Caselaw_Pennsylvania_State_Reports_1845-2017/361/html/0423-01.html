    <p id="b447-3" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[124,361,1158,1793]]]'>The insured was Francis J. Christ, a young man just under the age of 21 years. His parents had died when he was ten years old and he was then taken into the home of his grandmother, Margaret Ehrlich; he stayed there for seven years until September, 1942, at which time he went to live with John and Anna Christ; John Christ was his uncle and Anna Christ was John’s second Life. He remained with them until October, 1943 when he enlisted in the Navy; he returned to them again after his release from the service and then stayed at their home from March 15, 1946 to January 4, 1947. On the latter date, being about to be married, he went back to live with his grandmother who offered a home to him and his prospective wife, but only four days later, on January 8, 1947, he was killed in a mine accident. On December 13, 1943 he had obtained a National Service Life Insurance Certificate of $10,000 in which he had named his grandmother as beneficiary, stating that she stood to him “in loco parentis”, but on. April 12, 1946, while living with his uncle and aunt, he obtained from the Prudential Insurance Company of America, to replace the government certificate, the policy involved in the present litgation. This policy was in the amount of $5,000 but with double indemnity in the case of accidental death, and he named therein as beneficiary Anna Christ, if living, otherwise John Christ; he designated Anna Christ as “mother” and John Christ as “father”. Anna Christ brought suit on the policy but, as the proceeds were also claimed by the Peoples First National Bank &amp; Trust Company, administrator of the estate of Francis J. Christ, the insurance company caused inter-pleader proceedings to be instituted and paid into court the $10,000 due on the policy.</p>

But the réál controversy raged around two questions: (1) Did Mrs. Christ stand, as she claimed, “in loco parentis” to the insured? and (2) Who paid the premiums oh the policy? These, of course, were factfial issties. The applicable law is clear. A person may take out a policy of insurance on his own life and name as beneficiary whomsoever he pleases, regardless of whether or not such beneficiary has an insurable interest, but a beneficiary cannot take out a valid and enforceable policy for his own benefit, and pay the premiums thereon, on a life in which he has no insurable interest: <em>Werenzinski v.

On the other hand, Mrs. Christ produced, evidence to the effect that the insured had been in the habit of visiting' their home ever since he was a young lad; that while in the service, he wrote to her hundreds of endearing letters, in nearly, all. of them addressing her as “Mom” or “Mother”-; that he stayed with them whenever he was off on furloughs; that he was always regarded as. one of the family and treated the same as their own son who was a lad of about the same <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>age and an intimate companion of the insured. The agent of the insurance company testified that at the time the insured applied for the policy he said that Mrs. Christ was “one of the best mothers I ever had and I want her down as beneficiary”. In regard to the issue concerning the payment of the premiums the agent testified that the first one was paid by the insured; Mrs. Christ testified that it was paid by Mrs. Ehrlich. The remaining premiums, two in number, were paid to the company by Mrs. Christ, but she testified that she received the money for that purpose from the insured and turned it over to the agent in the same envelopes in which she received it. One of plaintiff’s witnesses testified that Mrs. Christ admitted to her at the time of the insured’s funeral that she, Mrs. Christ, “paid the insurance premium”, but whether this was intended to mean that she made the payments out of her own money is not clear.
