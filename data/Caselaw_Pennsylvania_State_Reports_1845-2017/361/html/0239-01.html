Gower, </em>Rep. temp. Finch, 164, (Ch. 1674)). The practice thus born has bécome so generally adopted that it is now a commonplace doctrine in equity jurisprudence, it being firmly established that, where it is not in the power of a vendor to make title to all that he has covenanted to convey, the,vendee has the right to take what the vendor can give with an allowance out of the purchase money for the deficiency: <em>Burk’s Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/75/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="1036747" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0141-01">75 Pa. 141</a>, 145; <em>Andrien v.

    <p id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[139,426,1151,964]]]'>Defendants, Michael and Sarah E. Circelli, entered into a written agreement with plaintiff, Harold Merritz, whereby they agreed to sell and convey to him three certain pieces of vacant ground in Philadelphia as described by metes and bounds. The agreement stated that “description of said lots and plot plan of the same is hereto attached and made part of said agreement.” The plot plan thus referred to showed that the lots were bounded by Elmwood Avenue, Lindbergh Boulevard, 57th Street and 58th Street. In the space marked Elm-wood Avenue there were printed the words “all improvements” and in the space marked 57th Street and the space marked Lindbergh Boulevard the word “sewer”. The purchase price was stated to be $12,500 of which $1,000 was paid at the time the agreement was signed. The premises were to be conveyed “free and clear of all incumbrance and easements”, subject to an exception not here relevant.</p>

He also ascertained that, while there was in fact a sewer in the bed of Lindbergh Boulevard, it could never be used by the occupants of such dwellings because it was constructed along the far or remote side of the boulevard and was intended to service only the properties on that side; the cost to these lots of installing an available sewer in Lindbergh Boulevard would be approximately $8,500.</p>

      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>This brings us to the real question in the case, which is whether, assuming such liability of the vendors to exist, plaintiff is entitled to the remedy which he seeks in the present proceedings. It is not in every instance that specific performance of a contract for the sale of land will be enforced, for an agreement may be perfectly good and binding upon both parties and nevertheless the court may relegate the plaintiff to whatever remedy he may have at law, if, in the exercise of a discretion, not arbitrary or capricious but governed by principles of reason, the chancellor is of opinion that in the particular case before him it would be contrary to equity and justice to decree specific performance.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b265-3" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[134,972,1147,152]]]'>There are two reasons why the equitable remedy of specific performance with an abatement should not be granted under the circumstances of the present case.</p>
    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[135,1136,1151,754]],["BL_266.1",266,[284,270,1148,1461]]]'>(1) The agreement between the parties did not, of course, involve any contractual obligation on the part of defendants to convey title to the Lindbergh Boulevard sewer nor did it contain any warranty in regard thereto; there was merely a misrepresentation of a fact as to the availability of a sewer which lay under the bed of a public street and not within the lines of the lots which were the subject of the agreement of sale. Only in cases where there is a defect in the vendor’s title or a deficiency in the quantity of the land to be conveyed does the doctrine of specific performance with an abatement prevail; where there is merely a claim based upon a representation collateral to the contract the only remedy available to the vendee is rescission or the recovery <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>of damages at law. Thus, where there was an innocent representation by a vendor in regard to the mileage of fencing on the land being sold, such mileage being in fact less than the amount stated, the vendee was refused specific performance with a deduction from the purchase price in respect of this deficiency: <em>Rutherford v. Acton-Adams, </em>[1915] A. C. 866. Where there was an innocent representation as to the area in grass of the land included in the contract of sale, specific performance with an abatement was refused, the court pointing out that this was not a case of defect in title or deficiency in quantity of the land but only a misrepresentation as to its quality: <em>Schmidt and Bellshaw v. Greenwood, 32 </em>N. Z. L. R. 241. Where there was a mistake in regard to the limits of the area covered by a town ordinance imposing building restrictions, the vendee was denied specific performance with an abatement: <em>Millman v. Swan, </em><a href="/va/141/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="141 Va. 312" data-case-ids="4929300" data-case-paths="/va/141/0312-01">141 Va. 312</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20S.E.%20166" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="127 S.E. 166">127 S. E. 166</a>. And where there was an incorrect representation that the rentals of the premises being sold were a certain specified amount, the court, stating that specific performance with an abatement should not be extended to cover defects other than deficiencies in title or in the area of the land to be conveyed, refused to decree specific performance with a deduction in the purchase price: <em>Radel v. 134 West Twenty-fifth Street Building </em>Corporation, <a href="/citations/?q=226%20N.Y.S.%20560" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="226 N.Y.S. 560">226 N.

Thus, where the requested allowance, representing a partial lack of title on the part of the vendors and also the incumbrance of a mortgage on the property, would <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>have exhausted nearly the whole of the purchase money, the chancellor refused, in the early case of <em>Wheatley v. Slade, </em>4 Sim. 126 (Ch. 1830), to decree specific performance with an abatement. And in <em>Rudd v. Lascelles, </em>[1900] 1 Ch. 815, it was stated that equitable relief should be confined to cases where the actual subject-matter was substantially the same as that called for in the contract; in that case the purchase: price was £3500 and the deduction claimed was £1000; the court stated that “It would be a great hardship to enforce the contract against her [the vendor] with so large an abatement . . ., and I cannot assume that she would have sold for such a reduced sum.” See also <em>Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Rwy.
