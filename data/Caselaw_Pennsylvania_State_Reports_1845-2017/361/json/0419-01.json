        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal from a decree of an orphans\u2019 court sustaining an appeal from the probate of a holographic will on the ground that the will was conditional and there had been a failure of condition.\nThe words of the instrument are: \u201cNov 29 Dear Frank if I never se you again I wont you to have everything I own keep this it may be of use to you some day your Father\nJ. H. Morrison.\u201d\nIt was established that the date of the will was November 29, 1919 and that \u201cDear Frank\u201d was testator\u2019s son, Frank A. Morrison, the appellant. The circumstances surrounding the execution are succinctly stated by the hearing judge as follows: \u201c. . . the testator was having grave difficulties with his wife; his only son, home from the army, had gone to North Carolina to work, the letter being written to the son in the south; his only daughter was teaching school in a town near the family home; the son did return within six months; the husband and wife separated shortly thereafter and then entered a formal agreement of separation whereby the wife, in consideration of the conveyance to her of the home, farm and contents released testator and his estate from all demands and he released her; the father and son saw one another constantly during the twenty-seven years after the son\u2019s return.\u201d\nWhether a will is conditional or not depends upon whether the event which constitutes the expressed contingency is construed to have been the occasion for making the will at a particular time or the reason for making it in a particular way. Thus: if the intent of this testator is construed to be (a) that testator desired his son to have the estate because he might never see the son again, the gift would be absolute but if (b) it was only in the event that testator should never see his son again that the son was to take, the testamentary provisions would be conditional and would fail if the parties did see each other before the death: Morrow\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 440, 9 A. 660; Forquer's Estate, 216 Pa. 331, 66 A. 92; Davis\u2019s Estate, 275 Pa. 126, 118 A. 645; Moore\u2019s Estate, 332 Pa. 257, 2 A. 2d 761. And, in seeking such intent, the test, as in any other will construction, is not what the testator may have meant, but the meaning of his words: Rosengarten Estate, 349 Pa. 32, 36 A. 2d 310; Myers Estate, 351 Pa. 472, 41 A. 2d 570; Leopold Estate, 356 Pa. 543, 52 A. 2d 458, considered in connection with the surrounding conditions at the time of the execution of the instrument: Postlethwaite\u2019s Appeal, 68 Pa. 477; McGlathery\u2019s Estate, 311 Pa. 351, 166 A. 886; Prime\u2019s Petition, 335 Pa. 218, 6 A. 2d 530; Jackson\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 561, 12 A. 2d 338; Harris Estate, 351 Pa. 368, 41 A. 2d 715. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in Eaton v. Brown, 193 U. S. 411, said, p. 413: \u201cThe English Courts are especially and wisely careful not to substitute a lively imagination . . .\u201d (italics supplied) for what testator might have said but did not. This Court has rigidly adhered to this rule: Nebinger's Estate, 185 Pa. 399, 39 A. 1049; Ludwick\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 365, 112 A. 543; Jacobs\u2019 Estate, 343 Pa. 387, 22 A. 2d 744. The principle that a construction of one will is no certain guide to the meaning of another (Bechtel, Exr., v. Fetter, 267 Pa. 178, 111 A. 50; Williamson\u2019s Estate, 302 Pa. 462, 153 A. 765; Jackson\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 561, 12 A. 2d 338; Emmerich Estate, 347 Pa. 307, 32 A. 2d 400). has particular-application in determining whether or not a will is conditional.\nThe words in the will in Moore\u2019s Estate, 332 Pa. 257, 2 A. 2d 761, and those in the present case are almost parallel. In Moore\u2019s Estate, they are if any thing Hapins to me Before I come Home. . . ; in the present case they are \u201c. . .' if I never se you again. . . .\u201d In Moore\u2019s Estate, the testatrix wrote the will in contemplation of a trip which she took to Cincinnati; she stayed three weeks, returned to her home and lived twelve years thereafter. This Court, in an unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Linn, construed the reference to the trip as the reason for making, the will at - that time, and held the bequests to be absolute. Construing- the words in the present case;.-it-, is clear .that the possibility of never seeing the son again was - the reason for making the will at that time. -The words \u201ckeep this it may be of use to' you some day\u201d wbuld negative any presumed intention that testator intended the gift to fail if he should see his son again. Under the facts and principles stated in Moore\u2019s Estaite, supra, such construction must prevail unless the meaning of .the words was modified by the proven conditions surrounding the testator.\nThe learned, hearing judge decided that the meaning of the words had been modified by the circumstances. He decided that there Was.a-presumption that testator desired equality; that appellant, the son, \u201cwas clearly on the father\u2019s side\u201d;, whereas, p\u00e9rhaps the deceased daughter \u201ctook her mother\u2019s part and the'testator struck out indiscriminately - against'' -wife and- daughter, not knowing the protection given by the law to a man\u2019s widow\u201d; and that.\u201cFor all that appears [the daughter] was . . . dutiful and loving.- The court further decided that the will was intended to be \u201cconditional and temporary\u201d because' (a) of the son\u2019s absence (b)' \u00f3f the provision against testator\u2019s death before be saw bis son again (c) of the change in marital status due to separation from bis wife. All of these findings, however, are not in the evidence but are the result of reasoning, deductions and inference, based upon conjecture. Testator may have provided for bis daughter, as well as for. bis wife, upon the separation. But such a surmise would, of course, be as the others, a matter of conjecture.\nAs we are unanimously of opinion that the contingency expressed was the 'occasion 'for making the will, its provisions are absolute, and it is, entitled to probate.\nThe decree is reversed and the appeal from probate dismissed. Costs to be paid out of the estate..",
