        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nWe approve both the reasoning and the conclusions upon which the Superior Court based its decision in this case. There are, however, certain corrections which need be made in the final order. In no event is there any occasion to reiterate the facts. Save for one exception, they fully appear in the opinion for the Superior Court: see Noonan Estate, 163 Pa. Superior Ct. 70, 60 A. 2d 374. As the omitted matter also goes to confirm the merit of the decision, we shall relate it before entering upon a review of the legal principles pertinent to the questions involved.\nThe excerpts from the correspondence between the beneficiary and the executor set forth in the opinion of the Superior Court reveal ample basis for that Court\u2019s conclusion that the executor breached his duty to the beneficiary by withholding from him material information which he sought and to which he was entitled: see C. J. S., Vol. 34, \u00a7 554, p. 502. Executors, as well as other fiduciaries, are under an obligation to make full disclosure to beneficiaries respecting their rights and to deal with them with utmost fairness: see Rogers v. Benz, 136 Minn. 83, 161 N. W. 395, 397, aff\u2019d. on rehearing 161 N. W. 1056; Schouler on Wills, Executors and Administrators, Sixth Ed., Vol. 4, \u00a7 3219.\nWhile the derelictions of the executor in the instant case, as indicated by the correspondence already referred to, consisted of acts of omission, e.g., failure to disclose or to fulfill relevant promises, the executor\u2019s letter of April 8, 1946, to the beneficiary contained what constituted in the circumstances a positive misfeasance. Therein he-expressly assigned, as an urgent reason for a speedy sale of the decedent\u2019s realty, the estate\u2019s possible escapement thereby from a claim upon a judgment against the testatrix\u2019s deceased husband (a former owner of the realty in controversy). The fact is that the lien of that judgment was then, and for years had been, extinct. Indeed, as the executor (an attorney at law) must have well known, it was, and had been, actually impossible, because of the time elapsed, to revive the lien of the judgment so as to bind the r\u00e9alty either in the hands of the testatrix; while yet alive, or as a part of her estate after her' death: Shareff v. Wolf, 120 Pa. Superior Ct. 227, 229-231, 182 A. 115; Rankin v. Rinehart, 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 385, 391-393; see also Henry\u2019s Estate, 34 Pa. Superior Ct. 597, 600-601. Yet, without the slightest effort to correct this material misrepresentation, the executor hastily went ahead with a sale of the property to his private secretary, Mrs. Beryl Blakely. The latter, on her part, was not only cognizant of the contents of the executor\u2019s misleading letter to-the beneficiary (as well as of all other correspondence between them)' but, as she was,an experienced-title: examiner, she is chargeable with actual,-find not merely constructive; knowledge of the patent error of law which - the letter contained.\nReversal of the lower court\u2019s action does not depend upon-any-disregard of competent findings made below. None of the operative facts in the case is in dispute. The decision rests upon, the ultimate inferences and conclusions correctly to be drawn from the uncontroverted evidence,\u2014 a function, which an appellate court is fully qualified to, and does, perform in appropriate circumstances: see Dorrance\u2019s Estate, 309 Pa. 151, 156, 163 A. 303; Hamilton v. Fay, 283 Pa. 175, 179, 128 A. 837; Miller\u2019s Estate, 279 Pa. 30, 38, 123 A. 646; Gongaware\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 512, 514; 109 A. 276. In the situation here presented, the lower court\u2019s -findings of adequacy of price and absence of fraud in-fact\u2019are imihaterial. The record reveals a plain and unmistakable case of an executor\u2019s breach of his fiduciary duty with full knowledge of the circumstances. on the part of' the improperly favored\u2018third party.\nAn executor is a fiduciary no less than is. a trustee (Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7 6, Comment i.) and, as such, primarily owes a duty of loyalty to a beneficiary of his trust: Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7170 (1). Under Comment p. of the latter section\u2019of the Restatement; the rule is given presently pertinent- specification fin. the following language : \u201cThe trustee is under \u00e1 duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust not toTe guided by\u2018the interest of any third person.\u2019 Thus, it. is improper for-the trustee to sell trust pr\u00f3perty-t\u00f3 a'third person for the:purpose of benefiting the third person rather than the trust estate.\u201d Here, the facts support ho other reasonable' conclusion than that the executor, in selling the testatrix\u2019s, residence property to his private secretary, was motivated by the latter\u2019s convenience and benefit without regard for the rights of the beneficiary whose desire to pay the decedent\u2019s debts and retain the realty (whereof he was the sole devisee) was arbitrarily and even deceptively ignored by the executor. \u201cHe that is intrusted with th\u00e9 interest of others, cannot, be allowed to make the business an object of interest to himself; because, from the frailty of nature, one who has the power, will be too readily seized with the inclination to use the opportunity for serving his own interest at the expense of those for whom he is intrusted\u201d: Beeson v. Beeson, 9 Pa. 279, 284.\nThe executor was, moreover, guilty of self-dealing, as the circumstances Attending the sale disclose. Such a transgression does, not lie exclusively in a fiduciary\u2019s sale of trust property to, himself. Cf. Downing Estate, 162 Pa. Superior Ct. 354, 57 A. 2d 710, affirmed per curiam by this Court: 359 Pa. 534, 535, 59 A. 2d 903. The test of forbidden self-dealing is whether the'fiduciary'had a personal interest in the subject transaction of such a substantial nature that it might have affected his judgment in material connection: Downing Estate, supra, at p, 359, citing Scott on Trusts, Vol. 2, \u00a7 170.12, p.\u2018 877, and Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7170 (1), Comment h. See also Comment c. of th\u00e9 same section of the Restatement which declares that \u201cTh\u00e9 trustee violates his duty to the beneficiary not, only, wh\u00e9re he p\u00farchas\u00e9s' trust property for himself individually, but also where he has apersonal interest in the purchase of such a substantial nature that it might affect Ms judgment in making the sale.\u201d It will be noted that the extent of the fiduciary\u2019s disqualifying interest need not be such as \u201cdid aff\u00e9ct' his judgment\u201d but merely such as \u201cmight affect Ms judgm\u00e9nt\u201d: Downing Estate, supra, at. p. 360.\nIn the instant case, the execut\u00f3r\u2019s interest in selling the property to his. secretary was sufficiently s\u00fabstanti\u00e1l to convict him .of a violation of the rule against self-dealing. It was by the executor\u2019s personal loan to Mrs. Blakely of four-fifths of the sale price for the real estate that she was enabled to buy the property; and, as security for her indebtedness to the fiduciary so incurred, she and her husband gave to him, personally, a first mortgage of the purchased realty. Obviously, the nature of the mortgage interest was such that, upon a default by the mortgagors, the executor would be in position to take over the late trust asset for himself. And, still further, the agreement of sale embraced not only the realty in controversy but the decedent\u2019s household goods and personal chattels (save for a few excepted articles) at their appraised values as fixed by the appraisers, one of whom was Mrs. Blakely,\u2014hardly less than indirect self-dealing, when considered in the light of the executor\u2019s favoritism for the purchaser whose self-aggrandizing capacity was of the executor\u2019s own deliberate choosing.\nWhere there is self-dealing on the part of a fiduciary, it is immaterial to the question of his liability in the premises whether he acted without fraudulant intent or whether the price received for his sale of trust property was fair and adequate: see Tracy v. Central Trust Company, 327 Pa. 77, 79, 192 A. 869, citing Everhart v. Searle, 71 Pa. 256, 260, where the following was approvingly quoted from Hare and Wallace\u2019s Notes, 1 Lead. Cases in Eq., p. 210,\u2014\u201cIt matters not that there was no fraud meditated and no injury done; the rule [forbidding self-dealing] is not intended to be remedial of actual wrong, but preventive of the possibility of it.\u201d See also Tanner\u2019s Estate, 218 Pa. 361, 365, 67 A. 646, where a substantially similar quotation, ascribed to the notes to Fox v. Mackreath, 1 Lead. Cases in Equity 239, was adopted. It was also recognized in Tanner\u2019s Estate that \u201cThe cases are uniform in declaring that it matters not [when there is self-dealing] how innocent and bona fide, and free from the suggestion of fault, the transaction may be.\u201d In Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, 32 Pa. 315, 316, it was said that .\u201c. . . the rule [forbidding self-dealing] is inflexible, without regard to the consideration paid, or the honesty of intent. Public policy requires this, not only as a shield' to the parties represented, but as a guard against temptation on part of the representative.\u201d In Downing Estate, supra, President Judge Rhodes of the Superior Court succinctly summarized the rule at p. 360 as follows.: \u201cThe prohibition against self-dealing is absolute; where the trustee violates it, good faith or payment of a fair consideration is not material.\u201d See also Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7 170 (1), Comment h. The situation is no different where the breach consists of the fiduciary\u2019s marked preference of a third person over the beneficiary in respect of a disposition of estate property. As in the case of self-dealing, such conduct constitutes a violation of the fiduciary\u2019s basic duty to the beneficiary. Cf. Downing Estate, supra, at p. 558.\nIn the case of an offending fiduciary, if the trust property which he improperly sold is held by or for him, the remedy is a direct setting aside of the sale upon attack by one having standing to complain, e.g., a testamentary beneficiary or cestui que tru,st: see Tracy v. Central Trust Company and Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, supra. Here the title to the property is in a third party purchaser. Whether, despite the executor\u2019s breach of trust, she may keep her bargain, depends upon whether she was a bona fide purchaser: Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7 170 (1), Comment e.; Scott on Trusts, \u00a7470. To be such, she must have paid value for the property without knowledge of the attendant circumstances constituting the executor\u2019s breaches. For present purposes, the merit of the lower court\u2019s finding that Mrs. Blakely paid a fair and adequate price for the property is assumed. But, she well knew, nonetheless, that the executor was preferring her as a purchaser over the beneficiary who had clearly expressed his desire to retain the property unsold. The plain import, if not the express words, of Mrs. Blakely\u2019s testimony confirms that she had positive knowledge of the trust relation and of the executor\u2019s disregard of the beneficiary\u2019s rights in the matter. Indeed, the notice need not have been actual. The obvious and undeniable. circumstances were such as to put her upon inquiry and so bind her with the legal equivalence of notice.: Cameron v. Peoples\u2019 Bank of Maytown, 297 Pa. 551, 556-557, 147 A. 657; cf. also Erie County v. Lamberton, 297 Pa. 406, 416, 147 A. 86. The notice to Mrs. Blakely fully, met the requirements of the situation. \u201cWhere \u00e1 fiduciary in violation of his duty to the beneficiary transfers property or causes property to be transferred to a third person, the third person, ... if he had notice of the violation of duty, holds the property upon a constructive trust for the beneficiary\u201d (emphasis supplied): Restatement, Restitution, \u00a7 201 (1).\nIt follows that Mrs. Blakely is accountable, as a matter of law, to the beneficiary for the property conveyed to her by the executor. In holding to such effect, the. Superior Court also correctly concluded that the value of the use and enjoyment of the property which she had during her occupancy, as grantee, for approximately two and a half years offset any claim which she might otherwise have had for reimbursement for the cost of repairs and improvements made to the property at her expense during her tenure. Also, we approve the disallowance of the additional attorney\u2019s fee claimed by the executor at the audit of his account.\nThe order of the Superior Court, prescribing the decree to be entered below, inadvertently failed to include the personal chattels in .the property to be accounted for by the purchaser and made no provision for the satisfaction of the mortgage placed on the realty by the purchaser. As Mrs. Blakely\u2019s purchase of the decedent\u2019s household furnishings, etc., stemmed from the same invalid agreement of sale, they, as well as the realty, should be conveyed to the testamentary beneficiary by her upon her proper reimbursement. The beneficiary should, therefore, be required to deposit with the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court for the joint account of Mrs. Blakely and the executor, personally, the sum of $3500 to be apportioned between them by the court below according as' their' interests may appear or as they may otherwise agree, and a further sum, for the additional reimbursement of Mrs. Blakely, in an amount commensurate with the price paid by her for the personal chattels. Upon the deposit by the ben'e\u00f1ciary of the sums above Specified, the executor will satisfy of record the Blak\u00e9ly mortgage of the property made to him in his personal capacity ; and Mrs. Blakely, joined by her husband, will execute and deliver to the beneficiary a special warranty deed for -the real estate in question, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, and also a bill of sale for the personal chattels.,. The time for. preserving the lien of decedent\u2019s debts having expired and-all. debts of. record having been paid, as established by the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court upon the audit of the executor\u2019s first and final account, any residual funds of the decedent\u2019s estate will be distributable forthwith to the person or persons' entitled thereto by law.\nAs so modified, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed at the appellants\u2019 costs, and the record remanded for the entry of a decree and further proceedings in the court below in accordance with this opinion.",
