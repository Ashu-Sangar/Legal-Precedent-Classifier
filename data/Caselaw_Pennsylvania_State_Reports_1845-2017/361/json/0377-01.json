        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe plaintiff has judgment on his verdict against appellant. The question now is whether he is entitled to recover from the appellant in this common law action or by resort to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law.\nThe Statement of Question Involved suggests no dispute of fact; it is not disputed that there was evidence of negligence to be submitted to the jury. The only suggestion is that the plaintiff, employed by Albert, was loaned to the appellant, in circumstances in which -the appellant- became his employer, and- therefore not liable in this suit.\nThe plaintiff was employed by Frank Albert as a fireman on a steam shovel. Albert sold to the appellant a steam shovel, then at an airport in Clearfield. This sale, as Mr. Newman, appellant\u2019s witness,\u2019 described it, .\u201cwas a spot sale\u2014as is, where.is.\u201d. Albert, the seller, was not required to deliver it at destination; the appellant was to get it where it stood at the airport. The shovel was operated by steam afid the appellant had no employes at that point capable of operating it and applied to Albert, the seller; for assistance in loading-the--steam shovel on a truck and trailer. Albert directed the plaintiff as fireman, and a man named Grubb, Who-could operate the steam shovel, to put the shovel on the trailer, meaning that they should get up steam on the shovel and run it up on the trailer. It was therefore \"necessary for the plaintiff to fire the boiler and raise steam; when that was done, Grubb drove it up on the trailer. Neither Grubb nor the plaintiff had anything to do with fastening or securing it to the trailer. Whatever was done so to secure it was done by appellant\u2019s employes. After the shovel was loaded, the trailer was moved by appellant\u2019s men from the airport to the public road and was on the way to the railway station where it was to be shipp\u00e9d, when the fastenings got lo\u00f3se and the shovel partly fell off the trailer and injured the plaintiff.\nIt is well settled that an employer may loan his employes to another in circumstances in which they may become the employes of the borrower. But our cases are clear that a workman cannot be loaned to become the \u00e9mploye of another without the workmafi\u2019s consent: Tarr v. Hecla Coal Co., 265 Pa. 519, 522, 109 A. 224 (1920); Sames v. Borough of Perkasie et al., 100 Pa. Superior Ct. 402, 407 (1930 ); Nilsson v. Nepi Brothers et al., 138 Pa. Superior Ct. 107, 9 A. 2d 912 (1939). See Skinner, Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, 4th ed., p. 85:\nThe plaintiff testified that he did not agree to become the employe of the appellant, and there is no contradiction of this. He stated that Albert, his employer, had told him to fire-up the shovel but did not tell him that it had been sold; that when \u201cthe accident happened, I was just down on my .fire door, opening.it, when I heard something crack . . .\u201d That was work performed in- the line of his duty to Albert when the accident happened. Millard Grubb, the operator of the shovel, said he knew it was sold but he didn\u2019t know to whom. He said, \u201cMy orders [received from Albert] was to come over and load the shovel.\u201d His evidence shows that by \u201cloading\u201d he meant driving the shovel up on the trailer which was in charge of appellant\u2019s men. Quick, the plaintiff, testified that during'the loading he \u201cwatched the steam and the pressure, to see that the steam and the pressure were up\u201d and that he did not \u201csee who directed Mr.. Grubb in moving the shovel.\u201d The fact is that appellant\u2019s employes guided him in this movement\u2019 of the shovel. The plaintiff summed up his position with the following: \u201cA. I was told to put steam in that shovel, and they didn\u2019t tell me what they was going to do\u2014didn\u2019t tell me they was going' to load it, b\u00fat' I would have stayed in to keep the steam up and'would have stayed on until they told me to get off of it, buf nobody told me to get off. Q. Then you fell off? A. That\u2019s right.\u201d '\nAs there was ho evidence that the plaintiff consented to become appellant\u2019s employe and as the negligence and the result are not. challenged, w\u00e9 must overrule the assignment of error and affirm the judgment., in this view of the case, it becomes unnecessary to say anything about the other defendant as to whom the court granted a new trial.\nJudgment affirmed.",
