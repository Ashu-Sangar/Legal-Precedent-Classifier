        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, James F. Harkins, was tried by a jury and convicted of prison breach. Post-verdict motions were denied and he was sentenced to prison for not less than two nor more than four years. On appeal, the Superior Court was evenly divided and the judgment of sentence therefore remained in effect. Commonwealth v. Harkins, 222 Pa.Super. 104, 295 A.2d 118 (1972). We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nAppellant first contends that he was prejudiced when a prospective juror, in the presence of other prospective jurors who later served on the jury, accused the appellant of a crime other than the crime for which appellant was to be tried. We agree and reverse the judgment of sentence and grant a new trial.\nDuring the voir dire, prospective jurors, who were being questioned collectively, were instructed by the trial judge to \"raise your hand\u201d if \u201cyou are'related . or personally acquainted with Raymond Magensky, the prosecutor in this case . . . \u201d None of the prospective jurors raised a hand. Before any other questions were asked, however, prospective juror number six said aloud to the trial judge: \u201cI don\u2019t think I should sit on this case.\u201d The trial judge then asked: \u201cHave you had some contact with Mr. Magensky that would not qualify you?\u201d The prospective juror said: \u201cYes, he stole my car.\u201d Defense counsel\u2019s motion to strike the panel was denied but juror number six was excused. Prospective jurors who heard the accusation thereafter served on the jury trying the appellant for prison breach.\nWhen juror number six made this accusation he was referring to the appellant whom he recognized as one suspected of stealing the juror\u2019s car on the same night the appellant allegedly committed the prison breach. Since the other prospective jurors also could have reasonably understood that the accusation was directed at the appellant, we must conclude that defense counsel\u2019s request for the striking of the panel should have been granted. \u201cThe minimal standards of constitutional due process guarantees [sic] to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial and \u2018indifferent\u2019 jurors. . . . \u201d Commonwealth v. Stewart, 449 Pa. 50, 52, 295 A.2d 303, 304 (1972). See also Commonwealth v. Bobko, 453 Pa. 475, 309 A.2d 576 (1973). \u201cImpartiality is not a technical conception. It is a state of mind. For the ascertainment of this mental attitude of appropriate indifference, the Constitution lays down no particular tests and procedure is not chained to any ancient and artificial formula.\u201d United States v. Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 145-146, 57 S.Ct. 177, 185, 81 L.Ed. 78, 88 (1936). \u201cThe theory of our system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.\u201d Patterson v. Colorado, 205 U.S. 454, 462, 27 S.Ct. 556, 558, 51 L.Ed. 879, 881 (1907).\nIn Commonwealth v. Santiago, 456 Pa. 265, 318 A.2d 737 (1974), we reversed a conviction because certain jurors had received nontestimonial information that the defendant had committed a crime other than that for which he was being tried. Similarly, in this case, jurors received nontestimonial information of a prior crime other than that for which the appellant was being tried. The appellant was therefore deprived of a fair trial by a panel of impartial and indifferent jurors.\nThe only arguments raised by the prosecution in this appeal concern the issue of harmless error. Initially, we must reject the prosecution\u2019s contention that it should not be required to establish that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitition, P. S., the appellant was entitled to a trial by an impartial jury. Since these rights were violated, the prosecution had the burden of proving that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, reh. den. 386 U.S. 987, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Commonwealth v. Pearson, 427 Pa. 45, 233 A.2d 552 (1967); cf. Commonwealth v. Padgett, 428 Pa. 229, 237 A.2d 209 (1968).\nThe prosecution has failed to establish that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Error cannot be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt if there is a reasonable possibility that the information received by the jury contributed to the conviction. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, reh. den. 386 U.S. 987, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L. Ed.2d 340 (1972).\nWhen the jury learns that the person being tried has previously committed another crime, the prejudicial impact cannot be considered insignificant. \u201cThe presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty, and thus effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Groce, 452 Pa. 15, 19, 303 A.2d 917, 919 (1973). \u201cThe fact that a reasonable inference of a prior criminal record is present in the minds of the jurors in and of itself mandates a new trial.\u2019\u2019 (Emphasis added.) Commonwealth v. Allen, 448 Pa. 177, 183, 292 A.2d 373, 376 (1972).\nThe appellant also contends that he was prejudiced when a prosecution witness, during direct examination, referred to yet another crime allegedly committed by the appellant. There is no need to consider this issue.\nThe judgment of sentence is reversed and a new trial granted.\nEAGEN, J., concurs in the result.",
