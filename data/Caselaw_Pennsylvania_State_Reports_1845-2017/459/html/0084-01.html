    <p id="b184-7" data-blocks='[["BL_184.7",184,[265,723,1156,637]]]'>Appellee, Larry White, was convicted by a jury on May 12, 1972, of second degree murder for the shooting death of Joseph E. Erwin. Prior to the trial, appellee’s motion to suppress various items of personal property seized as the result of a police search of his mother’s residence was denied. Appellee renewed his objection to the admission of the fruits of this allegedly illegal search in his post-verdict motions. On February 28, 1978, the trial court reversed its prior decision and ordered that the items of personal property seized pursuant to an illegal search warrant be suppressed and that a new trial be granted. The prosecution now appeals from that order.</p>
    <p id="b184-8" data-blocks='[["BL_184.8",184,[263,1382,1155,529]]]'>The prosecution does not contest the trial court’s conclusion that the search warrant was defective. It raises, however, the following two issues. The first is whether the search and seizure pursuant to an invalid warrant was legally justified in that the appellee’s mother voluntarily consented to the search. The second issue is whether the appellee, a temporary resident in his mother’s home, had standing to question the validity of the search of that home and the seizure of his personal property.</p>

In <em>Bumper, </em>the defendant was convicted of rape based partially upon evidence obtained from a police search of the home where defendant and his 66-year-old grandmother lived. Two days after <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>the alleged rape, four police officers went to the home and were met at the front door by the grandmother. One of the officers stated “I have a search warrant to search your house.” To this, the defendant’s grandmother replied “Go ahead,” and opened the door. A rifle was then discovered in the kitchen which was later introduced into evidence at trial. <em>Bum/per </em>held that under those circumstances there was no voluntary consent to the search. <em>Bumper </em>said:</p>
    <blockquote id="b185-4" data-blocks='[["BL_185.4",185,[219,803,1105,638]]]'>“When a prosecutor seeks to rely upon consent to justify the lawfulness of a search, he has the burden of proving that the consent was, in fact, freely and voluntarily given. This burden cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority. A search conducted in reliance upon a warrant cannot later be justified on the basis of consent if it turns out that the warrant was invalid. The result can be no different when it turns out that the State does not even attempt to rely upon the validity of the warrant, or facts to show that there was, in fact, any warrant at all.</blockquote>

They were announced and admitted into the apartment by a neighbor. The officers identified themselves to appellee’s mother who was sitting in bed, showed her a search warrant, and indicated that they were looking for her son’s black leather coat. Appellee’s mother did not get out of bed while the search took place, but directed <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>the officers to the coat. When she questioned their request for the production of appellee’s glasses and wallet, one of the officers indicated that the warrant covered those articles as well as the coat.</p>
    <p id="b186-4" data-blocks='[["BL_186.4",186,[261,511,1159,1125]]]'>Under the facts presented, we must conclude that the appellee’s mother did not voluntarily consent to the search of her apartment, but rather acquiesced to a claim of lawful authority. Appellee’s mother did nothing which would evidence an intent to aid the police in their quest for evidence until after she was presented with what appeared to be a valid search warrant by an individual apparently authorized to serve it. Her subsequent cooperation did not constitute a waiver of her constitutional right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure, but rather was a submission to the law. Appellee’s mother did not get out of bed during the search. When she thought that the police were exceeding the scope of the warrant, she objected. She submitted to the seizure of the glasses and wallet only after the police informed her that those items were also covered by the warrant. Since the search warrant was defective and there was no voluntary consent to the search, the trial court did not err in its conclusion that this was an illegal search and seizure. <em>Bumper v.
