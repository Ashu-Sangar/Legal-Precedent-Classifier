See sections 311 (2) and 313 of the Adoption Act of 1970, Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. Ill, § 311, 1 P.S. § 311(2) and § 313. The decree terminated appellant’s parental rights in her three children, Donna, age 6, Lawrence, age 5, and Sandra, age 2 (ages at the time of <a id="p638" href="#p638" data-label="638" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*638</a>the hearing). The court’s decree did not terminate the parental rights of Lawrence Geiger, husband of Catherine Geiger at the time of the hearing and natural father of the two younger children. The three children remain, however, in the custody of the Warren County Child Welfare Agency in compliance with the court’s order. The only issue raised by this appeal concerns the court’s termination of appellant’s parental rights in these children.</p>
    <p id="b736-4" data-blocks='[["BL_736.4",736,[258,801,1154,577]]]'>The petition seeking termination of appellant’s parental rights was filed by the Warren County. Child Welfare Agency. This agency’s contact with the Geigers had continued over a five-year period commencing in 1967, when the agency undertook periodic visits for the purpose, as described by the agency, of providing “protective services” for the children. During this period, the agency decided that the Geigers had made no “improvement” in their ability to care for their children, and the agency therefore sought to have the parental rights of both the father and the mother terminated.</p>
