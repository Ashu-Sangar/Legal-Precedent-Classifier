Her body was discovered sometime afterward, lying on the pavement of Nectarine Street near the intersection of Eleventh Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her handbag and small change purse were found several feet away <em>from </em>the body. Appellant, Gary Andrew Jones, age 15, was tried before a jury and convicted of murder in the first degree and aggravated robbery. He was sentenced to life imprisonment.

The police were admitted to the apartment by appellant’s father, who was told that his son had been implicated in a homicide. Appellant, who was asleep in his room at the time, was awakened by his father. Appellant’s father accompanied appellant who <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>was taken directly to the police station, arriving at 8:34 a. m. Appellant’s father was not told about his son’s constitutional rights at this time. Appellant was then taken, without his father, into an interrogation room. Inside the interrogation room, appellant was informed as to his constitutional rights and indicated he waived those rights. He was then questioned continuously for almost two hours by two detectives about the incident involving Marie Ledrick. He denied any participation until 5:15 a. m., when he admitted taking part in the robbery of Marie Ledrick, but claimed that a friend, Rocky, had struck the victim. The interrogation continued for about another two hours before a break was taken and appellant was given something to eat and drink. At 8:10 a. m., appellant’s father was brought into the interrogation room and was permitted to see his son. At 8:53 a. m., appellant’s constitutional rights were again read to him and waived by him in his father’s presence, but no questions about appellant’s constitutional rights were directed to appellant’s father. Appellant and his father had no opportunity to talk privately after this reading of appellant’s constitutional rights. The taking of the formal statement immediately commenced and continued until 10:16 a. m. The statement, which was nine pages long, was signed by the appellant and witnessed by his father.</p>

Even though he was co-operative and not a discipline problem, he had been placed in this special education class because school personnel had determined that he could not benefit from a regular classroom setting. As of June, 1970, three months before his arrest, appellant’s reading comprehension was at the level of a first grade student. He had learned to write his full name only within the past year. His remedial reading teacher testified that appellant was unable to tell time, or estimate distances or geographical directions such as North <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>and South or East and West; that he did not know the meaning of words such as “involved,” and “quarter” as in “quarter of the way up the block,” that he never used these words or words such as “opposite,” and “toward,” all of which were used in the written statement.</p>

His shirt was ripped, and he had a bruise on his face, the result of a fist fight. He was taken home by his father, where he tried to eat; he became sick and vomited, and was taken to a nearby hospital. There he was examined and given a tetanus antitoxin injection— standard treatment for such injury — and sent home with his father. Upon returning home, appellant again tried to eat, and again became sick and vomited. He went to bed at 1:00 a. m., just two hours before the police arrived. When the appellant was awakened and arrested at 3:15 a. m., he did not “appear” to be under the influence of any drugs or alcohol.</p>

The prosecution’s expert stated that appellant had “schizoid personality disorder;” the defense’s expert diagnosed appellant’s condition as “schizophrenic psychosis.” The defense’s psychiatric expert testified that appellant could not understand or even say some of the words used in the written statement and gave his opinion that the appellant did not understand his constitutional rights when they were read to him following his arrest. The prosecution’s expert said that the appellant functioned on “a borderline intellectual range,” falling within the bottom 7 per cent of the general population in appellant’s age group. When asked whether the appellant understood <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>his constitutional rights, the prosecution’s expert gave qualified answers.

Whether he would understand that at the time of his interrogation at the Police Administration Building is another question.
