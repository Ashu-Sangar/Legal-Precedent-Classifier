The members of the Federation refused to return to work, and shortly thereafter, the School Board instituted contempt proceedings against the Federation, its officers, and the members of its executive board. The Federation, its president, Frank Sullivan, and its treasurer and chief negotiator, John Ryan, were tried together before a jury and found guilty of indirect criminal contempt on January 25, 1973. On February 9th, following the denial of post-trial motions, defendants Ryan and Sullivan were each sentenced to serve not less than six months nor more than four years in the Philadelphia County Prison. In addition, Sullivan was sentenced to pay a fine of $5,000. Bail was denied pending the Federation’s compliance with the injunction of January 11th. A petition for reconsideration of sentence was granted, and on March 14th, 1973, Ryan’s and Sullivan’s terms of imprisonment were reduced to not less than four months nor more than twenty-three months. In a separate proceeding, the twenty-one members of the Federation’s executive board were tried together before a jury, and on February 9, 1973, likewise were found guilty of indirect criminal contempt. Following the denial of post-trial motions, each defendant was sentenced to pay a $250 fine, and to devote forty hours in a teaching, tutorial, counseling or similar capacity in a public or private institution or agency approved by the court.</p>

The factual underpinnings of this argument are as follows. The Federation and the School Board entered into a collective bargaining agreement which expired by its terms on August 31, 1972. On September 5th, the parties having failed to reach an agreement on a new contract, the Federation called a strike. The strike lasted until September 27th, when the parties entered into a memorandum of understanding reinstating the prior agreement until December 31, 1972. This memorandum of understanding was later extended until January 8, 1973. On January 3rd, the membership of the Federation voted to reject the report and recommendation of the fact finder designated by the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board to hear testimony on the impasse between the Federation and the School Board, and voted to go on strike against the School Board beginning January 8th. On the day following the strike vote, January 4th, the School Board instituted a proceeding in equity in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to enjoin the <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>threatened strike under § 1003 of the Public Employe Relations Act (“Act 195”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Federation filed preliminary objections challenging the jurisdiction of the court and demurring to the complaint. A hearing was held on Friday, January 5th, before President Judge Jamieson, who ruled that under § 1003 of Act 195 no injunction could issue until the strike was actually in progress. The chancellor then scheduled a hearing on the School Board’s complaint at 9:00 a. m. on Monday, January 8th, the day the strike was scheduled to begin.</p>
    <p id="b253-4" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[160,864,1146,537]]]'>At the hearing on January 8th, the Federation renewed its challenge to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that the School Board’s complaint was defective at the time of its filing and hence was not properly before the court. This argument is now urged upon us in the instant appeals. As a corollary to this contention, appellants argue that, since the jurisdiction of the court was not properly invoked, the injunction against the strike was a nullity, and appellants cannot be held in contempt for violating its terms.</p>

When, instead of dismissing the complaint, the chancellor postponed hearing on its prayer for a preliminary injunction until the day the strike was scheduled to begin, he clearly believed that he was expediting the disposition of a matter of grave public importance without prejudicing the rights of either the Federation or the School Board; he assumed that the jurisdiction to enjoin found lacking on Friday the 5th would have ripened and become exercisable by Monday the 8th. But it was not merely the power to grant an injunction that was absent on the 5th; it was the right of the School Board to invoke jurisdiction at all. No right of action existed until the strike was in being. Where matters of jurisdiction are concerned, the courts must enforce the letter of the law. “No emergency, real or feared, and no alleged hardship to a complaining party, however great, can justify a court’s entertaining and passing upon a subject matter which is not within its jurisdictional competence.” <em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v.

The pendency of a suit seeking an injunction, even though not immediately brought on for hearing, can shorten tempers, harden bargaining positions, and distract attention from the negotiating process. It was to avoid such untoward consequences that the legislature provided that a strike by public employees must actually be in progress before injunctive proceedings under § 1003 of Act 195 can begin.

To this latter rule, an exception is recognized with respect to temporary injunctions designed to maintain the status quo while the court resolves the question of its jurisdiction. Since a court always has jurisdiction to decide questions of its own jurisdiction, violation of a temporary injunction of this sort will sustain proceedings for contempt of court, even if the court ultimately rules that it lacks jurisdiction over the parties or the subject matter of the case. <em>See United States v.

In his dissenting opinion, the Chief Justice suggests that the chancellor had jurisdiction to entertain the School Board’s complaint under the Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, § 13, 17 P.S. § 282. We cannot agree. The Act provides in pertinent part that “[t]he court of common pleas of [Philadelphia] shall have the power and jurisdiction of courts of chancery, so far as relates to ... V. The prevention or restraint of the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law <em>and </em>prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals.” (emphasis supplied). Once negotiation and mediation processes have been utilized and exhausted, a strike by public school teachers is not “contrary to law.” On the contrary, strikes of this sort are implicitly authorized by § 1003 of Act 195. If such a strike occurs, “it shall not be prohibited unless or until such a strike creates a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public.” Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, § 1003; 43 P.S. § 1101.1003. The determination whether this “danger or threat” exists must be made in accordance with the procedures outlined in § 1003 of the Act. The requirements of this section are “jurisdictional” in the strict sense of that term, for it is not enough that a court have competence to adjudicate cases of a particular class; this general subject matter jurisdiction must be <em>invoked </em>in a proper and timely fashion. <em>West Homestead Borough School District </em>v. <em>Allegheny County Board of School Directors, </em><a href="/pa/440/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="440 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="1932180" data-case-paths="/pa/440/0113-01">440 Pa. 113</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=269%20A.2d%20904" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="269 A.2d 904">269 A.2d 904</a> (1970); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

The author of this opinion is constrained to add, as a personal footnote, that this decision carries no condonation of the conduct of The Federation and its members in continuing the strike after it was enjoined by the trial court. There is no indication in the record that the defiance exhibited by the appellants was motivated in any way by an honest belief that the court was without jurisdiction to grant the injunction. Thus their refusal to obey the injunctive decree evidenced an irresponsible disregard for the authority of the court and the rights of the public.

A party need not await the consummation of a threatened injury if the act which is sought to be enjoined is a <em>practical certainty.
