The victim’s body was found on Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia on September 30, 1972. About four months later, in January of 1973, the appellee walked into a police station. When a police officer asked if he could help the appellee, the appellee replied “I think I killed a man on Woodland Avenue in November. I punched on him.” Subsequently, appellee was advised of his constitutional rights and gave additional inculpatory statements to the police. The trial court found that the appellee was suffering from a mental disorder at the time he made the statements and concluded, therefore, that the appellee did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional rights. All of the appellee’s statements were ruled inadmissible at trial.</p>

It has always been recognized that where an evidentiary ruling, even though not involving a constitutional issue, requires the taking of extensive testimony out of the hearing of the jury and is not dependent upon the posture of the proceeding at the time of its offer into evidence, it was within the sound discretion of the trial court to hear and determine the issue prior to the commencement of the trial. This power was considered incidental to the general authority vested in the trial judge to provide for an orderly disposition of the issues.

The procedure established by Pa.R.Crim.P. 323 is an eminently appropriate device for the expeditious disposition of evidentiary objections that do not depend on their trial context for decision, for example, challenges based on Pa.R.Crim.P. 130, see <em>Commonwealth v.

While Rule 323 in terms provides only for objections on “constitutional” grounds, I see no reason why the suppression procedure need be restricted to “constitutional” claims. In my view, the Rule should be amended to make clear that appropriate challenges to admissibility, such as <em>Futch </em>claims, may be raised by a pre-trial motion to suppress.</p>
