The Rochester &amp; Pittsburgh Coal Co. brought an action in equity, alleging, as did appellants here, that the taxing procedures of the County deprived it of equal protection and denied it uniformity of taxation.

      <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a> Our opinions in the past have generally shown an awareness that the more direct the attack on the statute, the more likely it is that exercise of equitable jurisdiction will not damage the role of the administrative agency charged with enforcement of the act, nor require, for informed adjudication, the factual fabric which might develop at the agency level. The reason, we believe, is that the determination of the constitutionality of enabling legislation is not a function of the administrative agencies thus enabled. <em>See Philadelphia Life Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/410/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="410 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1884545" data-case-paths="/pa/410/0571-01">410 Pa. 571</a>, 580, <a href="/citations/?q=190%20A.2d%20111" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="190 A.2d 111">190 A.2d 111</a> (1963). The more clearly it appears that the question raised goes directly to the validity of the statute the less need exists for the agency involved to throw light on the issue through exercise of its specialized fact-finding function or application of its administrative expertise. Further, the less need there is for compliance with an agency’s procedures as a prerequisite to informed constitutional decision making, then correspondingly greater is the embarrassment caused to litigants by requiring conformity with the statutorily-prescribed remedy. We conclude that the case at bar is such a case. Here the specialized proceedings before the appellee Board would be of little, if any, utility in determining the constitutionality of section 7 of the Second Class County Assessment Law. Whatever benefit might be derived from the filing of individual appeals by these appellants with the Board would be far outweighed by the inconvenience, delay and expense involved. We hold, therefore, that in the circumstances of this case, the statutory remedy was not adequate. This holding, coupled with our basic finding of the presence of a substantial question of constitutionality going directly to the validity of the assessment scheme applicable to Allegheny County <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> requires that <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>we reverse and remand for further proceedings.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>
