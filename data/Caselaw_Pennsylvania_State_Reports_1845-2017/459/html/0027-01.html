Hosack, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally and to two counts of rape. Following a degree of guilt hearing guilt was fixed at murder in the first degree. He was senenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge and to ten to twenty years on each count of rape to run consecutively. No direct appeal was taken. Subsequently appellant filed a PCHA petition under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, §§ 1-14, as amended 19 P.S. §§ 1180-1, 1180-14 (Supp. 1974-75) to the judgment of sentence imposed upon the <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>indictment charging murder, No. 41 June Term, 1968.

    <p id="b129-4" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[185,526,1153,1072]]]'>Appellant first contends that he is entitled to withdraw his guilty plea because it was unknowing in that he was not aware at the time he entered the plea that he was entitled to a trial without a jury under Rule 1101 of the Pa.Rules of Criminal Procedure, 19 P.S. Appendix. However, in September, 1968, when this plea was entered, Rule 1101 did not permit a non-jury trial in a case in which a capital crime was charged. A capital crime was then and is now defined as one for which the death penalty may be imposed. See Rule 1100 Pa.Rules of Criminal Procedures (1973 ed.) and <em>Commonwealth v.

Since appellant, having been charged with a capital offense, was subject to the death penalty, Rule 1101 disallowed a non-jury trial in his case.

      <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>The third and final assignment of error urged in this appeal is that the hearing court erred in finding that appellant was represented by competent and effective counsel. The seminal question in determining whether a defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel is whether the course chosen by defense counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client’s interests. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, </em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 Pa. 599</a>, 604, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A.2d 349</a>, 353 (1967).</p>

    <p id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.6",131,[179,1418,1148,523]]]'>Two bases for the claim of ineffective assistance relate to two assignments of error discussed earlier. First appellant claims that his attorney erred in failing to inform him that he was entitled to a non-jury trial, and, second the attorney erred in not requesting withdrawal of the plea upon learning that the prosecutor intended to breach his agreement not to seek the death penalty. Since the premises relied upon here were shown to be incorrect there is no basis for the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>
    <p id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.7",131,[177,2012,1148,317]]]'>Similarly, appellant now argues that counsel was ineffective because he allegedly advised appellant incorrectly that several co-defendants intended to plead guilty.

      <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>Appellant also alleges that his attorney was ineffective in failing to explore the defense of duress and in failing to allow appellant to testify that he committed the crime under duress. The post-conviction hearing judge found that appellant’s counsel had taken the necessary steps to research and familiarize himself with this defense and the record supports this finding. Moreover, since the duress defense could only be brought out if appellant took the stand, it was reasonable not to pursue such a defense in view of the likelihood that appellant would not be believed because there was no strong basis for the claim of duress. It was also a reasonable decision in view of counsel’s concern that appellant’s exposure as a witness might well have provided a means for the introduction of other highly unfavorable facts regarding premeditation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> See <em>Commonwealth v.

We disagree. First it was reasonable not to request a sanity hearing after counsel received a report certifying appellant’s sanity from a qualified psychiatrist who had been selected by the defense. See <em>Commonwealth v. Whiting, supra </em>at 281, 296 A.2d at 792, where we said:</p>
