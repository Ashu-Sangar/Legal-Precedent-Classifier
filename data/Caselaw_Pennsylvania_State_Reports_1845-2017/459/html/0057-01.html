X, § 1011, as amended, 15 P.S. § 2011. (Repealed and replaced by Act of November 15, 1972, P.L. 1063, No. 271, § 5, 42 Pa. S. § 8309.) Appellant is the defendant in an assumpsit action brought by the appellee, McCrory Corporation. Appellee seeks indemnification from the appellant and alleges that the appellant negligently manufactured a rubber suction cup tip placed on a toy arrow which injured a minor plaintiff who recovered a judgment against the appellee which had sold the arrow.</p>

X, § 1011(B), as amended, 15 P.S. § 2011(B). Appellant filed preliminary objections challenging the trial court’s jurisdiction over the New York Corporation. The trial court dismissed the preliminary objections and the Superior Court unanimously affirmed that decision on appeal. <em>McCrory Corp. v.

    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[150,1625,1149,748]]]'>Appellant concedes that five percent of its gross sales, approximately $41,000 per year, are transacted with Pennsylvania customers, and that these orders are shipped into Pennsylvania by truck. The appellant, however, argues that it is not “doing business” in Pennsylvania because it maintains no office or place of business in Pennsylvania, nor does it have any employees or representatives located in this state. The appellant also argues that the present assumpsit action arises out of a series of transactions, all of which took place outside of Pennsylvania and which were in no way connected with Pennsylvania. The appellant’s arguments must be rejected since the appellant concedes that it <em>ships merchandise directly into </em>Pennsylvania.</p>
