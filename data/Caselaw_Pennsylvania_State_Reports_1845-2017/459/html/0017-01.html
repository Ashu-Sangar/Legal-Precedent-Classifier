The trial <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>judge, however, qualified his certification by noting that he had made corrections in the transcript. Three notations were made in the transcript of the charge to the jury. In one sentence, the word “intended” appears. Immediately above that word, the trial judge wrote the word “attended.” In another sentence, the word “all” appears. That word was lined out and, immediately above, the word “always” was written. In the same sentence the words “not unlike” appear. The word “not” and the first two letters, the “u” and the “n”, of the word “unlike” were lined out. The words “not unlike” thus became the word “like.”</p>

Appellant relies on <em>Commonwealth v.

This, however, goes only to the question of whether any harm was done to the appellant. We feel that regardless of whether appellant was prejudiced or not, the sanctity of the official stenographer’s transcript of testimony is of such significance that we cannot allow even a non-prejudicial change of that transcript without following the procedures' established by the Legislature.
