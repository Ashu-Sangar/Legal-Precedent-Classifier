These two properties have been administered as assets of the life insurance trusts for the benefit of Morris Rosenblum’s children in accordance with the seventeenth paragraph of the trust agreement, and net rentals from the properties have been distributed as income to the life tenants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Ad<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>vanees from principal to the life beneficiaries, as permitted by the provisions of the life insurance trust agreement, and the purchase of a mortgage on the Highland Avenue property absorbed a substantial portion of the liquid assets of the trusts. In 1969, the tenant of the Highland Avenue property broke its lease and subsequently became insolvent. Efforts to locate a new tenant were unsuccessful, and the trustee was obliged to advance its own funds for payment of taxes, insurance, and maintenance of the property. In May, 1971, the trustee notified the beneficiaries that it was unwilling to make further advances to maintain the Highland Avenue property. Shortly thereafter, on July 18, 1971, appellant Maurice Reichman instituted an action for an accounting in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleging various acts of neglect and malfeasance on the part of the trustee, and seeking to surcharge the trustee for an amount in excess of seven million dollars.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The complaint was ultimately dismissed.

They base this contention in part on the theory that the real estate did not pass under the will into the life insurance trusts, but remained in a separate residuary trust established by the sixth paragraph of the will. As we read the will, this theory cannot be reconciled with its plain language. The fifth paragraph of the will empowers the trustee “to sell any or all of the real estate of which I may die seized, as and when it is deemed to the best interests of my estate so to do . . . the said real estate and the proceeds of the sale thereof to be added to the principal of [the life insurance trusts].” According to appellants’ theory, it is only the proceeds from an exercise of the trustee’s discretionary power of sale which pass into the life insurance trusts under this paragraph of the will. But this interpretation renders superfluous the testator’s direction that “said real estate” as well as “the proceeds of the sale thereof” pour over into the life insurance trusts. As we said in <em>Vandergrift Estate, </em><a href="/pa/406/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="406 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="1304894" data-case-paths="/pa/406/0014-01">406 Pa. 14</a>, 16, <a href="/citations/?q=177%20A.2d%20432" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="177 A.2d 432">177 A.2d 432</a>, 438 (1962), “a will must be so construed, if possible, as to give effect to every word employed by the testator and a construction which renders any of the words nugatory and futile must be rejected . ”. <em>See also Chambers Estate, </em><a href="/pa/438/0022-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="438 Pa. 22" data-case-ids="1929235" data-case-paths="/pa/438/0022-01">438 Pa. 22</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20746" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="263 A.2d 746">263 A.2d 746</a> (1970); <em>Benedum Estate, </em><a href="/pa/427/0408-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="427 Pa. 408" data-case-ids="1910356" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0408-01">427 Pa. 408</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20129" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="235 A.2d 129">235 A. 2d 129</a> (1967). The reason for the testator’s choice of words is plain. He owned two separate parcels of real estate, and it was natural for him to suppose that his trustee might decide to sell one and not the other. We conclude that the words in the fifth paragraph, “the said real estate and the proceeds of the sale thereof”, refer to “all of the real estate of which I may die seized”; and <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>that the testator’s entire real estate holdings passed under that paragraph to the life insurance trusts.</p>

It must be conceded that this aspect of Mr. Rosenblum’s testamentary scheme might have given rise to some troublesome problems, for the proportional interests of the beneficiaries of the life insurance trusts and of the trust of the business established by the fourth paragraph of the will were not in all respects identical.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> We cannot, however, infer the existence of a trust where none is expressly provided merely because we think the testator did not arrange his affairs as tidily as he might have. Whatever the drawbacks of <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>his testamentary scheme, Morris Rosenblum’s will expresses his wishes in plain fashion.

    <p id="b309-4" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[153,619,1147,637]]]'>Appellants argue that even if the properties themselves were properly added to the insurance trusts rather than segregated in a separate trust, the net rentals from the properties should have been capitalized and accumulated for the benefit of the *emaindermen of the life insurance trusts. This part of appellants’ argument focuses on the testator’s direction in the fifth paragraph of the will that “proceeds of the sale [of real estate]” be added to the principal of the life insurance trusts. Their contention is that the use of the word “proceeds” includes rentals prior to sale, and that so long as real estate is unsold, rentals must be added to principal.</p>

Each child was to receive “the net income arising from [his or her] trust fund for and during the term of [his or her] natural life.” In general, rents received from realty held in trust are income, and except as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, they are payable to the beneficiary entitled to income from the trust.

There was error in this view, for the law is, <em>not that a trustee is bound to submit to a vexatious and unwarrantable call for books and papers, but that at all reasonable times, in proper places, </em>the books and accounts should, on call, be submitted to those who have a right to the inspection of them ....

The record reveals that the greater part of the documentary material which was the subject of appellants’ petition for discovery was sought in connection with appellants’ theory that the testator’s real estate formed the corpus of a separate residuary trust. It was appellants’ contention that tax returns, mortgage records, correspondence and other documents in the possession of the trustee would demonstrate that the trustee had acknowledged the existence of a separate trust. Lest there be any misunderstanding on this point, we emphasize that we are in complete agreement with the lower court that the existence <em>vel non </em>of the separate trust of real estate is purely a question of testamentary intent, derived from the trust instruments. The conduct of the trustee during the administration of the trust has no bearing on this question.</p>
