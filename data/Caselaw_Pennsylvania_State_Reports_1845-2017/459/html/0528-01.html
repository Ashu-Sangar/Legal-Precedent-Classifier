See <em>Merwarth v. Townsend, supra </em>and <em>Yinger v. Springer, </em><a href="/pa/452/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="452 Pa. 66" data-case-ids="575022" data-case-paths="/pa/452/0066-01">452 Pa. 66</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=305%20A.2d%2019" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="305 A.2d 19">305 A.2d 19</a> (1973). There is nothing in the record to support appellant’s claims that the northern boundary is insufficiently defined or that the accompanying plan is incomplete and not in accord with the agreement. Indeed the only support for these statements are appellant’s assertions that the sketch attached to the agreement was not acceptable to Mr. Miller, that the land was not defined until after the agreement was signed, that appellee did not know the extent of the land, and that Mr. Miller never knew of the parcel to be conveyed. However, the chancellor found, based upon sufficient competent evidence including the signed agreement, the survey map, and the testimony, that the boundaries were sufficiently defined to identify with certainty the parcel to be conveyed and that all the parties agreed to the sale of the described parcel.</p>

Lot No. 9” whereas the parcel in issue is <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>generally west of Lot No. 9. This was merely a typographical error and the specificity with which the remaining language describes the parcel is sufficient to obviate any ambiguity.</p>

However, this allegation is also without merit since that information was properly supplied by parol evidence. <em>Title Guaranty &amp; Surety Company v.
