The man then fired into the face of Officer Harrington, seriously injuring his lower jaw. A gun battle ensued between Officer Kenner and the assailant. Officer Kenner was soon joined by two additional police officers and they called for additional support. Officer McConomy, who occupied a guardhouse at the 96th District Station, received the call for assistance and radioed Officer Von Colin at the Cobbs Creek Guardhouse to find out what the trouble was. Von Colin replied, “I am not sure.” Just then a second call came over the radio and Officer McConomy told Von Colin he had a second assistance call. To this Von Colin replied, “Oh yeah?” Officer McConomy then heard several shots through the receiver and asked Von Colin what was happening, but he received no reply. Officer Von Colin died of gunshot wounds.</p>

At these meetings, the group, including appellant, discussed how they, in the words of Mrs. Williams, would “eliminate the ‘pigs’ ” in order to get police pressure off the blacks. She further testified that about a week before the murder of Officer Von Colin, the group, including appellant, discussed their plans to blow up a police <a id="p556" href="#p556" data-label="556" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*556</a>station around Sixteenth (the Cobb Street Station is located at 63rd Street).</p>

At trial, Mrs. Williams gave a different version, testifying that she heard appellant and his co-conspirators planning the bombing of a police station, shortly before Von Colin was murdered.

During defense counsel’s cross-examination of Officer Gillin, the district attorney, in front of the jury, began to handle the weapons that were introduced as Commonwealth exhibits.

Defense counsel objected and requested a sidebar at which the judge reprimanded the district attorney <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>for his actions. Appellant now argues that the above actions were so prejudicial that he is entitled to a new trial. We do not agree.

He complains that on the fifth day of the seven-day trial, when Mrs. Williams was scheduled to testify, the district attorney requested court personnel to keep appellant’s wife out of the courtroom, explaining that appellant’s wife had threatened Mrs. Williams. The district attorney also ordered all members of the Black Panthers kept out of the trial while Mrs. Williams testified. Pursuant to this request, other members of appellant’s family were also accidentally excluded. When this came to light, on the day following Mrs. Williams’ testimony, appellant’s counsel moved for a mistrial, which motion was denied. While it is true, as appellant argues, that the district attorney had no authority to exclude spectators, after the trial judge was made aware of the situation, he ratified the actions of the district attorney at least insofar as appellant’s wife and members of the Black Panthers were concerned. This presumably was based upon the judge’s determination that appellant’s wife and the Black Panthers might cause the witness, Mrs. Williams, to change her testimony out of fear.

Yeager, </em><a href="/f2d/448/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="448 F.2d 74" data-case-ids="803493" data-case-paths="/f2d/448/0074-01">448 F.2d 74</a> (3rd Cir. 1971), <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b658-7" data-blocks='[["BL_658.8",658,[270,946,1158,637]]]'>Particularly in trials where the savagery of the crimes charged or malevolence exhibited in the method of their execution is likely to excite the emotions and render sober judgment difficult, the responsibility of the trial judge to be especially vigilant in his efforts to preserve an air of impartiality and objectivity is heightened. In such a situation the admission and accentuation of irrelevant, inflammatory and highly prejudicial testimony is at variance with the unbiased, objective, reflective judgment that forms the basic tenet of American jurisprudence. This is especially true in the case at bar where the evidence of guilt was far from overwhelming.</p>

Coupling the subject matter of the poster, with the fact that appellant was on trial for charges that he was a member of a black revolutionary movement bent upon the irradication of all lawful authority within the community (allegedly to avenge all wrongs that have been visited upon blacks by whites), the highly inflammatory quality of the exhibit cannot seriously be questioned. For this reason also, its erroneous admission and submission to the jury when they retired for their deliberations cannot be passed over as <a id="p561" href="#p561" data-label="561" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*561</a>being harmless. <em>Chapman v.

It would be absurd to suggest that possession of <em>‘Mein Kampf </em>indicates the owner’s acceptance of Prussian superiority, or Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’ as his explanation for the origin of evil in the world today. While it is true the possession of books, painting, article or other materials relating to a particular subject properly indicate a more than casual interest and even possibly an adherence to a given view, no such evidence was offered in the instant case.</p>

In discussing the practice of allowing exhibits to be taken by the jury for consideration during deliberations the authors of McCormick on Evidence, 2nd Ed. (1972) § 217 wisely observed:</p>

    <p id="b661-5" data-blocks='[["BL_661.5",661,[186,977,1148,475]]]'>This reasoning has compelling force where, as here, the tangible possesses a highly inflammatory quality. Neither the court below nor the majority today has been able to articulate a single legitimate purpose that was served by the submission of this exhibit to the jury during their deliberations.

[■ “the Court will of course allow to be considered only such evidence as is worth submitting to men who will judge only by the most common and practicable tests. But to a more important extent the effect is to require a generally <em>higher degree of probative value for all evidence to be submitted to a jury </em>than would be asked in ordinary reasoning. The judge, in his efforts to prevent the jury from being satisfied by matters of slight value, capable of being exaggerated by prejudice and hasty reasoning, has constantly seen fit to exclude matter which does not rise to a clearly sufficient degree of value.”] Wigmore, Evidence, 3rd Ed.
