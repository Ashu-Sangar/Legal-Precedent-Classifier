The decedent left a will, duly probated, which provided for a residuary trust with income to his wife, Dora Buss Beeson, for her life, together writh a power to invade the principal. Upon her death, the income was to be paid in equal shares to three nieces: Kathryn Beeson Wirsing, Louise Beeson (later Louise Beeson Stuber), and Kathryn Wirsing Lofgren. Each was given a power of appointment over the principal supporting her income interest. The will further provided for specific bequests to named beneficiaries and <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>for annuities in favor of each of the nieces in the amount of $500.00 per annum.</p>

In <em>Carver, </em>the decedent created an inter vivos trust which provided for certain life estates, following which the principal was to pass to his children, or in default thereof, to whomever he might appoint by will. The decedent died without issue and exercised his testamentary power of appointment to named beneficiaries. An appraisement was made which did not include the remainder interests as to which the decedent had exercised his power of appointment. Upon the termination of the life estates, an appraisement was made of the remainder interest which then came into possession. An appeal was filed by the <em>Carver </em>trustees who argued that the Commonwealth was precluded from appraising and assessing the remainder interests by its failure to do so in its original appraisement and by its failure to expressly reserve the right to future valuation. We rejected this argument and held that the Commonwealth was not barred under the theory of finality of appraisement from making a remainder appraisement since, absent an election to prepay the tax, it could not properly do so until the future interest actually came into possession or enjoyment.</p>

Thus, an appraisal of the value of such interests at any other time would constitute a meaningless act. Even if the Commonwealth had appraised the remainder interests under the 1906 deed of trust at the time of decedent’s demise, as appellants contend it was required to do, a second appraisement would now be re<a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>quired in order to comply with the statutory direction that the tax be assessed ‘upon the value of the estate at the time the right of possession accrues to the owner.’ Act of June 20, 1919, P.L. 521, § 3, 72 P.S. § 2304. In the instant case, the right of possession did not accrue until the expiration of the interest of decedent’s wife in 1963. It was, therefore, not until that time that an appraisal of any legal significance could have been made by the Commonwealth. We are unable to adopt a construction of the Act of 1919 which would place upon the Commonwealth the duty to engage in an appraisement of future interests which would be binding upon neither itself nor the ultimate owner of the interest appraised.”</blockquote>

We explicitly stated in <em>Carver </em>that, even if the corpus had been included in the original appraisement, a reappraisement would have been required when the remainder interests vested in possession.

A second or supplemental appraisement is then a nullity. The crucial element in those cases was not the inclusion of an asset in the original appraisement nor was it the lack of an express reservation of the right to reappraise but rather it was the Commonwealth’s <em>erroneous assessment and collection of tax. </em>In such cases we reasoned that “[i]t would be most inequitable to permit the Commonwealth to lull parties into an assurance that the taxes have been paid in full and then, after the passage of many years, make a new claim for tax long after the entire estate had been adjudicated and the corpus distributed.” Heberton Estate, <a href="/pa/351/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="351 Pa. 564" data-case-ids="462794" data-case-paths="/pa/351/0564-01">351 Pa. 564</a>, 565, <a href="/citations/?q=41%20A.2d%20654" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="41 A.2d 654">41 A.2d 654</a>, 655 (1945).
