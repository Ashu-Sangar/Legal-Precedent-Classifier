We approach this case with a full awareness of the threat that wide-ranging legislative investigations may pose to these protected interests.

He contends that the resolution is so “broad, vague, and indefinite” as to be unconstitutional; however, his perfunctory effort to relate this sweeping charge to a threat to his constitutional rights of free speech, association, and privacy is not persuasive. Law enforcement and the administration of justice are public functions. Moreover, broad as this area of inquiry may be, its limits are relatively easy to define. A legislative investigation into this area seems far less threatening to freedoms protected by the Bill of Rights than other inquiries which have received a judicial stamp' of approval. <em>Compare Barenblatt v.

Being satisfied on this point, we are not disposed to quibble over the specific language of the resolution. The committee created by the resolution does not adjudicate or punish.

Its legislative charter is not subject to the same strict due process standards by which, we would measure a penal statute. <em>Cf. Hannah v.

The relator’s objections that, under the terms of the resolution, the committee’s investigation might extend into areas of exclusive federal concern or overlap with the work of other committees and commissions are addressed to the wrong forum. Whatever the merits of these observations, they have no bearing on Carcaci’s rights as a witness before the committee.

He contends that, in order to comply with the requirements of due process of law, any such finding of contempt must be made in a judicial forum. This contention is without merit.

He was expressly warned that his continued refusal to testify could result in a citation for contempt.

The relator was given full opportunity to justify his failure to testify. His counsel appeared with him at the bar of the House, and filed an extensive brief on his behalf. Carcaci might have avoided any penalty by answering the questions put to him before the assembled representatives, but he refused to do so.

It appears that the questions which Carcaci refused to answer dealt with his alleged wiretapping activities on behalf of the State Police. Carcaci did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in support of his refusal to testify. His counsel conceded in oral argument before the court below that the statute of limitations had run on any offense arising out of the facts which were sought by the committee. Nor, so far as appears from the record, did Carcaci object at any point that the questions propounded to him were not pertinent to the subject matter of the committee’s investigation. <em>See Yellin </em>v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/us/374/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="374 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="8524" data-case-paths="/us/374/0109-01">374 U.S. </a><em><a href="/us/374/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="374 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="8524" data-case-paths="/us/374/0109-01">109</a>, 122, </em>n. 8, <a href="/us/374/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="374 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="8524" data-case-paths="/us/374/0109-01">83 S.Ct. 1828</a>, 1836, <a href="/us/374/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="374 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="8524" data-case-paths="/us/374/0109-01">10 L.Ed.2d 778</a>, 788 (1963).</p>

Had Carcaci wished to challenge the constitutionality of the committee’s investigation without risking a contempt citation before the bar of the House, judicial recourse would have been available to him.
