Following the denial of motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment, the court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on the murder charge and ten to twenty years’ imprisonment on the robbery charge, the sentences to run concurrently. This direct appeal followed.</p>

On direct examination appellant testified that he had been convicted of robbery in 1971. He also testified, however, that this conviction was the result of his taking responsibility for the acts of his twin brother out of brotherly love. On cross-examination, the following transpired:-</p>

Thus, not “ [e] very unwise or irrelevant remark made in the course of a trial by a judge, a witness, or counsel” will justify a reversal. Rather, the remark must be prejudicial, i. e., “of such a nature of substance or delivered in such a manner that it may reasonably be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.” <em>Commonwealth v. Goosby, </em><a href="/pa/450/0609-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="450 Pa. 609" data-case-ids="1947060" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0609-01">450 Pa. 609</a>, 611, <a href="/citations/?q=301%20A.2d%20673" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="301 A.2d 673">301 A.2d 673</a>, 674 (1973).</p>
    <p id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[238,986,1156,796]]]'>In light of appellant’s tactic in the present case of introducing the identity problem at trial,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> we can find nothing inappropriate in the general line of the prosecutor’s cross-examination. Nevertheless, it was unnecessary for the prosecutor to mention why appellant’s brother was incarcerated and the objection on this point was properly sustained. However, it is inconceivable that this isolated remark, which actually impugns appellant’s brother more than appellant, could be considered sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial. The very fact that no motion for mistrial was made bespeaks the innocuous nature of this occurrence. Moreover, once the above-quoted exchange was completed, no further mention of the subject was made either during trial or in closing argument.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

      <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>As to appellant’s contention that the trial court erred in failing to give a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the questioned remark, we find no merit whatsoever. If a party fails to specifically except to a court’s instructions, he has in effect waived any claim of defect or omission. <em>Commonwealth v. Clair, </em>Pa., <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20272" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="326 A.2d 272">326 A. 2d 272</a> (J-216 filed October 16, 1974); <em>Dilliplaine v.

We have serious doubts whether there was any error in the judge’s actions and we feel that the questioned incident does not even arguably fall within the ambit of basic and fundamental error. The trial judge may have done appellant a service in not giving a cautionary instruction since such an instruction might merely have served to emphasize or refresh the jury’s recollection of this brief incident. In any event, we cannot say that it was error not to take such action, especially in light of appellant’s failure either to move for a mistrial or to request such instructions.</p>

While appellant contends that his testimony regarding the prior identity problem with his brother was only to dissipate the impact of his prior robbery conviction (which, incidentally, appellant had brought out himself on' direct examination), the Commonwealth argues that appellant was also trying to imply that perhaps his brother was the culprit in this case and that once again his (appellant’s) brotherly love compelled him to “take the rap” to protect his brother. We think this is a fair and realistic inference and thus justified the prosecution’s rebutting any possibility of mistaken identity in this case.</p>
