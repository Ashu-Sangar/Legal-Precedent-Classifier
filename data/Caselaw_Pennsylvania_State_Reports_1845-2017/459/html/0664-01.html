Whereas here there was an absence of any compelling reason for the admission of these slides, we are forced to conclude that their introduction was error. Further, we cannot accept the Commonwealth’s argument that the cautionary instructions of the court relating to this evidence or the limitation placed upon the viewing time adequately assured against the prejudice created.
