A scuffle ensued when one patron resisted. One man was killed, others wounded, and a robber shot in the shoulder. The robbers fled, dragging their wounded member with them, and jumped into a nearby automobile. Even before its doors were fully closed, the automobile sped away.</p>

Here, unlike <em>Cherry, Williams, </em>and <em>Tingle, </em>appellant merely reiterated what he stated earlier that day and before any unnecessary delay.
