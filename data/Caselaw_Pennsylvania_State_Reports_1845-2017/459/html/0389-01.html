Three youths, one readily identified by a bystander as Norman Lyons, were seen fleeing the scene of the crime, which occurred at approximately 2:50 p. m. In the course of their investigation that afternoon, the police talked to many young men in the neighborhood, including appellant, Daryl Roane, but all were released without being arrested. That evening, Norman Lyons was arrested and he made a statement to the police in which he admitted his involvement in the robbery and named appellant as the man who had pulled the trigger. The police thereupon went to the home where appellant, who was then sixteen years old,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> lived with his mother, Mrs. Roane. At approximately 10:40 p. m., they informed appellant and Mrs. Roane that appellant was under arrest and took him to the police station at 22nd and Hunting Park Avenue in Philadelphia. Before they left the Roane home, Mrs. Roane told the police that she would be following them to the station. However, when Mrs. Roane arrived at the police station, at approximately 11:00 p. m., Daryl and the arresting officers were nowhere to be seen. Mrs. Roane waited for over an hour, during which time she was given no information concerning the whereabouts of her son. At approximately 12:10 a. m., Mrs. Roane happened to notice her son, accompanied by a detective, proceeding <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>to a water fountain in the hallway where Mrs. Roane had been sitting. Mrs. Roane attempted to talk with Daryl, but the opportunity was denied to her when the detective took appellant away to another interrogation room. Mrs. Roane inquired of the detective but received no answer. Since she had no idea where her son had been taken, she continued to wait. After another wait, for a period which Mrs. Roane estimated to have been approximately an hour, Mrs. Roane again saw the police taking her son across the hallway into another interrogation room. This time the door was left ajar, so Mrs. Roane, uninvited, entered. She asked the police for an opportunity to talk with Daryl to find out what had happened since his arrest. The police gave her permission, but urged her to speak up so that they could hear what she said. According to Mrs. Roane, however, her son was uncommunicative. Soon after, a police officer brought a typewriter into the room, and a detective began reading appellant his constitutional rights. When he came to appellant’s right to have an attorney present before any statement was made, Mrs. Roane told the police that she wanted to obtain a lawyer for her son and she did not want any statement taken. Mrs. Roane’s request was ignored, and the police began taking appellant’s formal statement. When Mrs. Roane protested, one of the detectives in the room told her, “Let him talk, maybe it will make him feel better.”</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b493-5" data-blocks='[["BL_493.5",493,[216,884,1145,691]]]'>Here, Mrs. Roane informed the police at the time of Daryl’s arrest that she would be following the police car to the station, thereby making it clear that she expected to be present during her son’s interrogation. Rather than waiting for Mrs. Roane, the police ignored her. When she got to the station, no one helped her to locate her son. Even after she happened to spot him when he was brought out to a water fountain, the police ignored her presence and returned him to the interrogation room. It was only when he was moved to a second interrogation room, one hour later, and the door of that room was left ajar, that Mrs. Roane was finally able to gain access to the interrogation room.</p>

However, in our view, Mrs. Roane’s mere presence is not enough. In order to support a finding that Daryl’s waiver of his rights was knowing and intelligent, we believe that the record must indicate that Mrs. Roane had an opportunity to give Daryl the kind of helpful advice discussed in <em>Gallegos, supra. </em>The instant case reveals no such opportuni<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>ty. Instead, the record makes clear that at no time was Mrs. Roane permitted to talk with her son alone. Rather, when she did try to talk with Daryl, one officer intruded, asking her to speak up so that she and her son could be heard, and another tried to dissuade her from the advice she was attempting to give by urging her to “let him talk, maybe it will make him feel better.”</p>
    <p id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[250,672,1153,529]]]'>Since the record indicates that the Commmonwealth first attempted to exclude appellant’s mother from the interrogation and then, when she finally gained access, did not afford her an opportunity to advise her son privately about his constitutional rights, although she indicated that she wished him to be afforded the right of counsel, we hold that the Commonwealth failed to establish that appellant’s waiver of his rights was a knowing and intelligent one.

How then can it <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>reasonably be said that his waiver thereof was unknowing?</p>
    <p id="b495-4" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[208,427,1144,1018]]]'>The thrust of the majority opinion, as I read it, is that a sixteen-year-old, regardless of maturity and experience, may not effectively waive his right to counsel when questioned by the police if a parent is present who is unwilling to join in the waiver. In my view, such a prophylactic rule is unrealistic and overlooks the key to the entire case — that is — what did Roane himself want and was his decision voluntary, and based on a knowing and intelligent understanding of his constitutional rights. At the time Roane was sixteen years of age and mature at least with regard to police procedure, since he had prior contact with the authorities. He was of average intelligence, and in the eleventh grade of high school. He was aware of his constitutional rights and the charges against him. This was not an incommunicado interrogation, since his mother and sister were with him. Moreover, the period of questioning before he first implicated himself was relatively short in duration, and he was not physically abused or threatened.</p>
    <p id="b495-5" data-blocks='[["BL_495.5",495,[207,1471,1144,638]]]'>Hence, we are left with one question: May a sixteen-year-old, under the instant circumstances, refuse the advice of a parent and waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In the instant case, the mother was given an opportunity to confer with her son and during this time she made her wishes known to him; yet, in the face of this, he indicated to the police he wanted to give a statement. This decision on his part was made with complete knowledge of his constitutional rights, the charges and the wishes of his mother. I know of no ruling of the United States Supreme Court, or of this Court, which denies him the right to make such a decision.</p>
    <p id="b495-6" data-blocks='[["BL_495.6",495,[206,2129,1144,204]],["BL_496.1",496,[240,317,1158,1338]]]'>The underlying fear of the line of cases which confront the issue of juvenile waivers has centered around two considerations: First, the will of the juvenile may be overborne by police tactics and he may become a victim <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>of fear, panic or coercion in the face of the presence of the law and give either an involuntary or untrustworthy statement. Second, because of his tender years he will not be able to understand his constitutional rights or the consequences of waiving these rights; thus, he does not effectively enjoy the benefits of his constitutional rights, or the protections which these rights provide. Under the facts of the instant case, however, both of these considerations are alleviated. Presently, Roane did not stand alone against the authorities because his mother and sister were present; hence, we do not have the fear of an involuntary statement. Moreover, his constitutional rights were explained to him, he was apprised of the wishes of his mother, and, based on his age, maturity, and intelligence he knowingly and understanding^ chose to waive those rights. Under like circumstances, we have held such waivers to be valid. See <em>Commonwealth v. Moses, </em><a href="/pa/446/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="446 Pa. 350" data-case-ids="1941737" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0350-01">446 Pa. 350</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=287%20A.2d%20131" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="287 A.2d 131">287 A.2d 131</a> (1971), and <em>Commonwealth v.

The fact that his mother was present and indicated she wanted her son to have the aid of an attorney only adds to the <em>Moses </em>and <em>Darden </em>rulings in the face of the aforementioned considerations. Roane had the benefits of the guidance of his parent, something Moses and Darden did not.</p>
    <p id="b496-4" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[238,1686,1154,474]]]'>Consequently, I would hold that the waiver of constitutional rights by a sixteen-year-old is valid, even after an adult or guardian expresses the view he or she does not want him to waive his rights, if the sixteen-year-old of his own volition, with a complete knowledge and understanding of his rights, chooses to disregard the advice of the adult. To hold otherwise is to say a sixteen-year-old may never effectively waive his constitutional rights without the consent of his parent or guardian.</p>
