Williams, pled guilty to aggravated robbery and to a general charge of murder on January 2, 1973. A degree of guilt hearing was then held at the conclusion of which appellant was adjudged guilty of robbery and murder in the first degree. Post-verdict motions were made orally but later withdrawn at the request of the appellant. On January 5, 1973, the trial court suspended sentence on the robbery conviction and <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction. This direct appeal from the judgment of sentence followed.</p>
    <p id="b689-4" data-blocks='[["BL_689.4",689,[187,470,1148,251]]]'>Several issues are raised in this appeal, none of which are ripe for appellate review. Since appellant withdrew his post-verdict motions, the trial court has not had the opportunity to consider the merits of the issues presented.</p>
    <p id="b689-5" data-blocks='[["BL_689.5",689,[180,777,1153,909]]]'> In numerous cases we have enunciated and applied the rule that issues not raised in post-verdict motions are deemed waived and may not be raised on direct appeal to this Court. For example, <em>see Commonwealth v. Agie, </em><a href="/citations/?q=499%20Pa.%20187" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="499 Pa. 187">499 Pa. 187</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20741" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="296 A.2d 741">296 A.2d 741</a> (1972). This rule applies whether the appeal arises from a conviction following a full trial or only a degree of guilt hearing held after a plea of guilty. <em>See Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/442/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="442 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1935347" data-case-paths="/pa/442/0512-01">442 Pa. 512</a>, 515 n. 2, <a href="/citations/?q=276%20A.2d%20537" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="276 A.2d 537">276 A.2d 537</a>, 539 n. 2 (1971). However, in order to be effective as a waiver, the withdrawal of post-verdict motions must have been made with a full knowledge and understanding of its consequential effect on the appellant’s right to appeal. <em>See Douglas v.

This rule was adopted on June 8, 1973 (to become effective forty-five days later), long after Williams, the appellant herein, decided to waive his right to file post-trial motions and sentence was imposed.
