The Commonwealth seeks to recover from the incompetent’s estate the cost of his maintenance since his commitment. The orphans’ court of Westmoreland County denied the Commonwealth’s claim.

The Commonwealth did not prosecute him for the crime. Instead, upon the petition of the warden supervising Downing’s incarceration pending trial, the Court of Quarter Sessions appointed two doctors who examined Downing and found him to be psychotic with criminal tendencies. They recommended that Downing be committed to Farview State Hospital. The court adopted this recommendation and on June 3, 1954, committed Downing pursuant to the Mental Health Act of 1951.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The commitment order provided inter alia:</p>

The court transferred the claim to the orphans’ court. There the case languished until 1972, when the guardian filed a first and partial account. The court in its adjudication denied the Commonwealth’s claim.</p>

Nevertheless, it contends that the estate of the incompetent is liable for the cost of his care since commitment. The Commonwealth argues that at common <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>law and in all mental health acts the estate of the incompetent is primarily liable for the incompetent’s maintenance. The Commonwealth further argues that no act of the Legislature has ever relieved the estate of this responsibility. It therefore concludes that the committing court’s order on cost of maintenance could not in any way release the estate from its liability.</p>
    <p id="b640-4" data-blocks='[["BL_640.4",640,[277,696,1158,1013]]]'> Were the Commonwealth’s theory to prevail, it would in effect permit the Commonwealth to relitigate a 20-year old order. The Commonwealth failed to follow the statutory procedure for modification of the original order. If the Commonwealth believes that the order improperly disposed of the issue of Downing’s maintenance, its remedy is to seek a modification of the order. Until it obtains such a modification, the mandate of the court must be obeyed. The Commonwealth is thus precluded from recovering the cost of the incompetent’s maintenance incurred in compliance with that order. See <em>Walker v. City of Birmingham, </em><a href="/us/388/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="388 U.S. 307" data-case-ids="6168412" data-case-paths="/us/388/0307-01">388 U.S. 307</a>, <a href="/us/388/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="388 U.S. 307" data-case-ids="6168412" data-case-paths="/us/388/0307-01">87 S.Ct. 1824</a>, <a href="/us/388/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="388 U.S. 307" data-case-ids="6168412" data-case-paths="/us/388/0307-01">18 L.Ed.2d 1210</a> (1967); <em>Philadelphia Marine Trade Association v.

At the time of his commitment to the hospital, the Commonwealth was preparing to prosecute Downing for murder. The commitment was pursuant to the petition of the official charged with Downing’s custody pending trial. His commitment to Farview is part of the custody pending disposition of the criminal charge.
