Because I believe that such a judgment is absolutely null and void, I must dissent from the court’s action today, which has the effect of ratifying the empty proceeding in the trial court and leaving in effect the Superior Court’s affirmance of a shadow judgment against a nonentity.

Compton and Evangeline Payne. On April 27, 1971 a Suggestion of Death was filed by counsel for Mr. Compton indicating that Compton had died on August 14, 1970. No steps were taken to substitute a successor to Compton as a party defendant but the action was <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>nonetheless allowed to proceed to trial.

R.C.P. 2375, 12 P.S. Appendix); Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure 2351-2374. I would have supposed it to be elementary and fundamental that a court cannot proceed to trial against a person who is not living and whose personal representative has not been substituted in his place. That, however, is what was done in this case. Notwithstanding that all parties and the court knew that Compton had died, they engaged in a charade in which it was pretended that Compton was still alive.</p>
