In this direct appeal,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Powell asserts three claims of error. First, he argues that his statements to the police should have been suppressed. Second, he alleges the court abused its discretion in failing to grant his motion for a change of venue. Finally, appellant maintains that his right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses was denied by the quashing of a subpoena served on a prospective defense witness.</p>

Appellant and Edward Logan became the prime suspects. In March, 1972, appellant was arrested in North Carolina for the murder. He waived extradition.</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.7",353,[183,1389,1150,743]]]'>Three Pennsylvania state policemen and one Cambria County detective were assigned to return Powell to Pennsylvania. On March 7, 1972, the North Carolina police surrendered Powell to the four Pennsylvania officers. Before beginning the automobile trip back to Cambria County, the officers informed Powell of his constitutional rights.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> They did not question him during the ride. Nevertheless, appellant made several inculpatory statements during the eight-hour trip. In the most incriminating, he told the officers, “I don’t know why I got involved, killing an old man like that. I must be crazy, I belong in an institution.” Whenever Powell began making a statement, the police urged him to wait until he had consulted counsel.</p>

Upon Powell’s motion, he was granted a separate trial. Logan was tried first, and was convicted on October 2, ■ 1972, of murder in the first degree. Because Watt’s murder had attracted great public interest, the local newspapers, radio and television covered the trial extensively.</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[255,692,1158,531]]]'>During Logan’s trial, a prosecution witness, Dr. Fagan, testified that she had accompanied Logan to the victim’s home prior to the crime to discuss the purchase of antiques. Although Dr. Fagan was a resident of neighboring Blair County, her appearance at Logan’s trial interrupted an extended tour of South America. Realizing that Dr. Fagan would resume her trip when she completed her testimony and desiring that she appear as a defense witness at his trial, Powell served a subpoena upon Dr. Fagan immediately following her testimony.</p>

The court ruled that section 4 of the Uniform Act to Secure Attendance of Witnesses <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> barred the service of a subpoena upon a witness who, like Dr. Fagan, came into the Commonwealth in obedience to a previously issued subpoena. On October 3, 1972, appellant applied to the court for an order to compel the appearance of Dr. Fagan. Two days later the court granted a <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>continuance,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> noting that appellant was free to subpoena the witness when she returned to the jurisdiction.

After a suppression hearing, the court denied the motion. On October 3, 1972, appellant moved for a change of venue, contending that he could not obtain a fair trial in Cambria County due to the publicity that accompanied the murder and Logan’s trial. This motion was denied and a continuance granted on October 5, 1972.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In December, 1972, Powell was tried and convicted.</p>

It cannot be said on this record that the media’s pretrial publicity was of such a nature that appellant’s trial in effect took place outside the courtroom. Nor can the publicity be viewed as so pervasive as to reduce Powell’s trial to a “hollow formality.” Compare <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, </em><a href="/us/373/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="373 U.S. 723" data-case-ids="11720000" data-case-paths="/us/373/0723-01">373 U.S. 723</a>, 726, <a href="/us/373/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="373 U.S. 723" data-case-ids="11720000" data-case-paths="/us/373/0723-01">83 S.Ct. 1417</a>, 1419, <a href="/us/373/0723-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="373 U.S. 723" data-case-ids="11720000" data-case-paths="/us/373/0723-01">10 L.Ed.2d 663</a> <em>(1963); Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, Powell’s trial was one year after the homicide _and two months after Logan’s trial. In these circumstances there was time for the ef<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>feet of these news stories to fade from the minds of prospective jurors. The trial court determined on this record that it was possible to select jurors who had no fixed opinion as to the accused’s guilt. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[185,579,1150,808]]]'>The record clearly reveals the trial court understood its obligation to assure Powell an impartial trial. The court fulfilled its responsibility to probe prospective jurors during voir dire to determine if they were prejudiced against the defendant and to exclude any juror with a fixed opinion of appellant’s guilt. The court denied the motion for a change of venue because it was satisfied that Powell could receive a fair trial in Cambria County. We find no abuse of discretion or error of law in the court’s refusal to grant the change of venue. See <em>Commonwealth v.
