To provide an appointment process for occasions when the preferred procedure is thus inadequate,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> the Constitution permits the Governor to issue temporary commissions “during the recess of the Senate.” The exception was designed for use only when the preferred procedure could not be employed.

Because each house is powerless to enact legislation alone,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> each has a strong interest in insuring that bills passed by it are considered by the other house. The greatest threat to this interest is the possibility that the other house might adjourn, thus disabling itself from the consideration of bills.

      <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>The draftsmen foresaw that protection of the interest of each house in having its bills considered by the other, if unqualified, would be gained at the expense of flexibility in the administration of the legislative calendar. Accordingly, the Constitution provides an exception to the consent requirement for adjournments of less than four days. This exception clearly reflects the perception that adjournments of less than four days present a minimal threat to each house’s interest in the consideration by the other of its bills.</p>
    <p id="b283-4" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[165,834,1150,912]]]'>Defendants argue that the Senate’s adjournment in this case was effective despite the absence of the consent of the House of Representatives under article II, section 14 because its duration was not more than three days. We disagree. Sine die adjournments are vastly different from the short recesses envisioned by article II, section 14 in two important respects. First, article II, section 14, as pointed out above, was designed to provide flexibility in the legislative calendar. However, sine die adjournments are unrelated to flexibility in the calendar, representing as they do the end of the legislative calendar for the session. Because the purpose of the exception to the consent requirement would not be served by its application to sine die adjournments, we conclude that the Constitution does not intend its application. Hence, section 14 does not expand the power of the Governor to make unconfirmed appointments.</p>
    <p id="b283-5" data-blocks='[["BL_283.5",283,[164,1779,1148,529]],["BL_284.1",284,[237,254,1156,477]]]'>Second, at the time the consent exception was inserted into the Constitution, a sine die adjournment by one house posed a far more drastic threat to the interests of the other than a short recess contemplated by article II, section 14. Recesses of less than four days pose a minimal danger that one house will so absent itself as to disable it from consideration of legislation. However, at the time the consent requirement and the three-day exception were inserted in the Constitution, a sine die adjournment represented the greatest threat to the interests of the <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>other house. This was so because unenacted bills pending at the end of a session expired,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> requiring reintroduction and repassage of the bill in the originating house in order to obtain consideration by the other house. The absence of one house prevented legislation initiated by the other from ever being enacted into law. Accordingly, in contrast to a three-day intra-session recess, a sine die adjournment by one house was the ultimate threat to the interest in having the bills of the other enacted.</p>

To attempt to distinguish this recess from one resulting from joint action would create a distinction without meaning and wholly unsupported by the language and clear intention of the Constitution. As the majority of this Court observed in <em>Stroup, supra </em>at 177, <a href="/citations/?q=313%20A.2d%20237" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="313 A.2d 237">313 A.2d at </a>240:</p>

Therefore the action taken by the Senate in recessing on December 31, 1973 fulfills the requirement of article II, section 14 in that it was a recess of less than three days. To conclude that this recess did not in fact terminate the annual ses<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>sion is contrary to fact, and the majority’s attempt to describe it as something less than a termination of an annual session is, in my judgment, completely without foundation.</p>
