Defendant Halperin was accused of corruptly influencing witnesses before a federal grand jury. When called before another grand jury, he declined to answer certain questions because his answers might incriminate him. At trial he answered the same questions in a way consistent with innocence. The government was permitted, over objection, to cross-examine Halperin on his allegedly inconsistent responses. The trial judge however indicated that this cross-examination could be considered only as reflecting on the witness’ credibility.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

Two grounds for reversal were advanced. First, the Court, for the sake of argument, assumed that Halperin’s trial testimony and earlier claim of privilege were inconsistent.

See 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1040 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). Both the claim of privilege before the grand jury and the exculpatory answers at trial were “wholly consistent with innocence.” <a href="/us/353/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="353 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="6161067" data-case-paths="/us/353/0391-01">353 U.S. at 421</a>, <a href="/us/353/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="353 U.S. 391" data-case-ids="6161067" data-case-paths="/us/353/0391-01">77 S.Ct. at 982</a>.

Oxman and Levitan had invoked their constitutional privilege against self-incrimination at a prior stage of the disciplinary proceeding. Even if nothing in this statute prevents us from remanding a case to the trial court in appropriate .circumstances, this course is not justified in the present case. There is abundant evidence in the record that appellants have engaged in unethical conduct. Moreover, nothing in the careful review of this evidence in the opinion of the court en banc below suggests that the court gave any weight whatever to this controverted testimony in making its findings; indeed, the claim of privilege is not so much as mentioned. Moreover, I find it hard to understand how remanding this case for retrial can guarantee a more impartial review of the evidence, for copies of the majority opinion will of course be read by the judges who will constitute the new disciplinary court, and presumably by common pleas judges throughout the Commonwealth. Thus we will have the anomaly that when this case is retried, no “factfinder . . . untainted by the unconstitutionally-elicited impeachment” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">*</a> will be available. <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>In my view, a second trial of this case will be a costly and time-consuming exercise in futility.</p>
