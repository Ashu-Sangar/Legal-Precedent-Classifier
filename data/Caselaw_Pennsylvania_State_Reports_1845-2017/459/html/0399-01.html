Zelem, appellee, became a laboratory technician at the Veterinary Science Division of Pennsylvania State University. On October 1, 1967, the university entered into a collective bargaining agreement (Agreement I) with Teamsters Local Union No. 8, one of the appellants and the employee organization representing the bargaining unit of which Miss Zelem was a member. The agreement, which was extended by mutual consent to June 30, 1970, contained a union security provision best described as a modified-agency shop. Under its terms, all employees who were members of the bargaining unit, but who had not joined the union, were required to pay to the union an amount equal to the regular initiation fees and dues as a condition of employment. However, Agreement I specifically exempted those non<a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>member employees whose employment predated the agreement. Appellee, who had never joined the union, was thus exempt from the agency-shop provisions.</p>
    <p id="b500-4" data-blocks='[["BL_500.4",500,[264,488,1162,637]]]'>A renewal contract (Agreement II) was subsequently executed between the union and the university, effective for the period from July 1, 1970 to May 31, 1973. This contract contained a strict agency-shop provision by the terms of which all employees, including those in the position of appellee, were required to pay the equivalent of the union’s regular initiation fees and the union dues. In order to avoid discharge, appellee paid under protest, but she then filed a complaint charging the university and the union with an unfair labor practice under § 1201 of the Public Employe Relations Act (PERA), Act of July 23,1970, P.L. 563, 43 P.S. § 1101.101 etseq.</p>

It then reversed itself and entered a final order, with one member dissenting, upholding the challenged union security provision. On appeal, the Court of Common Pleas of Centre County reversed the board and found in favor of appellee. An equally-divided Commonwealth Court affirmed that decision, and we granted allocatur petitions filed by the union and the board, because the case raises an important question concerning the proper interpretation of § 904 of PERA and its relationship to other provisions of the act, particularly §§ 401 and 705.</p>

The union and the board argue, however, that the strict-agency-shop provision of Agreement II, which took effect on July 1, 1970, was simply a modification of the modified-agency-shop provision of Agreement I, and that such a modification is specifically permitted by § 904, which allowed the parties to “continue voluntarily to bargain” on “items,” such as the agency-shop provision, which were included in collective bargaining agreements in existence on January 1, 1970, but which were inconsistent with the statute.</p>

No contractual obligation was impaired by the application of § 904 to Agreement II. The only obligation affected was that purportedly placed on appellee and others of her status — the obligation to pay the equivalent of dues and initiation fees to the union. Such an obligation cannot be considered contractual, since appellee and the others were not parties to the contract. When such an obligation is permitted, it is only by reason of the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> or, in the instant <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>case, the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Thus, what has been impaired by § 904 is not a contractual obligation owed by appellee to the union, but rather the continuation of the union’s statutory right to bind non-consenting, nonmembers, such as appellee, to contractual provisions requiring employees to pay union dues.

To the contrary, the clear meaning of the words require an interpretation that the existence of a union security agreement providing for an agency shop on the specified date permits the parties to negotiate subsequent contracts also containing an agency shop provision, the only limitation being that it not be in violation of earlier laws. The clause “[t]he parties to such agreements may continue voluntarily to bargain on any such items” clearly expresses the right to agree upon an agency shop not permitted by PERA but otherwise permissible under the laws of this Commonwealth. The word “bargaining” unquestionably relates to the item, an agency shop, and there is a complete absence of any language which would limit the terms of the bargaining to the terms of the existing security provision.</p>

This reasoning disregards the patent fact that the term “bargain” was used by the legislature in this section to define the rights of those who were in fact participating in the bargaining process. It further ignores the practical reality that these alleged forgotten souls are attempting to receive <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>the benefits of union membership, while avoiding acceptance of its responsibilities.</p>

Unresolved disputes between the public employer and its employes are injurious to the public and the General Assembly is therefore aware that adequate means must be established for minimizing them and providing for their resolution. Within the limitations imposed upon the governmental processes by these rights of the public at large and recognizing that harmonious relationships are required between the public employer and its employes, the General Assembly has determined that the overall policy may best be accomplished by (1) granting to public employes the right to organize and choose freely their representatives; (2) requiring public employers to negotiate and bargain with employe organizations representing public employes and to enter into written agreements evidencing the result of such bargaining; and (3) establishing procedures to provide for the protection of the rights of the public employe, the public employer and the public at large.”</blockquote>
