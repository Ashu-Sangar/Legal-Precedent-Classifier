    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[221,425,1172,1654]]]'>Appellant and Rochelle Petrakovich were married in September, 1970 and resided near Allentown, Pennsylvania. Both had been previously married and divorced and had lost custody of their respective children of those prior marriages. In May, 1971, appellant and his wife moved to Arizona where they lived for several months. In October of that year, Mrs. Petrakovich returned to Allentown and obtained employment at the Top Diner, where she had previously worked. . On January 12, 1972, appellant appeared at the Diner, spotted his wife behind the lunch counter, and accosted her. The prosecution version of what then transpired, as presented through three eye-witnesses, was as follows: Appellant leaned over the counter and pushed his wife against a refrigeration unit which was several feet behind her. Mrs. Petrakovich, seeming startled, moved towards the counter and apparently spoke with her husband for one or two minutes. No witness could testify as to the content of this conversation. Appellant then drew a gun and fired it at his <em>wife; </em>she screamed, clutched her left arm, and fell to the floor. Still holding the gun, appellant leaped over the counter and warned the other employees and patrons not to move or call the police. He then bent over his wife and said “I love you, Shel.” After another warning to an employee who attempted to come to the injured woman’s aid, appellant again professed his love to his wife and fired a second shot into her chest. He then shot himself in the chest and fell upon his wife’s body. The police and an ambulance were then called. Mrs. Petrakovich died before arrival at a hospital.</p>

He stated that life for him and his wife had been extremely difficult immediately after their <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>marriage due to the loss of custody of their children. It was to escape that painful situation that they had moved to Arizona; but in a final attempt to regain her children, Mrs. Petrakovich returned to Allentown. On December 31, 1971, she telephoned appellant and asked him to join her and to meet her at the Top Diner at 11:00 a.m., January 12, 1972. Upon arriving at the Diner at the appointed time, appellant saw his wife at work behind the counter, approached her and, placing his hands on her shoulders, kissed her. After some general conversation, Mrs. Petrakovich told him that her efforts to win her children had been unsuccessful. Suddenly, appellant heard her scream and saw that she had shot herself with the family gun which she had brought from Arizona. He jumped over the counter and took from her the gun which, in the process, discharged accidentally, and his wife fell to the floor. As he knelt over her, telling her that he loved her, she asked him to “go with her.” Wishing to join her in death, he shot himself in the chest.</p>

The Commonwealth witness testified that when the shot which entered the arm of the deceased was fired, appellant was standing “directly in front of” her. The evidence showed that the bullet which entered the victim’s left arm passed into the left chest and finally lodged in the right side of the abdomen at the back of the body. This would arguably indicate that the bullet entered the body at an angle, not from “directly in front” of the decedent. Such a variance, however, is one which goes to credibility rather than sufficiency. <em>See Commonwealth v.

The Commonwealth’s forensic pathologist’s testimony established the range and angle from which each bullet hit the body. The defense did not dispute his testimony (although their interpretations of the ramifications of these facts differed). The photographs merely duplicated the expert’s testimony and could have been of little use to the untrained eyes of the jurors. In these circumstances, the value of the photographs was so slight that it was clearly exceeded by the prejudicial effect these pictures had on the jurors. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the pictures. I would reverse the judgment and grant a new trial.</p>
