On December 29, 1967, appellant visited the maternity ward of the Woman’s Medicine College Hospital in Philadelphia, where his wife, Cynthia Hamilton, was a patient following the delivery of a baby three days previously. There were several other visitors and patients in the room, including Mrs. Hamilton’s step-father. The appellant sat beside his wife’s bed for a period of time. At approximately 8:00 p. m., Mrs. Hamilton received a telephone call. As she turned to answer the ’phone, appellant shot her in the back of the head. After firing two more shots into her body, he turned the gun on himself, shooting himself twice in the chest. The wounds inflicted upon his wife proved fatal; from those inflicted upon himself the appellant recovered. At trial, the appellant did not contest the fact that he did shoot and kill his wife. His defense was that he was insane at the time of the commission of the act, and competent evidence was introduced to that effect.</p>

Dr. Kushner gave it as his opinion that, at the time of the shooting, the appellant “had a <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>defect of reasoning, due to a disease of the mind” that rendered him “unable to appreciate the nature and quality of his act”. The doctor was then asked whether he had an opinion as to whether Hamilton “was so entirely perverted as rendered the commission of the deed an overwhelming necessity when he shot and killed his wife”. Objection to this question was sustained, and appellant urges this ruling as prejudicial error. Immediately thereafter, however, the witness was allowed to respond to a question whether appellant was “suffering a stopgap of his intelligent control and his will, and it rendered it impossible to do otherwise but yield thereto”. The answer given was “yes”. The doctor then added, “I think Arnold Hamilton had no choice because of his mental illness.” If the exclusion of an answer to the first question was error, it would seem to have been cured by the admission of an answer to the second. Moreover, the court affirmed appellant’s point for charge (No. 7) that, if Hamilton had “such unsoundness of mind that it subjugated his intellect, control and will so that it became impossible for him in his mental state to do other than as he did”, the verdict must be not guilty by reason of insanity.</p>

Because, however, of the further opinion allowed to be given by Dr. Kushner, and the quoted point for charge, which was given not only once but twice, the jury was, in effect, allowed to consider “overwhelming necessity” in its determination of whether or not appellant was sane. The permitted testimony and the point for charge were both more favorable to appellant than he was entitled to; we thus see no reason on this record to comply with appellant’s request to reconsider M’Naghten and all of our cases which have followed it since 1846, when Chief Justice Gibson in effect <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>incorporated the rule of that case into our law, <em>Commonwealth v.

There may be an unseen ligament pressing on the mind, drawing it to consequences which it sees, but cannot avoid, and placing it under a coercion, which, while its results are clearly perceived, is incapable of resistance.” <em>Commonwealth v.

After thus stating the nature of the “mania”, Chief Justice Gibson immediately voiced caveats concerning it: It “is dangerous in its relations”, is to be recognized “only in the clearest cases”, should be “shown to have been habitual”, and should be confined “within the strictest limits”. Then followed this summary: “To establish it as a justification in any particular case, it is necessary either to show, by clear proof, its contemporaneous existence evinced by present circumstances, or the existence of an <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>habitual tendency developed in previous cases, becoming in itself second nature.” <em><a href="/pa/4/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="4 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="401928" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0264-01">Ibid.</a></em>

As in <em>Commonwealth v. Thomas, supra, </em>and in <em>Commonwealth v.

In its rebuttal of the insanity defense, the Commonwealth called Dr. Kenneth A. Kool, also a qualified psychiatrist, who examined the appellant on two occasions. The doctor stated, in concluding his direct examination, that, in his opinion, appellant knew the nature and quality of his act in shooting his wife, and knew that it was wrong to kill. He added: “I am giving my best opinion, my best speculation. I was not there. It is my opinion that he knew right from wrong, that he knew the nature and consequences of the act, and that he had intent to do bodily harm in taking and using the gun.” During a vigor<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>ous cross-examination, the witness was asked whether he was “absolutely certain” that Hamilton was not psychotic at the time he shot his wife, and answered that he was not absolutely certain. At the end of the cross-examination (which continued for approximately 23 more pages in the typewritten transcript), defense counsel moved to strike the entire testimony of Dr. Kool on the ground that it was not clear and precise, but amounted only to guess and conjecture. The court’s refusal of this motion is assigned as error.</p>

The fact that the doctor was not willing to state that he was “absolutely certain” that Hamilton was not psychotic at the time of the crime is no reason for disqualifying his testimony. We have never required expert opinion to rise to the level of absolute certainty; if that were the standard, it would not be opinion, but factual knowledge.

We are not able to find such abuse in this case. Moreover, only one of the three witnesses in question (step-father of the decedent) was called by the Commonwealth; he was the <em>first </em>witness in the case, and thus not subject to any influence by the testimony of others. One other relative (a brother of the decedent) was called by the appellant, but testified to quite different episodes of erratic behavior than those the other witnesses had cited; the third person was never called to testify for either side. If the trial judge could be said to have abused his discretion, therefore, the error was clearly harmless.</p>
