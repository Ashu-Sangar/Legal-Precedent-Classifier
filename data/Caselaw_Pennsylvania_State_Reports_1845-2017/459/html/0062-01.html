They proceeded to the subway station at 30th and Market Streets, where they jumped one Steven Kreloff, beat him badly and robbed him of money and other valuables. Almost immediately thereafter they attacked, beat and robbed one Harry Pollack, and then threw him onto the subway tracks. Pollack subsequently died of the beating and fall. The appellant and his accomplices then scattered, only to regroup about an hour later. At that time, Jones snatched a purse from one Annie Thomas, a pedestrian. Appellant and two of his companions were arrested approximately 10-20 minutes after the purse snatching.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

At trial, appellant renewed his attack on the confession by offering the testimony of a psychiatrist concerning his, Jones’, subnormal mental capacity and lack of verbal facility, and his consequent inability to have given the confession which the Commonwealth attributed to him.

The gist of the psychiatrist’s testimony, he said, would be that, in light of the defendant’s mental capacity, his I.Q. and lack of verbal facility, defendant would have been incapable of giving a statement of the length and continuity of the one allegedly given by the defendant to the police. Counsel indicated that the psychiatrist would testify that in his opinion the interrogating detective had interjected questions which were not reflected in the statement. He further stated that the purpose of the psychiatrist’s testimony would be to show that the defendant had an l.Q. of 71 and was a mild mental defective and that “these points would be important to the jury’s evaluation of the defendant’s statement”.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The trial judge’s stated reason for refusing the offer was that the psychiatrist was not <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>present when the statement was given by the appellant to the police; hence, presumably, was not in a position to contradict or impugn the police account relative to the giving of the statement. The court en banc, in rejecting appellant’s post-trial motions, concluded that the testimony was properly excluded since the “subject matter of the proffered testimony is outside the area of competence, even for an expert, on which to express his opinion”.</p>

While, on its facts, <em>McCusker </em>is not controlling in the case at bar, its rationale is applicable here: “Any analysis of the admissibility of a particular type of evidence must start with a threshold inquiry as to its relevance and probative value. A leading commentator has suggested the following desideratum for relevancy: ‘ [D] oes the evidence offered rendered [sic] the desired inference <em>more probable than it would be without the evidence? </em>. . . Relevant evidence, then, is evidence that in some degree advances the inquiry, and thus has probative value and is prima facie admissible.’ McCormick, Evidence § 152 at 318-19 (1954) (emphasis in original); 1 Wigmore, Evidence, §§ <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>9-10 at 289-95 (3rd ed. 1940).” <a href="/pa/448/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="448 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1944691" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0382-01">448 Pa. at 388</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20286" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="292 A.2d 286">292 A. 2d at 289</a>. Our analysis then proceeded in part as follows: “Applying the established principles of relevancy to a murder prosecution where a defendant asserts that he acted in the heat of passion, it seems clear any evidence — lay or psychiatric — pertinent to that defense should be admissible. The principal vice of rejecting psychiatric testimony, as the trial court did here, is that it excludes from the consideration of the factfinders evidence of probative value vital to a determination of defendant’s state of mind.” <a href="/pa/448/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="448 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1944691" data-case-paths="/pa/448/0382-01">448 Pa. at 391</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=292%20A.2d%20286" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="292 A.2d 286">292 A.2d at 290</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Taper, </em><a href="/pa/434/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="434 Pa. 71" data-case-ids="1922570" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0071-01">434 Pa. 71</a>, 78, <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a><a href="/citations/?q=253%20A.2d%2090" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="253 A.2d 90">253 A.2d 90</a>, 93 (1969) (emphasis added). This determination was in line with the United States Supreme Court’s decision that limited mental ability is a factor which weighs heavily against the voluntariness of a confession. <em>Clewis v. Texas, </em><a href="/us/386/0707-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="386 U.S. 707" data-case-ids="6181228" data-case-paths="/us/386/0707-01">386 U.S. 707</a>, <a href="/us/386/0707-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="386 U.S. 707" data-case-ids="6181228" data-case-paths="/us/386/0707-01">87 S.Ct. 1338</a>, <a href="/us/386/0707-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="386 U.S. 707" data-case-ids="6181228" data-case-paths="/us/386/0707-01">18 L.Ed.2d 423</a> (1967). While the appellant in this case is mot strictly challenging the voluntariness of his confession, he is trying, by his offer of proof, to have the confession viewed in the perspective of his alleged subnormal mental capacity, and so to question the weight that should be given to it. In effect, he is saying that the statement in the format presented by the Commonwealth was not truly his own. We see no reason why opinion testimony by a qualified psychiatrist that, because of his low intelligence, appellant was incapable of giving such a statement should not be admissible for that purpose, notwithstanding that he was not present when the confession was made and recorded.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

On these charges, appellant received varying prison sentences, to run concurrently with each other and with the sentence of murder. From these seven judgments of sentence, appellant has taken but a single appeal, which was lodged in this Court. Since appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, he has a right of direct appeal from that judgment to this Court under the Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. 2, § 202, 17 P.S. § 211.202. Appeals from the convictions of the other offenses should have been taken to the Superior Court. The Commonwealth has filed no motion to quash, however, nor has it interposed any objection to the procedure followed. This failure to object serves to perfect this Court’s jurisdiction of the appeal unless the Court orders otherwise (Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. 5, § 503, 17 P.S. § 211.503). Since the issues raised are common to all the judgments, we have concluded that no purpose would be served by quashing the appeal, which we here treat as consolidated appeals from the several judgments.

      <p id="b167-6" data-blocks='[["BL_167.6",167,[175,1671,1143,112]]]'>. <em>See </em>Rule 702 of the proposed Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates which sets forth the following standard for the allowance of testimony by experts:</p>
      <blockquote id="b167-7" data-blocks='[["BL_167.7",167,[249,1785,1069,185]]]'>“If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.”</blockquote>
      <p id="b167-8" data-blocks='[["BL_167.8",167,[211,1974,1108,371]],["BL_168.1",168,[275,2272,1115,71]]]'>As the note of the Advisory Committee to this rule states: “Whether the situation is a proper one for the use of expert testimony is to be determined on the basis of assisting the trier. ‘There is no more certain test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.’ Ladd, Expert Testimony, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Vand.%20L.%20Rev.%20414" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="5 Vand. L. Rev. 414">5 Vand.L.Rev. 414</a>, 418 (1952). When opinions are excluded, it is because they <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>are unhelpful and therefore superfluous and a waste of time. 7 Wigmore § 1918.”</p>
