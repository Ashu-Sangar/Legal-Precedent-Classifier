We find the arrest here to be clearly without probable cause. The arresting officer had only a very sketchy description consisting of height, general build, hair length and complexion shade.

    <p id="b772-4" data-blocks='[["BL_772.4",772,[260,1036,1163,1069]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that probable cause for appellant’s arrest <em>as a murder suspect </em>existed because the officer observed the appellant engaging in an apparent shakedown. Since the victim was also subjected to such a shakedown, the Commonwealth contends the arrest was justified by the combination of description and modus operandi. Nowhere, however, does the record of the trial reveal that the' arresting officer was aware that the slaying occurred in the context of a robbery. The officer testified at both the trial and the suppression hearing that he initially stopped the appellant to investigate his suspicious activity, <em>as a separate and distinct occurrence. </em>Only after he had satisfied himself that nothing was amiss did he notice the appellant’s similarity with the broadcast description. Since the facts known to the arresting officer “at the moment the arrest is made” determines the legality of the arrest, <em>Adams v.

The Commonwealth seems to maintain that the description supports a finding of probable cause even though the number of arrests which resulted gave the appearance of a dragnet. To justify an arrest, however, the Commonwealth must show the <em>likelihood </em>that the person arrested had committed or was committing a crime. If a description is so general that a great many people can be arrested on the basis of it alone, the limiting factor of likeliness is discarded and the standard becomes one of possibility rather than probability.</p>

The trial court in its opinion accepted these propositions relying on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fogan, </em><a href="/pa/449/0552-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="449 Pa. 552" data-case-ids="1945680" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0552-01">449 Pa. 552</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20755" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="296 A.2d 755">296 A.2d 755</a> (1972), for authority. We find such reliance misplaced. In <em>Fogan, </em>the accused was undeniably arrested without probable cause. Several <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>hours after arrest the police learned <em>from the victim </em>that the accused had, in fact, committed the crime in issue. Police then gave the accused his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, confronted him with the new information, and secured a confession. We held the confession admissible not because of the time delay and the recitation of <em>Miranda </em>rights but because of the vital information (which in itself would have supported a proper arrest) that the police uncovered independent'of the illegal arrest.</p>
