On September 29, 1969, the Board of Supervisors adopted the recommended Comprehensive Zoning Plan, after deleting therefrom a section providing for multi-family housing. This Court on February 13, 1970, filed its decision in <em>Girsh Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/437/0237-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="437 Pa. 237" data-case-ids="1927788" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0237-01">437 Pa. 237</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=263%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="263 A.2d 395">263 A.2d 395</a> (1970), declaring as unconstitutional a municipal zoning ordinance which failed to provide for multi-family housing. On April 11, 1970, Harcourt Wells, Inc., (William H. R. Casey’s predecessor in interest to the property here involved) made an application to the Board of Supervisors by letter and submission of a preliminary plot plan to allow it to introduce multi-family development into the township. Simultaneously, the applicant questioned the validity of the township’s zoning ordinance and requested a hearing before the Zoning Hearing Board.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> The challenge to the ordinance was premised on two distinct grounds: (a) the ordinance did not provide for multi-family dwellings; and (b) the ordinance required a minimum two-acre lot for residential housing.</p>

Public notice of this proposed amendment was made on May 1 and May 8, 1970, and it was adopted on May 25th.</p>

On June 14th, the Zoning Hearing Board issued its decision dismissing the challenge to the validity of the ordinance. However, prior to this, or on May 25, 1970, William H. R. Casey, as successor in interest to Harcourt Wells, Inc., filed an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County contending, inter alia, the Zoning Board was “without authority to determine questions concerning the validity of the zoning ordinance.” A second appeal was also filed subsequent to the Zoning Hearing Board’s issuance of its decision, but prior to the hearing before the Court of Common Pleas. These two appeals were formally consolidated for hearing before the Court of Common Pleas.</p>

If so, then the unconstitutionality of the unamended ordinance would not be relevant to our decision as our consideration would then be focused on the ordinance in its amended form. The “pending ordinance doctrine” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> has been most carefully defined in cases involving zoning modifications vis-a-vis applications for building permits. It is well settled in this Commonwealth that a building permit may be refused if at the time of application for such permit there is pending an amendment to a previously permissive zoning ordinance which would prohibit the use of the land for which such permit is sought. <em>Hertrick Appeal, </em><a href="/pa/391/0148-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="391 Pa. 148" data-case-ids="1276881" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0148-01">391 Pa. 148</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20310" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="137 A.2d 310">137 A. 2d 310</a> (1958); <em>Boron Oil Co. v.

      <em>Oil Co. v. Kimple, </em>supra. While the facts presented .herein distinguish the instant, case, from the typical “pending ordinance” case, in that there existed no permissive zoning ordinance subsequently amended to effectively deny the application for the building permit, the same approach will be followed. If, as the township contends, there had been a “sufficient public declaration” of an intent to provide for multi-family housing in the township zoning ordinance, then the constitutionality of the ordinance must necessarily involve a consideration of the ordinance as it existed subsequent to May 25, 1970.</p>

The municipality could penalize the successful challenger by enacting an amendatory ordinance designed to cure the constitutional infirmity, but also designed to zone around the challenger.

The municipality is given an opportunity to cure the defective ordinance in accordance with the determination of the court without fear of a flood of applications by landowners seeking to take advantage of the invalidity. The original ordinance would remain in effect and subsequent applicants would be on constructive notice of the municipality’s intent to amend the defective ordinance and, therefore, would be unable to obtain vested rights based upon the ordinance’s invalidity. In effect, a moratorium would be effectuated upon the challenging of the zoning ordinance and the application for building permits until an amended, constitutionally permissible ordinance could be enacted.</p>

(1972)) was to allow a municipality to comply with the law by amending its zoning ordinance to correct any deficiencies without “the pain of suffering unwanted uses sought by those seeking advantage of the latest judicially discovered imperfection.” <em>Colonial Park for Mobile Homes, Inc. v.

      <em> </em>and, where such a good faith amendment was adopted prior to court proceedings, the trial court would be permitted to dismiss the challenging landowner’s complaint. Although the majority refers to the affirmative relief granted in <em>Girsh </em>as mandating similar relief here, it must be noted that in <em>Girsh </em>the “curative” amendment was adopted over three and a half months after this Court’s decision and more than a year after the landowner’s initial challenge. Furthermore, when this Court decided to grant specific relief to the landowner in <em>Girsh </em>(Order dated August 29, 1972), the issue was whether a township could in “bad faith” zone around the challenging landowner. The issue of bad faith was not presented here.</p>
    <p id="b331-4" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[192,1239,1145,529]]]'>I believe the trial court properly viewed this Township as promptly and reasonably curing its zoning ordinance in light of our <em>Girsh </em>decision. To hold in the circumstances presented here that withholding a building permit from Mr. Casey would chill future zoning challenges is an exaggeration. For even in the event that a successful challenger did not personally benefit by a curative amendment, under my reading of <em>Girsh </em>the landowner could still seek relief where he could show the township’s action was retaliatory.</p>

      <p id="b330-8" data-blocks='[["BL_330.9",330,[249,1265,1150,1009]]]'>. <em>See </em>Section 802 of the Municipalities Planning Code, as amended, 53 P..S. § 10802 (now repealed, 1972, June 2, P.L. 333 No. 93, § 13). In particular, this section provided that a township, upon being given notice by a landowner of his administrative and/or judicial challenge, had sixty days to amend the challenged provisions. Further, if such township cured the defect within the designated time period, the landowner was told he could either dismiss his former complaint or challenge the amended ordinance. Interestingly, although this landowner did not proceed pursuant to Section 802, the Warwick Township governing body on its own initiative cured its zoning ordinance well within the sixty days deemed reasonable by statute. Further, the only real differences between proceeding via Section 802 and as this appellant did (pursuant to Section 801) is that this landowner did not file the more detailed plans and drawings required by a complete application for development under Section 802(1) and that the Township Board of Supervisors was not specifically notified of appellant’s challenge pursuant to Section 801. Such differences, however, did not" militate that the lower court not consider the curative amendment that had been adopted prior to the time appellant’s challenge reached that court. In fact, in view of the incomplete nature of appellant’s application at the time of challenge, the Common Pleas judge held that a building permit should not be granted. Lastly, it should be noted that the majority’s interpretation of Sections 801 and 1009(2)ii rendered nugatory the more elaborate proceedings cited in Section 802 — a result the legislature could not have intended.</p>
