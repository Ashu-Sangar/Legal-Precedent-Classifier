After being questioned as to his gang affiliation, and denying any, defendant was inflicted with a small stab wound of his side. He proceeded to the home of a friend, Freddy Bright, 28 years of age, at 1719 W. Berks Street. There he informed Freddy and the other occupants, Robert Hendricks, 14 years of age, Samuel Bullock, cousin of Hendricks, 16 years old, Shirley Bullock, 14, and Leatrice Moore, 18, what had happened to him. Some 20 minutes later, at Hendricks’ suggestion that they go out and try to find the four 'dudes’ who had stabbed the defendant, Robert Hendricks and Samuel Bullock armed themselves with <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>butcher knives taken from the kitchen of the apartment. Defendant fearing to go outside alone followed the two out. He had a small paring knife in his possession. They proceeded to 17th and Monument Streets where they encountered an unidentified negro male. Hendricks asked the boy if he belonged to the GTO gang. The defendant stated that he told Hendricks to ‘Leave the boy alone,’ which they did. According to the defendant, a few seconds later Hendricks stopped another boy, the victim in this case subsequently identified as Thomas C. McAllister, 15, a complete stranger to the parties involved, and asked him what gang he belonged to. At this point Samuel Bullock is stated to have abandoned his participation in the project, started back to the apartment on Berks Street and, when about one-half block away, saw both Hendricks and the defendant swing at the deceased. A short while after Bullock returned to the apartment, Hendricks and the defendant came in. The detective testified that the defendant told him that he had not stabbed the boy, but that Hendricks had stabbed him and was bragging that he had ‘got a homicide.’ Both girls are said to have stated that both Hendricks and the defendant had knives. Shirley Bullock stated that she saw blood on the knife of Hendricks but that there was no blood on the defendant’s knife. Detective Lyons testified that his examination of the body of the victim disclosed one stab wound of the chest and the Report of the Medical Examiner stated that the cause of death was a stab wound of the chest.”</blockquote>

The appellant’s answers during the colloquy were responsive and intelligent. The trial court, after observing the appellant’s demeanor, disposition, and ability to respond to questions, specifically concluded that the appellant was knowingly and intelligently entering his plea of guilty.
