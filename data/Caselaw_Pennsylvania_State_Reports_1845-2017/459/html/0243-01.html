Bullock then told Detective Brown he took part in the robbery of Taylor, but insisted Taylor was shot accidentally. Subsequently, a formal or recorded statement was taken. Bullock’s version of the robbery and shooting in this statement corresponded with that given previously. However, it was more detailed. Upon its completion, Bullock read and signed the statement on each page. After this, Bullock made another attempt to contact his attorney by phone but was unsuccessful. It is the court’s ruling, refusing to suppress and in permitting evidentiary use of Bullock’s admissions and recorded statement, made after he told the police he wanted to contact his attorney “before I talk to you,” that is the principal assignment of error in this appeal.</p>

Therein the defendant, Phillip Clark, was arrested for the murder of a police officer who was in pursuit of Clark while he was fleeing from a robbery. While Clark was being apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, he was asked, “Do you want either to talk with a lawyer at this time or to have a lawyer with you while we ask you questions?” Clark responded that he would like to talk with his mother. Then he was asked, “Are you willing to answer questions of your own free will, without force or fear and without any threats or promises having been made to you?” Clark answered, “May I speak to my mother?” At this juncture, Clark’s mother was brought into the interview room and left alone with her son for half an hour. Afterwards, the detective returned to the room and once again asked Clark, “Do you want to talk to a lawyer at this time or to have a lawyer with you while we ask you questions?” At this point, Clark provided the police incriminating information. In <em>Clark, </em>we unequivocally decided that the question of “whether a lawyer was wanted cannot be said to be ‘interrogation’ without prior warning of constitutional rights, such as was condemned in <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.Ct. 1602</a>, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">16 L.Ed.2d 694</a> (1966); it was rather a further recognition of those rights, and preparatory to interrogation. We have defined ‘interrogation’ under Mi<a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>randa as including ‘any question likely to or expected to elicit a confession’. <em>Commonwealth v.

Franklin, </em>supra. In <em>Franklin </em>the defendant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, at which time he requested the presence of an attorney and all questioning ceased. During the next few hours, Franklin attempted to contact his attorney several times to no avail. A public defender was called to counsel the defendant, but Franklin was “not satisfied” with his services and declined to use the defender. Subsequently, Franklin was told by a detective that “we [the police] didn’t have to have a statement from him because witnesses had identified him but we would like to hear his side of the story.” At this point Franklin agreed to talk with the police and was given his full <em>Miranda </em>warnings before interrogation began.

In <em>Nathan </em>we held inadmissible a confession obtained under circumstances very similar to those which existed in this case. We believe that <em>Nathan </em>is distinguishable from the case before us in that there the police “advised” the accused that it was sometimes helpful to give a statement, then confronted him with a statement made by the girl who was with him at the time of the murder, and after he had expressed a willingness to talk, failed to warn him again of his rights. In the instant case there is no evidence of police advice or persuasion, and a <em>second set of </em>warnings was given <em>after </em>appellant said that he would make a statement in the absence of his attorney.</p>
