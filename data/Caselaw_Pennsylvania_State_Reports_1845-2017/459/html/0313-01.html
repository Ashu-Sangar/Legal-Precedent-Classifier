The test chosen by the legislature avoids some problems of enforcement of a Sunday closing law. The test chosen would permit enforcement officers to periodically obtain information as to the number of employees employed by a given retail establishment, and to maintain a list of those establishments permitted to open under the exception. To determine if the statute was being obeyed, stores open on Sunday could simply be checked against this list. If all retail grocery establishments were permitted to remain open on Sunday so long as no more than nine employees were <em>working </em>on any given Sunday, no one could see an open store and know whether the law was being violated. Enforcing the statute would require a weekly check of the interior of every store open on Sunday to determine how many employees were working. The legislature could have concluded that such enforcement considerations dictated that the exception apply only to those stores employing “less than ten” <em>at any time.</em>

We are also to consider the consequences of a particular interpretation. 1 Pa. S. § 1921(c)(6). We must presume that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable. 1 Pa. S. § 1922(1). The consequences of the interpretation suggested by the appellants would render ineffective the general prohibition against the Sunday sales of fresh meats, produce and groceries. The legislative objective of providing for a day of rest and recreation would be thwarted. We are thus unable to accept appellants’ interpretation. The trial court properly held that the appellants’ entire retail establishment could not remain open under the third exception.</p>

It is not the number of workers employed at a store or their family relationship that determines whether a shopper will give up his Sunday rest. Rather, the needs of the shopper and his expectation of finding products he desires shape his decision. Although the anticipation that the items sought can be purchased may be affected by the number of stores open on Sunday, it is unaffected by the number of employees working at the store or their family ties to one another. Clearly, the considerations which require us to strike down the family store exemption dictate that the small store exemption is also impermissible.
