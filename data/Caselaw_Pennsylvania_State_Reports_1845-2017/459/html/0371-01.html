The testimony established that at or about 2:30 P.M. on January 17, 1970, the deceased, a driver-salesman for a meat concern, while in the process of discharging the duties of his employment, was accosted by two men. During the course of an attempted robbery the victim received a gunshot wound to the abdomen which resulted in his death. A seventeen-year-old youth testified that while he was standing waiting for a friend, he observed the incident.

A fair reading of the pertinent testimony, set forth above, reflects at least a clear denial of the occurrence of the conversation described by Wilson.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> It was therefore proper for the court to permit cross-examination of Mr. Gwaltney on the issue regarding the occurrence of that conversation. Unquestion<a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>ably, the prosecution was surprised by the unexpected contradiction of Gwaltney’s prior statements to the police and his sworn testimony at the co-defendant’s trial. Furthermore, in contradicting Mr. Wilson’s testimony, Gwaltney’s testimony was injurious to the Commonwealth and benefited the defense. However, cross-examination beyond the denial of the occurrence of the conversation was improper and should not have been permitted. The only harm to the Commonwealth’s case was the denial that the conversation, in fact, took place. The effect of the witness’s failure to recall, when questioned, other events was neither helpful nor harmful, but simply neutral. We have held that lapse of memory alone is not sufficient to justify cross-examination of one’s own witness because it does not aid the opposing party. <em>Commonwealth v.
