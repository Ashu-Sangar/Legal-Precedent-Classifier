At approximately 4:00 p.m. on that date the victim’s brother, Wendell Brown, became involved in an altercation over who should use a basketball court with one William Wingate, a friend of appellant’s, at the Tustin playground in West Philadelphia. The fight, however, was broken up and Wendell left the playground. Wendell later returned to the playground where he encountered appellant, whom he had seen earlier with Win-gate. Wendell told appellant to tell Wingate that a basketball game was not worth fighting over. Appellant said, “you’re right” and claimed he would convey the message.</p>

While Wendell Brown was standing in the playground, Wingate and another man approached him from behind and began bludgeoning Mr. Brown with a baseball bat. The two men then retreated up a flight of nearby steps when Darren Brown came to his brother’s aid. Wendell urged Darren that he was all right but Darren responded, “No f_k that, no one f_ks with my brother.” He <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>then pointed a finger at the top of the steps and said, “Let’s go get them.”</p>

Wendell punched appellant in the face, shouted for Darren to run, and then fled up the steps. Darren, however, froze and was shot in the chest. He fled a short distance then collapsed. Appellant fired three or four shots at Wendell, who escaped unharmed, and then pursued his already wounded victim. Standing over his victim, he pumped shot after shot into Darren Brown’s prostrate body. Appellant then waved his weapon at the crowd and asked, “Does anybody else want some of this?”</p>

The case proceeded to a jury trial before the Honorable Paul Ribner. In addition to physical evidence recovered at the crime scene, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Wendell Brown and Marcus Watson. Since he had been fleeing for his life at the time of the shooting, Brown had not actually seen appellant shoot his brother; however, he did <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>identify appellant as the individual whom he had seen pull a gun as he and his brother ran up the steps of the playground. Watson had witnessed the shooting and identified appellant as Darren Brown’s slayer. In addition, both Brown and Watson had identified appellant from a photo array and in a lineup. The Commonwealth also introduced a statement made to the police by an individual named Hiram Smith on July 10, 1990, in which Smith had identified appellant as the man who had “emptied the clip” of his gun into Darren Brown. Smith, however, had moved to Georgia upon receipt of his first court notice, and at trial denied that he had been able to identify appellant.</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[289,968,1156,583]]]'>Appellant, meanwhile, presented an alibi defense in which he claimed to have arrived at Tameka Brown’s house at 5:00 p.m. on June 26, 1990, and to have been there at the time of the shooting. The defense presented the testimony of Ms. Brown to corroborate appellant’s story, as well as two witnesses, Daniel Hunter and Tyrone Simmons, who claimed appellant was not at the Tustin playground at the time of the shooting. The defense also introduced the testimony of Kerry Pleasant who claimed appellant had called him from Tameka Brown’s residence at the time of the shooting to arrange to have Pleasant pick him up at 6:00 a.m. the following morning.</p>

In reviewing such claims, we are guided by the rule of law that the admissibility of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and that an appellate court may only reverse upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b182-8" data-blocks='[["BL_182.8",182,[254,1226,1157,635]]]'>Appellant’s first three contentions concern the statements of Hiram Smith, a Commonwealth witness who had been an eyewitness to the shooting. At trial, Smith testified that he had been unable to identify Darren Brown’s assailant. In response to this testimony, the prosecution introduced a statement made by Smith to police on July 10, 1990, in which he had identified appellant as Darren Brown’s killer after viewing an array of eight photographs. Appellant now argues that the trial court erred in admitting the prior inconsistent statement of Hiram Smith as substantive evidence. This allegation is completely without merit in light of our holding in <em>Commonwealth v.

We subsequently reversed the judgment of sentence against the defendant and remanded the case for a new trial on the ground that two of the statements challenged by the defendant had been improperly admitted as substantive evidence. <a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>In doing so, we held that a witness’ prior inconsistent statement could only be admitted as substantive evidence when the statement had been given under oath at a formal legal proceeding, reduced to writing and signed by the declarant, or recorded verbatim contemporaneously with the making of the statement.</p>
    <p id="b183-4" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[127,678,1155,486]]]'>Under the present facts, Detective William Coogan recorded Smith’s statement verbatim, reducing it to writing as Smith made the statement. Smith then signed each page of the written statement. Such a statement, which was not only recorded verbatim contemporaneously but also reduced to writing and signed by the declarant, clearly satisfies the requirements of <em>Lively. </em>Thus, it was properly admitted as substantive evidence which could be referred to by the prosecution in its closing argument.</p>
    <p id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.6",183,[125,1227,1159,1141]]]'>Appellant next challenges the admission of a portion of the testimony of Detective William Coogan. The detective testified that Smith’s identification of appellant had taken place in the detective’s car after Smith had indicated that his wife was in his apartment, and that he did not wish to talk to the detective in front of her, because both she and her mother were pressuring him not to testify. Appellant contends that this testimony should have been excluded as double hearsay, since it included Smith’s out of court statement as well as Smith’s wife’s threats to Smith. We disagree. Detective Coogan’s testimony never mentioned a statement by Hiram Smith’s wife. Furthermore, Smith’s statement to Detective Coogan was clearly admissible since it was not introduced for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather, to display Smith’s state of mind. The fact that Smith was considering the idea of not testifying against appellant would seem to discredit his subsequent testimony in which he renounced his identification of appellant. Thus, under the present facts, Smith’s state of mind at the time of his discussion with Detective Coogan was relevant and the evidence displaying it was properly admitted under the “state of mind” exception.</p>
    <p id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.4",184,[304,320,1153,925]]]'>
      <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>Appellant also alleges that the trial court erred in admitting a statement made by Smith during an incident which occurred on September 12, 1990. Detective Coogan testified that on that date he was driving Smith, David Webb, Marcus Watson and Wendell Brown back to West Philadelphia after the four had viewed a lineup in which appellant was included. According to Coogan, Marcus Watson and Wendell Brown, both of whom had quickly identified appellant as Darren Brown’s slayer, began chastising Smith for not identifying appellant, stating that he had not done the right thing. Smith had then stated that he would straighten matters out and finally that he would testify. Appellant now asserts that this statement was improperly admitted hearsay. Such an argument, however, ignores that the statement was admissible both as a prior inconsistent statement on the part of Smith and as evidence of Smith’s state of mind. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the statement.</p>
    <p id="b184-5" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[300,1308,1156,649]]]'>Appellant next alleges the trial court erred in allowing the prosecution to question Tameka Brown as to whether she had defied her parents wishes in order to see appellant, and also as to whether she had continued to date appellant after appellant had become involved in a fistfight with her stepfather that had to be stopped by the police. This claim is meritless. Under the present facts, evidence of Ms. Brown’s unwavering allegiance to appellant, even after he had come to blows with a member of her family and had been forbidden to see him, was clearly relevant in order to show the witness’s bias in favor of appellant. The evidence was, therefore, properly admitted to impeach her credibility.</p>
    <p id="b184-6" data-blocks='[["BL_184.6",184,[299,1998,1152,370]]]'>Appellant also contends that he was deprived of a fair trial through the admission of other crimes evidence during the cross-examination of Ms. Brown.

At trial, Pleasant testified that appellant had called him on the evening of June 26, 1990 (the evening of the shooting), and asked Pleasant to pick him up at 6:00 a.m. on the morning of June 27, 1990. According to Pleasant, appellant called again at 5:30 a.m. on June 27th to wake Pleasant up. Pleasant then picked up appellant and drove him to North Philadelphia. In response to this testimony, the Commonwealth introduced a previous statement made by Pleasant to the police in which Pleasant stated that appellant had called him at 5:30 a.m. on the morning of the 27th. The statement, however, made no mention of a call on the evening of the murder. Appellant now argues that this statement was consistent with Pleasant’s testimony at trial and should not have been admitted. This claim is absurd. Pleasant testified at trial that he spoke with appellant on the evening of June 26. His statement to police, however, makes no mention of such a conversation. This is an obvious inconsistency which provided a basis for the admission of the statement as a prior inconsistent statement.</p>

In raising this claim, appellant essentially asserts that the prosecution was required to accept his version of the facts given on direct examination.

Specifically, appellant contends that this line of questioning implied that appellant had been responsible for the death of Albert Ragan. We find this claim to be without merit in light of the fact that the prosecution never stated that appellant had been responsible for Albert Ragan’s death, but rather, merely asked whether appellant had been in possession of certain firearms around that time.

In the present case, such a question was proper since Ms. Ragan’s knowledge of her son’s association with such violent individuals was clearly relevant in order to impeach Ms. Ragan’s previous assessment of appellant’s character, in which she had described appellant as a warm and loving son.

Indeed, the prosecution’s remark regarding whether it had “dawned” on appellant that he should not have been charged with the murder of Darren Brown does not refer to speech at all, but rather, deals with appellant’s cognitive process. The prosecutor’s question as to whether appellant had ever told anybody that he was wrongly accused, meanwhile, not only fails to mention the police, but is <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>also ambiguous as to whether it refers to post or pre-arrest silence. In light of these distinctions, the comments in the instant case cannot be said to have had the sort of prejudicial effect which warranted a new trial in <em>Turner. </em>This is especially so in light of the thorough cautionary instruction given by the trial court immediately after the prosecutor had made these remarks.

As in cases dealing with remarks made during the examination of witnesses, our standard in determining whether a remark made during the prosecution’s closing argument warrants a new trial is “whether the unavoidable effect of the contested comments was to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility towards the accused so as to hinder an objective weighing of the evidence and impede the rendering of a true verdict.” <em>Commonwealth v.

This claim ignores the context in which this comment occurred. In the course of his summation, the prosecutor, while discussing the credibility of Wendell Brown, argued that although he never had a brother, he could imagine and the jury could measure whether the emotional effect of the murder of Wendall Brown’s brother would facilitate his desire to remember the features of his brother’s murderer. Such a comment focused the jury on the evidence and its role as the factfinder. Thus, it was permissible and does not provide a basis for relief.</p>

This argument is unsupported by the record. Indeed, the record indicates that the comment was in reality a reminder to the jury of the gravity of their task. As the prosecutor stated, “Justice cannot fail here. We cannot have a failure of justice. A man’s life has been taken, and a person is accused of doing that.” (T.T. 9/27/91 p. 1085). Such a remark was not improper.</p>
