In this case, <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>the trial court erroneously held that Appellant was required to prove lack of knowledge <em>and </em>consent. It is clear that the trial court found that the evidence established knowledge on the part of Appellant. Nevertheless, evidence which establishes knowledge of illegal drug activity does not automatically establish consent to that activity. According to the trial court, the evidence showed that Appellant was not entitled to an innocent owner defense. <em>Commonwealth v. $2,523.48 U.S. Currency, </em>No. 90-01145, slip op. at 10. However, there is no indication that the evidence, if examined under the proper standard, would not have been sufficient to establish that his lack of consent was reasonable under the circumstances. It is impossible for this Court to ascertain from the trial court’s opinion where, if at all, its analysis went from considering the reasonableness of Appellant’s lack of knowledge to considering the reasonableness of Appellant’s lack of consent.</p>
    <p id="b724-5" data-blocks='[["BL_724.5",724,[278,1152,1157,624]]]'>The Commonwealth Court disposed of the issue of consent by comparing the actions of Appellant with the actions of the property owners in <em>Gordon Street. </em>The property owners in <em>Gordon Street </em>went well beyond what was necessary for them to protect their property; they were subjected to threats and physical violence because of their cooperation with the police. We refuse to require that a property owner become an adjunct to the law enforcement community or that he endanger his life or the lives of others in preventing the illegal activity of third parties. His actions to prevent illegal drug activity once he becomes aware of it must only be reasonable considering the circumstances.</p>
