The issue in both cases concerned the sufficiency of the evidence necessary to sustain the convictions. The two drivers argued that the tests did not accurately reflect the content of alcohol in their blood at the time they were driving because of the amount of time which elapsed from the time they were operating their vehicles until the time hospital officials performed the blood test. In both instances, each driver’s blood alcohol content only narrowly surpassed the 0.10% level — 0.114% in <em>Jarman </em>and 0.108% in <em>Modajfare.</em>

      <em>Id. </em>The expert further testified that if the driver’s blood alcohol level was still rising at the time the test was administered his level at the time he was operating the motor vehicle was probably less than the proscribed level. <em>Id. </em>“[T]here was no evidence upon which the expert could offer an opinion as to whether appellant’s blood alcohol level was in fact greater than or equal to 0.10% at the time of driving.” <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we found that the Commonwealth’s expert witness “could not determine with any degree of clinical certainty ... whether the level was in fact rising or falling at [the time the blood test was performed]----” <em>Id.</em>

Here, Appellee’s blood alcohol level was 0.18%, significantly above the 0.10% threshold. Additionally, the lapse of time between when Appellee was driving and when he submitted to the test was only forty minutes.
