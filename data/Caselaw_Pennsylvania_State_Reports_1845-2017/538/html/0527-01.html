As Mura turned left from Scotia Hollow Road onto Route 51 with intentions of crossing the two southbound lanes and proceeding onto the northbound lanes, her vehicle was struck by a car driven by Marshall E. Kelley, Jr., who was travelling in the passing lane going south on Route 51. The impact of the collision with Mura’s vehicle sent Kelley’s car across the center line of Route 51 into the northbound lanes where he collided with a northbound vehicle driven by Mary Miller.</p>

Mrs. Miller also suffered head and facial lacerations, a concussion, fractured ribs, various internal injuries and shock, pain and suffering. Kelley suffered neck, back, spine and knee injuries along with various body lacerations, abrasions and contusions. McCalla, Curley, Miller and Kelley filed suits against Mura, which were consolidated into three cases. Mura denied liability and joined Appellant in each action alleging that its design and maintenance of Route 51 was the cause of these accidents. Appellant attempted to join the County as an additional defendant and argued that its defective design of traffic control devices for the intersection of Scotia Hollow Road with Route 51 was the proximate cause of the accidents. The County filed preliminary objections to its being joined contending that it did not have a common law or statutory duty to erect any particular type of traffic control device at that location and, therefore, could not be liable to any of the plaintiffs or defendants in these actions. The Honorable Bernard J. McGowan, of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, agreed and sustained the preliminary objections. The Commonwealth Court affirmed, 141 Pa.Cmwlth. 710, <a href="/citations/?q=595%20A.2d%20796" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="595 A.2d 796">595 A.2d 796</a>, and we granted farther review to examine these lower court holdings in light of our recent decision in <em>Bendas v.

In that case the specific defect was the alleged failure to erect traffic control devices. The Court explained that there was no mandatory duty to erect such devices, but that once a township decided to exercise its discretion to erect a device, the township could be found negligent for failing to maintain the device.

Therefore, the governmental immunity of the County of Allegheny in this case is waived if a jury determines that the county allowed a dangerous condition on a street in its jurisdiction, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8542(b)(6)(i).</p>

The jury would be empowered to dictate significant alterations and additions to the infrastructure with no concomitant accountability for financing.

We held that a “dangerous condition” might include negligent failure to erect a traffic control device. . <em>Bendas, supra. </em>That, to me, should be the <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>outer limit of the scope of the duty of the Commonwealth or political subdivision. I would interpret “dangerous condition of streets” and “dangerous condition of highways” to mean the condition of <em>existing </em>streets and highways and absolutely exclude consideration of streets, highways, roadways, parkways, expressways, ramps, overpasses, underpasses, detours, and interchanges which might have been, but were not, built.</p>
    <p id="b701-5" data-blocks='[["BL_701.5",701,[117,721,1155,748]]]'>In this case, the allegations go far beyond what the statute contemplates. This is not a case of failing to maintain a stop sign once provided, or even a case of failing to provide a traffic signal where safety required; the complaint against the county in this case alleges negligence for improper <em>design </em>and <em>construction </em>of Scotia Hollow Road, for failing to provide a detour route, for failing to prohibit egress from Scotia Hollow Road to Route 51, for permitting left turns onto Route 51, for failing to <em>design </em>and <em>construct </em>a <em>ramp </em>or <em>overpass </em>at Route 51, and for failing to implement other proper <em>engineering </em>endeavors. Thus jurors are invited to consider the most radical and costly remedies to reduce the peril inherent in motor vehicle transportation. I believe these are legislative or political factors, not jury questions.</p>

I believe the executive and legislative branches, with political and fiscal accountability, should have sole authority to determine what streets and highways should be made and provided.</p>

However, I cannot agree that the County had such a duty in this instance. The collision did not occur on a highway owned or maintained by the County, but rather, occurred on a state highway. Moreover, the allegations of the complaint concern access to a state highway from a local highway, and the regulation of the flow of traffic onto a state road is beyond the authority of the County absent the consent of PennDOT. 75 Pa.C.S. §§ 6122, 6124; 67 Pa.Code § 211.6.</p>
