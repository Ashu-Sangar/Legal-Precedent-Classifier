In a classic <em>non sequitur, </em>the court wrote: “However, a court’s authority to review an arbitration award based on a provision being contrary to public policy does not give the court authority to review an award where the arbitrators refuse to apply a provision on public policy grounds.” The court held, alternatively, that even if it had jurisdiction to review the award, it would hold, as the arbitrators did, that under <em>Gerardi v. Harleysville Insurance Co., supra, </em>the territorial limitation clause is invalid and unenforceable as a contravention of public policy. Finally, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 8101, the court awarded statutory interest on the arbitration award from the date the award was entered, September 30, 1991.</p>

Appellee Hall, cross-appellant, argues that the Superior Court erred in vacating the judgment for interest, misconstruing the award of interest as damages which exceed the policy limits.

In short, a court has the power to review an arbitration award which is based on the declaration of an insurance policy clause to be void as against public policy, as the Superior Court correctly held. The Superior Court made short shrift of appellee’s argument that only a <em>claimant </em>may seek review of such an award. The court wrote: “Logically, we cannot permit a claimant who loses an arbitration decision to raise this issue and allow the court to review it, while under the same circumstances, prohibit an insurer from defending its policy provisions when the arbitration panel ruled they were contrary to legislative mandate.” <em>Hall v.

      <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>The holding of <em>Gerardi </em>had two major bases. First, subsection (e) of the uninsured motorist act sets forth three instances where the coverage required by the act does not apply; the three exceptions do not include territorial limitations; and the statutory construction act provides that “[e]xceptions expressed in a statute shall be construed to exclude all others.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1924. The Superior Court quoted this court to the effect that the uninsured motorist statute “mandates a floor of minimum protection to be afforded to the owner/operator of a motor vehicle within the Commonwealth. The legislature has permitted enhancement of that minimum protection, but we believe the statute does not permit a diminution of that protection below the statutory limits.” <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/481/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="481 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1747300" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0130-01">481 Pa. 130</a>, 139-40, <a href="/pa/481/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="481 Pa. 130" data-case-ids="1747300" data-case-paths="/pa/481/0130-01">392 A.2d 281</a>, 285 (1978).</p>

It provides an illustrative example of the logical fallacy of <em>petitio principii. </em>The syllogism representing this rationale may be stated thus: the statute requires worldwide uninsured motorist coverage; the statute authorizes three exceptions but does not authorize a territorial limitation; explicit exceptions exclude all other exceptions; therefore the statute requires worldwide coverage. The reasoning is valid only if one starts with the conclusion. Unless the statute requires worldwide coverage, a territorial limitation is not an exception, the rule of statutory construction, expressio unius est exclusio alterius — expression of one exception excludes all others — does not come into play, and the logic breaks down entirely.</p>

    <blockquote id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[351,2183,1106,96]]]'>(e) The coverage required by [the uninsured motorist act] does not apply:</blockquote>

An example might help to illustrate the point. If the statute had explicitly required worldwide uninsured motorist coverage but listed as an exception that an insurer might exclude such coverage in countries subjected to trade sanctions by the U.S. government, then the limitation set forth in the Arnica policy at issue would contravene the statute by virtue of 1 Pa.C.S. § 1924. The <em>Gerardi </em>majority conceded, however, that the statute did not explicitly mandate any specific territorial scope of coverage, but by assuming that <em>worldwide </em>coverage was required, it was able to discover a logical path to the conclusion that worldwide coverage was <em>required. </em>This defect in logic was noted by Judge Hester, dissenting.</p>

If we accept that the “purpose of the uninsured motorist law is to provide protection to innocent victims of irresponsible [uninsured] drivers,” then an uninsured motorist policy which fails to provide any protection to the innocent victims of irresponsible uninsured drivers would contravene the legislative purpose and offend public policy. But unless one begins with the point at issue, namely that the purpose of the uninsured motorist law is to protect the victims of uninsured drivers <em>everywhere in the world, </em>there is no reason to conclude that an insurance policy providing uninsured motorist coverage within clearly defined territorial limits violates the legislative purpose of the statute or contravenes any public policy. The Arnica insurance clause clearly protects the innocent victims of irresponsible uninsured drivers in the United States, its territories and possessions, Puerto Rico, and Canada; in so doing, it clearly effectuates the purpose of the statute. Whether it violates public policy by excluding accidents in Barbados is the ultimate question in the case and its solution is not advanced by the circular reasoning of <em>Gerardi.</em>

If uninsured motorist coverage were extended worldwide, the rates of Pennsylvania insurers would necessarily reflect the increased scope of the risk as well as the increased difficulty and expense involved in the investigation of claims. In addition, motorists who do not drive in foreign countries would be required to subsidize the additional costs of underwriting the risk to those who do.
