    <p id="b572-5" data-blocks='[["BL_572.5",572,[242,535,1162,1217]]]'>Second, in my opinion, the decision herein implicates an important question of waiver that should be addressed in order to protect Appellant’s constitutional rights. Significantly, an order suppressing physical evidence against Appellant was entered by the Philadelphia Municipal Court, and reversed on appeal by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Appellant’s subsequent appeal to the Superior Court was quashed based upon a lack of jurisdiction. Since we have affirmed the decision of the Superior Court, this matter will now be returned to the Philadelphia Municipal Court for trial on the merits. At that trial, the Commonwealth will be permitted to introduce physical evidence obtained from a search of Appellant that was arguably conducted without reasonable suspicion or probable cause. If convicted, Appellant will be entitled to appeal for a trial <em>de novo </em>in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. However, this trial is not <em>de novo </em>in the traditional sense. During this <em>de novo </em>trial, Appellant will be precluded from re-litigating the suppression claims previously decided by the Philadelphia Municipal Court and affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas, since this form of <em>“de novo </em>trial” has been held to not include pre-trial matters. <em>Commonwealth v.

In my opinion, the ruling of this Court now makes it incumbent upon Appellant to take affirmative action to preserve his suppression claims during the <em>de novo </em>trial before the Court of Common Pleas. Otherwise, they may be deemed waived by the Superior Court, since by general definition a <em>de novo </em>proceeding is conductéd as if the matter has not been heard before and as if no decision has been previously ren<a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>dered. Thus, I believe that during this form of limited <em>de novo </em>proceeding Appellant must at least raise, or attempt to re-litigate, his suppression claims and incorporate the relevant portions of the record created by the Philadelphia Municipal Court. In so doing, Appellant will ensure that his suppression claims will be sufficiently preserved should the Superior Court be called upon to review a conviction arising from the <em>de novo </em>trial.</p>
    <p id="b573-5" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[123,758,1156,1005]]]'>Third, in rendering its decision, the Majority has for some reason deemed it desirable to reference a “general rule” that all motions to suppress evidence must be presented in writing, irrespective of the fact that such was not at issue in the case. While it is advisable to file suppression motions in writing, it is my experience that under certain circumstances there is insufficient time in which to do so. A hard and fast rule preventing such emergency oral motions to suppress could conceivably serve only to harm, without adequate basis, the rights guaranteed to an accused by the Constitutions of the United States and this Commonwealth. I agree that the relaxed requirement in the Philadelphia Municipal Court has fostered confusion on this question in other jurisdictions, since Pa.R.Crim.P. 323 governing suppression of evidence contains no specific requirement that such motions must be in writing. However, if this Court is going to address the issue, it should be decided completely, and in a manner that would achieve consistency in practice before all jurisdictions. Therefore, I expressly disassociate myself from this portion of the Majority Opinion.</p>

    <p id="b574-6" data-blocks='[["BL_574.6",574,[306,667,1160,1451]]]'>In <em>Baker, </em>the Court of Common Pleas suppressed certain evidence seized in a search of the appellant’s vehicle. The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court which reversed the suppression order. The appellant appealed to this Court and we granted allocatur on the question of whether a revolver seized from under the seat of appellant’s automobile was properly admissible in a search made without a warrant. The Commonwealth argued that the appeal to this Court should be quashed as interlocutory. In the above-quoted footnote we rejected the Commonwealth’s contention that appellate orders suppressing evidence were not cognizable by this Court. I believe that this footnote did no more than reassert our longstanding authority to review appellate reversals of orders suppressing evidence where they present “special” or “important” reasons for such review. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v.

I do not believe that <em>Baker </em>should be overruled so as to suggest that all appellate reversals of suppression orders are interlocutory, thus precluding this Court from its longstanding practice of reviewing such orders where special or important reasons are presented.</p>

The instant case comes to us in a different form than <em>Baker </em>and the cases cited above. This case was not brought in the court of common pleas, <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>appealed to the Superior Court by the Commonwealth, and then granted allocatur by this Court. Instead, this case was brought in Municipal Court, appealed to the court of common pleas sitting as an appellate court by the Commonwealth, and then appealed to the Superior Court by the appellant. I agree with the Majority that <em>Baker </em>should be overruled to the extent that the above-quoted language in <em>Baker </em>suggests that appellate reversals of suppression orders are not interlocutory and appealable as a matter of right to the Superior Court in cases such as this. However, I would carefully limit our holding to this point. Although I agree with the Petitioner that the language in this footnote is facially applicable to the case at bar, I reiterate my belief that this language in <em>Baker </em>did no more than preserve our authority to review appellate reversals of suppression orders where they presented special or important reasons for our consideration. I do not believe that our intent was to make all such appellate reversals appealable as a matter of right to the Superior Court in the instant context. Thus, I agree with the Majority’s conclusion that appellate reversals of suppression orders are interlocutory in this instance and not appealable to the Superior Court as a matter of right.</p>
    <p id="b575-4" data-blocks='[["BL_575.5",575,[180,1518,1155,528]]]'>As with cases that originate in the Commonwealth Court and are granted discretionary appeal to this Court, defendants whose cases originate in the Municipal Court have an avenue for discretionary appeal. Pa.R.A.P. 1311 allows a party to appeal an interlocutory order to the Superior Court by permission by filing a Petition for Permission to Appeal. Pa.R.A.P. 1311(a), (b). Here, such a Petition for Permission to Appeal was not filed. Thus, I agree with the Majority that the Superior Court was well within its authority to quash appellant’s appeal and that we should not disturb its ruling.</p>
