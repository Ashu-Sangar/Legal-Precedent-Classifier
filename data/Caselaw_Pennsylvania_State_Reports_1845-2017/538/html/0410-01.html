    <p id="b582-10" data-blocks='[["BL_582.11",582,[277,1001,1156,1126]]]'>The record reflects the following facts which form the basis for appellant’s conviction. On June 10,1990, appellant and his father, Wesley Brown, who was then seventy-seven years old, were together in their home in Philadelphia. A quarrel between the two occurred over appellant’s use of his father’s car for “hacking,” that is, an unlicensed taxi service. Appellant shot his father four times with a .38 caliber pistol and left him to bleed to death in their home. A neighbor who heard the shots called the victim’s granddaughter; she in turn called her grandfather. Appellant answered the phone and told his niece that her grandfather was outdoors. Appellant placed a .38 caliber revolver next to his father’s body and took $400 from his father’s wallet, then drove off in his father’s car. He disposed of the murder weapon by throwing it out the car window in Maryland en route to Georgia. Two days later appellant was stopped at a road check in Georgia; a computer check of appellant’s driver’s license disclosed that the license was expired, that the car was stolen, and that appellant was wanted in Pennsylvania for murder. Appellant admitted shooting his father, but claimed it was done in self-defense after his father pointed a .357 magnum pistol at him.</p>

    <p id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.6",583,[194,1921,1158,311]]]'>Appellant frequently argued with his father over the use of the latter’s car in the hacking business. On the eve of the murder, they quarreled once more, and the victim reported to the police that his car had been stolen. According to the victim’s granddaughter, it was because he was afraid to stand up to his son and refuse him the use of the car.</p>

      <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>In the early post-midnight hours of Monday, June 11, 1990, appellant went to his father’s bedroom and shot him four times with a .38 caliber revolver. Medical evidence established that three of four bullets struck the victim, two in the chest and one in the arm, all of them travelling downwards through the victim’s body. The bullets injured the victim’s lung, aorta, bones and tissues, causing the victim to bleed to death in ten or fifteen minutes. There was a loaded .38 caliber revolver lying near the victim’s head when the body was discovered. There was evidence that the gun did not belong to the victim, and, by implication, that appellant took it from his collection of weapons and placed it there after the shooting.</p>
    <p id="b584-4" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[229,1057,1156,1305]]]'>Appellant gave voluntary written statements to authorities in Georgia shortly after his arrest and nine days later when he returned to Pennsylvania after waiving extradition, in addition to his trial testimony. In the first statement, dated June 13, 1990, appellant claimed that when he entered the bedroom, his father had a .357 magnum pistol aimed at him, that he panicked, became angry, and fired his own .38 caliber revolver at the wall. He also admitted that he could have retreated safely through the nearby door if he had not been angry. In appellant’s second pretrial statement given on June 22, 1990, he claimed that his father had a .357 magnum pointed at him and said, “I’m going to blow your brains out.” Reacting out of anger, appellant started to fall out of the room, pulled his revolver and fired without aiming. At trial, appellant testified that he angrily followed his father to his bedroom during an argument. As he entered the bedroom, his father had a .38 pointed at him. “Instantaneously,” acting “out of impulse, reaction,” he “dropped to the floor,” “spun around,” “rolled ... trying to get out of his aim,” pulled his own weapon and fired up from the floor without even looking. Then he “ran out of the room.” He later explained, “After I fired, I sort of like stumbled out. I just like crawled out. I ran out.” He testified that he was angry; he was scared; he was shaking; he was in shock; he was crying.</p>

It would, however, have been futile for defense counsel to object to the testimony, for it was not inadmissible hearsay. It was admitted to support the Commonwealth’s position that appellant’s self-defense claim was a sham and that he had planted a gun near his father’s body after killing him. Charlena Hudgins was testifying that the gun discovered near the body was not the victim’s gun, which she knew because she had seen his gun years earlier; she remembered the incident because he told her he’d left his home with the gun because his son had torn up their house. The victim’s out-of-court statement about his son’s violence was thus not admitted for the truth of the statement but because of its effect on the witness, causing her to remember the incident clearly, including the gun the victim brought to her house on that occasion. As the out-of-court statement was not admitted for its truth, it was admissible as an exception to the rule against hearsay. <em>Commonwealth v.

Then the transcript reflects that the prosecutor asked her, “But he told that to the police anyway?” She answered yes.

It is quite clear from the setting of the challenged question that the prosecutor was asking Carter about her statement to the police, not about appellant’s statements. Carter had not been present when appellant made statements to the police and could not have testified about what he told them. Moreover, appellant never told the police that his father shot at him, and it would have been pointless for the prosecutor to ask Carter to accuse appellant of having made such a false statement when he had never made such a statement.

Appellant apparently claims that the prosecutor, learned in the law, was well aware of the difference between criminal convictions and felony convictions. The mitigating circumstance at issue, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(1), refers to a “significant history of prior criminal convictions.” In the context of the prosecutor’s closing argument, however, the difference between a criminal conviction or a felony conviction was without import, as there was no dispute that appellant’s history of convictions consisted only of one prior manslaughter. The question was the significance or <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>weight to be accorded the single felony conviction. We cannot perceive any sinister prosecutorial motive in referring to “felony convictions” in closing argument.

This, too, is a frivolous argument. The thrust of the prosecutor’s argument was simply that appellant hoped to avoid full accountability for his behavior. Accountability means acceptance of the consequences of one’s actions; in seeking to avoid the death penalty, which the crime and the circumstances justified, appellant was arguably attempting to evade the full consequences of his crime. It was certainly fair argument on the part of the prosecutor. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As is all too common in trial practice, appellant’s post-trial motions presented only a boilerplate challenge to the “sufficiency and weight of the evidence,” neglecting to differentiate the differing considerations inhering in the different challenges, and neglecting, to specify what preponderant evidence was overlooked by the jury in reaching a verdict of guilt allegedly against the weight of the evidence. Thus the trial court, in denying the motion based on the sufficiency and weight of the evidence, did not review the evidence at length. In his appellate brief, appellant again fails to specify how the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, referring merely to contradictory evidence presented by the Commonwealth and by appellant. There is nothing in the record which was likely to shock the trial court’s sense of justice and cry out for a new trial in order to permit justice to prevail.
