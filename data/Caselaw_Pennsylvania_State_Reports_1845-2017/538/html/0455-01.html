If counsel had raised the appellant’s previous work record, the reference to work would only have highlighted and reminded the jury that it was appellant’s former workplace where he committed the murders. Counsel’s strategy not to divert the jury and cogently to restate appellant’s position was reasonable.

First, appellant claims that the prosecutor’s statement that the Commonwealth’s “best witnesses [the victims] are not here” was improper. The statement read in full: “Our best witnesses are not here. I’m sure if [victim] Mr. Smith was here or [victim] Mr. Presbery was here they would tell you that it was not my choice to go this way, it was not my choice to go in that kind of pain.” Appellant asserts that this argument is virtually identical to closing arguments found improper in <em>Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, </em><a href="/pa/455/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="85" data-cite="455 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="582030" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0525-01">455 Pa. 525</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="86" data-cite="317 A.2d 205">317 A.2d 205</a> (1974) and other cases. In <em>Lipscomb, </em>this court held that the prosecution’s remarks exceeded the bounds of propriety and constituted an appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury. There, the prosecutor’s remarks referred to the absence of his best witness (the victim) and estimated that if the victim could come back, he would say he did not want to die. <em>Lipscomb, </em>455 Pa. at 207, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20205" class="citation" data-index="87" data-cite="317 A.2d 205">317 A.2d at 528</a>. This court <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>recently reiterated that prejudice “might arise if such reference to the victim has the effect of arousing the jury’s emotions to such a degree that it becomes impossible to impose a sentence based on the relevant evidence.... ” <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b636-5" data-blocks='[["BL_636.5",636,[247,648,1157,943]]]'>Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the prosecutor’s remarks prejudiced the jury. The prosecutor’s argument was an attempt to explain why the prosecution had no witnesses to prove the aggravating circumstance of killing a victim to prevent him from testifying. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(5). Defense counsel had argued that the Commonwealth failed to show that the second victim had been a witness to the murder. The prosecutor then specifically addressed this argument and made an isolated reference to the victim, not to impassion the jury, but to properly address the reason for the absence of witnesses to prove this aggravating circumstance. Moreover, the trial court immediately charged the jury after the prosecution’s summation that it “should not decide out of any feelings of vengeance or prejudice towards the petitioner.” Hence, any possibility that the statements of the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passions of the jury was immediately addressed and corrected by the trial court prior to deliberations.</p>

The prosecutor’s statement, however, was a mere request that the jury reach a verdict that any reasonable person, whether the person be a prosecutor or not, would return faced with these set of facts.</p>
    <p id="b637-5" data-blocks='[["BL_637.5",637,[121,703,1158,873]]]'>Third, appellant claims that the prosecutor improperly asked the jury to “[s]end out a message about the conduct engaged in by that man [appellant] as he sits passively at that table, [that his conduct] cannot be condoned among civilized men.” In <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant has failed to demonstrate any impropriety. The passage that follows the cited passage is critical: “Tell him [appellant] what you did, when you did it, how you did and for the reason that you did it you must die.” Read together, the only message the prosecutor exhorted the jury to send was a message to appellant. Appellant has failed to demonstrate ineffectiveness in any of the above three situations and, therefore, the issue of prosecutorial misconduct is meritless.</p>
