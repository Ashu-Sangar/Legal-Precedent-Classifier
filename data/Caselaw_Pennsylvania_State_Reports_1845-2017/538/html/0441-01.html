An Order requiring appellee to pay $500.00 per month was entered upon recommendation of a Domestic Relations Hearing Officer. Believing that the award was too high, appellee sought a <em>de novo </em>hearing in the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County. Following the hearing, the trial court ordered appellee to pay $400.00 per month, while the guidelines suggested the amount of $513.00 per month. In' its opinion in support of its order, the trial court found the following:</p>

Plaintiff has been employed as a waitress, and has a minimum wage earning capacity. She is currently off work after having surgery, but plans to return to work in the near future. Her present husband is not employed and no explanation of his status was presented at trial. It is axiomatic that he has a duty to contribute to the support of his wife and child. The total monthly budget of Plaintiff’s household is $850.00 per month. The parties children constitute forty per cent of that household, and the sum of $340.00 per month reflects their reasonable needs. The Court has concluded that the reasonable needs of the children are about $400.00 per month.</blockquote>

The Court believes that an award in the guideline amount would <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>require this defendant to pay 60% of the expenses of Plaintiffs household, and thus subsidize plaintiffs current husband and their child.

First, with respect to the viability of the <em>Melzer </em>formula, the Superior Court ignores the clear and unambiguous language of the guidelines and corresponding rules. In <em>Melzer v. Witsberger, </em><a href="/pa/505/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="505 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1788910" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0462-01">505 Pa. 462</a>, <a href="/pa/505/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="505 Pa. 462" data-case-ids="1788910" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0462-01">480 A.2d 991</a> (1984), this Court set forth a formula for determining child support obligations based upon the reasonable needs of <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>the particular child or children involved together with the respective abilities of each parent to support their children. In 1989, however, this Court adopted the support guidelines found at Pa.R.C.P. 1910.16-1 <em>et seq. </em>Rule 1910.16-5 specifies in detail the applicability of the guidelines. Initially, the rule makes clear that the <em>Melzer </em>formula applies <em>only </em>where the parties’ combined income exceeds the amount of the guideline income figures. Thus, the Superior Court erred in holding that the guidelines do not supersede the <em>Melzer </em>formula. The clear and unambiguous wording of Rule 1910.16-5 provides that the <em>Melzer </em>formula is no longer viable where the parties’ incomes fall within the guideline figures. This is true even where the finder of fact, upon application of the guideline rules, determines that a deviation from the recommended guideline figure is warranted.</p>

Rule 1910.16-1 explicitly states that the amount of support, whether it be child support, spousal support or alimony pendente lite, shall be determined in accordance with the support guidelines which consist of not only the grids set forth in Rule 1910.16-2 and the formula set forth in Rule 1910.16-3, but also Rule 1910.16-5 which discusses in detail the operation of the guidelines.

The guidelines assume that similarly situated parties, at least with respect to income levels, will have similar reasonable needs and expenses. The reasonable needs of the child as well as the reasonable expenses of the obligor are factored into the support guidelines. The support guideline amount is presumed to be (1) a pay<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>ment which the obligor can reasonably afford and (2) a payment that is reasonably necessary to further the child’s welfare. The clear intent of the guidelines, therefore, was to do away with individual, case-by-case determinations of just what constitutes the <em>reasonable needs and expenses </em>of the particular parties involved and thus to limit the trial court’s discretion. In other words, the trier of fact need not, nor should he or she, consider in the first instance, the actual expenses of the parties in an effort to establish the reasonable needs of a particular child.

The case is remanded for the imposition of an award in the amount of the appropriate guideline figure.</p>

    <p id="Aest" data-blocks='[["BL_619.8",619,[621,613,193,41]]]'>dissenting.</p>
    <p id="b619-8" data-blocks='[["BL_619.9",619,[142,683,1155,367]]]'>I emphatically dissent. The support guidelines provide a starting point to calculate what child support should be paid in a given case. There is, as the majority states, a presumption that the guidelines are correct, but this presumption can always be rebutted by a presentation of facts in the case which suggest that the amount paid should be more or less than the guideline.</p>
    <p id="b619-9" data-blocks='[["BL_619.10",619,[142,1077,1154,144]]]'>The guiding principle is that the absent parent should pay his or her fair share of what is required to support the children.</p>
    <p id="b619-10" data-blocks='[["BL_619.11",619,[140,1257,1155,584]]]'>In many cases, that need is uncertain and so the guidelines are relied upon. In this case, the need is defined. The custodial parent, the mother, tells us, through submission of her monthly budget, that she requires $850 per month to support her family of five. Because only two of these five people are the non-custodial father’s responsibility to support, the trial court properly multiplied the required $850 by 40%, the percentage of the mother’s new family represented by the non-custodial father’s children. This calculation yields the amount of $340. Out of an abundance of caution, the court then increased that amount to $400 per month.</p>
    <p id="b619-11" data-blocks='[["BL_619.12",619,[140,1870,1152,305]]]'>This calculation and reasoning process were entirely proper. The whole purpose of the guidelines and of support hearings generally is to determine what amount of money is needed to support the children and to require both parents to pay their fair share of that need. This is exactly what the trial court did.</p>
    <p id="b619-12" data-blocks='[["BL_619.13",619,[140,2211,1152,149]],["BL_620.1",620,[273,311,1152,199]]]'>Furthermore, the trial court properly explained its deviation from the guideline. As Rule 1910.16 — 4(b)(7) requires, the court must consider, inter alia, “standard of living of the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>parties and their children.” In basing its order on the monthly budget for the family as presented by the mother, the court appropriately considered the standard of living of the parties and their children.</p>
    <p id="b620-5" data-blocks='[["BL_620.5",620,[272,559,1154,375]]]'>The majority “finds” that subsection (7) of Rule 1910.16-4(b) cannot be used to justify a downward modification of the guideline. The justification for this remarkable determination is “the premises on which the guidelines are based.” Needless to say, this justification justifies nothing. By definition, a guideline must be able to be modified upwards <em>or </em>downwards, depending <em>on </em>the facts of the case.</p>
    <p id="b620-6" data-blocks='[["BL_620.6",620,[269,975,1154,428]]]'>Generally, I agree with the majority’s conclusion that “the purpose of the support guidelines is to make available for the children’s reasonable needs the full amount of the guideline figures unless unusual obligations of the obligor limit his or her ability to pay the guideline amount,” but this has no application where the parties tell us what amount is needed to support the children and that amount is different from the guideline.</p>
    <p id="b620-7" data-blocks='[["BL_620.7",620,[268,1444,1152,260]]]'>The trial court is correct in reasoning that on the facts of this case, if the father were required to pay the guideline amount, he would, in effect, be subsidizing the mother’s new husband and child in addition to supporting his own children. Such a result defies rationality.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b620-8" data-blocks='[["BL_620.8",620,[308,1784,900,41]]]'>PAPADAKOS, J., joins this dissenting opinion.</p>
