The Superior Court found that the trial court erred by choosing Mr. Robinson instead of Appellee, Mrs. Rochelle L.

The issue before us is whether the Superior Court misapprehended the scope of appellate review as established in <em>Mumma v.

On April 19th of that year, Mr. Robinson filed a petition for custody. Subsequently, in May 1989, by agreement of the parties to share legal custody of Bobby, physical custody was awarded on a rotating basis with five days to the mother, three days to the father, and holidays divided on a rotating schedule.

Robinson v. Robinson, </em><a href="/pa/505/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="505 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1788853" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0226-01">505 Pa. 226</a>, 233, <a href="/pa/505/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="505 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1788853" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0226-01">478 A.2d 800</a>, 804 (1984). It is apparent from its reasoning that the trial court considered Bobby’s best interest when it formed the custody order. The trial court considered various factors in its decision to award primary custody to Mr. Robinson. These factors included: Bobby’s affection for both parents and both sets of grandparents; evidence presented at the hearing which indicated that Mr. Robinson would be more willing than Mrs. Robinson to encourage frequent and continuing contact between both parents and the rest of the immediate family; and the willingness and availability of Mr. Robinson’s family to care for Bobby while Mr. Robinson worked. Based on these <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>considerations, we find no indication that the trial court’s custody order was unsupported by the record.</p>
    <p id="b223-4" data-blocks='[["BL_223.5",223,[170,432,1158,639]]]'>Additionally, appellate interference is allowed only where it is found that the custody order is manifestly unreasonable as shown by the evidence of record. On issues of credibility and weight of the evidence, appellate courts must defer to the findings of the trial judge who has had the opportunity to observe the proceedings and the demeanor of the witnesses. <em>Holtz Will, </em><a href="/pa/422/0540-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="422 Pa. 540" data-case-ids="1901714" data-case-paths="/pa/422/0540-01">422 Pa. 540</a>, 547, <a href="/citations/?q=222%20A.2d%20885" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="222 A.2d 885">222 A.2d 885</a>, 889 (1966). Here, the trial judge observed the proceedings and the demeanor of ten witnesses. As a result of the proceedings, the trial judge was convinced that Mr. Robinson deserved custody of Bobby, and we find no evidence that his decision was manifestly unreasonable.</p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[170,1096,1153,316]]]'>Mrs. Robinson argues that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding primary custody to Mr. Robinson. She submits that her unemployed status would allow her to be available to care for the child all day and that this factor alone should warrant her receiving primary custody of Bobby. We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.7",223,[167,1445,1156,529]]]'>As stated above, the trial court weighed many factors in reaching its conclusion. The parties cannot dictate the amount of weight the trial court places on evidence. Rather, the paramount concern of the trial court is the best interest of the child. Appellate interference is unwarranted if the trial court’s consideration of the best interest of the child was careful and thorough, and we are unable to find any abuse of discretion. <em>Mumma v. Mumma, </em><a href="/pa-super/380/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="380 Pa.
