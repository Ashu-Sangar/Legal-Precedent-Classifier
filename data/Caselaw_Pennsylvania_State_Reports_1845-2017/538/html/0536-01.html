On September 14, 1990, Turkey Hill applied to the Fleetwood Zoning Hearing Board (Board) for a special exception and for a variance under the Ordinance requesting permission to install, a single self-service gasoline pump and canopy in the parking lot of its Fleetwood store. In addition, on October 10, 1990, <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>Turkey Hill appealed to the Board from the Fleetwood Zoning Officer’s denial of a building permit for the gasoline pump.</p>

In <em>V.S.H. Realty, Inc. </em>the appellant, V.S.H. Realty, applied to the Zoning Hearing Board of the Borough of Sharon Hill for a special exception to construct a convenience store and gasoline pumps on a lot located in a commercial zoning district. Retail stores, hotels, restaurants, auto repair shops, and motor vehicle service stations were permitted uses in C Commercial Districts in <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>Sharon Hill. <em><a href="/citations/?q=365%20A.2d%20670" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="365 A.2d 670">Id.</a> </em>Uses of the same general character as the permitted uses were allowed by special exception. <em><a href="/citations/?q=365%20A.2d%20670" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="365 A.2d 670">Id.</a> </em>V.S.H. Realty argued that the gasoline operation was of the same general character as a retail store and therefore, a variance was unnecessary. The Board denied the exception after a hearing on the matter because it concluded that the proposed operation was a motor vehicle service station and that the lot size did not comply with the dimensional requirements for a service station under the ordinance. The court of common pleas affirmed without taking additional evidence. The Commonwealth Court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the Board’s finding that the proposed gasoline business was more similar to a service station than to a retail store; therefore, the court affirmed the trial court. <em><a href="/citations/?q=365%20A.2d%20670" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="365 A.2d 670">Id.</a> V.S.H.

Hence,, the Commonwealth Court’s opinion in <em>V.S.H. Realty </em>lacks any accessory use analysis which would be relevant in this matter.</p>
    <p id="b708-4" data-blocks='[["BL_708.5",708,[239,1428,1156,964]]]'>The Borough also relies upon two decisions from outside our jurisdiction for the proposition that the sale of gasoline converts a convenience store into a gasoline service station. First, the Borough cites <em>Singal v. Bangor, </em><a href="/a2d/440/1048-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="440 A.2d 1048" data-case-ids="7947529" data-case-paths="/a2d/440/1048-01">440 A.2d 1048</a> (Me.1982). In <em>Singal </em>the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held that gasoline pumps and underground storage tanks were not a use accessory to a “grocery superette” in an area zoned as neighborhood commercial. The court found that gasoline pumps were structures, and that the applicable accessory use provision in the ordinance did not provide for structures incidental to retail stores. <em><a href="/a2d/440/1048-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="440 A.2d 1048" data-case-ids="7947529" data-case-paths="/a2d/440/1048-01">Id.</a> </em>Additionally, the court reviewed the ordinance as a whole and determined that because the ordinance considered the sale of gasoline undesirable even in heavy commercial zones, the legislative intent of the ordinance was to prohibit the sale of gasoline in neighborhood commercial zones. <em><a href="/a2d/440/1048-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="440 A.2d 1048" data-case-ids="7947529" data-case-paths="/a2d/440/1048-01">Id.</a> </em>Consequently, the legislature could not have intended a gasoline service station as an accessory use to a “grocery superette.”</p>

    <blockquote id="b713-5" data-blocks='[["BL_713.6",713,[233,994,1113,368]]]'>2. The installation and operation of self-service gas pumps on the northeast corner of 200 W.

In this case the letter of the ordinance states that accessory uses are permitted as of right, and is devoid of any additional restrictions or requirements upon them. Moreover, Section 802.10 only applies to a use permitted by special exception. Furthermore, any doubt must be resolved in favor of the landowner and the least restrictive use of the land. <em><a href="/pa-commw/142/0567-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="142 Pa.
