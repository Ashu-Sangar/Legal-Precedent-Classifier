When trial counsel called the witness to testify on his behalf, Michael refused to answer any questions concerning his whereabouts on the morning of July 17, 1988, pursuant to his fifth amendment rights. (N.T. 10/26/89, <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>578-79). At Appellant’s post-verdict hearing, Appellant testified that Michael might now admit that he was the one who committed the atrocities on July 17, 1988, because Michael would feel guilty for causing Appellant to be on death row for a crime that Michael committed. (N.T. 3/20/90, 3-6). However, much time has passed since Appellant’s capture, trial, sentencing hearing, post-verdict motion hearing, and appeal, and at no time has Appellant asserted with any degree of certainty that Michael has decided to waive his fifth amendment rights. In fact, the sole reason for making a request for the continuance was so counsel could find out Michael’s true intentions. (N.T. 3/20/90, 3).</p>

The trial court was correct in concluding that, even if Michael testified that it was he, not Appellant, that committed the crimes, this testimony would have been of little value in light of the testimony of the many eyewitnesses who knew Appellant and identified him as the shooter. <em>See Commonwealth v.
