He secondly asserts that since he did not fire-the fatal shot, he is not legally responsible. The trial court rejected these arguments on several grounds. The court initially concluded that this action was a “duel.” On the one hand, culpability would lie on the basis of the transferred intent doctrine. On the other hand, Gaynor’s actions (dueling) “were a direct and substantial factor in bringing about the death” (slip op., p. 6). The jury could determine that causation existed as a finding of fact. Engaging in “mutual combat” with intent to kill “provides the malice necessary for murder” (slip op., p. 4).</p>
