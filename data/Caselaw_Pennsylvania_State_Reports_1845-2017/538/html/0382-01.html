Later that evening, Ms. Little, called the police to let them know she had been involved in an incident and that she would like to have a police officer come to her house to talk about it. At about the same time, police had learned of the Appellant’s whereabouts and Appellant was arrested. After being given his Miranda<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> warnings both verbally and in writing, Appellant expressly waived his right to remain silent by executing a waiver form.

Specifically, the prosecution asked, <em>“During the course of that conversation, </em>Trooper Harriman, did [defendant] tell you that this incident was an accident?” to which Trooper Harriman replied in the negative. T.T. at 141 (emphasis added). Despite the fact that this inquiry specifically referred to the conversation between Appellant and Trooper Harriman <em>before </em>he reasserted his right to remain silent, the majority nevertheless holds that the prosecution’s examination regarding the omission of such information in his initial police statement was a violation of Appellant’s right to remain silent. However, the prosecution merely attempted to explore factual inconsistencies between the Appellant’s previous version of the events and his testimony at trial, not his silence upon his arrest. As demonstrated by the record, the prosecution referred exclusively to Appellant’s post-arrest statements, not to his post-arrest silence following those ■ statements.</p>

Here, the Commonwealth was properly comparing the accused’s “new” defense at trial with his post-arrest statement, thereby demonstrating an inconsistency with Appellant’s original account of the incident. It would be an absurd result to allow a defendant, who has waived the right to remain silent, to furnish statements to the police and subsequently permit him to hide behind the shield of the Fifth Amendment and not be questioned about the contents of those statements that he did make. We stated, “[o]nce a suspect elects to make responses, the import of those responses are properly available for the jury’s consideration. In such a case <em>the right to remain silent is not implicated.” Commonwealth v.

The majority maintains that it is irrelevant whether a defendant elects the right to remain silent at the outset or reasserts it at a later time. I agree. However, to suggest that we will also safeguard statements made after the defendant has renounced this right is beyond the protections guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. Therefore, once Appellant chose to <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>comment on the events surrounding the incident to whatever extent he so chose, he elected to have those statements used against him, including any reasonable inference drawn therefrom.</p>
