On July 29, 1986, while Mr. Morrison was on a brief visit home, he began to hallucinate and became violent. Mrs. Morrison requested that her husband be returned to Wood-ville. The Office of Mental Health (“OMH”) arranged for the local Chief of Police to transport Mr. Morrison from his home <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>to the police station, and for Appellant Schleifer Ambulance Service (“Schleifer”) to transport Mr. Morrison from the police station to Woodville. During Schleifer’s transport, while the ambulance was crossing the Fort Pitt Bridge over the Monongahela River, Mr. Morrison escaped from the ambulance, ran to the railing at the side of the bridge, and fell over the railing to his death.</p>

With respect to Appellant Schleifer, she alleged that the ambulance service was negligent in failing to assess Mr. Morrison’s condition; failing to restrain, control and monitor him; allowing him to escape from the ambulance; and failing to remain at the scene of the accident to assist the rescue squad.</p>
    <p id="b292-5" data-blocks='[["BL_292.6",292,[244,1134,1156,725]]]'>Before trial, Schleifer filed a motion in limine to preclude Mrs. Morrison from introducing evidence that the ambulance crew failed to remain at the scene of the accident. Schleifer asserted that the attendants’ leaving the scene did not affect their ability to assist Mr. Morrison, because they could have done nothing to help him after he fell. Schleifer argued that any probative value the evidence might have was outweighed by its prejudicial effect, as the evidence would serve only to inflame the jury and evoke sympathy against Schleifer. Mrs. Morrison argued, to the contrary, that the evidence of abandonment was admissible because it was probative of the ambulance crew’s lack of proper training and showed a continuous course of negligent conduct. The trial court denied the motion in limine.</p>

Jozwiak, and the ambulance driver, John C. Fritzius. The two men testified regarding the extent of their training in transporting mental health patients, described their pick-up and transport of Mr. Morrison, and recounted the accident and their activities after it happened. They testified that Mr. Morrison had been sitting <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>in the back of the ambulance with Mr. Jozwiak. While Mr. Jozwiak was distracted, enjoying the view from the Fort Pitt Bridge, Mr. Morrison climbed into the front passenger seat and escaped through the passenger side door. Mr. Jozwiak followed Mr. Morrison through that door and chased him, but Mr. Morrison ran over to the railing and fell off of the bridge. The ambulance crew “heard a thud” (Testimony of Bernard J. Jozwiak, Reproduced Record at 80a) and ran to the railing. They could not see Mr. Morrison, but they did see a boat in the river with a couple of fishermen on board. Fritzius and Jozwiak tried to signal to the men on the boat, but the men apparently thought they were merely waving in greeting and did not stop. Because there was nowhere to stop on the bridge, no telephone was available before the tunnel, and the ambulance was not equipped with a two-way radio, the crew decided to return to the ambulance and drive through the tunnel to a garage at the end of the tunnel. With the help of a mechanic there, Fritzius called “911” and reported the accident to an operator who said “okay, we’ll take over.” (Testimony of John C. Fritzius, R.R. at 179a.) Jozwiak then called their employer, Theodore J. Schleifer, who instructed the crew to return to the base. After returning to the base, the crew transported another patient who had been scheduled for dialysis that afternoon. Later that day Schleifer, Fritzius and Jozwiak went to the police station to complete a report.</p>

Mr. Fike testified that from the corner of his eye he saw an object fall, and then he heard a thud as the object hit the edge of the dock and a splash as it hit the water. He looked up and saw the ambulance on the bridge and the two crew members looking over the railing. Mr. Fike stayed on the dock for approximately fifteen minutes, but did not see anything float to the surface of the water.</p>

The argument even suggested that he might be found alive despite the admissions and evidence to the contrary. Permitting this despite numerous objections, beginning with a motion in limine, was a very serious trial error. The action of Schleifer in this respect was presented as cold and callous indifference to life and it probably was ill advised from the viewpoint of conventional opinion, but it did not contribute to the death of Morrison. The error in permitting the representation of the contrary requires a new trial.</blockquote>

Although the court referred to a second issue raised by Schleifer,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> the court found resolution of that issue to be unnecessary because the admission of the abandonment evidence alone was a sufficient basis for granting a new trial. <em>(Id. </em>at 6.)</p>

The majority disagreed with Schleifer’s characterization of the issue on appeal as being whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial, where the basis of that decision was the trial court’s discretionary ruling that the abandonment evidence should have been excluded. Instead, the court framed the issue as “whether the reason the trial court gave for granting a new trial was in itself an error of <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>law.” <em><a href="/pa-commw/148/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="148 Pa.

More specifically, the court determined that the issue was “whether, in a negligence case, evidence which is offered to prove breach of a duty need also be probative of causation to be relevant and therefore admissible.” <em><a href="/pa-commw/148/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="148 Pa.

On appeal to this Court, Sehleifer contends that the Commonwealth Court applied an incorrect standard of review in reversing the trial court’s order. We agree. The Commonwealth Court majority stated that it was to examine the trial court’s decision to determine “whether the reason the trial <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>court gave for granting a new trial was in itself an error of law.” <a href="/pa-commw/148/0245-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="148 Pa.

That statement reflects a basic misunderstanding of the standard that is to be applied in reviewing a trial court’s decision to grant a new trial. The misunderstanding appears to have originated from confusion regarding this Court’s articulation of the scope and standard of review of a trial court’s decision to grant a new trial. Therefore, we will examine the source of confusion and then explain the proper application of the scope and standard of review.</p>

The two terms carry distinct meanings and should not be substituted for one another. “Scope of review” refers to “the confínes within which an appellate court must conduct its examination.” <em>Coker v. S.M. Flickinger Company, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/533/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="533 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1837545" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0441-01">533 Pa. 441</a>, 450, <a href="/pa/533/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="533 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1837545" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0441-01">625 A.2d 1181</a>, 1186 (1993). In other words, it refers to the <em>matters </em>(or “what”) the appellate court is permitted to examine. In contrast, “standard of review” refers to the <em>manner </em>in which (or “how”) that examination is conducted. In <em>Coker </em>we also referred to the standard of review as the “degree of scrutiny” that is to be applied. <em><a href="/pa/533/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="533 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1837545" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0441-01">Id.,</a> </em><a href="/pa/533/0441-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="533 Pa. 441" data-case-ids="1837545" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0441-01">625 A.2d at 1186</a>.</p>

Thus, the <em>standard </em>for appellate review of such a decision is always an abuse of discretion standard.

That is, the intermediate appellate courts interpreted an inquiry into the “legal merit” to be a more penetrating review than an abuse of discretion review. The Commonwealth Court in the case <em>sub judice, </em>in particular, apparently believed that, in all cases where the trial court cites just one reason or a finite set Qf reasons for its decision, the cited reasons are converted into issues of law that the appellate court is to review <em>de novo. </em>In <em>Coker, </em>however, we emphasized that it is the <em>scope </em>of review, and not the <em>standard </em>of review, that varies:</p>

It is important to recognize that the trial court’s decision whether to grant a new trial rests on its preliminary or predicate decision as to whether any reasons exist for granting a new trial. In other words, there are two levels to a trial court’s decision whether to grant a new trial: First, the court must determine whether, colloquially speaking, a “mistake” (or mistakes) was made at trial. Second, the court decides whether the mistake (or mistakes) is sufficient basis for granting a new trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> The first decision — whether a mistake was made — may involve factual, legal, or discretionary matters.

The trial court expressly stated that it granted a new trial because the disputed evidence should have been excluded as being unduly prejudicial to Schleifer and because the manner in which plaintiff used the evidence further prejudiced Schleifer. It is well established that both of these determinations were within the trial court’s discretion: This Court has repeatedly stated that the admission or exclusion of evidence lies within the discretion of the trial court, <em>Commonwealth v.

For example, in cases where the cited reason for granting a new trial was the supposed inaccuracy or inadequacy of jury instructions, we have reviewed the trial court's decision as a matter of law. <em>See, e.g., Adams v.

Even assuming that the Commonwealth Court was correct in finding that the disputed evidence was relevant to the issue of the ambulance crew’s lack of proper training, it does not follow that the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the evidence should have been excluded. It is apparent from the trial court’s ruling on the motion in limine that it recognized that the evidence might be relevant to the training issue. See R.R. at 32a-34a. However, the trial court's later decision to grant a new trial was based on its determination that the evidence was presented in a manner that suggested that it was relevant to causation, and therefore its admission unduly prejudiced Schleifer. We note, moreover, that plaintiff was given the opportunity to, and did, present a significant amount of other evidence (including expert testimony and the testimony of Schleifer’s crew and owner) to support her contention that the attendants were not properly trained.</p>

Because we affirm the trial court's order on the basis of its stated reasons, we need not address the second issue presented by Schleifer— <em>i.e., </em>whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Schleifer was a common carrier for hire. We note that the trial court did not resolve this issue on its merits, as the court found the admission of the disputed evidence to be sufficient basis for granting a new trial.</p>
