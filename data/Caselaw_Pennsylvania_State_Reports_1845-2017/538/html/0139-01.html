In November, 1990, Preiser sued Viola for breach of contract in a suit filed in Broward County, Florida. Therein he claimed fees and expenses still due and owing from Viola.</p>

Only a qualified privilege (which does not protect a declarant against malice) applied to testimony given in this private proceeding. Our research reveals that, where the issue arises, courts in this country have often been reluctant to extend the narrow limits of absolute privilege and, hence, only a conditional or qualified privilege (not protecting malice) has been frequently held to apply to communications made to private professional peer-<a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>review organizations (including bar associations).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> What the annotation also confirms is that courts across this country have been frequently and easily able to distinguish between publicly mandated professional disciplinary procedures and purely private procedures where punishment by contempt or perjury charges does not exist. Our case law confirms this conclusion. In <em>McMillan v. Birch, </em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Binn.%20177" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="1 Binn. 177">1 Binn 177</a> (1806), it was held that words spoken by a defendant of and to the plaintiff before a church presbytery, in the course of the defendant’s defense against charges brought there against him by the plaintiff, were not actionable as long as the defendant did not wander designedly from the point in question. The defendant’s words were held to be subject to a <em>qualified </em>privilege. The proceeding was clearly private in nature.</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[301,1085,1155,525]]]'>In short, there is ample support in our law for distinguishing between public and private professional peer-review proceedings. The proceeding in the instant matter was clearly private and could only affect those who consented to it. That being the case, a fatal defect becomes obvious at once. Appellee, Attorney Preiser, was not a member of the Allegheny County Bar Association, nor was he a Pennsylvania lawyer! He neither responded to nor consented to the proceedings, but rather filed an appropriate action in a state court to resolve the dispute. These facts are uncontradicted in the record.</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[299,1642,1154,579]],["BL_313.1",313,[143,304,1155,603]]]'>For a privilege to apply to a private professional peer-review proceeding (and we do not instantly decide whether the privilege should be absolute or qualified, or indeed, whether any privilege is even applicable), the “accused” or the respondent in the proceedings must consent in some way to being a part of the proceedings. At the very least, he or she must be a member of the organization conducting the proceeding. That was not the case here. Merely being a licensed attorney somewhere in the country, and even sometimes appearing specially in Pennsylvania cases, is not enough to subject such an attorney, against his or her consent, to a <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>private fee dispute proceeding where the accuser’s pleadings or statements are privileged against claims of being defamatory, libelous, or reckless. As the Comment to Rule 1.5 of our Rules of Professional Conduct, cited above, states, lawyers should “conscientiously consider submitting” to a local bar association fee dispute committee. The rule is not mandatory and if a lawyer does not “submit” or consent to the proceeding, no privilege attaches to the text of the charges made and the complainant would be wise to commence a proceeding before an appropriate court or State Disciplinary Board directly.</p>

A clause in the hospital service policy at issue in that case made arbitration mandatory but nonetheless the contracting parties must be assumed to have initially contracted voluntarily (although this latter point was disputed by consumer protection organizations who filed an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief in the case). On the assumption that the contractual arbitration clause was indeed voluntary, the plaintiffs in the tort liability case alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>misrepresentation against the deposition witness, had clearly submitted to the private arbitration proceeding consensually and hence to potentially damaging testimony. This is unlike Attorney Preiser in our case who cannot be said to have consented to a proceeding whereby he might be libelled without safeguards against falsehoods in the nature of contempt or perjury charges being available against the libellant. <em>Moore v. Conliffe </em>is not inconsistent -with our conclusion in this case.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <blockquote id="b309-9" data-blocks='[["BL_309.9",309,[248,1978,1089,390]]]'>1. In contrast, membership in “bar associations” is an entirely separate matter, for one need not be a member of a bar association to be a member of the bar of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Indeed, bar associations are merely private organizations, not unlike other professional <em>or </em>trade interest-related groups, consisting of certain members of the bar who desire to associate for social, political, educational, travel, or other purposes. Organizations known as “bar associations” have no official court related standing whatsoever, and, as private organizations, are entitled to establish their own membership requirements, not restricted in that regard by rules of this Court.</blockquote>
