Children and Youth is an agency of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and, pursuant to law, is responsible for placing children who are wards of the Commonwealth with agencies for the purposes of adoption. Concern is a private child placement agency, licensed by the Commonwealth.</p>

    <p id="b364-7" data-blocks='[["BL_364.7",364,[248,1580,1156,785]]]'>The Complaint alleges the following facts: in early 1983, appellees Jayne and Frank Gibbs, who were already foster parents, inquired of Concern about the availability of a healthy Caucasian infant for adoption, (Complaint at ¶ 10) and were informed that there was a two year waiting list for healthy Caucasian infants. Appellees were actively encouraged by agency representatives to apply for the adoption of an older child, (Complaint at ¶ 11) and were told that it would be easier to adopt a “hard to adopt due to age” child, and that if the child had been physically or sexually abused, Concern would disclose fully the history of these occurrences. (Complaint at ¶ 12). Appellees were invited to look through a book containing photographs of older children available for adoption, along with brief positive descriptions of the children. (Complaint at ¶ 13).</p>

(Complaint at ¶ 14). After a home-study by Marsha Hiester, Concern’s adoption specialist, appellees reviewed the book of waiting children approximately twice a month at Concern's offices. On each occasion they completed a form for the child they wanted to adopt, and on each occasion they specifically requested a child who was “hard to place due to age,” but who had no history of sexual or physical abuse or any mental or emotional problems.

(Complaint at ¶ 18).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In addition to his age, appellees were told by Concern that Michael was presently repeating kindergarten, that he was Caucasian, and that he had been in foster care, but for only two years and only with one family. (Complaint at ¶ 19). Appellees were further informed by Concern that Michael was hyperactive, behind in his school work, had been verbally abused by his mother and that the major problem was neglect by his mother. Concern specifically denied any history of physical or sexual abuse. (Complaint at ¶ 20). In October of 1984, appellees were introduced to Michael and his caseworkers at Concern. They were given information about Michael’s foster family, and were once again informed by Concern that there was no history of sexual or physical abuse. (Complaint at ¶ 22). Later that same afternoon, appellees met with Brenda Messa, a caseworker at Children and Youth’s offices in Easton, Pennsylvania where they requested a more detailed social and medical history of Michael.

Shortly thereafter, Concern forwarded certain documents identified as Michael’s medical file, consisting of records of Michael’s birth and the medical history of his natural mother.

Prior to finalization, appellees met with Concern and specifically asked whether there was anything in Concern’s file that had not been disclosed to them. They were assured by Concern that they had been given everything Children and Youth had provided to Concern; but were told that Children and Youth had “promised additional information,” and that there was a “communication problem” with Children and Youth. Concern agreed to check all records to make sure everything was made available to appellees prior to the finalization of the adoption. (Complaint at ¶ 31).</p>

Gibbs. (Complaint at ¶ 32). Immediately thereafter, Michael began experiencing severe emotional problems. (Complaint at ¶ 33). He became violent and aggressive toward younger children, attempting to amputate the arm of a five year old (Complaint at ¶ 34); attempting to suffocate his younger cousin (Complaint at ¶ 35); attempting to kill another cousin by hitting him over the head with a lead pipe (Complaint at ¶ 36); deliberately placing Clorox in a cleaning solution causing Ms. Gibbs to burn her hands badly (Complaint at ¶ 38); and starting a fire which seriously injured a younger cousin (Complaint at ¶40).</p>

The adopting parents later learned that the child had, in fact, been born in a mental institution to a mentally retarded woman and had previously been placed with several foster families. The adoption agency was well aware of these facts and that the child was developing slowly, but provided the adopting parents a fictional story about the child’s medical history. The parents sued the adoption agency for intentional misrepresentation, and the Ohio Supreme Court upheld an award of damages, concluding that “[i]t would be a travesty of justice and a distortion of the truth to conclude that deceitful placement of this infant, known by [the adoption agency] to be at risk, was not actionable when the tragic, but hidden realities of the child’s infirmities finally came to light.” <em>Burr, </em><a href="/ohio-st-3d/23/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="23 Ohio St. 3d 69" data-case-ids="1822561" data-case-paths="/ohio-st-3d/23/0069-01">23 Ohio St.3d at 75</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=491%20N.E.2d%201101" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="491 N.E.2d 1101">491 N.E.2d at 1107</a>.</p>

We now hold, in accord with the unanimous decisions of our sister jurisdictions, that the cause of action for intentional misrepresentation is equally applicable in the adoption context. Such application will further the goal of providing prospective parents with full and accurate information about the child, and, at the same time will inhibit adoption agencies from providing false information. Adopting parents will then be able to make informed choices about adoption, ensuring that they have the emotional and financial resources to care properly for the child they have consented to adopt. This truthfulness in the adoption process will, thus, result in fewer failed adoptions and enhance public confidence in the process. We, like the court in <em>Burr, supra, </em>believe that it would be a “travesty of justice” to allow adoption agencies to engage in deceitful and fraudulent conduct with impunity. <em>See Burr, </em><a href="/ohio-st-3d/23/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="23 Ohio St. 3d 69" data-case-ids="1822561" data-case-paths="/ohio-st-3d/23/0069-01">23 Ohio St.3d at 75-76</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=491%20N.E.2d%201101" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="491 N.E.2d 1101">491 N.E.2d at 1107</a>.</p>

Negligent misrepresentation, however, requires that the adoption agency make reasonable efforts to determine whether its representations are true. Blair, <em>supra, </em>at 946. Nevertheless, we believe that this admittedly'heavier burden is tempered in several ways. First, agencies are only under the obligation to make <em>reasonable </em>efforts to determine if their statements are true. Thus, adoption agencies need not offer warranties or guarantees as to the information they provide. Second, as aptly stated by the court in <em>Meracle, </em>agencies may refrain from making any representations at all if they find that the burden of reasonable investigation is too harsh. While we adopt the traditional common-law cause of action of negligent misrepresentation in the adoption setting today, we in no way imply that adoption agencies are insurors or warrantors of a child’s health. The tort we now recognize is not similar to, nor can it be compared with products liability or contractual warranties. Adoption agencies must merely use reasonable care to insure that the information they communicate is accurate, and the parents must show that any negligently communicated information is <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>causally related to their damages.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a> We believe that this tort is sufficiently restricted by the common law notion of foreseeability as found in the concepts of duty and proximate cause to prevent it from becoming in any way a guarantee or warranty of a child’s future health.</p>

The Act further provides that thé intermediary “shall deliver such information to the adopting parents or their physician.” 23 Pa.C.S. § 2909(a). The effort at collection required by Section 2533(b)(12) must be made in good faith, and if it fails, the failure must be explained. Once medical information has been obtained pursuant to Section 2533(b)(12), Section 2909(a) creates an obligation on the part of the adoption intermediary to disclose it fully and accurately. Our legislature used the word “shall” in this statute and we must abide by its plain meaning. “Shall” evidences the legislative intent to mandate that adoption agencies must fully and accurately divulge to the prospective parents all the information they have obtained. The statute gives adoption agencies no discretion to disclose information selectively. In fact, our legislature was so in favor of full disclosure as to provide explicitly in the Act that even otherwise confidential or privileged information must be released after material identifying the biological parents has been removed. <em>See </em>23 Pa.C.S. § 2102.

It can be argued that adoptive parents are entitled to no notice of medical problems, since natural parents receive no advance warning of a child’s special needs. However, the risks assumed by adoptive parents are, in truth, very different from those of adoptive parents. <em>See </em>Blair, <em>supra, </em>at 889-90; Connelly, <em>supra, </em>at 796; Note, <em>When Love is Not Enough: Toward a Unified Wrongful Adoption Tort, </em><a href="/citations/?q=105%20Harv.%20L.%20Rev.%201761" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="105 Harv. L. Rev. 1761">105 Harv.L.Rev. 1761</a>, 1777 (1992). Biological parents, theoretically at least, are aware of their medical histories and can decide to have a child with knowledge of, e.g., an increased risk of genetic abnormality. Adoptive parents, without full and accurate information, have no way of knowing if the adoptee has a risk of a genetic problem. <em>See </em>Connelly, <em>supra, </em>at 796. This Court is also mindful that adoptive parents are performing a valuable social service in providing a family to otherwise unwanted children. <em>See When Love is Not Enough, supra, </em>at 1777. In light of this contribution to society, it is only equitable to conclude that adoptive parents should not be asked to assume unwittingly the same risks as natural parents.</p>
