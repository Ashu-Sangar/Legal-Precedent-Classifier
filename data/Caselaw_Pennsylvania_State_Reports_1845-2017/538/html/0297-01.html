The convictions arose from Thompson’s shooting of Bill Moye outside a crack house in Philadelphia because Moye owed him money. At the penalty phase of the trial, the jury unanimously determined that the Commonwealth established aggravating circumstance (d)(6) (a killing committed while in the perpetration of a felony),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and some of the jurors found that Thompson established mitigating circumstance (e)(8) (mitigating evidence concerning defendant’s character, record, and the circumstances of the crime).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> They unanimously found that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance and sentenced the defendant to death.</p>

Testimony established that shortly before the murder, Thompson, carrying a revolver, entered the house at 3849 North Broad Street along with his co-conspirator, and asked whether the victim was present. Persons who were in the house told him that the victim was not present, but Thompson, still holding the revolver, searched the house anyway. Thompson and his co-conspirator then left the house, and shortly after they left, Thompson was heard arguing loudly with the victim and demanding the payment of money. In response to the victim’s plea for more time, Thompson stated: “I gave you time.” The victim said, “No, man. No. Don’t do it. Don’t do it.” Then a shot was heard, following which a group of people who had been in the crack house came out of the house and saw Thompson, still holding the revolver, and his co-conspirator standing next to the prone body of the victim. The victim was not yet dead, and Thompson was still arguing with him about payment of the debt.</p>

One of the witnesses, Ms. Mouzon, testified that her boyfriend, Hank, was cradling the victim’s head, and said that “he” did not have to shoot the victim; that “he” was going to get his money. Another witness, Roberson, identified the shooter as Thompson. A third witness, deceased at the time of trial, stated at the preliminary hearing that the victim, as he lay dying, identified Thompson as the person who shot him. Thompson admitted to police that he was at the crime scene and that he got into an argument and scuffle with the victim because of a debt.</p>

    <p id="b471-7" data-blocks='[["BL_471.7",471,[113,1200,1158,422]]]'>Thompson acknowledges that an intent to kill <em>may </em>be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon against the vital part of the victim’s body, but argues that since the inference is permissive only, it should not have been drawn. Having conceded this much, Thompson’s claim must fail because if the jury may conclude that the inference of intent may be drawn, and it in fact drew that inference, it did no more than it was permitted to do.</p>

The robbery was complete when Thompson shot the victim in the course of attempting to take money from him, regardless of subsequent conduct of the co-actor and regardless of whether any property was actually taken.

Thompson is responsible for the acts of the co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, <em>Commonwealth v.

They are things that make a first degree murder either more terrible or less terrible. You are the only ones who decide what things in your opinion and in your mind make a killing more terrible or less terrible. Aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances have equal importance. Your verdict must be a sentence of death if you unanimously find, that is all of you find, at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or if you find one aggravating circumstance which outweighs any mitigating circumstance.
