In <em>Roxberry, </em>the defendant raised an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on trial counsel’s failure to object to the omission of an alibi instruction. The defendant presented evidence that he was in a bar four blocks away from the scene of a crime which occurred between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. He testified that he was drinking in the bar from 8:00 p.m. until 1:00 a.m. on the night of the crime. This Court refused to establish a minimum distance requirement between the scene of the crime and where the defendant claims to have been when the crime occurred in order for the defendant to assert an alibi defense. We held that “[tjhere is no minimum or threshold quantum of physical separation necessary for a defense to constitute an alibi, so long as the separation makes it impossible for the defendant to have committed the crime.” <em>Id.</em>

    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[290,1179,1158,837]]]'>In the instant case, Appellant presented evidence that he was approximately 150 feet away from the tire when he was arrested. The testimony regarding Appellant’s location, along with the testimony that the “true owner” of the paper bag ran past the car just prior to Appellant’s arrest, does not show that he was removed from the scene of the crime nor that it was impossible for him to have placed the bag under the tire. The scene of the crime is not limited to the tire where the bag was hidden. If the true owner of the bag did run past Appellant, the scene of the crime encompassed the area where he ran. As the Superior Court stated, “the testimony of the witnesses does not place Appellant away from the scene of the crime, but rather implies that Appellant was at the scene and that the officers mistakenly identified him as the one who had hidden the bag____” <a href="/pa-super/421/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="421 Pa.

For Appellant to have been misidentified as the man who ran by, , he must have been close enough to the scene that such a misidentification could have been made. After Officer Fontanez saw Appellant place the bag under the tire, he checked its <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>contents and then signaled for his partner to arrest Appellant. Between the time Officer Fontanez saw Appellant place the bag under the tire and the time his partner made the arrest, it is possible that Appellant could have reached the parked car after having hid the bag. Unlike the defendant in <em>Roxberry, </em>whose evidence, if believed, would have made it impossible for him to have committed the crime, the instant Appellant presented evidence placing him at the scene of the crime. This is strengthened by Appellant’s defense of misidentification: if Appellant was not at the scene of the crime, he could not have been mistaken for the running man. The testimony placing Appellant at the parked car does not establish an alibi since Appellant was not removed from the scene of the crime and since it was physically possible for him to have committed the crime. Therefore, he was not entitled to an alibi instruction.</p>
