The MVFRL was amended by the Act of February 7,1990, P.L. 11 (Act 6). The amendment established a peer review plan for evaluating treatment, health care services, products or accommodations provided to a person injured in an automobile accident. The issue is whether an insured must seek reconsideration of an adverse peer review decision before initiating an action in common pleas court to recover medical benefits under an automobile insurance policy. We hold that an insured is not required to request reconsideration of a peer review decision before proceeding to court.</p>

At the time of the accident, she was insured under a policy issued by the Appellee, Pennsylvania National Insurance Company (Pennsylvania National).

The insurance company filed an answer denying responsibility for payment of the bills because the medical services provided to Terminator were unnecessary. The insurance company subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, asserting that Terminate had no standing to file suit in common pleas court because she had not requested reconsideration of the initial peer review determination.</p>

The trial court concluded that under § 1797(b)(2), a request for reconsideration of an initial peer review decision must be made and disposed of before the common pleas court may exercise jurisdiction to review the matter. The trial court construed reconsideration of an adverse peer review decision as a mandatory administrative remedy that must be exhausted prior to obtaining judicial review. Because Terminate did not seek reconsideration of Options’ determination, the court found that there had not been a final decision by the peer review organization that would enable it to exercise jurisdiction to review the initial decision.

Conceding that a PRO is not an administrative agency, Pennsylvania National argues that it performs a fact-finding function akin to the type of duties normally allotted to administrative agencies by the General Assembly. Terminato argues that the lower courts erred because reconsideration under § 1797(b)(2) is not a statutorily defined remedy that must be exhausted before pursuing relief in a court of law. She contends that the peer review procedure was not designed as a mandatory and exclusive method to resolve a disputed claim of insurance coverage and, therefore, cannot be a statutory remedy that requires exhaustion. Terminato emphasizes the language of § 1797(b)(2) that “an insurer, provider or insured <em>may </em>request a reconsideration by the PRO of the PRO’s decision” to demonstrate that the reconsideration procedure is permitted, rather than required.</p>

While a PRO cannot be owned by or be otherwise affiliated with the insurance company (31 Pa.Code § 68.3(d)), the law provides for the insurance company to select the PRO that will review the claim. The insurance company initially pays the PRO for its services. The insured plays no role in the selection process. Obviously, PROs have a strong financial incentive to appear fair in the eyes of the insurance company. Otherwise, the insurance company will take its business elsewhere. On the other hand, the PRO is not concerned with how the insured views the PRO because this will not affect its future business. Consequently, the PRO does not have the characteristics of an independent body for which the Legislature would seek judicial deference.</blockquote>

It assists insurers in making an informed decision regarding a medical claim by mandating review by a medical professional when the claim is challenged by the insurer. Section 1797(b) is a cost containment provision, not an alternative dispute resolution procedure. This accounts for the lack of involvement of the insured or provider in the process.

It is unclear from a reading of the regulation itself whether the Insurance Commissioner specifically intended to construe Section 1797(b) as precluding judicial review unless reconsideration was sought. It is possible that the regulation was promulgated in response to earlier challenges to Section 1797(b) brought before the Commonwealth Court in raising the issue of whether the statute entirely prohibited the challenge of a PRO’s findings in court when the reasonableness or necessity of the medical services has been challenged before a PRO. In <em>Pennsylvania Chiropractic Federation v. Foster, </em>136 Pa.Cmwlth. 465, <a href="/pa-commw/136/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="583 A.2d 844" data-case-ids="1408309" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/136/0465-01">583 A.2d 844</a> (1990), the peer review process was challenged on the basis that the statute violated the constitutional right to due process because the PRO’s decisions were not subject to review. The Insurance Commissioner asserted in argument on preliminary objections that the PRO decision was not entitled to review because it is an "arbitration-like” proceeding. In the alternative, the Insurance Commissioner contended that the Commonwealth Court could construe the statute as allowing judicial review by applying the principle of construction that statutes are to be construed so as to avoid unconstitutional results.</p>
      <p id="b238-7" data-blocks='[["BL_238.8",238,[259,1497,1121,270]]]'>The Commonwealth Court overruled the Insurance Commissioner’s demurrer to the due process challenge. The Court determined that it would be premature at that stage of the litigation to impose any constitutionally based construction on the statute because it had not been established with a sufficient degree of certainty what the due process rights of the Pennsylvania Chiropractic Federation would require in that context.</p>
      <p id="b238-8" data-blocks='[["BL_238.9",238,[255,1772,1121,578]]]'>The Commonwealth Court addressed the same constitutional challenge in its subsequent decision in <em>Pennsylvania Medical Providers Association v.

The medical association had filed a petition for review alleging that Section 1797(b) of the MVFRL was unconstitutional because it allowed a private, non-governmental PRO with financial interests aligned with the insurer to control the amount paid to a provider without providing for any judicial review if the charges are denied. The Commonwealth Court dismissed the petition for review, concluding that the Insurance Commissioner’s regulation providing for an appeal of a PRO’s final determination to the courts, 31 Pa.Code § 69.52(m), addressed the due process concern. The Commonwealth Court specifically noted, however, that it made no ruling regarding whether the regulations are themselves vague or inconsistent with the MVFRL. 149 Pa.Cmwlth. at 207, <a href="/pa-commw/149/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="613 A.2d 51" data-case-ids="1435274" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/149/0203-01">613 A.2d at 53</a>, in. 3.</p>
