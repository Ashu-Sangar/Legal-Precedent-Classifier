    <p id="b539-6" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[175,739,1156,1614]]]'>The Commonwealth sought to introduce expert testimony concerning retrograde extrapolation to show that Appellant’s blood alcohol content was 0.10% or greater at the time of the collision. In order to determine what Appellant’s blood alcohol content was at 1:30 a.m., the Commonwealth’s expert, Dr. Winek, used Appellant’s blood alcohol content as determined at 6:20 a.m. and attempted to relate this number back to 1:30 a.m. using retrograde extrapolation. (N.T. 11/20/90, 120-24). At the coroner’s inquest in this matter, Dr. Winek used retrograde extrapolation and determined that Appellant’s blood alcohol content was 0.134% at the time of the accident. (N.T. 11/20/90, 124). At a pre-trial proceeding before the trial court, Dr. Winek used the same method and indicated that Appellant’s blood alcohol content at the time of the accident was 0.155%. (N.T. 3/20/91, 60). Dr. Winek testified that he should also account for any alcohol still in Appellant’s stomach at the time of the accident since alcohol in the stomach is unabsorbed and has no effect on the central nervous system. (N.T. 3/20/91, 63). To account for this unabsorbed alcohol, Dr. Winek subtracted the amount of alcohol that would be unabsorbed in a 150 pound man after consuming two twelve-ounce beers and determined that Appellant’s blood alcohol content at the time of the accident was 0.105%. (N.T. 3/20/91, 79-80). According to the trial court, Dr. Winek’s opinion was based on a hypothetical “which is not only incomplete, but which elicits an expert opinion which is necessarily based upon ‘average dissipation rates,’ ‘average absorption rates,’ and the alcohol content of the ‘average’ drink.” <em>Commonwealth v.
