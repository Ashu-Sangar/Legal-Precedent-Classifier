Evidence with respect to Zdrok’s failure to pay the fine imposed at sentencing for the conviction, first introduced by Petitioner at the hearing, is clearly relevant to the type of discipline to be imposed inasmuch as it reflects on Zdrok’s respect for the <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>legal system and his behavior as an officer of the court. Additionally, Disciplinary Board Rule § 89.151 provides that “the participants may offer any evidence which is relevant and material on the issue of the type of discipline to be imposed,” including “a statement showing the dates, general nature and ultimate disposition of every matter involving the arrest or prosecution of the respondent-attorney during the preceding ten years.” Thus, the contempt conviction was properly considered by the Hearing Committee as a prosecution occurring within the preceding ten years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Finally, the record reveals that testimony with respect to his contempt conviction was properly elicited in response to testimony as to Zdrok’s reputation as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen offered on Zdrok’s behalf.</p>

The record reveals that Zdrok was well aware of what evidence Disciplinary Counsel would introduce at the hearing through the prehearing stipulation to the admission of various exhibits, which included the contempt conviction and documents relating to the failure of Zdrok to timely pay the fine. Additionally, much of the testimony heard on these subjects was in response to witnesses offered on behalf of Zdrok.</p>
