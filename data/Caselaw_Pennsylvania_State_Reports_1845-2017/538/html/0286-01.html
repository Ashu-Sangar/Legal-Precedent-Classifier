    <p id="b454-4" data-blocks='[["BL_454.5",454,[281,698,1156,838]]]'>On January 5, 1991, at approximately 2:15 a.m., a police officer sitting in a patrol car in the City of Franklin observed a station wagon that appeared to be traveling much faster than other vehicles that had passed by earlier that night on the same street. The officer decided to follow the vehicle to determine whether it was speeding. By driving at a rapid pace for less than one mile, he caught up with the vehicle, but, by then, it had left the City of Franklin and entered the adjoining jurisdiction of Sandycreek Township. The officer began to clock the vehicle, and continued to do so for one-half of a mile. Two-thirds of the clock occurred in Sandycreek Township, and the final one-third occurred after the vehicle left Sandycreek Township and reentered the City of Franklin.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> During the clock, the vehicle never traveled less than fifty-five, nor more than sixty, miles per hour. The posted speed limit was forty-five miles per hour.</p>

Suppression was granted on the basis that the officer’s pursuit of appellant from the City of Franklin into the neighboring municipality of Sandycreek Township was improper. This conclusion rested on a provision of the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a), which sets forth the circum<a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>stances under which a municipal police officer can pursue a suspect into a neighboring municipality:</p>
    <blockquote id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[235,422,1113,417]]]'>(a) General rule. — Any duly employed municipal police officer who is within this Commonwealth, but beyond the territorial limits of his primary jurisdiction, shall have the power and authority to enforce the laws of this Commonwealth or otherwise perform the functions of that office as if enforcing those laws or performing those functions within the territorial limits of his primary jurisdiction in the following cases:</blockquote>

    <p id="b455-8" data-blocks='[["BL_455.8",455,[188,1313,1156,475]]]'>The suppression court held that the officer did not have probable cause to believe that appellant was speeding before he entered Sandycreek Township, and, therefore, that there was no cause for the officer to pursue him into that township. The Superior Court disagreed, reasoning that the officer’s observation that appellant’s vehicle was traveling faster than other vehicles that had traveled on the same road that night was “enough to raise his suspicions and to allow the officer to investigate.” We do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b455-9" data-blocks='[["BL_455.9",455,[187,1822,1155,311]]]'>The test set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. § 8953(a)(2) is not whether an officer has observed something that would merely raise his suspicions, but rather whether he has probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed within his primary jurisdiction.

    <p id="b455-10" data-blocks='[["BL_455.10",455,[187,2159,1152,204]],["BL_456.1",456,[237,318,1156,471]]]'>The officer testified that appellant’s vehicle was moving faster than others that he observed on the same night.

The officer himself testified that he was unable to give any estimate whatsoever of that speed, and that nothing erratic had been observed with regard to the manner in which the vehicle was being operated. He also testified that he initially had only a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was speeding, and that he decided to follow it to determine whether, in fact, it was speeding. Clearly, therefore, probable cause to pursue appellant into Sandycreek Township was lacking.</p>

We find no basis in the record, however, to conclude that the officer entered Sandycreek Township for any purpose other than to determine whether appellant was speeding. This being the case, probable cause to believe that an offense had been committed in the City of Franklin was necessary to justify the officer’s pursuit of appellant into the neighboring township.</p>

Here, the officer had a reasonable basis to believe that a law of this Commonwealth had been violated prior to stopping the car. Thus, his stop of appellant’s car was not unreasonable.</p>

A police officer, sitting in his police vehicle in his primary jurisdiction, sees a car travelling at a more rapid rate of speed than other cars had been travelling past him. Believing that the car is speeding, the police officer takes chase to establish the exact rate of speed and, in doing so, passing into another jurisdiction and returning to his own jurisdiction. During the chase, the police officer clocks the car travelling 10 to 15 miles above the posted speed limit.</p>
    <p id="b461-9" data-blocks='[["BL_461.10",461,[197,1379,1158,478]]]'>Some of the clocking is made in the policeman’s primary jurisdiction and some is made in the adjoining jurisdiction. The entire clocking distance exceeds five tenths 0io) of a mile, some of it in each jurisdiction. The majority finds that since at least three tenths (*So) of a mile was not clocked in the policeman’s jurisdiction, the officer had no probable cause to stop the vehicle and any evidence obtained as a result of the stop must be suppressed. Thus, another drunken driver is set free upon the unsuspecting travelling public.</p>
    <p id="b461-10" data-blocks='[["BL_461.11",461,[197,1881,1154,475]],["BL_462.1",462,[221,303,1151,96]]]'>The majority keys in upon the policeman’s observation that the car was travelling at a higher rate of speed than other vehicles and finds this observation, by a trained police officer, to be insufficient for the police officer to believe that the car is speeding. Thus, the majority finds no evidence to support probable cause. I find this reasoning ludicrous because the alternatives are to allow a drunken speeder to continue unhampered or to equip every police car in Pennsylvania with radar guns or similar devices. Ergo, if you do not have hard <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>evidence to arrest, you cannot stop the vehicle which appears to be speeding.</p>

The officer, nevertheless, did testify that the vehicle was travelling faster than any other vehicles and sufficient to raise a suspicion.</p>
    <p id="b462-5" data-blocks='[["BL_462.6",462,[216,812,1157,203]]]'>The majority, second, then seizes upon the officer’s use of the word “suspicion,” couples it to the absence of evidence of a technical rate of speed, and mystically concludes that there was no probable cause on which to base hot pursuit.</p>
    <p id="b462-6" data-blocks='[["BL_462.7",462,[214,1040,1156,686]]]'>Probable cause has been defined repeatedly in our law as those facts and circumstances existing at the time of arrest which would justify a reasonably prudent person in the belief that a crime has been committed and that the defendant was the probable perpetrator. <em>Commonwealth v.
