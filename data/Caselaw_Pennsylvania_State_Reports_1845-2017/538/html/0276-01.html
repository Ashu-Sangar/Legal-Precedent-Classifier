We affirm the thorough and well-reasoned opinion of the learned Commonwealth Court.</p>
    <p id="b445-7" data-blocks='[["BL_445.8",445,[124,1199,1159,1050]],["BL_446.1",446,[305,313,1151,208]]]'>Appellants, Emerson Lightner and Gary Lightner are licensed agents affiliated with Appellant Stone and Edwards Insurance Agency, Inc. (“Stone and Edwards”). This matter began with allegations of serious insurance law violations by Appellants, which triggered an investigation by the Deputy Insurance Commissioner for Consumer Services, Enforcement and Program Services (“Deputy Insurance Commissioner-Enforcement”) acting through the Department’s Bureau of Enforcement. While the investigation of Appellants was pending, two insurance companies, Aetna Life Insurance <em>&amp; </em>Annuity Company (“Aetna”) and Colony Life Insurance Company (“Colony”), submitted applications to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department (“Department”) requesting that licenses be issued to Appellant, Emerson Lightner. The Department placed these license applications on hold pending the outcome of the existing investigation. The investigation resulted in the issuance of an Order to Show Cause by the Deputy Insurance Commissioner-Enforcement. Based upon the commencement of this “enforcement action” against Appellants, and the nature thereof, Lightner was considered <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>unworthy for additional licenses and the applications of Aetna and Colony were denied by the Chief of the Division of Agents and Brokers in the Department’s Bureau of Licensing and Financial Analysis.</p>
    <p id="b446-4" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[300,547,1156,909]]]'>The Department also placed “holds” on any new license applications by Gary and Emerson Lightner and Stone &amp; Edwards pending the outcome of the enforcement proceeding. Emerson Lightner appealed the denial of the license applications submitted by Aetna and Colony to the Insurance Commissioner, who appointed a hearing officer to conduct an evidentiary hearing. This “license appeal” was consolidated for hearing with the “enforcement action” due to the similarity of issues in the two proceedings. However, before such a hearing could be held, Appellants commenced two actions, in the nature of petitions for review, before the Commonwealth Court pursuant to its original jurisdiction. Together, these actions sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a mandamus to have the Department issue essentially any “new” licenses sought by Appellants without regard to whether the existing charges of insurance law violations rendered Appellants unworthy for further licenses.</p>
    <p id="b446-5" data-blocks='[["BL_446.6",446,[298,1482,1159,468]]]'>Upon initial review by the Commonwealth Court, Judge Friedman, granted preliminary injunctive relief in favor of Appellants, and temporarily enjoined the two consolidated matters pending before the Department. Judge Friedman then ordered the two actions consolidated for the filing of dispositive motions for summary judgment, since the parties agreed that the matter turned strictly on questions of law. The cross-motions for summary judgment were considered by the Commonwealth Court <em>en banc.</em>

However, this claim is not premised upon the actual investigatory and adjudicatory procedures currently employed within the Department. Rather, it relies solely upon the “potential” for commingling of these functions within the Department, because the Insurance Commissioner possesses ultimate authority as to both functions by virtue of the UIPA and relevant regulations.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> In support of this claim, Appellants essentially rely upon the decision of this Court in <em>Lyness v.

Given the nature and constraints of our various governmental bodies, the question of due process reasonably involves an inquiry into the nature of the process <em>actually </em>provided. It does not require, as maintained by Appellants, solely an inquiry into the comprehensive administrative authority granted to a single individual such as the Insurance Commissioner, without regard to whether the nature of the process actually utilized by that individual in administering that authority sufficiently isolates relevant functions to preclude the appearance of bias, partiality or prejudice.</p>

Based upon the evidence of record, it is clear that the Pennsylvania Insurance Department has erected sufficient “walls of division” with regard to the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of alleged insurance law violations. The Insurance Commissioner has retained the role of adjudicator, and delegated the investigative and prosecutorial functions to the Deputy Insurance Commissioner-Enforcement. The Insurance Commissioner does undoubtedly continue to possess ultimate authority pursuant to UIPA to investigate and prosecute insurance law violations. However, as a practical matter, the manner of delegation of these functions has sufficiently isolated the Insurance Commissioner from the investigatory and prosecutorial function, and the Deputy Insurance Commissioner-Enforcement from the function of adjudication.</p>

Accordingly, we conclude that Appellants’ unsubstantiated claim of commingling, and facial challenge to the UIPA, is meritless.</p>

      <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>Appellants first claim that they were entitled to notice and a hearing prior to the denial of the license applications filed by Aetna and Colony, and thus, they are entitled to have the licenses issued. We disagree. The initial denial of licenses complained of by Appellants is simply the result of a staff function performed by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, Bureau of Licensing and Financial Analysis, Division of Agents and Brokers. Appellants may appeal from this initial decision to the Insurance Commissioner, who as adjudicator, will conduct a formal hearing on the applicant’s worthiness. As Appellants will receive a hearing prior to final determination on these license applications, and there exists no authority for a hearing in connection with the initial review by the Bureau of Agents and Brokers, this claim is meritless.</p>
    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.5",450,[276,1128,1156,847]]]'>Appellants next argue that the Department has a non-discretionary duty to issue all licenses requested, without regard to Appellants “worthiness,” because Appellants already possess licenses evidencing their worthiness. In essence, Appellants’ claim is that they should be deemed worthy of new licenses until proven otherwise, irrespective of the existence of allegations of serious insurance law violations. This position is simply not supported by the relevant statutory provision governing the issuance of licenses, which provided that the Insurance Commissioner may issue licenses “when ... satisfied that the applicant is worthy of license.” 40 P.S. § 233(a) (repealed 1992).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Furthermore, a contrary conclusion, that the Insurance Commissioner possesses no discretion to make an independent evaluation of worthiness in light of the charges against Appellants, would raise serious public policy concerns.

Appellants reason that their livelihood as insurance agents and brokers is a protected property interest, which also encompasses any “new” licenses because those licenses are allegedly crucial to the continued pursuit of their livelihood. This argument is at most fallacious.</p>
    <p id="b451-4" data-blocks='[["BL_451.5",451,[186,828,1155,629]]]'>As discussed above, Appellants have no absolute right to the issuance of any “new” licenses absent a finding by the department that they are worthy to possess the additional license. Furthermore, it is not the absence of “new” licenses that is directly impinging upon Appellants’ ability to further diversify. Rather, it is their allegedly unlawful insurance practices in the past that have steered them into the wind, and caused the Division of Agents and Brokers to initially deem them unworthy to represent an even greater diversity of insurance products to the public pending the outcome of the existing charges or formal hearing as to worthiness by the Insurance Commissioner.</p>

This will prevent any wrongful delay of Appellants’ ability to appeal to the Insurance Commissioner for a formal hearing concerning their worthiness to possess any additional licenses. However, until such a determination is rendered by the Insurance Commissioner, Appellants clearly possess no property interest in licenses that have yet to be issued, which would entitle them to immediate issuance thereof or hearing beyond that which is presently provided.
