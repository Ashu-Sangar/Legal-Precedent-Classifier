    <p id="b727-6" data-blocks='[["BL_727.7",727,[111,1134,1159,686]]]'>On October 26, 1988, the videotaped deposition of Elizabeth Sully, a victim of theft by scam artists, was taken before the trial court. The videotape was thereafter introduced at trial before the same judge sitting without a jury and Appellant was found guilty and sentenced on February 20, 1992, to prison for a term of three and one-half years to seven years. The videotape taken on October 26, 1988, was made pursuant to an agreement by all parties that Elizabeth Sully’s age of eighty-eight years could result in her mental incapacity to testify at the time of trial. (R.R., p. 251.) Their prophecy was soon realized. Because of Elizabeth Sully’s subsequent incapacity to give testimony, the videotaped deposition was admitted into evidence.</p>

The defendant was accused of convincing the sisters to do unnecessary repair work on their home, buy appliances, have personal checks made out to the defendant, execute a power of attorney to him which controlled their financial affairs, and empty their deposit box of cash, bonds and certificates. Elizabeth Sully’s videotaped deposition in court detailed these acts and identified the defendant as the perpetrator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b728-5" data-blocks='[["BL_728.6",728,[292,974,1153,742]]]'>Although Appellant’s attorney agreed to the deposition, he reserved the right to test the witness’s capacity to testify at trial. (R.R., p. 19.) The trial commenced some three years later. After the court decided that Elizabeth Sully lacked the capacity to testify in person, the admissibility of the videotaped deposition was put at issue. Dr. Christine Martone, director of the Behavior Clinic of Allegheny County, testified that her personal examination of Elizabeth Sully nearly a year after the deposition revealed organic brain syndrome with dementia. Dr. Martone stated that the witness was not competent to testify at trial. In addition, and to the point raised here, Dr. Martone testified that her own review of the videotape led her to believe that Miss Sully was competent during the deposition. (R.R., pp. 129-130.)</p>

    <p id="b730-11" data-blocks='[["BL_730.11",730,[296,1405,1156,846]]]'>The basis of the defense’s allegation is a police affidavit for issuance of process in the Sully crimes. (A copy of this affidavit is found beginning at R.R., p. 291.) According to Attorney Robert Medonis, a copy of the affidavit of the crime was transmitted to him in the Orphans’ Court by the office of the District Attorney. Medonis was conducting the competency examination of Elizabeth Sully in Orphans’ Court. At the very least, it appears that someone in the District Attorney’s office certainly was aware of those proceedings, and the affidavit was given to Attorney Medonis prior to the videotaped deposition. The existence of the affidavit was bared in a statement by Attorney Medonis at the competency hearing held on October 19, 1988, one week before the deposition of Elizabeth Sully. Attorney Medonis used the existence of the crime to demonstrate that Miss Sully could not manage her own affairs.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b731-3" data-blocks='[["BL_731.5",731,[174,320,1154,368]]]'>
      <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>The record reveals that three different prosecutors were assigned to this case at different times: Anthony Bittner, Esq., Leo Dillon, Esq. and finally Michael M. Ahwesh, Esq. Without explanation, the trial judge determined that Leo Dillon was not aware of the proceedings of the Orphans’ Court. (R.R., pp. 112-113.) Dillon represented the Commonwealth at the videotaped deposition of Elizabeth Sully.</p>
    <p id="b731-4" data-blocks='[["BL_731.6",731,[174,714,1156,749]]]'>Beyond these facts, however, the record offers nothing more on the question of prior knowledge by the prosecution. Because this was a pivotal issue in the trial proceedings, we note that a hearing was not held to make a factual determination on the record. Attorney Medonis was never called to explain who gave him the police affidavit. Nor were prosecutors Bittner and Dillon questioned. ■ The trial court just proceeded to determine that a review of the videotape by Dr. Martone proved in itself that Elizabeth Sully was not incompetent to testify at that time. (Slip opinion, pp. 4-5.) The Superior Court affirmed. (Slip opinion, p. 5.) Both courts concluded as well that Appellant’s counsel could not complain after agreeing to the deposition while retaining the right to challenge Miss Sully’s capacity later.</p>
    <p id="b731-5" data-blocks='[["BL_731.7",731,[175,1489,1153,476]]]'>Such conclusions are unsatisfactory. Surely the entire defense approach to the videotaped deposition could have been altered with knowledge of the hearing in Orphans’ Court. Indeed, it can be surmised reasonably that, with such knowledge, the defense could have insisted on waiting beyond the one week that it took for the Orphans’ Court to adjudicate Elizabeth Sully incompetent and then have confronted the court with that decision going into the deposition.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Clearly, Elizabeth Sully’s testimony also was material.</p>

The prosecutor at trial protested that his office lacked such notice, while the testimony of Attorney Medonis in Orphans’ Court provides a strong inference that the District Attorney’s office gave him the police affidavit. The record so far is not dispositive. The appellant raises the allegation that the Office of the District Attorney had such knowledge, and that the failure to divulge the information triggered <em>Brady. </em>Before the <em>Brady </em>issue can be addressed, it is imperative to determine whether the prosecution possessed the information in the first place and knowingly withheld same from defendant.</p>
