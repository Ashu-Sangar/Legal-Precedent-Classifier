Shortly after midnight on September 27, 1987, Appellant was involved in an altercation with two men, one of whom was the decedent, at the intersection of 52nd and Market Streets in Philadelphia. Appellant called out for help, and four men came to the scene and chased the decedent and the other man away. Shortly thereafter, the decedent returned with a piece of wood, which he swung at Appellant. Appellant then pulled out a knife. The decedent and the other man took off in different directions. Appellant, along with three or four other men, pursued the decedent, who threw his piece of wood at Appellant but missed. Appellant continued to chase the decedent until the decedent fell, and as he started to get up Appellant punched him and knocked him to the ground. Appellant began to stab the decedent repeatedly, at one point using both hands to plunge the knife into decedent’s chest. Appellant then left the scene, fled to Georgia where his mother lived, and was eventually arrested there. The knife was not recovered.</p>
    <p id="b257-5" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[144,1871,1156,472]]]'>Appellant was tried before a jury. The Commonwealth’s witnesses included an eyewitness who testified as to the events. Additionally, the investigating and arresting officers testified, as did the assistant medical examiner for the city and county of Philadelphia who testified that the decedent’s body contained 16 wounds consistent with those caused by a knife. Appellant did not testify, and the only witness presented by the defense was trial counsel’s assistant who testified that Appellant was right-handed.</p>

    <p id="b258-5" data-blocks='[["BL_258.5",258,[284,524,1151,204]]]'>Through appellate counsel, Appellant asserts various issues of trial error and ineffective assistance of counsel before this court with respect to the verdicts of guilt.

    <p id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[279,847,1157,634]]]'>First, Appellant argues that the trial court erred in permitting the Commonwealth to introduce evidence of a statement by Appellant at the time of arrest which incorporated “other crimes” evidence. The arresting officer testified that when Appellant was arrested in Georgia, Appellant asked the police what he was being arrested for. “For murder,” he was told. Appellant then replied, “Which one?” Appellant alleges that this statement creates the inference that Appellant was referring to more than one murder that he had committed, that this was therefore evidence of prior crimes, and that such evidence is typically inadmissible absent a specific exception.</p>
    <p id="b258-8" data-blocks='[["BL_258.8",258,[275,1505,1158,689]],["BL_259.1",259,[193,292,1152,152]]]'>Appellant’s argument is erroneous. Appellant’s contention that this evidence referred to other murders committed by Appellant and that the jury would so interpret it that way is not a reasonable implication. In fact, it was only <em>defense </em>counsel that drew this conclusion in his closing argument, when he made a joke out of the idea that the Appellant may have committed so many murders that he had to inquire which among them he was being arrested for. The context in which this testimony was elicited would not create the inference that Appellant suggests. The response “Wfiiich one?” was an attempt by the Appellant to determine with whose murder he was being charged. The Commonwealth was clearly attempting to establish that Appellant had knowledge of the murder <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>of Clarence Woodlock when he made this statement, and that an innocent person would not have such knowledge. Therefore, there is simply no prior crimes evidence here.</p>
    <p id="b259-4" data-blocks='[["BL_259.5",259,[189,491,1157,1287]]]'>Appellant also contends that the trial court erred when it ruled that Appellant could not offer evidence that he was right-handed — specifically, by signing his name for the jury to see — without being subject to cross-examination. Appellant argues that this ruling forced him to decline his name-writing demonstration and instead offer the testimony of counsel’s assistant. Appellant fervently argues that such demonstration should not be subject to cross-examination. Regardless of the merit of that contention, we fail to see how Appellant could have been harmed by the court’s ruling. Whether Appellant was right- or left-handed was of dubious relevance since according to the medical examiner who testified, handedness could not be definitively determined by knife wounds. Moreover, the testimony of the eyewitness indicated that Appellant used <em>both </em>hands while stabbing decedent. Finally, Appellant was in fact able to enter evidence as to his handedness; we cannot see how his demonstration would have been that much more probative than the assistant’s testimony so that his being precluded from presenting it would rise to the level of error requiring a new trial. <em>See Commonwealth v.

On cross-examination, defense counsel showed the witness a photograph of another man, who was known as “QB,” and referred to such photograph as a “mug shot.” Apparently, trial counsel’s strategy was to imply that the eyewitness may have confused Appellant with this man known as “QB.” The photograph of QB was not shown to the jury, nor was it admitted into evidence.</p>

Here, trial counsel failed to request the instruction until after the jury had been sent out to deliberate. This request was patently not “timely.” It is quite evident from the record that trial counsel’s failure to request the charge in a timely manner was unreasonable.

It is true, as the trial judge also noted, that the reasonableness of counsel’s actions must be viewed from an objective standard established by the record, not a subjective one. However, the trial court’s conclusion that trial counsel was reasonable from an objective standpoint — that is, that it was counsel’s strategy <em>not </em>to ask for the no-adverse-inference charge, and such strategy is objectively reasonable — cannot stand in light of the detailed record on this point.</p>

As noted above, this Court has held under <em>Pierce </em>and its progeny that a defendant is required to show actual prejudice; that is, that counsel’s ineffectiveness was of such magnitude that it “could have reasonably had an adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings.” <em>Pierce, </em><a href="/pa/515/0153-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="515 Pa. 153" data-case-ids="1806001,1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-01,/pa/515/0153-02">515 Pa. at 162</a>, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 A.2d at 977</a>. This standard is different from the harmless error analysis that is typically applied when determining whether the trial court <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>erred in taking or failing to take certain action. The harmless error standard, as set forth by this Court in <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. at 409</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d at 164</a> (citations omitted), states that “[w]henever there is a <em>‘reasonable </em>possibility1 that an error ‘might have contributed to the conviction,’ the error is not harmless.” This standard, which places the burden on the Commonwealth to show that the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt, is a lesser standard than the <em>Pierce </em>prejudice standard, which requires the defendant to show that counsel’s conduct had an actual adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings. This distinction appropriately arises from the difference between a direct attack on error occurring at trial and a collateral attack on the stewardship of counsel. In a collateral attack, we first presume that counsel is effective, and that not every error by counsel can or will result in a constitutional violation of a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>Pierce, swpra.</em>

However, as discussed above, it is not axiomatic that what can never be harmless error by the trial court equates to ineffective assistance of counsel. Under <em>Pierce </em>and its progeny, a defendant is required to show that counsel’s ineffectiveness was of such magnitude that the verdict essentially would have been different absent counsel’s alleged ineffectiveness. Appellant has not identified to this Court how he was in fact prejudiced. Nor can we discern from an independent review of the record how Appellant was prejudiced.

I cannot conclude as the majority has that Appellant’s counsel was effective in light of the majority’s proper analysis that Appellant was denied his constitutional rights in violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. I agree with the majoritys analysis that trial counsel acted improperly when he failed to request a “no-adverse inference” jury instruction and that no reasonable basis existed for trial counsel’s course of conduct. My dis<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>agreement with the majority arises from their conclusion that Appellant failed to establish prejudice and their independent review of the record likewise failed to discern any prejudice.</p>

If the Appellant’s failure to testify was a critical factor in only one juror’s mind, then under <em>Pierce, </em>the Appellant would have established the required “adverse effect on the outcome of the proceedings” necessary to prove “prejudice.” Short of that testimony, Appellant cannot sustain his ineffectiveness claim.</p>
