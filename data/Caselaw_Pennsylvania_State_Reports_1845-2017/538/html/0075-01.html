Pursuant to 43 P.S. § 217.4, the matter was submitted to a board of arbitration which issued a decision and award on February 13, 1989. The award spanned a three year period from January 1, 1989, <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>to December 31, 1991, and provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that for each of those three years “the base annual salary rate for each bargaining unit job shall be re-established and increased to levels equal to <em>$1000.00 </em>above the salary rates in effect for those jobs during each preceding Calendar year....” Record at 11a. This increase applied to the positions of senior patrolman and sergeant. <em>Id. </em>The award also provided that the base annual salary of employees below the rank of senior patrolman was to be determined on the basis of a percentage of the senior patrolman’s salary rate in relation to the employee’s number of years of service until the rate equalled that of the senior patrolman. <em>Id. </em>at 12a, 14a-15a.</p>

It alleged that the portion of the award which provided a $1,000.00 salary increase for each year of the bargaining agreement violated certain provisions of the Act 47 recovery plan. Specifically, Farrell alleged that the increase violated Article IV, Item 8 of the plan which stated “[ljabor costs will increase approximately 2'/¿% each year.” Record at 32a. Farrell also argued that if the arbitration award was forced upon the city, it would be in violation of section 264 of Act 47, which would result in a loss of funding from the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

The FOP therefore argued that the statement concerning the <em>2}f¿% </em>labor cost increase was not a mandatory or binding recommendation on Farrell to restrict labor costs to that percentage each year.</p>

However, the court then looked to specific language located in Article V of the recovery plan under the subheading titled “Collective Bargaining Agreements” which stated “[t]here do not appear to be the resources for increases in either base pay or fringes, however, they are expressed, in the near future. This will be a harsh reality at the bargaining table for the foreseeable future.” <em>Id. </em>at 6. The court concluded from this language that “this recommendation [was] a binding obligation upon the City that there be no increases in either base pay or fringe benefits for the years 1989 or 1990.” <em>Id. </em>It reasoned that although the language was classified as a recommendation, it was a binding obligation on Farrell in light of section 264(a) of Act 47, 53 P.S. § 11701.264(a), which provides that a financially distressed municipality is subject to suspension of Commonwealth funding for failure to follow a recommendation of a coordinator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Thus, the court held that the arbitrators’ award of a $1,000.00 salary increase in the years 1989 and 1990 was illegal and declared that portion of the award null and void.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

We agree with Judge Kelley and the FOP that it is these recommendations or “provisions” that section 252 of Act 47, 53 P.S. § 11701.252, prohibits from being violated, expanded or diminished by the arbitration award.

Although the recovery plan specifically prohibits increases in the cost of fringe benefits, our review, as well as that of the Commonwealth Court panel below, reveals that there is no recommendation which freezes or places limits on increases of police salaries. Accordingly, the arbitration award in this case does not violate the provisions of Farrell’s recovery plan. That is the end of the inquiry. It was therefore unnecessary and erroneous for the Commonwealth Court to have remanded for additional testimony after it concluded that “Farrell’s recovery plan does not contain any provisions which freeze salaries or prohibit salary increases for any of its employees.” <em>FOP, Lodge No. 34 v.

In Article V of the City of Farrell recovery plan under the subheading titled “Collective Bargaining Agreements”, the coordinator states “[t]here do not appear to be the resources for increases in either base pay or fringes, however they are expressed, in the near future. This will be a harsh reality at the bargaining table for the foreseeable future.” This is a recommendation of the plan coordinator and cannot be violated or there will be a suspension of funding under § 264 of Act 47.</p>

Both the assumptions and the recommendations work together to develop a plan that must be followed in order to (1) make the plan and the economic recovery of the City of Farrell work, and (2) receive funding from the Commonwealth. The plan needs to be viewed as a whole and not in it’s individual parts. As a whole, the plan develops a means for the City of Farrell to overcome its great financial difficulties.</p>
    <p id="b250-7" data-blocks='[["BL_250.9",250,[291,1623,1155,412]]]'>In using assumptions such as the 2/6% salary increase, the plan develops a balanced budget, or in the years 1988 through 1990, a small surplus. The 2/6% increase in salaries and benefits along with other expenditures are projected along with revenues. If the revenues do not rise as expected, then there is no room for the 2/6% salary increase and modifications to the plan need to be made, as stipulated in Article IV, which states:</p>

I would interpret this as a recommendation, not a meaningless sentence as the majority has done. I believe the coordinator is stating that the projected budget allows for a 2!é% increase in salaries and benefits, but due to the very small margin for error, is recommending that salaries and benefits remain at current levels.</p>

Obviously, salaries are a large and troubling part of a municipality’s financial concern. Therefore, even though the Commonwealth Court and the majority claim that the plan does not specifically delineate “officer salaries” in the plan, any economic recovery plan that would omit as vital an area as salaries would be incomplete. Therefore, since it is incomprehensible to imagine that employee salaries and benefits would not be covered under the plan, and this is the only section covering such, I would construe Article V of the plan as recommending that salaries and benefits remain at current levels. Because this is a recommendation, the City of Farrell cannot refuse to follow it or its refusal will result in a suspension of Commonwealth funding .under § 264 of Act 47. I would reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and affirm the decision of the Court oí Common Pleas vacating the Act 111 arbitration award.</p>
