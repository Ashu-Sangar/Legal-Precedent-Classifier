Gainer testified that he was in the Philadelphia Detention Center on October 2, 1983, and while there, saw and conversed with Appellant. N.T. 1/6/88, 28-30. During the course of that meeting, Gainer testified that Appellant admitted killing Jamie Lamb because he thought that Lamb had killed his cousin. N.T. 1/6/88, 31. Appellant argues that the jury knew that his incarceration at the Philadelphia Detention Center was for criminal conduct other than that for which he was on trial.
