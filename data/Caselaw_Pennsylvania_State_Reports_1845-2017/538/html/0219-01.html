    <p id="b389-5" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[156,766,1155,313]]]'>The pertinent facts in this case are as follows. On March 6, 1987, Appellant, Daryl Schulte, attended a wedding reception organized by the bride’s parents, Co-Appellants Linda Fox Trinnes and Edward Trinnes. Schulte, then 18 years old, took his girlfriend and Appellee’s decedent, Kerry Kiser, as passengers. These two women were also eighteen years old.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.7",389,[153,1103,1155,584]]]'>At the reception Schulte, his girlfriend, and Kiser consumed large quantities of alcoholic beverages. They remained at the reception from 7:00 p.m. until 9:30 p.m. where Schulte consumed between six and eight whiskey sours. Schulte and the women left the reception in Schulte’s father’s car with Schulte driving. He proceeded to drive at a high rate of speed when, not far from the reception, his car rammed another car, hit the curb, became airborne, hit a street light pole, and flipped over in an adjacent field. Schulte and his girlfriend suffered minor injuries. Ms. Kiser was thrown from the vehicle and suffered fatal injuries.</p>
    <p id="b389-7" data-blocks='[["BL_389.8",389,[151,1712,1155,258]]]'>Appellees brought wrongful death and survival actions against Schulte. Schulte joined the Trinneses as additional defendants as well as the bartenders and the bride and groom. At trial, extensive testimony was presented that went to the issue of liability.</p>
    <p id="b389-8" data-blocks='[["BL_389.9",389,[151,1996,1155,367]],["BL_390.1",390,[277,316,1153,97]]]'>The only evidence on the issue of damages was offered by the Appellees. The parents and siblings of the deceased testified as to the character and personality traits of Ms. Kiser. Appellees also offered the only expert testimony in the form of a video-taped deposition of Dr. James L. Kenkell, Ph.D., a professor of economics at the University of Pittsburgh. He testified that the value of the loss of services to <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>the Kiser family, resulting from the death of Ms. Kiser, would range from $11,862.50 to $18,980.00.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[272,440,1156,846]]]'>Dr. Kenkell further testified as to the net economic loss resulting from the death of Appellant’s decedent. He testified that this figure included potential income, fringe benefits, and household services — less personal maintenance expenses. He explained how he employed various data compiled by the U.S. government and other sources to arrive at a net economic loss figure. Dr. Kenkell estimated that a white female, such as Ms. Kiser, would have a working lifetime of 42.5 years. He then projected that as a high school graduate she could expect to earn $792,352.15 over that lifetime or $18,643.58 per year. After adding in fringe benefits and household services, Dr. Kenkell subtracted personal maintenance expenses which he calculated at 40% of income. Thus, the figure of $571,659.29 was arrived at as the net economic loss resulting from the death of a white female high school graduate of the same age as Ms. Kiser.</p>
    <p id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[271,1321,1153,366]]]'>As Ms. Kiser was enrolled in a two-year college program at the time of her death, Dr. Kenkell also calculated a net economic loss figure for a college graduate. This figure was $756,081.43 based on a four year degree program. He explained that the figure for a graduate of a two-year college program was roughly midway between the high school and four-year college figures.</p>
    <p id="b390-7" data-blocks='[["BL_390.7",390,[268,1714,1154,529]]]'>On cross-examination, Dr. Kenkell admitted that there was a probability that Ms. Kiser’s working lifetime would be less than 42.5 years. He stated that the average working lifetime for a woman who took time away from her career to raise a family was 29.1 years. Further, he admitted that the 40% rate he used for the personal maintenance deduction may have been low. He conceded that a 70% rate may more accurately reflect personal maintenance. Using these new parameters, Dr. Kenkell recalculated the net economic loss and arrived at a figure of $232,400.20 for a white high school graduate.</p>

It found negligence on the part of Mr. Schulte as <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>the driver and the Trinneses as the reception hosts. It also found that Ms. Kiser was negligent. However, the jury specifically found that Ms. Kiser’s negligence was not a substantial factor in bringing about her death. The jury found that the negligence of Mr. Schulte and the Trinneses were substantial factors and assessed liability at 60 percent and 40 percent respectively. The jury then awarded damages in the amount of $25,000. The Superior Court vacated this award after finding it inadequate and remanded the case for trial on the issue of damages alone.</p>

However, Appellees also brought a survival claim on behalf of the decedent as executors of the decedent’s estate. As discussed <em>supra, </em>under Pennsylvania law, wrongful death and survival claims are two distinct claims compensating two distinct classes of plaintiffs for two distinct types of losses. Here, the estate of the decedent was entitled to receive damages for the decedent’s loss of earning power minus her personal maintenance expenses. Judge Del Sole’s assertion that the Appellees were properly compensated by the jury award for funeral expenses and loss of services compels the conclusion that the jury determined the decedent’s estate was not entitled to any damages on the survival claim. We believe that such conclusion is contrary to our law and the uncontroverted evidence presented at trial and is, therefore, “shocking.”</p>

The jury’s award effectively compensates the Kisers for the loss of services of their daughter and the funeral expenses incurred.

Instead, in this case, the jury totally disregarded the only evidence presented on the question of damages and settled on a somewhat capricious and inadequate amount of $25,000.

The jury completely exonerated two of the defendants and apportioned the negligence 60%-20%-20% among Mr. Schulte and the Trinneses.

In his dissent, Mr. Justice Flaherty argues that our opinion unduly interferes with the jury’s "freedom to evaluate the evidence and to accept it or reject it as they see fit.” Dissenting Opinion at 9. He further asserts that "[t]he plaintiff need only to produce expert opinion of lost earnings ... and if the defendant has no evidence to controvert such expert opinion, the court’s only task would be to enter judgment in the amount of the expert opinion." <em><a href="/pa-commw/118/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="118 Pa.

As discussed above, an appellate court will only award a new trial where the jury's verdict is so contrary to the evidence as to shock one’s sense of justice. Nothing in our opinion requires an award of a new trial where the jury’s award does not match the expert testimony dollar for dollar. In many cases the award of the jury may be inadequate because it falls below the uncontroverted testimony of an expert. In these cases, an appellate court should defer to the jury’s evaluation of the evidence and uphold the verdict. It is only in the rare case, such as the instant case, where the jury’s verdict is so patently inadequate as to shock the conscience of the court that an appellate court should inquire into the adequacy of the verdict. Thus, we do not believe that anything in our opinion interferes with a jury’s ability to evaluate evidence, except in cases where the verdict is so grossly inadequate that it is evident that the jury was mistaken.</p>

Bujak, </em><a href="/pa/537/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="537 Pa. 155" data-case-ids="775544" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0155-01">537 Pa. 155</a>, <a href="/pa/537/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="642 A.2d 448" data-case-ids="775517,775544,7862661,7862705" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0154-01,/pa/537/0155-01,/a2d/642/0448-01,/a2d/642/0448-02">642 A.2d 448</a> (1994). In that case, Catalano sued officer Bujak for injuries he allegedly suffered as a result of an arrest. Catalano claimed that these injuries caused him pain, suffering, and loss of twenty-one weeks of employment. The jury found Officer Bujak’s conduct was willful and that his willful conduct had harmed Catalano. The jury awarded Catalano damages for his medical costs, but none for lost wages, loss of future earning capacity, pain and suffering or embarrassment and humiliation. We overruled the Commonwealth Court which had found the verdict inadequate, and we held: "It would appear that the jury simply disbelieved evidence in excess of what it awarded____ In this case the jury apparently did not believe that pain and suffering, for example, or missed work, resulted from the injury which Bujak caused.” <em>Catalano v. Bujak, </em>at 161, <a href="/pa/537/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="642 A.2d 448" data-case-ids="775517,775544,7862661,7862705" data-case-paths="/pa/537/0154-01,/pa/537/0155-01,/a2d/642/0448-01,/a2d/642/0448-02">642 A.2d at 451</a>. The instant case is distinguished from <em>Catalano </em>in that the evidence of damages in this case is uncontroverted. In <em>Catalano, </em>Officer Bujak presented extensive evidence that Catalano suffered an injury at his job which was the real cause of his loss of employment and pain and suffering. Here, there was no such evidence offered by the defense. Thus, the jury's verdict in <em>Catalano </em>had a rational basis in the evidence offered at trial; the jury believed Officer Bujak’s theory over the one presented by Catalano. Here, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the jury’s <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>verdict to award no damages in the survival action has no basis in the evidence offered at trial.</p>

Thus, the court held that a new trial on the issue of damages alone was inappropriate. Likewise, here, the defendants vigorously contest liability amongst themselves. However, as discussed above, we cannot agree that the verdict in this case was a compromise verdict. We believe that the verdict here was not a result of the jury being unable to apportion blame among the several defendants. More likely, we believe that the low verdict was a result of jury instructions that did not adequately explain that Petitioners were entitled to both wrongful death and survival damages and/or the hostility of the trial judge to such damages. <em>See </em>Notes of Testimony, March 4-7, 1991, at 158-59. Therefore, despite a factual similarity to <em>Dougherty, </em>we cannot agree that here the issue of damages is intertwined with the issue of liability.</p>

But if this difference controls the case, then we need not even have trials in cases like this. The plaintiff need only produce expert opinion of lost earnings and pain and suffering, and if the defendant has no evidence to controvert such expert opinion, the court’s only remaining task would be to enter judgment in the amount of the expert opinion.
