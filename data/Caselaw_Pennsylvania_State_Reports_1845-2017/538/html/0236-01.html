Upon O’Connell’s failure of this test, the officer arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol. O’Connell was immediately advised of his Miranda rights and taken to the police station where he was again advised of his Miranda rights in written form. Paragraph 6 of the form asked, “Do you want to talk to a lawyer at this time or have a lawyer with you while we ask you questions?” At first O’Connell answered “No”, but later he changed his answer to “Yes.”</p>

The officer testified that O’Connell gave no reason for his refusal, that he was permitted to call his lawyer, and that following this call, O’Connell was willing to submit to the test. The officer would not administer the test, however, because he had been unable to personally observe O’Connell for the preceding thirty-five to forty-five minutes; therefore, a refusal was noted.</p>

If the arrestee hesitates and attempts to exercise his Miranda right by asking for a lawyer or asking to make a phone call, a refusal is recorded.</blockquote>

In <em>McFadden, </em>the motorist was pulled over after he used his right turn signal to indicate that he was making a left turn. The officer smelled alcohol on McFadden’s breath, and as a result, conducted a field sobriety test which McFadden failed. The officer placed him under arrest and read McFadden <em>Miranda </em>warnings. The motorist was then taken to the police station to take a breathalyzer test. Upon arrival at the police station, McFadden was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings in writing. McFadden refused to submit to the breathalyzer test and asked to make a telephone call.

Upon his arrival at the scene, only one of the two vehicles involved in the accident remained. The driver of the remaining vehicle and another witness to the accident described for West the other vehicle involved in the collision: a black sports car with Florida license plates. Moreover, the other driver and the witness described the driver of the black car as possibly being “Oriental.” Because West is familiar with most of the residents of Versailles, this description of the vehicle and the driver indicated to West that Ingram had been the driver involved in the accident. West subsequently proceeded in the direction that the witnesses had shown the fleeing car was travelling, and spotted the vehicle heading north on Second Street. While attempting to catch Ingram’s vehicle, West further noticed that a barricade he had passed a few minutes earlier had recently been damaged. As West approached the car, which was at that point parked behind Ingram’s residence, he observed damage to the vehicle’s left front fender, and a piece of wood on the vehicle. West testified that he found Ingram on the back porch of his residence attempting to enter his house. After several minutes, Ingram surrendered to West.</p>
