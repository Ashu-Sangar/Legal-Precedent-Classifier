The Commonwealth’s evidence consisted of the testimony of two Westmoreland County detectives, Terrence Kuhns and Anthony Marcocci, who encountered Lightfoot on October 9, 1988, while working as undercover narcotics agents with an informant in the Monessen area.</p>
    <p id="b518-8" data-blocks='[["BL_518.8",518,[285,1275,1158,852]]]'>Detective Kuhns testified that the informant advised him that Lightfoot would be at a certain bar in Monessen and would probably be able to obtain drugs for him. Kuhns and Marcocci went to the bar and there met the informant and Lightfoot. After a brief conversation, Kuhns had a discussion ■with Lightfoot about purchasing “double dutch”, a mixture of heroin and cocaine. Lightfoot indicated that he could obtain the drugs for thirty dollars a bag, plus a “tariff’ for his services in obtaining the drugs. Kuhns gave Lightfoot one hundred twenty five dollars and Lightfoot left the bar in the informant’s car. Sometime later, a woman named Sharon Norfleet entered the bar and indicated to Kuhns and Marcocci that they should accompany her outside. Lightfoot was waiting in the car. After the detectives entered the car, Lightfoot gave them several packets of drugs. He indicated that he had needed Norfleet’s help to obtain the drugs.</p>

According to Lightfoot, he was acquainted with the informant <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>as a fellow drug user, but he had never engaged in selling drugs to her or anyone else. On the night in question the informant called him, picked him up in her car, and drove him to the bar in Monessen. He indicated to her that he had not had any heroin that day and was “sick” with withdrawal symptoms.</p>
    <p id="b519-5" data-blocks='[["BL_519.5",519,[200,635,1155,738]]]'>At the bar, the informant indicated that she had some cousins who were trying to get some drugs, and that if Lightfoot could obtain the drugs for them he would be able to get fifty dollars for himself to get whatever drugs he needed. She then introduced Lightfoot to Kuhns, who said he was interested in buying some drugs. Thereafter the informant gave Lightfoot one hundred twenty five dollars from Kuhns for this purpose. Moreover the informant told Lightfoot to take her car and advised him where he could obtain the drugs. After taking the car to Clairton and obtaining some drugs, Lightfoot happened upon Sharon Norfleet and offered her a ride. They returned to the bar, where Lightfoot gave Kuhns the drugs, after which the informant drove Lightfoot and Norfleet back to Lightfoot’s home.</p>

Appellant testified that he met the confidential informant at a bar, where he agreed to buy the illegal substance for the confidential informant because he was experiencing heroin withdrawal and needed money to purchase more illegal drugs for himself. Shortly after receiving “front money” from the confidential informant, he proceeded to a known drug area, where he had previously purchased illegal drugs (T.T. at 124-129), and purchased the requested contraband for the confidential informant. He also purchased heroin for himself. (T.T. at 130-133). While he was there, he met another user of illegal substances and before returning the cocaine to the confidential informant, he stopped to share his drugs with the other user. (T.T. at 141-143). Nothing in the record indicates that the detectives employed methods that would overwhelm persons who would not otherwise commit this crime. To the extent Appellant was induced to commit his crimes, he was induced only by his own physical need to obtain money to purchase <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>more illegal substances for his own use and <em>not </em>by improper police conduct.</p>

Appellant was ready and willing to commit these crimes because he wanted money to purchase and use controlled substances for which he himself was responsible in creating his own need. Therefore, as a matter of law, I would find that Appellant failed to establish prima facie evidence of the elements of the defense of entrapment so as to bar any instruction. The majority’s holding to the contrary suggests that the mere request by a police officer, or by a confidential informant acting at the behest of the police, to purchase illegal substances warrants an entrapment instruction. I do not believe this to be the case. Therefore, I would find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion and properly refused the requested entrapment instruction.</p>

Indeed, the majority’s reliance upon <em>Borgella </em>is misplaced. In <em>Borgella, </em>this Court found sufficient evidence warranting an entrapment instruction where the defendant testified that months prior to the charged incident, the confi<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>dential informant appeared as a stranger at defendant’s home asking to use his bathroom. The informant used the bathroom and then asked the defendant to obtain drugs for him, which the defendant refused to do. The informant subsequently returned to the defendant’s home several times over the several months prior to the charged incident, seeking drugs and seeking to develop a relationship which would induce the defendant to commit a drug offense. The informant also attempted to play on Borgella’s sympathy by masquerading as an addict with domestic problems who was unable to obtain drugs himself because each time he tried he was “ripped off” or beaten. However, Borgella persisted in his refusal to purchase illegal drugs for the informant. As the two became social Mends, Borgella became enviable of the informant’s income and became interested in employment by the informant’s “boss”. Per Borgella’s testimony, he had been led to believe the informant was employed in the area of construction.</p>
    <p id="b526-5" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[206,1267,1155,565]]]'>The informant agreed to the introduction and drove Borgella from his home to meet his “boss” in a parking lot to discuss a potential job in construction for Borgella. Police testified that at this meeting Borgella sold them drugs. However, Borgella testified that he did not. The issue before the Court in <em>Borgella </em>was whether an entrapment instruction was warranted where the accused denied any criminal wrongdoing. Here, unlike <em>Borgella, </em>we have a seasoned drug veteran who admitted he purchased and delivered the contraband and admitted he agreed to partake in the drug transaction in order to perpetuate his own drug use.</p>
