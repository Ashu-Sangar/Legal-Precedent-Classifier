Andre Ramsey, one of the victims, was a tenant in the same residence. On the evening of September 28th or 29th of 1989, Appellant returned home and entered Ramsey’s room and fired two gunshots at close range into the heads of Ramsey and Robertson. Ramsey was shot in the back of the head and Robertson was shot in the temple. After the killings, Appellant removed money, jewelry and car keys belonging to Ramsey, and with the aid of Robert Stackhouse, the boyfriend of Appellant’s mother, moved the victims’ corpses to an oil pit in the basement garage of the residence. Ramsey’s room and other areas of the residence were then cleaned by Appellant, Stack-house and members of his family in order to conceal Appellant’s crimes. The next day, Appellant, who was unemployed and had been unable to repay a minor debt to a friend, suddenly was able to undertake unusual expenditures and repay a portion of his debt. Thereafter, Appellant went into hiding, and ultimately hired two men to remove the victims’ corpses from his basement because they had begun to decompose.</p>

On October 24, 1989, Appellant was arrested at the home of his uncle and aunt where he had taken up residence after the murders. Appellant subsequently admitted to the police that he had shot both victims in Ramsey’s room, moved their bodies, cleaned the room to conceal the crime, and hired two men to dispose of the victims’ corpses. However, Appellant also maintained that he had shot the victims in self-defense because he believed Ramsey and Robertson had been reaching for guns during an alleged argument that had taken place in Ramsey’s room. The jury was free to disbelieve the testimony presented in support of this defense. <em>Commonwealth v.

We further conclude that his argument did not have the “unavoidable effect” of prejudicing the jury, forming in their mind a fixed bias and hostility towards Appellant so that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict. The argument of the Assistant District Attorney was reasonably based upon the evidence presented at trial and the reasonable inferences therefrom, and merely exhibited a degree of oratorical flair, license and passion that was permissible during his arguments to the jury. <em>Commonwealth v.

The statute offers no specific formula concerning how the jury should go about weighing these factors. In the absence of such guidance, the “process” of weighing must be left to the individual members of the jury. Thus, when the trial court instructed the jury that they <em>must </em>consider the lack of unanimity regarding findings of mitigating circumstances when determining whether the mitigating circumstances were outweighed by the aggravating circumstances, the trial court interfered with the province of the jury. In making this statement, the trial court, in contravention of the Statute, invaded the exclusive function of the jury to assess what weight each factor deserved within the particular case before them. This instruction had the unavoidable effect of telling the jury that the weight to be accorded to mitigating circumstances was governed by the number of jurors that had found them to exist— i.e., how weighty or serious can the evidence in mitigation be if only a few members of the jury found it.</p>

There exists a reasonable probability that the jury’s weighing process may have yielded a different result. Hence, the fundamental fairness of the proceeding was undermined by trial counsel’s failure to object to the instruction, and a new hearing as to penalty is warranted. <em>Commonwealth v.

Our sentencing scheme allows an individual juror to consider and weigh for himself or herself whether mitigating circumstances exist in any case and whether their existence mitigates in favor of life or death. <em>Commonwealth v. O’Shea, </em><a href="/pa/523/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="523 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1820339" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0384-01">523 Pa. 384</a>, 410, <a href="/pa/523/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="523 Pa. 384" data-case-ids="1820339" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0384-01">567 A.2d 1023</a> (1990); <em>Commonwealth v. Frey, </em><a href="/pa/520/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="160" data-cite="520 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1815634" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0338-01">520 Pa. 338</a>, <a href="/pa/520/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="520 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1815634" data-case-paths="/pa/520/0338-01">554 A.2d 27</a> (1989). Accordingly, any charge should be reviewed in light of this standard to insure that no juror is prevented from assessing for himself or herself whether mitigating eir<a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>cumstances, when found by a particular juror, outweigh in his or her mind the aggravating circumstances found by the entire jury.</p>
    <p id="b344-5" data-blocks='[["BL_344.5",344,[288,496,1157,586]]]'>Here, the Majority complains that when the trial judge told the jury they must take into consideration the fact a particular mitigating circumstance was not found unanimously, the trial judge channelled the jury into believing that a particular weight had to be accorded a mitigating circumstance in proportion to the number of jurors who found that particular circumstance to be present. While this is an interesting interpretation of the trial court’s charge, I do not believe it to be the “unavoidable” meaning to be assigned to this language or that the trial court interfered with the province of the jury in delivering this charge.</p>
    <blockquote id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[330,1110,1111,268]]]'>In pertinent part, the language of the charge was as follows: “As I told you before, the mitigating circumstances need not be unanimous. However, if they are not unanimous, then you must take that into consideration when you are weighing whether the mitigating outweigh the aggravating.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b344-7" data-blocks='[["BL_344.7",344,[284,1406,1156,962]],["BL_345.1",345,[142,310,1156,314]]]'>As I read this language, the trial court was speaking to the jurors individually in light of the first sentence which explains that mitigating circumstances can be properly found by less than unanimous vote. As I read the next sentence, the trial court is still addressing the jurors individually because he is discussing mitigating circumstances that are found by less than the full jury and simply tells them that, in spite of their lack of unanimity on a particular mitigating circumstance, the individual juror who finds mitigating circumstances <em>must </em>nonetheless “take that into consideration,” <em>i.e., </em>consider the mitigating circumstance found by that juror when weighing whether the particular mitigating circumstance outweighs the aggravating circumstance which might have been found by the full jury. In other words, the individual juror who finds a particular mitigating circumstance is still required to consider the impact of this circumstance in his deliberations even if the full jury did not agree with his or her finding of the presence of such a circumstance. Significantly, the trial court had just <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>finished telling the jurors in the preceding sentence that their findings with regard to mitigating circumstances would be accorded validity even if they were <em>not unanimous, </em>and for this reason I see no reason to read his second sentence in a way which calls into question the validity of what had just been characterized as a proper finding as the Majority has.</p>
    <p id="b345-5" data-blocks='[["BL_345.5",345,[140,664,1158,308]]]'>In my view, the charge fully complies with the statute’s goal in not precluding an individual juror from considering and weighing any mitigating circumstance in his or her deliberations and the ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on trial counsel’s failure to object to the charge is meritless. I would affirm the verdict and sentence of death.</p>
