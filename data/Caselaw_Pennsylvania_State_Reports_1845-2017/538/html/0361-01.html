The Commonwealth Court sustained Appellees’ preliminary objections but concluded that the administrative remedies available to Appellants inadequately addressed the particular takings claim issue in this case. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court transferred the case to the Environmental Hearing Board (the “EHB”) after finding that the EHB was more technically competent in surface mining taking claims and that the EHB possessed the jurisdiction and expertise to rule on the validity of such claims, 155 Pa.Cmwlth. 72, <a href="/pa-commw/155/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="624 A.2d 742" data-case-ids="1445796" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/155/0072-01">624 A.2d 742</a>.</p>

Appellants assert that because the Commonwealth Court ruled that the prescribed administrative procedures inadequately provided for redress of their claim, it was irrational for the Court to then require Appellants to pursue such inadequate remedies. They maintain that their takings claim is properly justiciable in the courts. Appellees agree with Appellants that because the EHB’s review jurisdiction is statutorily limited to challenges of Department of Environmental Resources (“DER”) enforcement actions, the Commonwealth Court’s transfer of this matter to the EHB improperly expanded the EHB’s jurisdiction beyond that granted by the <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>legislature. Appellees maintain that Appellants’ takings claim is properly addressed by the DER, not the judiciary.</p>
    <p id="b531-4" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[120,430,1157,1009]]]'>The first issue before this Court is whether the Commonwealth Court acted properly in relieving Appellants of the general requirement that a party must exhaust available administrative remedies prior to submitting a constitutional takings claim for judicial resolution. Appellees rely upon <em>Gardner v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Environmental Resources, </em><a href="/pa-commw/145/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="145 Pa. Commw. 345" data-case-ids="1426510" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/145/0345-01">145 Pa.Commw. 345</a>, <a href="/pa-commw/145/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="145 Pa. Commw. 345" data-case-ids="1426510" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/145/0345-01">603 A.2d 279</a> (1992), for the proposition that the mere existence of statutory and regulatory remedies compels Appellants to first avail themselves of those mechanisms before proceeding to a judicial forum. However, this is too broad a reading of <em>Gardner. </em>Rather, in <em>Gardner, </em>the Commonwealth Court held only that the trial court properly ruled that there appeared to be a reasonable administrative remedy still available, and that, therefore, the injured party must first exhaust those remedies before challenging the matter in court. Here, a specific finding was made by the Commonwealth Court that there were <em>no </em>reasonable administrative remedies available; thus, <em>Gardner </em>is inapplicable.</p>
    <p id="b531-5" data-blocks='[["BL_531.6",531,[119,1471,1161,740]],["BL_532.1",532,[302,303,1155,372]]]'>The issues before us are simply (1) whether the Commonwealth Court correctly found that no administrative remedies were available and that it therefore had jurisdiction; and (2) whether the Commonwealth Court properly transferred the matter to the EHB. Absent an abuse of discretion or error of law by the Commonwealth Court, this Court should not disturb the ruling below. <em>Frye Const., Inc. v. City of Monongahela, </em><a href="/pa/526/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="526 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1825987" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0170-01">526 Pa. 170</a>, 176, <a href="/pa/526/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="526 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1825987" data-case-paths="/pa/526/0170-01">584 A.2d 946</a>, 948-49 (1991) (citation omitted). Here, the Commonwealth Court's waiver of the exhaustion requirement was a sound exercise of its discretion. The Commonwealth Court applied the <em>Gardner </em>principle and found that Appellant’s takings claim was not sufficiently redressed by the prescribed administrative procedures.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Since there is no evidence or assertion by either party <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>that these conclusions are inherently unreasonable or that they constituted an abuse of discretion, this Court should not disturb the conclusion of the Commonwealth Court. Accordingly, we affirm the Commonwealth Court’s ruling that Appellants lacked a reasonably sufficient administrative remedy for their claim and that they need not, in this instance, further pursue administrative relief.</p>

However, the Commonwealth Court’s reliance on <em>Arsenal Coal </em>was misplaced. <em>Arsenal Coal </em>stands for the proposition that the EHB has ancillary jurisdiction to rule on the validity of EQB regulations <em>only after </em>the DER has undertaken a regula<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>tory enforcement action.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Here, DER never took any steps to enforce the EQB regulation designating a portion of Appellants’ land as unsuitable for mining. Therefore, absent any DER enforcement action, the EHB is without any legislatively-conferred jurisdiction over this matter. <em>See <a href="/pa/505/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="505 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1788892" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0198-01">id.</a> </em>In turn, the Commonwealth Court’s attempt to transfer the case to the EHB was in error because the judiciary does not possess the power to expand the legislatively-defined jurisdiction of administrative agencies. Accordingly, we reverse that portion of the Commonwealth Court’s order transferring this matter to the EHB.</p>
    <p id="b533-6" data-blocks='[["BL_533.7",533,[175,1463,1155,367]],["BL_534.1",534,[240,319,1154,318]]]'>Given our conclusion that the transfer to the EHB was in error, we must now determine whether this case must be brought before the judiciary or before DER. Appellees ask this Court to refer this case to DER for further adjudication in the event that we find that the EHB lacks jurisdiction over this matter. Appellees contend that the administrative remedies in this case are substantively adequate and that DER is <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>the forum in which EQB regulations are challenged. As previously stated, however, we have agreed with the Commonwealth Court’s ruling that Appellants lack adequate administrative remedies in this case.
