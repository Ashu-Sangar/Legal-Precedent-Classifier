In connection -with the murder conviction, a sentencing hearing was held, as required by 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711, and appellant was sentenced to death. Terms of imprisonment were imposed for the other offenses. The present direct appeal ensued. We affirm.</p>

On the afternoon of May 8, 1987, Veranica James Hands was to meet her husband and some friends at a shopping mall in Philadelphia. She failed to appear, however, so her husband went looking for her. He went to their residence, an apartment located on the two upper floors of a three story duplex on Federal Street. He was surprised to find that the door to the building and the door to the apartment were unlocked. After inspecting the lower floor of the apartment, he proceeded to the bedroom area on the third floor. There, on the stairway landing, he found the body of his wife. The body, clad in a bathrobe, was partially covered with a blanket and pillows. Mrs. Hands, who was eight and one-half months pregnant, had been bound, gagged, and stabbed to death. She suffered more than fifty stab wounds, many of which <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>punctured vital organs. A number of the wounds also fatally penetrated her unborn baby.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[143,444,1154,478]]]'>The third floor of the apartment had been partially ransacked. Underclothing had been removed from Mrs. Hands and thrown on the floor. Other clothing was strewn about the area. Cabinet drawers were open. Cologne had been spread around the bedroom. Pocket change, paper currency, an imitation Rolex watch, a high school ring belonging to Mrs. Hands, a gold chain bracelet belonging to Mr. Hands, other watches, rings, jewelry, and a pair of fingerless sporting gloves were missing from the bedroom.</p>
    <p id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[142,948,1157,367]]]'>There were no signs that the apartment had been forcibly entered. A bedroom window, usually kept closed, was open. The window was normally opened only when Mrs. Hands would look down to the street level to see who was ringing the doorbell. This, along with the fact that the apartment doors were unlocked, indicated that Mrs. Hands had unlocked the doors to allow entry.</p>
    <p id="b275-7" data-blocks='[["BL_275.7",275,[142,1342,1154,476]]]'>Late on the day of the crime, one of appellant’s acquaintances, Jerry McEachin, encountered appellant at McEachin’s residence in Philadelphia. Appellant appeared very nervous and scared, and attempted to flush papers from his pockets into a toilet. He showed McEachin a “MAC” card which bore the name of Mrs. Hands, a high school ring which bore her initials, a man’s gold chain bracelet, various other jewelry, an imitation Rolex watch, other watches, coins, paper currency, and a pair of fingerless sporting gloves.</p>

He said that he had just stabbed his cousin, a woman who lived on Federal Street, and that he committed the stabbing with a knife that he found in the victim’s apartment. (Mrs. Hands was, in fact, related to appellant as a very distant cousin.) Appellant also told McEachin that he had, in the past, committed a stabbing in which he wounded a woman repeatedly. McEachin noticed blood on appellant’s shoelaces. Appellant said that, after committing the present stabbing, he <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>washed blood from the knife and put the knife back in its place in the victim’s apartment.</p>

Appellant approached the front of the house, but, upon seeing the police, fled.</p>
    <p id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.6",276,[289,718,1158,529]]]'>Around 2:00 a.m. on the following day, May 9, 1987, McEachin noticed appellant hiding under a truck in front of McEachin’s residence. Appellant asked whether any police officers were in the vicinity, and, upon being told that there were not, he emerged. Later that morning, McEachin and appellant attempted to use the victim’s MAC card and visited a number of jewelers to sell some of the victim’s jewelry. Appellant later removed his shoes, threw them into a trash dumpster, and told McEachin that he hoped he had not left any bloodstains or footprints at the crime scene.</p>
    <p id="b276-7" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[286,1271,1154,312]]]'>The jewelry that appellant sold was eventually recovered by police and identified as belonging to Mrs. Hands. Appellant’s fingerprints were found on containers that held pocket change in the victim’s bedroom. Appellant’s thumbprint, in a red stain that was ostensibly blood, was found on a doorjamb beside the victim’s body.</p>

The photos served to provide the jury with a better understanding of the crime scene. They also exposed the malicious manner in which the murder was committed. The jurors, by gaining insight into the full extent of the harm wrought, were placed in a better position to assess the nature and intent of the <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>crime’s perpetrator. “A jury can often best perform its function if it has not been unduly insulated from gaining a full understanding of the crime itself.” <em>Id. </em>at 407, <a href="/pa/536/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="639 A.2d 786" data-case-ids="1843199,7863698" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0402-01,/a2d/639/0786-01">639 A.2d at 789</a>. The photos in the present case served to enhance that understanding. The photos were few in number, and, being black and white rather than color, they safely understated the true nature of the crime scene.

    <p id="b278-5" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[260,783,1157,366]]]'>Appellant next argues that the trial court erred in allowing admission of testimony regarding appellant’s prior conviction for robbery, burglary, aggravated assault and attempted rape. The conviction arose from an incident, in 1979, when appellant committed a knife attack upon a woman in her home.

Both were attacked while alone in their third floor bedrooms in apartment buildings where appellant resided on the first floor. The victims, both of whom were black, female, and relatively young, had their underclothing or nightclothes pulled from them. Both were then physically restrained and attacked with knives obtained from their own apartments. The assailant repeatedly stabbed both victims until death (or, in the 1979 attack, apparent death) occurred. Mrs. Hands was stabbed more than fifty times, and the victim of the previous attack was stabbed eight times. In each case the apartment was ransacked, yet the only valuables taken were small items from the bedroom, i.e., coins, watches, etc. In each case the perpetrator cleaned the borrowed knife and left it at the scene of the crime. <em>Bryant </em>is distinguishable because the details of the crimes did not point to a similar criminal pattern and were common elements found in most burglary situations; here both ciimes contain uniquely similar attributes sufficient to allow the prior conviction into evidence.</p>

One of these was a very brief remark that the specific intent to kill necessary to a conviction for murder of the first degree could be inferred from the severity of the victim’s wounds, the fact that the victim was bound and gagged, and testimony given by the victim of the stabbing that appellant committed in 1979. Appellant asserts that testimony from the victim of the 1979 crime was admitted to establish the identity of the perpetrator of the present crime and not as a basis to infer specific intent to kill, and that counsel should, therefore, have objected.

Counsel told the court that he had explained to appellant that the prosecution was not in a position to introduce evidence of the unrelated crime and that, if he inquired about the reasons for appellant’s arrest, facts relating to that crime would likely be revealed to the jury.
