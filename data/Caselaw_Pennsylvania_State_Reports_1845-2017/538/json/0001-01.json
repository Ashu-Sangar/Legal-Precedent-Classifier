The manufacturer of a mass produced product, in this case a Spin-Around, is not protected by the Pennsylvania 12 year statute of repose, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5536(a), and a directed verdict should not have been entered in favor of Mexico Forge, Inc., the manufacturer.

Building Components, Inc., 536 Pa. 95, 637 A.2d 1331 ( 994).\nThe cross-petition for allowance of appeal filed by Mexico Forge, Inc. is denied but this matter is remanded to the Superior Court so it may decide the issues raised by Mexico Forge, Inc., in its appeal to that court but left undecided because of the Superior Court\u2019s disposition of the statute of repose issue.\nMr. Justice Montemuro is sitting by designation as Senior Justice pursuant to Judicial Assignment Docket No. 94 R1801, due to the unavailability of Mr. Justice Larsen, see No. 127 Judicial Administration Docket No. 1, filed October 28, 1993.",
