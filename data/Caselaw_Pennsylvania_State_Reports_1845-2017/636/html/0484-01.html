Plainly, therefore, Section 693 itself does not specifically differentiate between “contracts” and "collective bargaining agreements.” Moreover, in Section 696(k)(4), immediately after having delineated — in subsections (k)(2) and (3) — a series of requirements and restrictions relative to collective bargaining agreements, the Legislature specified that “[a] provision in <em>any contract </em>in effect on the date of the declaration of distress under this subsection that is in conflict with this subsection shall be discontinued <em>in any new or renewed contract." </em>24 P.S. § 6-696(k)(4) (emphases added).
