Most centrally, Section 5, entitled “Owner’s payment obligations,” provides that “[t]he owner shall pay the contractor strictly in accordance with terms of the construction contract,” creates a default term for timely payment in the absence of an express term governing the same, and subjects “owners” who do not timely pay contractors to interest payments at a statutorily-provided rate. 73 P.S. § 505.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Likewise, Section 12 provides that “owners” who fail to comply with CASPA’s requirements are subject to “a penalty equal to 1% per month of the amount that was wrongfully withheld,” as well as reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. 73 P.S. § 512.</p>

Beginning in 2005, Appellant Scungio Borst <em>&amp; </em>Associates (“SBA”) entered into a series of written and oral construction contracts with Appellee 410 Shurs Lane Developers, LLC (“410 SLD”), which 410 SLD’s part-owner and president, Appellee Robert DeBolt (“DeBolt”), executed on 410 SLD’s behalf. Therein, SBA agreed to improve real property owned by 410 SLD in connection with the development of a condominium complex, <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>and did so until November 2006, when SBA’s contracts were terminated with approximately $1.5 million in outstanding payments due.

SBA asserted, among other claims, violations of CASPA. Central to this appeal, DeBolt filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to SBA’s claim under CASPA, arguing he could not be held liable under CASPA because he was not a party to SBA’s contract with 410 SLD, and citing Section 4 for the proposition that CASPA applies solely to parties to a construction contract.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> SBA responded that DeBolt was liable under Sections 2 and 5 because he was an agent of 410 SLD who acted with his authority in ordering the subject work.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> (The parties do not dispute that DeBolt acted as 410 SLD’s agent in this respect.)

Instead, the legislature must have intended to hold the principal, <em>i.e., </em>the owner, liable for its agents’ authorized acts in “ordering the improvement to be made.” Such an interpretation comports with general agency law.</blockquote>

The court further noted that, while the WPCL was intended to provide employees a mechanism to disgorge wrongfully withheld wages from their employers, and while imposing personal liability for employers’ agents gave “top corporate managers an incentive to use available corporate funds for the payment of wages and benefits rather than for some other purpose,” id at 108 (citing Carpenters Health and Welfare Fund of Phila. and Vicinity by Gray v.

Specifically, SBA posits that “the intent of both acts is to protect workmen” by ensuring that they get paid for work performed, that both statutes define liable entities as including their agents, and, thus, they should be interpreted as similarly imposing liability on agents who are decision-makers. Appellant’s Brief <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>at 13-16.

SBA further submits that the Superior Court’s analysis ignores the presumption that the legislature is familiar with extant law when enacting legislation and that it may use statutory language already interpreted in a particular way to indicate its intent to obtain a similar interpretation of a new statute. SBA notes that the judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing language of the WPCL predate the General Assembly’s enactment of CASPA, and, thus, reasons that the presumption applies herein. Thus, SBA contends the Superior Court’s determination that CASPA merely provides additional remedies to contracting parties is erroneous, and that the statute, like the WPCL, actually incentivizes agents to remedy owners’ violations in order to protect contractors.</p>

SBA adds that, insofar as “owners” subject to liability are intended to include “agents of the owner acting with their authority,” “it follows that ‘agents of owners’ are subject to liability under CASPA,” and “[t]he majority’s interpretation of ‘agent of the owner’ as a mere device for distinguishing agents from contractors is unsound.” Appellant’s Brief at 20-21.</p>

De-Bolt thus agrees with the Superior Court’s conclusion that Section 2’s language was merely intended to establish that an agent’s conduct is imputed to an owner, and that an agent is not himself a contractor. He claims that SBA’s reliance on the WPCL is flawed, reasoning that “the statutes are incongruous, and there is no authority or legislative history to conclude that CASPA and the WPCL were intended to be parallel provisions, or that the terms should be similarly construed.” Appel-lee’s Brief at 9.

    <p id="b684-4" data-blocks='[["BL_684.4",684,[264,519,1156,1525]]]'>Thus, our initial inquiry is whether the plain language of Section 2’s provision that “owner” means a “person who has an interest in the real property that is improved and who ordered the improvement to be made,” and includes “agents of the owner acting with their authority,” 73 P.S. § 502, is clear and unambiguous with respect to agent liability. We conclude it is not. On the one hand, as SBA argues, one can read Section 2’s definition of owner — as including “agents of the owner acting with their authority” — to indicate that such agents are equivalent to owners for purposes of the statute. Under such a reading, an owner’s agent would share the owner’s statutory obligations to timely pay contractors, as well as potential liability where contractors are not timely paid. On the other hand, as the lower courts concluded, one can read Section 2’s first clause — defining an “owner” as “[a] person who has an interest in the real property that is improved and who ordered the improvement to be made” — as the term’s definition. Under that view, Section 2’s second clause — providing that “[t]he term includes successors in interest of the owner and agents of the owner acting with their authority”— as, essentially, a proviso (albeit an awkward one) modifying the first clause and clarifying that an owner remains liable under CASPA’s operative provisions notwithstanding the owner’s employment of an agent to order the subject improvements, or the owner’s conveyance of its interest in the subject property to another entity. In our view, both constructions are reasonable interpretations of Section 2’s text, and, accordingly, we conclude that Section 2 is ambiguous with respect to agent liability.</p>

    <p id="b685-4" data-blocks='[["BL_685.4",685,[186,720,1154,1096]]]'>We begin our inquiry in this regard with a brief review of the law concerning timely payment of contractors prior to CASPA’s enactment, the legislative history attendant CAS-PA’s passage, and its substantive effect. Prior to CASPA’s enactment, an unpaid contractor would typically pursue a breach of contract claim against the property owner. Yet, a contractor so proceeding could face a series of potential pitfalls. Under traditional contract law, a contractor was entitled to payment according to the terms of its contract, or, in the absence of such a term, within a “reasonable time” or upon completion of its work. See 17 C.J.S. Contracts § 79. Under these standards, a contractor would face the option of potentially costly litigation over whether delays in payment were “reasonable,” or awaiting the conclusion of its work to be paid, an unsatisfying option for large and lengthy construction projects. Similarly, under traditional contract law, an unpaid contractor would be required to pay its own litigation costs, including attorneys’ fees and expenses. See 20 C.J.S. Costs §§ 3, 173. Thus, if a contractor’s damages were less than the cost of litigation, it might well be dissuaded from vindicating its rights.</p>

CASPA displaced the common law standards vis-á-vis what constitutes timely payment in the context of construction contracts with, as detailed above, a <a id="p634" href="#p634" data-label="634" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*634</a>statutorily-specified timetable, and provided additional incentives — in the form of interest payments at a statutorily-provided rate, penalty damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs — that reduced the aforementioned disincentives for contractors to pursue their contractual rights.</p>
    <p id="b686-4" data-blocks='[["BL_686.4",686,[273,612,1153,416]]]'>In our view, the General Assembly in enacting CASPA intended to address the problems inherent in reliance on common law contract doctrine to solve payment disputes in the construction field, and did not intend, as SBA suggests, to impose liability on agents. First, we note that CASPA’s subtitle focuses on two subjects — timely payment and remedies— and does not suggest that its provisions impose liability on non-contracting parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Plainly, SBA’s approach would extend a contractor’s right to payment beyond that contemplated in Sections 4 and 7, as agents are not ordinarily parties to their principals’ construction contracts. Likewise, SBA’s interpretation of Section 2 is difficult to reconcile with the myriad provisions of CASPA which regard a construction contract as central to a contractor’s claim. See, e.g., 73 P.S. § 504 (conditioning entitlement to payment on “[performance <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>... in accordance with the provisions of a contract”); 73 P.S. § 505 (requiring payment in strict compliance with “the terms of the construction contract”); 73 P.S. § 506(a) (permitting owners to withhold payments for deficiently performed work “according to the terms of the construction contract”). SBA’s view of the statute dispenses with that centrality, and extends liability to agents, who, again, may be entirely foreign to the agreement. Although SBA correctly notes that Sections 5 through 12 also set forth the liability of “owners,” in our view, the only way to harmoniously view CASPA, as a whole, is to conclude that Sections 5 through 12 do not intend thereby to impose agency liability.</p>

Had the General Assembly intended to do so, we conclude it would have made a clearer statement to that effect, rather than resort to an ambiguous clause in a definitional provision such as Section 502. Accord Delaware River Port Auth. v. Pa.

While SBA asserts that its interpretation merely requires only high-level decision-making agents to personally guarantee their principals’ construction projects, tellingly, SBA offers nothing in CAS-PA’s text that would suggest such a limitation.</p>

As an initial matter, we note that this Court has not definitively interpreted Section 260.2a as permitting an employee to bring an action against its employer’s agents. In any event, we note that SBA has offered no legislative history or prior decisional law demonstrating that Section 260.2a was, in fact, a model for Section 2 of CASPA. Furthermore, we find that the language of the respective sections is not sufficiently similar to compel the conclusion that they be similarly construed. As noted <em>supra, </em>Section 2’s definition of “owner” is composed of two parts, defining owner as “[a] person who has an interest in the real property ... and who ordered the improvement to be made,” and adding a proviso that “[t]he term includes successors in interest of the owner and agents of the owner acting with their authority.” 73 P.S. § 602. By contrast, Section 260.2(a)’s definition of “employer” is a single, continuous list of qualifying entities that is not similarly structurally divisible. See supra note 5.
