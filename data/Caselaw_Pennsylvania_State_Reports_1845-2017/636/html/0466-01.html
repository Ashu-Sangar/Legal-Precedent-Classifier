The court found that, to the extent the Commonwealth brought the disqualification actions under federal law (18 U.S.C. <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>§§ 3006A, 3599), the Commonwealth lacked a private right of action. <em>In re FCDO, </em><a href="/f3d/790/0457-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="790 F.3d 457" data-case-ids="4272929" data-case-paths="/f3d/790/0457-01">790 F.3d at 475</a>.
