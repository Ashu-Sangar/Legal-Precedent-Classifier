Proceeding under a belief he was subject to a ten-year SORNA registration period (a belief shared at sentencing by the court and the prosecutor), appel-lee filed a Petition for Review in the Nature of a Complaint in Mandamus in the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction on July 19, 2012, shortly before expiration of that period. The petition sought to compel PSP to correct appellee’s sexual offender registration status from lifetime registrant to ten-year registrant and to remove him from the registry when the ten-year period expired. In the course of litigation, the parties attached exhibits including the transcripts from appel-lee’s guilty plea and sentencing proceedings; ultimately, the parties stipulated discovery was unnecessary and cross-motions for summary judgment were filed.</p>

Appellee was twenty-one years old when he met the sixteen-year-old female victim on-line late in 1999. Appel-lee developed a relationship with the victim which ultimately resulted in a series of sexual encounters. The age of consent in Pennsylvania is sixteen, see 18 Pa.C.S. § 3122.1; thus, the consensual sexual relationship itself was not criminal. However, during the course of the relationship, appellee persuaded the victim to take and transmit sexually explicit photographs of herself and he also photographed the two engaging in sexual acts. It is a crime to photograph or cause to be photographed a minor engaging in consensual sex and causing a minor to take sexual photographs of herself. 18 Pa.C.S. § 6312(d).</p>

The parties and the trial court believed appellee was subject to a ten-year registration period, not lifetime registration. <em>See </em>N.T. 2/28/02 at 29-30, 45. Thus, appellee’s mother testified, “My son made a mistake, a terrible, terrible error in his life that’s affected him. He’s been punished. He will be punished.

He is because what he did is a serious offense.” <em>Id. </em>at 45.

Appellee notes a single judgment of conviction follows from each criminal case regardless of the number of guilty counts. Appellee then contends Section 9795.1(b)(1) has a latent ambiguity, revealed when the plural term “convictions” is applied to offenses arising from the same criminal act, episode, or course of conduct. He reasons the ambiguity does not arise from confusing words, but from a disparity between what the statute states is the desired result and a flawed methodology which could prevent that result if a term is construed in a certain way. Appellee maintains it is evident Section 9795.1(b)(1) is ambiguous as reasonable minds could, and have, disagreed about the meaning of “two or more convictions” in the context of the overall statutory construct.</p>

Furthermore, 42 Pa.C.S § 9795.4 states, "[ajfter conviction, but before sentencing, a court shall order an individual convicted of an offense specified in Section 9795.1 (relating to registration) to be assessed by the board.” 42 Pa.C.S § 9795.4(a).
