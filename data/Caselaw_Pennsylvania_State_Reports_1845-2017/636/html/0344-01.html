The property at issue is the Eleanor Siddons Warrant, located in Rush Township, Centre County. The warrant was issued in 1798 as containing 460 acres, strict measure, and was assessed as 438 acres, 163 perches after taking into account roads and waterways.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> As relevant to the dispute in this case, Appellants’ ancestors, Harry and Anna Keller, bought the Eleanor Sid-dons Warrant at a tax sale in 1894.

Moreover, the record contains no evidence that the Kellers informed the commissioners of their reservation of rights. As discussed below, the Kellers were not required to report their reservation of rights under the reporting requirements of the Act of 1806. The lack of reporting, however, is relevant to this case because the county commissioners were tasked with assessing unseated property for taxation purposes based on what was reported by the owners.</p>

Documenting the November 1935 sale from the Centre County Treasurer to the County Commissioners is a deed dated June 1936 using sparse language dictated by Section 9 of the Act of 1815, as set forth at 72 P.S. § 6136, describing the property as “a tract of unseated land containing 433-153 per acres situate in the Rush Twp. in the County of Centre, surveyed to Ralph Smith.” Deed of June 10,1936, R.R. at 65a.</p>

Herder Spring asserted that the 1935 tax sale extinguished the Kellers’ 1899 reservation of subsurface rights. The basis of the argument is that because the County Commissioners had not been alerted to the Kellers’ reservation of rights, the taxes were assessed against the entire Eleanor Siddons Warrant, and the sale of the property for delinquent taxes resulted in a sale of both the surface and subsurface rights. The tax sale of the fee simple estate, <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>according to Herder Spring, extinguished any prior reserved estates in concurrence with the longstanding policy of “title-washing.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> In furtherance of its argument, Herder Spring observed that the deed from the Centre County Commissioners to Herr did not reference only the “surface estate” but rather the “Eleanor Siddons Warrant.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Herder Spring, <em>inter alia, </em>contended that the 1935 tax sale resulted in the conveyance of the entire Eleanor Siddons Warrant and not merely the surface rights as alleged by the Keller Heirs. Relying on the pre-1947 statutes and caselaw relating to taxation of unseated land discussed <em>infra. </em>Herder Spring contended that the failure of the Kellers to notify the County Commissioners of the reservation of subsurface rights following the 1899 sale of the surface rights to the Becks, “result[ed] in the tax assessment of the fee interest [e.g. the surface and subsurface rights] to continue, and when the taxes went unpaid, it was this fee interest which was sold to [Herder Spring’s] predecessor in title Max Herr.” Herder Spring Summary Judgment Motion at 3, R.R. 119a. It argued that owners of unseated land were required to notify the county commissioners of their interest to allow for proper assessment and taxation and that the commissioners were not required to search deeds to determine ownership for taxation purposes. While acknowledging that a reservation of mineral rights may create an estate separate from the surface, Herder Spring contended that the 1935 tax sale involved assessment, taxation, and conveyance of the entire Eleanor Siddons Warrant because the Kellers did not report the severance of their subsurface rights from the surface rights or pay the tax assessed on the entire Warrant.</p>

Thus, if the warrant had been assessed as a whole, the tax sale would have divested “all the estate and interest therein, that the real owner or owners had at the time of such sale.” Act of 1804, § 5.

As explained in the Historical Society of Pennsylvania’s <em>Land Records Guide, </em>Pennsylvania’s early land law developed from policies instituted by William Penn’s sons in an attempt to encourage organized settlement and payment for the land. Generally, a person seeking to purchase land would submit an application to the Land Office. The secretary would issue a warrant, which described the land, the property adjoining the land, the purchaser, the purchase price, and the terms of sale. The issuance of the warrant triggered the surveyor general's responsibility for surveying the land, which would produce a survey map that identified important features on the land and adjoining properties and town and county boundaries, which helped to create cohesive maps of the area. Upon completion of the survey by the deputy surveyor, the surveyor general would verify the acreage, which included a six percent allowance for roads. After the survey was returned, a patent would be issued providing clear title from the state or the proprietor (such as the Penn Family) to the original purchaser of the property.

Yet, for an issue to be preserved for appeal, a party must raise it at the first possible opportunity to do so. <em>Cf. Cagnoli v. Bonnell, </em><a href="/pa/531/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="531 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1834417" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0199-01">531 Pa. 199</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="159" data-cite="531 Pa. 199" data-case-ids="1834417" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0199-01">611 A.2d 1194</a>, 1196 (1992) (issue not waived when counsel raised it at the earliest possible time in the court below). This particular civil proceeding — an action to quiet title — conforms to our rules of civil procedure, and, thus, all provisions of those rules are applicable. <em>See </em>Pa. R.C.P. 1061 (“[T]he procedure in the action to quiet title from the commencement to the entry of judgment shall be in accordance with the rules relating to a civil action.”). The Keller Heirs’ challenge to the tax sale, distilled to its essence, is a claim that the sale was illegal because it violated their constitutional due process rights. Consequently, in my view, the Keller Heirs were required by Pa.R.C.P. 1030(a) to plead the alleged illegality of the tax sale in the trial court as an affirmative defense in response to Appellee’s complaint to quiet title. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1030(a) (“[A]ll affirmative defenses including but not limited to ... illegality ... shall be pleaded in a responsive pleading under the heading ‘New Matter’ ”.). In that complaint, Appellee alleged that it acquired a fee simple interest to both the surface and subsurface estates under the Act of 1806 as a result of the 1935 tax sale, which it further contended was done in accordance with the law then in existence and with the Keller Heirs’ full knowledge. <em>See </em>First Amended Complaint in Action to Quiet Title (R.R. 12a-23a) at ¶ 10, 16, 19. As the Keller Heirs did not raise any issue of a due process impediment to the legal validity of the sale in a responsive pleading to this complaint, despite that being the first opportunity for them to raise such a claim, I would deem it waived for purposes of the present appeal under Pa.R.A.P. <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>302(a) (“Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a>
