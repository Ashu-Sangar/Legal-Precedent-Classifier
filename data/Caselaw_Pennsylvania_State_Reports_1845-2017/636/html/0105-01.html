Unbeknownst to the victims, the arms deal was a ruse, and Williams planned to rob them when they met. <em>Id. </em>at 50. White testified that he stole a dark colored van at Williams’ request to aid in the robbery plan. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. Williams had a duffle bag full of guns stashed in a closet at his girlfriend’s house, which he passed out to the members of his gang participating in the robbery. Williams gave White a shotgun, Bennett a .357 automatic weapon and kept for himself what White described as an “[uzi] type of handgun,” as well as the .9 millimeter gun he “always” carried. <em>Id. </em>at 53-54.</p>

Upon receiving from one of the victims the $2400 brought to make the gun purchase, Williams continued to demand more money. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58. One of the three victims ultimately confessed that there was more money at another location, prompting Williams, Bennett and a third person, known to White only as “Steve,” to take that victim in the stolen van to obtain the money, leaving White, Wilson and a third gang member (whose name White did not know) to guard the remaining two victims.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Reynolds was on his back, with his feet on the curb and his head pointed away from the street, his head resting on a bandana or kerchief, which, according to the witness, appeared to have originally been around Reynolds’ head or neck. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 119.

Dr. Paul J. Hoyer, Assistant Medical Examiner for Philadelphia, testified that whether a person would sustain additional injuries (scrapes, bruises, abrasions, contusions) resulting from a fall after a shooting would depend on the type of surface upon which the person fell, the speed at which they were traveling (e.g., if they were running at the time they were shot), and whether the surface was wet or dry. N.T., 7/28/1993, at 157. If a person was running when shot, for example, Dr. Hoyer stated that he would expect to see abrasions on the body from the fall. <em>Id. </em>at 164. According to Dr. Hoyer, the absence of non-gunshot injuries on a body that fell after being shot means only that the body “did not fall against a hard surface with a lot of force.” <em>Id. </em>at 162. The trial court precluded defense counsel from posing a hypothetical question regarding whether Dr. Hoyer would expect to see additional injuries to a body that was thrown or pushed onto concrete from a moving van after being shot. <em>Id. </em>at 161-67.

According to Tressel, the blood flow evidence supported only a finding that the victims were shot at the locations where they were found by police. This testimony certainly falls under Williams’ claim, contained in his original counseled PCRA petition, that trial counsel failed to present exculpatory evidence highlighting contradictions between the physical evidence and White’s story of what occurred.

While Dr. Wetli’s phrasing of his testimony on direct would have been helpful to Williams’ defense, the Commonwealth’s cross-examination left very little force to his opinion. Dr. Wetli’s opinion was based solely on the absence of non-gunshot injuries on the victims’ bodies or damage to their clothing, but he conceded that it was “difficult to say with any degree of certainty what should have occurred with regard to the bodies.” N.T., 3/11/2013, at 145. In particular, because there was no information pertaining to “the speed of the van,” and because “[t]he slower the van is moving, obviously the less injury you’re going to be getting,” he could only conclude that although it was “possible,” he believed it “very unlikely” that the murders occurred the way White testified. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 145.</p>

Moreover, it is doubtful that Dr. Wetli’s testimony would have been admissible as expert testimony at trial. Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 702 provides that a witness so qualified may testify as an expert if: “(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge is beyond that possessed by the average layperson; (b) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; and (c) the expert’s methodology is generally accepted in the relevant field.” Pa.R.E. 702. Taking nothing away from Dr. Wetli’s experience and expertise, the record reflects that his testimony amounted only to his conclusion that a person thrown onto the sidewalk from a van that is driving fast enough down the street would likely sustain injuries and damage their clothing. That is not something that is beyond the grasp of the average layperson.

The record reflects that there was some evidence presented that, at most, circumstantially or tangentially either linked Williams to the murders or corroborated certain aspects of White’s testimony.

Contrary to the position taken by Chief Justice Saylor in his concurring opinion, the blood spatter and blood flow evidence would not only have served to impeach White’s testimony, but constituted substantive evidence that provided an alternate scenario for the commission of the crime (i.e., the victims were shot where they were found and were not thrown from a van). Further, the Chief Justice's reliance upon trial testimony that it rained at some unknown time for an unknown duration after the murders — an area the Commonwealth neither raised nor pursued either in its questioning or its arguments before the PCRA court — does not invalidate Tressel’s testimony.

We take no position on Chief Justice Saylor’s conclusion in his concurrence that the trial court’s actions constituted a structural error that necessitates the grant of a new trial. While the trial court erred in limiting cross-examination of an expert witness through the use of hypothetical questions and denigrating defense counsel's attempt to pursue the line of cross-examination, defense counsel was able to elicit testimony in support of the defense theory from two of the Commonwealth’s experts and presented closing argument on the facts that counsel attempted to develop with the precluded cross-examination. Because the record fully supports the PCRA court’s determination that appellate counsel was otherwise ineffective for failing to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based upon trial counsel's failure to present the above-discussed expert testimony, it is unnecessary in this case to engage in the detailed analysis necessary to determine whether the law of structural error applies to the record before us, especially in light of the fact that the parties neither raised nor briefed this question on appeal. <em>See Neder v.

One difficulty facing the defendants in their efforts to counter the core elements of White’s testimony was the unlikelihood that two brothers <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>and their companion from New York would have been randomly killed on the same night in an uncoordinated fashion by different actors in different areas of Philadelphia. Rather, the circumstances surrounding the murders strongly suggested some sort of coordination in the killings entailing one or more elements of transportation. In addition to supplying such an explanation, White’s account was complemented by substantial corroboration in material respects, including through the testimony of the sister of two of the victims describing a recent meeting between Appellant and the three victims in New York. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 146-47 n. 24, 141 A.3d at 465-66 n. 24 (discussing this and other corroborative details); <em>see also </em>N.T., July 29, 1993, at 82 (reflecting the depiction, by Appellant’s trial counsel, of the sister as “a crucial witness for” the prosecution, as “[s]he gives corroboration that [Appellant] was involved in the shooting of those three men”). Although certainly evidence tending to disprove discrete details of White’s account could have affected the jurors’ assessment of its truthfulness, from my point of view, the corroboration of other important details and the absence of any other plausible explanation for the three apparently related killings diminishes the likelihood that such impact would have been dispositive.</p>

To the degree that this evidence undercuts James White’s testimony that two of the victims were killed in the back a van, and that the body of at least one was thrown or pushed from the vehicle, it would seem to me that the impact could have been considerably countered by the prosecution through the mere observation that the bodies apparently had been exposed to the elements for a substantial period of time before they were discovered. <em>See, e.g., </em>N.T., July 22, 1993, at 122-123 (reflecting the testimony of a detective that Kevin Anderson’s body “had been obviously been [sic] there for quite some time,” “[h]is clothes were soaked,” and “[t]here was not a great amount of blood around the head area, which you would [njormally see from a head wound,” since <em>“[i]t had like been washed away during the night by the min” </em>(emphasis added)).</p>

In this regard, three experienced trial attorneys relied upon cross-examination of the Commonwealth’s experts, as well as arguments invoking the jurors’ common experience, to highlight the incongruity arising from the fact that none of the victims’ bodies or clothes evidenced signs of injury or disturbance on account of having been, as James White described it, thrown or pushed from a moving vehicle.<a class="footnotemark">1</a>

    <p id="b214-4" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[274,563,1155,416]]]'>I write solely to distance myself from the Majority’s rejection of the PCRA court’s reliance upon Dr. Charles Wetli’s testimony to support its conclusion that trial counsel’s “failure to consult with experts in preparation for the defense left him unable to challenge key inconsistent aspects of [the Commonwealth’s evidence], to be able to appropriately cross-examine the Commonwealth experts, or to present his own expert testimony in rebuttal.” PCRA Ct. Op. at 29.</p>
    <p id="b214-5" data-blocks='[["BL_214.5",214,[274,1000,1155,836]]]'>As the Majority recognizes, Dr. Wetli is the former Chief Medical Examiner for Suffolk County, New York. At the PCRA hearing, Dr. Wetli testified as an expert in forensic pathology. In his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical and forensic certainty, the location and condition of the victims’ bodies and clothing materially were inconsistent with the version of events as recounted by James White, the Commonwealth’s primary witness against Williams, who stated that he observed Williams either toss or throw the victims’ bodies from a moving vehicle. Maj. Op. at 131-32, 141 A.3d at 456-57. Based upon his experience examining bodies expelled from moving vehicles, Dr. Wetli testified that he would have expected to see evidence of injury to the victims’ bodies or damage to their clothing. Dr. Wetli opined that there was no evidence to support White’s testimony that the victims were thrown from a moving vehicle.</p>

The PCRA court implicitly credited Dr. Wetli’s opinion that the absence of damage to the clothing or injury to the bodies was inconsistent with what an expert in forensic pathology would <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>have expected to see on bodies thrown from a moving vehicle, and considered this testimony to be supportive of Williams’ claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to consult ■with or to retain any experts in this case. PCRA Ct. Op. at 23; 29. As the arbiter of credibility, the PCRA court was entitled to rely upon this testimony. Indeed, testimony from the Commonwealth’s expert witness, Dr. Samuel Gulino, was consistent with Dr. Wetli’s testimony in this regard. <em>Id. </em>at 24-25. In my view, the record supports the PCRA court’s conclusion that the expert testimony presented at the PCRA hearing rendered White’s testimony incredible. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 133-34, 141 A.3d at 457-58.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[197,995,1154,1116]]]'>The Majority rejects the PCRA court’s conclusion that Dr. Wetli’s testimony would have helped the defense, and holds that, to the extent Williams’ claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness rested upon Dr. Wetli’s testimony, it lacks arguable merit. I disagree. In dismissing Dr. Wetli’s testimony, the Majority acknowledges that, although it would have been helpful to the defense, its benefit was marginal at best. According to the Majority, the Commonwealth’s cross-examination of Dr. Wetli “left very little force to his opinion.” Maj. Op. at 139-40, 141 A.3d at 461. The Majority has not explained, however, the extent to which the Commonwealth undermined Dr. Wetli’s testimony through cross-examination at the PCRA hearing. More importantly, the PCRA court found Dr. Wetli’s expert testimony credible, and apparently was not swayed by the cross-examination that the Majority now credits with undermining that testimony. As an appellate court, we are bound by the PCRA court’s credibility determination in favor of Dr. Wetli. We may not discount this testimony now because of cross-examination that the PCRA court found unpersuasive. In doing so, the Majority has exceeded our appellate boundaries.</p>

PCRA Ct. Op. at 23-24 (observing that, although Dr. Wetli testified that it was “possible” for the bodies to have been thrown from the van, he qualified this statement by explaining that “I would be very surprised if that, in fact, was the case based on the total lack of evidence for any such occurrence”). The Majority’s second-guessing as to the persuasiveness of Dr. Wetli’s testimony, and its selective use of portions of his testimony for purposes of discounting his expert opinion, violates our obligation to defer to the PCRA court’s credibility determinations that are supported by the record.</p>
    <p id="b216-4" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[261,1094,1154,1051]]]'>I also decline to join in the Majority’s speculation that Dr. Wetli’s testimony would have been inadmissible at Williams’ trial pursuant to Rule 702 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence because the testimony involved a matter of common sense, rather than a matter beyond the ken of “the average layperson.” Pa.R.E. 702. Trial counsel had a duty to investigate the circumstances of the case, a duty which involved an independent investigation and understanding of the physical and medical evidence. <em>See Commonwealth v. Bailey, </em><a href="/pa/480/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="480 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1745038" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0329-01">480 Pa. 329</a>, <a href="/pa/480/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="480 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="1745038" data-case-paths="/pa/480/0329-01">390 A.2d 166</a>, 170 (1978). The PCRA court concluded that trial counsel’s failure to consult with experts in preparation for the defense left him unable to challenge the Commonwealth’s evidence. PCRA Ct. Op. at 29. Rule 702 has no bearing upon counsel’s obligation to investigate, nor upon counsel’s failure to do so in this case. The Majority advances this dubious hypothesis without advocacy, and premises this notion upon nothing more than speculation. I can discern no reason to inject Rule 702 into the consideration of Williams’ ineffectiveness claim on appeal, and I distance myself from the Majority’s decision to do so.</p>
