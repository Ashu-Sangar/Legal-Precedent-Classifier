He proceeds to reason that Article XI, Section 1 is violated here because in order for the electorate to accept a “change” to the constitution, the voter must necessarily know what the constitution currently provides in addition to what it would provide if the amendment were adopted. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 145 A.3d at 1154.

Respectfully, we believe Justice Wecht's concern raises a distinction without a difference. The question in <em>Stander </em>was whether a ballot question asking voters to approve a proposed constitutional amendment contained sufficient information. Because this case presents the same issue, <em>Stander </em>is controlling and no party disputes its applicability. The fact that the General Assembly may use different processes to arrive at its decision to propose a constitutional amendment is irrelevant to how we review whether the ballot question provides the voters with sufficient information on which to consider its adoption.</p>

As acknowledged in Justice Baer’s Opinion at 550-51, 145 A.3d at 1141-42, <em>Stander </em>is the governing test to assess whether the content and meaning of the wording of a ballot question is adequate to enable the voter to understand the true nature of the changes to the Constitution which a proposed amendment will effectuate. In that regard, we view Justice Baer’s reliance on <em>Oncken v. Ewing, </em><a href="/pa/336/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="336 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="1195633" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0043-01">336 Pa. 43</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20A.2d%20402" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="8 A.2d 402">8 A.2d 402</a> (1939), to be misplaced. Unlike <em>Stander, </em>in <em>Oncken, </em>we were not addressing the <em>constitutional </em>requirements for the content of a ballot question. Rather, our Court was considering the discrete issue of whether the results of an election should be invalidated because the manner of printing of the ballot itself failed to precisely comport with the <em>statutory </em>requirements of the Election Code. The alleged fatal flaw in the ballot in that case, which the challenger did not raise prior to the election under the procedures afforded by the Election Code, was that it did not, as required by that Code, contain the words "yes” or “no” next to the question on which the voter was asked to place an "X”, even though it instructed the voter to indicate his or her choice by placing an "X” directly opposite the words "For City Charter” if they were in favor of its adoption, or "Against City Charter” if they were opposed to its enactment. As the issue in that case turned on the question of whether a technical defect in the physical appearance of the ballot itself was misleading to the voter and, thus, interfered with his statutory right to make a free choice, it has little application here. Moreover, <em>Stander </em>makes no reference to <em>Oncken, </em>and our research discloses no instance where <em>Oncken </em>has been used by our Court to assess whether the structure and content of the language of a ballot question involving a proposed constitutional amendment was misleading; hence, we consider it to be inapplicable to the resolution of the instant case.</p>

Critically, none of the cases Justice Baer references involved constitutional challenges to the <em>wording </em>of ballot questions on proposed amendments; thus, they have no bearing on the resolution of the instant matter.</p>

We find no merit to the Secretary’s additional assertions that Plaintiffs’ complaint raises a non-justiciable question, or that it is barred by the doctrine of laches. Specifically with regard to laches, our Court has heretofore indicated that, because of the paramount importance of the manner in which a proposed constitutional amendment is presented to the people for consideration, the doctrine of laches was not a bar to our Court’s consideration of such matters. <em>See Tausig v.

Opining that I have "raise[d] a distinction without a difference,” Justice Baer's opinion relies upon the fact that this Court upheld the ballot question in <em>Stander </em>even though it "did not specifically reference or explain the several substantive changes that would result from a ‘yes’ vote, including that a retirement age of 70 was being imposed on jurists for the first time.” Justice Baer’s Opinion at 550 n. 7, 551-52, 145 A.3d at 1141 n. 7, 1142. This ignores <em>Stander's </em>recognition that it would have been impossible to print on the ballot a comprehensive summary of the proposed Judiciary Article V. <em>Stander, </em><a href="/citations/?q=250%20A.2d%20474" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="250 A.2d 474">250 A.2d at 480</a> ("It is equally clear and realistic beyond the peradventure of a doubt that a lengthy summary of the proposed Judiciary Article could not have been printed on an election ballot.’’). Plainly, this distinction makes all the difference in the world. A non-deceptive and constitutionally-compliant ballot question could readily have been printed here.</p>
