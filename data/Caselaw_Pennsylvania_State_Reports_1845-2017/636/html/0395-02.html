A.S. involved the proper construction of the lifetime-registration triggering language “two or more convictions” in Megan’s Law II, Pennsylvania’s former sex offender registration statute. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(b)(1) (superseded). This appeal concerns nearly identical triggering language brought over into Section 9799.14 of Pennsylvania’s current statute, Act 111 of 2011, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9799.10-9799.41.

Under the two-tier system of Megan’s Law, lifetime registration was required for “[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a),” i.e., for offenses otherwise subject to ten-year registration. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795,l(a)-(b) (superseded) (emphasis added). Under SORNA’s three-tier system, lifetime registration is required for offenders with “two or more convictions of offenses listed as Tier I or Tier II sexual offenses,” <em>i.e., </em>for offenses otherwise subject to fifteen-year or twenty-five-year registration. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9799.14(d).

On the eve of argument, however, the Defender Association of Philadelphia, which was not appointed and which had not filed a brief as <em>amicus curiae, </em>entered an appearance as counsel for appellant and an assistant defender presented oral argument. Counsel’s oral presentation included several sophisticated arguments not pursued in appellant’s brief, including, <em>inter alia, </em>a claim of ambiguity premised upon the textual differences between Megan’s Law and SORNA; a claim the statute is subject to strict construction because, in other circumstances not present here, it applies retroactively, <em>see </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(2) (retroactive provisions "shall be strictly construed”); and a claim that "sequential prosecutions” should be required to trigger the recidivist provision. These claims were not outlined or developed in appellant’s brief. In addition, it appears the Commonwealth, like the Court, was not provided a written exposition of the new theories and points presented at oral argument. Under the circumstances, for purposes of decision, we will confine ourselves to the arguments outlined in the briefs.</p>

In that case, I expressed my dissenting view that Megan’s Law II’s provision that “[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>of the offenses set forth in” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9795.1(a) “shall be subject to lifetime registration” as a sexual offender, 42 Pa. C.S. § 9795.1(b)(1), clearly and unambiguously provides that any individual who accrues multiple convictions of offenses set forth in Section 9795.1(a) is subject to lifetime registration as a sexual offender. <em>See A.S., </em><a href="/pa/636/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="143 A.3d 896" data-case-ids="12280216,6787905" data-case-paths="/pa/636/0403-01,/a3d/143/0896-01">143 A.3d 896</a> (Todd, J., dissenting). In my view, SORNA’s analogous provision, that an individual with “[t]wo or more convictions of offenses listed as Tier I or Tier II sexual offenses” is subject to lifetime registration, 42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9799.14(d)(16); <em>see also </em>9799.15(a)(l)-(3), likewise clearly and unambiguously provides that any individual who accrues multiple convictions of Tier I or Tier II sexual offenses must register for life. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>
