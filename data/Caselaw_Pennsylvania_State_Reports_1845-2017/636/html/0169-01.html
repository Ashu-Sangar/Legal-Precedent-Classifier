    <p id="b224-6" data-blocks='[["BL_224.5",224,[266,491,1153,1280]]]'>Ryan D. Safka (Appellant) was the driver of an automobile that crashed killing three of his four passengers. The investigating police officer believed that Appellant’s speed caused the accident. He, in part, relied upon data retrieved from the vehicle’s Event Data Recorder (EDR) which, as fully elaborated upon herein, recorded the vehicle’s speed for the five seconds prior to the airbag’s deployment. In a non-jury vehicular manslaughter trial, after the evidence was closed, the trial court reopened it to permit the parties to present additional evidence concerning the reliability of the EDR data. The question presented herein is whether this was trial court error. We hold that in this non-jury proceeding, the trial court had the discretion to reopen the record <em>sua sponte </em>to receive additional testimony to avoid a miscarriage of justice, and did not abuse its discretion by doing so. In this regard, we find this case analogous to Pennsylvania’s well-established rule that upon request by either party, a court may reopen the record to prevent such a miscarriage of justice. <em>See Commonwealth v. Baldwin, </em><a href="/pa/619/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="619 Pa. 178" data-case-ids="4234346" data-case-paths="/pa/619/0178-01">619 Pa. 178</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20A.3d%20764" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="68 A.3d 764">68 A.3d 764</a>, 763 (2012) (holding that the reopening of a case after the parties have rested to take additional testimony is within the trial court’s discretion, the exercise of which is couched in terms of preventing a failure or miscarriage of justice). Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

As the car approached a bend in the road, it struck the jersey-barrier dividing the opposing lanes of traffic, careened back across its two lanes to the berm of the highway, where it struck a pile of snow that had accumulated under a guard rail, and vaulted airborne over the trees lining the roadway until it crashed on a steep hill adjacent to 1-376. Appellant and one passenger survived. The other three passengers were killed.</p>

      <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>Pennsylvania State Trooper Mark Kern, an accident recon-structionist, arrived at the scene shortly after the accident to determine its cause. Trooper Kern assessed the damage done to Appellant’s vehicle and the roadway. From his calculations, he determined that Appellant’s vehicle was traveling at approximately 67 miles per hour (mph) in a 50 mph zone when it hit the guardrail and left the roadway. In addition to his accident reconstruction calculations, Trooper Kern investigated whether Appellant’s car was equipped with an EDR, which is a device placed in the vehicle by the manufacturer to collect and record information about the operation of the vehicle’s airbags. Trooper Kern learned that Appellant’s vehicle was so equipped, and that the particular EDR model recorded the vehicle’s speed for the five seconds prior to airbag deployment. Using his training and past experience with EDRs, Trooper Kern extracted the EDR, determined that it was undamaged, and downloaded its information. The data from the EDR corroborated Trooper Kern’s belief that speed was a factor in the accident.</p>

Appellant waived his right to a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial, which commenced February 6, 2012. Although the Commonwealth disclosed the EDR data in discovery, the defense did not file any pretrial motions to challenge admission of this evidence.</p>

Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 2/6/2012, at 11-12 (“It is our position, Judge, that [the EDR] is not held to the standard of other instrumenta-tions in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”); <em>id. </em>at 12 (“In this case, Judge, they are looking at a box that is not certified, not calibrated. We would submit it lacks the certain reliability.”). The prosecutor argued that these concerns pertained to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13. Interpreting the defense argument as an oral motion <em>in limine </em>challenging the admissibility of the EDR data, the trial court stated that it would consider the matter and rule on it when the Commonwealth introduced the EDR evidence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Considering the weight of the car and the distance it traveled while airborne, other physical observations from the accident reconstruction, and his calculations of what speed would send a vehicle airborne for the distance it traveled, Trooper Kern opined that Appellant was traveling at least 67 mph when the car left the roadway.</p>

Although he was unable to explain pre<a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>cisely how the device recorded data, Trooper Kern testified generally about how it functions and his experience downloading data from other EDRs. With regard to the data he downloaded from the EDR in Appellant’s vehicle, Trooper Kern explained that it recorded Appellant’s speed five seconds before the airbags deployed, which he believed was when the vehicle hit the jersey-barrier dividing the opposing lanes of traffic. This data reflected that at five seconds before deployment, the vehicle was traveling 106 mph; at four seconds before deployment, it was traveling 100 mph; at three seconds before deployment, it was traveling 94 mph; at two seconds before deployment, it was traveling 87 mph; and at one second before deployment, it was traveling 70 mph. Trooper Kern testified that this supported his opinion that Appellant lost control of his vehicle due to excessive speed. During cross-examination, defense counsel attempted to cast doubt on the reliability of data retrieved from an EDR generally. Trooper Kern testified that there is no uniformity within the automotive industry regarding the data an EDR will record, and that the EDR is not calibrated or certified for accuracy by an independent agency. The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of Appellant’s surviving passenger, who stated his belief that Appellant was traveling between 70 and 80 mph in the 50 mph zone just prior to the accident.</p>
    <p id="b227-5" data-blocks='[["BL_227.4",227,[198,1647,1155,743]]]'>After the Commonwealth rested its case, the trial court permitted Appellant and the prosecutor to revisit the motion <em>in limine, </em>which defense counsel characterized as a motion for judgment of acquittal. Defense counsel argued that without testing, certification, or calibration, and with a lack of uniformity among manufacturers, data derived from the EDR was not reliable and should not be admitted. The Commonwealth responded that EDRs are not meant to be certified or calibrated. Rather, an EDR is installed during a vehicle’s manufacture, where it remains for the life of the automobile. The trial court denied Appellant’s motion <em>in limine </em>and stated that it was the court’s obligation as fact-finder to determine how much weight to give the EDR data. Appellant chose not to testify, or to present evidence.</p>

The trial court explained that it was not revisiting the motion <em>in limine, </em>but was concerned with what weight the court should give to “some amorphous module that someone gathers data from.” N.T., 2/7/2012, at 153. Following closing arguments, the trial court stated that it would review the matter overnight.</p>

N.T., 2/8/2012, at 159. Moreover, the court explained that there was no Pennsylvania precedent to guide it. Accordingly, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>decided to reopen the record and continue the trial in two weeks for the limited purpose of providing both parties the opportunity to present expert testimony about the accuracy and reliability of information recorded by the EDR.</p>

Although Mr. Ruth agreed with Trooper Kern regarding the speed of Appellant’s vehicle prior to airbag deployment, he opined that the airbags deployed not when the vehicle hit the jersey-barrier as Trooper Kern testified, but when the vehicle struck the trees after being vaulted over the guardrail.</p>
    <p id="b229-6" data-blocks='[["BL_229.5",229,[191,1170,1154,523]]]'>On cross-examination, Mr. Ruth testified that although EDRs are not inspected, certified, or calibrated, there was no need for such inspection, certification, or calibration. According to Mr. Ruth, EDRs transmit data digitally, so it is either on and collecting data, or it is not functioning and not recording data. In addition, Mr. Ruth explained that the EDR is constantly recording vehicle readings for five second periods, which are continually overwritten unless the airbag is deployed. Once the airbags deploy, the last five seconds are permanently recorded.</p>

Rather, Appellant waited until the day of trial to make an assertion which the trial court treated as an objection to admissibility. The trial court noted that it permitted the Commonwealth to admit the EDR data and reserved consideration of the weight of the evidence. It is apparent from the trial court’s Rule 1925(a) opinion that when the trial court reopened the record to assess the weight of evidence it had already admitted, it acted out of an abundance of caution in this bench trial to afford the criminal defendant the opportunity to respond to its concerns.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a>

In addressing Appellant’s argument that the trial court had no discretion to open the record <em>sua sponte, </em>the Superior Court faulted Appellant for failing to confront how the timing of his objection hampered the trial court’s ability to evaluate the EDR data. The Superior Court reasoned that, by failing to file a pre-trial motion, despite knowing the Commonwealth intended to rely on the EDR data, the Superi- or Court reasoned that Appellant forfeited his opportunity to have the trial court explore the foundational evidence necessary to determine whether EDR data is accurate, reliable, and generally accepted in the scientific community. Thus, according to the Superior Court, the trial court was left with little time to assess such questions, and, using its discretion to assess the admissibility of evidence, admitted the EDR data subject to a later determination of whether there was a sufficient foundation to establish the technology’s accuracy and reliability.</p>

Although Appellant agrees that a trial court generally has discretion to permit a party to reopen its case prior to the entry of a final judgment, he argues that there is no authority which permits a court to do so <em>sua sponte. </em>It makes no difference to Appellant’s argument if the case proceeds as a bench or jury trial. In this respect, Appellant argues that the lack of a jury does not grant the court <em>carte blanche </em>authority to develop a record to its liking.

The Commonwealth’s evidence as to speed primarily consisted of testimony from Pennsylvania State Trooper Mark Kern, an accident reconstructionist. Trooper Kern offered two kinds of testimony at trial.

In addition, the Commonwealth could have taken better charge of its case and been prepared to prove the reliability of its scientific evidence, which obviously was important to a successful prosecution. <em>See Grady, </em><a href="/pa/576/0546-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="839 A.2d 1038" data-case-ids="16775,9061706" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0546-01,/a2d/839/1038-01">839 A.2d at 1045</a> (emphasizing proponent of expert scientific evidence bears burden of proof on <em>Frye </em>issue).

I merely stress the rules do not discourage this defense strategy; this case suggests <em>Frye </em>issues may be sufficiently distinct from other evidentiary issues as to warrant a more regularized pre-trial process; and, since the Court is responsible for the procedural rules, it is a matter that may warrant referral to the Committee on Rules of Evidence and the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee.</p>

Op. at 7.1 am uncomfortable with reliance on post-trial explanations of the fact-finder’s internal deliberation especially where, as here, there is contemporaneous record evidence indicating the question is not so simple. <em>See </em>Dissenting Op. at 194, 141 A.3d at 1254 (Donohue, J., dissenting). For example, the record shows that, when trial reconvened following the reopening of the record, the court stated "virtually none” of the non-EDR evidence (i.e., the surviving passenger’s lay testimony and Trooper Kern's calculations about the speed of appellant’s vehicle) "would evidence criminality.” N.T. 2/21/12 at 231. The court then stated the EDR data showed a speed of 106 miles per hour and ruled the EDR data was admissible and sufficient to support guilty verdicts. <em>Id. </em>at 231-32. It appears the supplemental evidence respecting the EDR data spared the trial court the task of determining whether the remaining evidence alone warranted a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Appellant argued the trial court’s <em>sua sponte </em>reopening of the record violated the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, U.S. Const, amend. V; Pa. Const. Art. I, § 10, as the parties had rested their cases and the trial court had begun deliberation.</p>
