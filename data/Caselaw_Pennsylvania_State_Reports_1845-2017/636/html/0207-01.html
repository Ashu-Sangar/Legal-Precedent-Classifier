Appellant asserts the Superior Court incorrectly read into the statute a requirement that the five arrest-free years be “immediately” following the conviction sought to be expunged, when the actual text of the statute does not include that qualifier. Appellant claims courts should not add words or phrases when construing a statute unless the words are “necessary for a proper interpretation, do not conflict with the obvious intent of the statute, and do not in any way affect its scope and operation.” Appellant’s Brief at 11, <em>citing Commonwealth v.

Appellant points out the General Assembly has used “immediately following” in other statutes when it intends to qualify timing in this way, and thus the omission of the phrase from Section 9122(b)(3)(i) is telling. Appellant’s Brief at 12, <em>citing, e.g., </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 9143 (Office of Attorney General has power to promulgate guidelines for implementation of statute for period of “one year immediately following the effective date of this section”).</p>

Appellant further stresses the Legislature’s use of the present perfect tense— “has been free of arrest” — supports her interpretation that the statute does not refer to any particular five-year period, and that period can occur recently, as opposed to the Superior Court’s conversion of the language, in the Anal paragraph of its opinion, to read “was not free of arrest or prosecution.” <em><a href="/a3d/111/0201-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="111 A.3d 201" data-case-ids="6884658" data-case-paths="/a3d/111/0201-01">Id.</a> </em>(emphasis added).

As written, the language leaves open the question: during what five-year period must an individual be free from arrest? Is it, as Appellant argues, “any” five year period following conviction; or is it, as the Commonwealth argues, “the” five-year period “immediately” following the conviction? Because Subsection 9122(b)(3)(i)’s language is “reasonably capable of either construction,” the statute is indeed ambiguous. <em>Freedom Med. Supply, Inc. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas.

Upon closer review, however, it <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>becomes apparent that Appellant’s interpretation is the more persuasive construct.</p>
    <p id="b275-4" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[201,460,1155,732]]]'>First, as a principle of statutory construction, we may add words or phrases in construing a statute only if they are “necessary to the proper interpretation of a statute” and “do not conflict with its obvious purpose and intent, nor in any way affect its scope and operation.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1923(c). As mentioned above, both interpretations arguably require us to read in missing words to clarify the applicable five-year period. However, accepting the Commonwealth’s suggestion— adding “the” and “immediately” — significantly limits the scope of who may be eligible for an expungement. Specifically, the Commonwealth’s interpretation excludes individuals, such as Appellant, from seeking an expungement, notwithstanding that they have been arrest-free well past multiple five-year periods following their conviction.</p>
    <p id="b275-5" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[201,1214,1156,626]]]'>On the other hand, Appellant’s suggestion — adding “any”— does not significantly alter or limit the statutory language of Subsection 9122(b)(3)(i), because the statute as written has no limitation on which five-year period would suffice, indicating that any five-year period is acceptable. Thus, adding the word “any” helps to clarify the legislature’s intent, rather than significantly alter it. Moreover, regardless of whether we apply the penal or remedial standard of statutory construction,<a class="footnotemark">1</a> we construe the statute in favor of Appellant, and therefore, her suggestion of adding “any” is more appropriate than the Commonwealth’s suggestion to add “the” and “immediately.”</p>

Here, the General Assembly’s use of the past perfect tense “has been” is instructive. The phrase “has been” implies that the five-year period could be any five-year period following conviction ending with the most recent one. To accept the Commonwealth’s argument that the General <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>Assembly intended the statute to include only the first five-year period immediately following conviction would require a change of “has been” to “was.” Otherwise, as Appellant points out, the statute would read: “An individual ... has been free of arrest or prosecution for [the] five years [immediately] following the conviction,” which, grammatically, is awkward. <em>See </em>Appellant’s Brief at 16. If that was the Legislature’s intent, the statutory provision would properly take the past tense, <em>ie., </em>requiring that Appellant “was free of arrest or prosecution for the five years immediately following conviction.” Thus, Appellant’s interpretation is more grammatically accurate, weighing in favor of her interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[266,1026,1153,1349]],["BL_277.1",277,[195,341,1152,95]]]'>Third, Appellant rebuts the Commonwealth’s strongest argument that her interpretation renders “following the conviction for that offense” to be mere surplusage. At first blush, the Commonwealth’s argument seems plausible: if the General Assembly intended the arrest-free period to be “any” five-year period after conviction, then it would not have had to say “following the conviction,” and instead could have said simply that a petitioner must be “free of arrest for five years.” According to the Commonwealth, adding “following the conviction” indicates the intent that the five-year period must occur immediately following the conviction. However, Appellant posits that the “following the conviction” language is necessary to set the start date of the five-year period. Appellant suggests other reasonable starting points that the General Assembly could have selected instead, such as: 1) “following final release from confinement or supervision,” the starting point used in 18 Pa,C.S. § 9122(b)(1), governing expungement eligibility for individuals over 70 years of age; or 2) a certain time period since “the individual has satisfied all terms and conditions of the sentence imposed for the violation,” which is contained within 18 Pa.C.S. § 9123(a)(2.2), governing expungement eligibility for certain juvenile records. In light of these other reasonable possibilities, it appears correct that the language “following the conviction” is necessary to discern the earliest possible start date for the five-year waiting period, <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>and therefore, is not rendered meaningless by Appellant’s interpretation.</p>
    <p id="b277-4" data-blocks='[["BL_277.4",277,[195,460,1154,474]]]'>Finally, the Commonwealth’s interpretation is simply unreasonable, as aptly highlighted by Justice Wecht’s concurring opinion. <em>See </em>Concurring Op. at 227-28, 141 A.3d at 1274 (Wecht, J.). As my colleague observed, the Commonwealth’s interpretation would allow for an individual to reoffend every five years and one day and be eligible, subject to the trial court’s discretion, for expungement of every offense, yet preclude an individual like Appellant from receiving an expungement even if she had been arrest-free for fifty years.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[194,954,1156,633]]]'>For all of these reasons, I find Appellant’s interpretation much more persuasive than that of the Commonwealth. I point out that the sole issue before us is whether Appellant is eligible to seek expungement for her 1997 conviction. The only facts relevant to whether Appellant is statutorily eligible for expungement is whether she seeks to expunge a summary conviction and whether she has been arrest-free for a five-year period since her conviction for that offense. Any discussion of the general expungement scheme or the factors a trial court should consider when deciding whether to grant an expungement petition is irrelevant to the determination that she is eligible to seek expungement.</p>

These two rules of construction, in this case, seem to arrive at the same result: ambiguity in Subsection 9122(b)(3)(i) should be resolved in Appellant’s favor under both rules because Appellant was at one time the accused, and she is the intended beneficiary of the statute’s humanitarian objectives.</p>

I agree with the Majority’s assessment that the Commonwealth’s reading of the statute yields an unreasonable result, in that the 1997 offenses never may be expunged, while, oddly enough, expungement of the 1998 conviction is fully permissible. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 221-22, 141 A.3d at 1270-71.</p>
    <p id="b279-5" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[198,783,1156,1438]]]'>I note, as well, that the Commonwealth’s suggested interpretation would countenance an even more plainly unreasonable and absurd result, as follows. The Commonwealth maintains that “a defendant with a subsequent arrest or prosecution within the five years following the initial summary offense conviction may never have the initial summary offense expunged,” but that a summary offense conviction may be expunged if the defendant “can simply remain arrest-free for five years following that conviction.” Brief for the Commonwealth at 10, 14. The Majority correctly notes that this interpretation would preclude expungement of the 1997 offenses even if Giulian remains arrest-free for another fifty years. However, over a similar fifty-year period, the Commonwealth’s interpretation would allow for the expungement of up to ten offenses, provided merely that five years elapsed between each conviction and subsequent arrest. While an individual that was arrested within five years of a summary conviction would have a criminal record forever, another individual would be free to recidivate in perpetuity, reoffending every five years while never being precluded from expungement as a matter of law. Although occurring over a period of time, this is precisely and ironically the sort of “volume discounting” and “expungement windfall” that the Commonwealth argues should be forbidden under the statute. <em>See Id. </em>at 17. These volume discounts and expungement windfalls would accrue liberally for recidivist offenders under the Commonwealth’s own interpretation.</p>
