The amicus, however, does not accept the notion that this incongruity relieves sentencing courts from compliance with their express statutory responsibility to undertake judicial fact-finding. Because, under <em>Alleyne, </em>the IDSI crime and the Section 9718(a)(1) crime are now separate offenses, the Defender Association asserts that each requires independent fact-finding by separate fact-finders, per the express legislative command. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9718(c).

As a result, despite the existence of provisions in Section 9718 which are suspect under <em>Alleyne </em>and <em>Hopkins, </em>they do not manifest an <em>Alleyne </em>violation in this case. In other words, the structure of the criminal offense in this case ensures that <em>Alleyne’s </em>mandates will be satisfied. That the judge presumably also found the triggering fact by a preponderance of the evidence per Section 9718 — a <em>pro forma </em>act given the jury’s finding the same fact beyond a reasonable doubt — is immaterial under <em>Alleyne; </em>indeed, the majority cites nothing to suggest the <em>Alleyne </em>Court was concerned about a judge making factual findings redundant to those of the jury. While we concluded in <em>Hopkins </em>that this “proof at sentencing” provision was not subject to severance in the circumstances presented in <em>Hopkins, </em>here, the mere existence of such a provision in the sentencing statute does not make a <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>sentence that was imposed in accord with <em>Alleyne </em>unconstitutional. The focus for purposes of <em>Alleyne </em>is not on the sentencing statute, but, rather, on whether a defendant has been denied his or her right to a trial by jury on the facts triggering a sentence. Here, in these circumstances, Appellee has not. In short, Appellee’s mandatory minimum sentence was imposed by a trial court pursuant to the authority of Section 9718 in a manner that, in these circumstances, fully comports with Alleyne,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_8" id="ref_footnote_3_8">8</a>

Further, in determining that the sentencing statute at issue in <em>Hopkins </em>failed to provide the protections mandated by <em>Alleyne, </em>we neither announced a categorical holding of facial unconstitutionality of all mandatory minimum statutes nor suggested that all mandatory minimum statutes were unconstitutional under all circumstances. Rather, the predicate in <em>Hopkins </em>was a mandatory minimum statute triggered by a factual determination not an element of the underlying crime.</p>

As a result, there is no need to engage in any severability analysis regarding Section 9718. In essence, the approach taken by the majority “puts the cart before the horse” — finding Section 9718 to be non-severable and infirm without first identifying the constitutional violation to which Appellee was subjected.

Yet, the majority finds Appellee is entitled to relief because, although Appellee’s Sixth Amendment rights were preserved “in the abstract” given that a jury found beyond a reasonable doubt the charged element that the victim was less than 16 years old, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 53-54, 140 A.3d at 661, his Sixth Amendment jury trial rights were nonetheless impaired because a sentencing judge redundantly found this same fact by a lesser burden of proof.

To sharpen the point, our Court has pending before it an appeal in which a conviction for the rape of a child, less than 13 years of age, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3121(c), <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>serves as the factual trigger for a mandatory minimum sentence of not less than 10 years imprisonment under Section 9718. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9718(a)(3); <em>see supra </em>note 3. Thus, a conviction of the offense itself is trigger for the mandatory minimum sentence. Yet, even in this most straightforward of cases, where the underlying conviction itself is the trigger for a mandatory minimum sentence, under the majority’s approach, the defendant will argue entitlement to a new sentencing hearing. In my view, the majority’s rejection of a harmless error analysis herein is inconsistent with the teachings of <em>Alleyne, </em>subsequent state and federal caselaw, and common sense.</p>

While the triggering fact for the mandatory minimum sentence under Section 9718 is, in this case, the same fact that is an element of the underlying criminal offense at Section 3123(a)(7), the vast majority of other criminal offenses referred to in Section 9718 follow the factual situation which gave rise to <em>Alleyne, </em>in that the fact that triggers the mandatory minimum sentence is independent of the facts constituting the elements of the underlying criminal offense. Indeed, of the 21 criminal offenses referenced in Section 9718(a)(1) and (2), only three, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3123(a)(7), (b) and (c), subsume the same factual predicate as that required for imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence.
