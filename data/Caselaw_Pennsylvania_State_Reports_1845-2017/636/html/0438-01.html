The question in this case, raised under a derivative theory of ineffective assistance of counsel, is whether that provision proscribes only convictions for two or more distinct inchoate crimes, or whether it also prohibits convictions for two or more counts of the same inchoate crime. We hold that Section 906 bars convictions only for multiple distinct inchoate crimes. Because the Superior Court concluded otherwise in remanding for an ineffectiveness hearing, we reverse.</p>

Kingston drove his vehicle off the road and into a ditch. When police officers arrived, Mroz told them that Kingston, who was visibly intoxicated, had been driving the vehicle. The police arrested Kingston and charged him with driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance (“DUI”), 76 Pa.C.S. § 3802, and several other Motor Vehicle Code violations. A blood test revealed that Kingston’s blood alcohol concentration was 0.26% shortly after the accident. Kingston had three prior DUI convictions. If <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>convicted of a fourth, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of one-year incarceration. <em>See </em>75 Pa.C.S. § 3804(b)(4).</p>

A few weeks later, Kingston sent Mroz a second letter, asking her to tell “them” that she was driving on the night of the accident. Kingston assured Mroz that if she took the blame for the collision “they” could only “give [her] a fine.” Notes of Testimony (“N.t.”), 3/24/2010, exh. 2.

Contrary to Kingston’s wishes, Mroz testified that Kingston was driving at the time of the accident. The charges were held for court, and Kingston proceeded to trial. However, due to an administrative oversight, Mroz did not receive notice that the Commonwealth had subpoenaed her to testify at Kingston’s trial until after it had commenced. When she failed to appear on the morning of Kingston’s trial, the court issued a bench warrant for Mroz and proceeded without her.

Therein, Kingston alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the imposition of consecutive sentences for each of his solicitation convictions. Kingston argued that, pursuant to Section 906 of the Crimes Code, his six convictions should have merged into only two for sentencing purposes, one for soliciting perjury and one for soliciting to hinder apprehension or prosecution. The PCRA court dismissed Kingston’s petition without a hearing, concluding that Kingston’s ineffectiveness claim lacked arguable merit because Section 906 “does not prohibit multiple convictions for the same type of inchoate crime.” PCRA Court Order, 8/23/2012, at 2.

From my point of view, the statute is materially ambiguous in such regard, and accordingly, the rule of lenity should be applied to enforce horizontal <em>and </em>vertical preclusion.</p>

      <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>In its reasoning rejecting vertical preclusion, the majority first states that acceptance of such proscription “would require us to privilege the unspoken ‘counts’ over the express enumeration of distinct inchoate offenses.” Majority Opinion, at 449, 143 A.3d at 924. In point of fact, however, no such privileging is required, since extension of a rule of preclusion across the two categories which are facially encompassed within the statute simply is not an either-or proposition. Along these lines, I also do not see what is added through the observation that the Crimes Code may otherwise frequently speak in terms of “counts” or “violations.” <em>See id. </em>at 449-50, 143 A.3d at 924-25. Straightforwardly, a crime is simply a violation of the law, <em>see </em>Black’s Law Dictionary (17th ed.1999); <em>accord </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 106, so that the use of the terms “violation,” versus “count,” versus “crime” would seem to me to be immaterial. Accordingly, the answer to the majority’s defining question— “[m]ore than one what?” — seems apparent. Majority Opinion, at 450, 143 A.3d at 925. Section 906 bars convictions of more than one crime or crimes in the delineated circumstances.</p>
