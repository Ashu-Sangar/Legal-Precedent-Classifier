Judge Stabile observed that, in that case, the Superior Court merely considered the threshold question of whether a petitioning parent was permitted to. show cause to waive the Adoption Act’s relinquishment requirement where the grandfather sought to adopt his grandchild and co-parent with his daughter, but that it did not consider, let alone hold, that the mother had demonstrated cause to proceed with the adoption under the circumstances of that case.

Additionally, Father contends that the proposed adoption will create mixed family roles, such as the fact that Children’s legal father would also be their Mother’s father, and will create the appearance of an incestuous relationship between Mother and Grandfather, as the relationship between parents is typically intimate.

By contrast, in second-parent adoption cases in which the relinquishment of a parent’s rights is not required — i.e., stepparent adoptions and adoptions by same-sex couples — relinquishment of the parent’s rights is unnecessary, and indeed damaging. In such cases, the parent and the prospective adoptive parent are committed partners — that is, they are involved in a horizontal relationship, are equals as between each other, and are equals with respect to the child. Adoption in such circumstances allows the prospective adoptive parent to create a new parent-child relationship with the legal parent’s child and a family unit <em>together with </em>the co-parent to whom he or she is committed. Thus, because the legal parent and prospective parent in second-parent adoption cases are part of the same family unit, the relinquishment requirement undermines, rather than promotes, family stability.</p>

Thus, while Grandfather’s efforts in assisting Mother with Children are certainly laudable, and while Grandfather is in no way precluded from enjoying partial custody of Children, Grandfather’s pre-exist-ing and continuing close relationship with Children does not establish legal cause to excuse the requirement that Mother relinquish her parental rights under Section 2711 prior to the adoption.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> As such, the adoption proposed herein may not proceed.

Like my colleagues, I appreciate that families of all varieties can and do flourish. Nevertheless, it is beyond cavil that children are entitled to permanency, and the best model to ensure that permanency is to have children parented by two parents in a permanent relationship — a marriage.</p>

In light of the benefits that come with two parents, even when one is absent, I believe our legislature has adopted a child-focused statute which should not be changed.</p>

Terminating an uninvolved parent’s rights does not remedy any harm caused by that parent’s absence in the child’s life. The only benefit of terminating a non-involved parent’s rights without substituting a new parent is arguably to the involved parent: it removes the involved parent’s fear that the non-involved parent will have a change of heart and want a relationship with the child (which may, in the long term, benefit the child); it removes the risk to the involved parent of having to litigate child custody; it dispels the involved parent’s feeling that his or her efforts are underappreciated in the eyes of the law, etc.</p>

While I respect and appreciate the vitally important and often-times challenging role of single parents, our laws protecting children are properly focused on the bests interests of children, rather than unfairness to parents.</p>

It cannot be denied that emotions run high in family court, and parents often blame each other for not doing enough for their children. If we permit the termination of parental rights simply because one parent accuses the other parent of being a non-involved parent — be it non-payment of child support, failure to exercise custodial rights, or some other omission — then the courts will be inundated with requests to deprive children of one of their parents. Respectfully, I cannot agree that the legislature <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>should create a cause of action that will allow parents to seek vindication and retribution against each other, at the expense of their children.</p>

Our decision is dictated by the Pennsylvania Adoption Act and, in particular, by the statutory requirement that, in order to terminate the other parent’s parental rights, a petitioning parent must demonstrate that an adoption of his or her child is contemplated and relinquish his or her parental rights, unless the petitioning parent has a spouse or partner willing to adopt.

However, in the nearly 36 years since this requirement was enacted, the concept of family has evolved — and continues to evolve — in today’s society, and there are situations where, in my view, it is unfair to require a single parent to have a spouse or partner as a prerequisite to seeking the termination of the rights of the child’s other legal, but absent, parent. Indeed, there are many families comprised of only a parent and a child where the single parent is fully capable of raising and providing for his or her child, and where the absent parent provides no benefit to — or worse, is a dark cloud over — the child. While, of course, I am mindful of the legislature’s policymaking role in this area, given that today’s families are not necessarily the traditional nuclear families that were envisioned at the time our adoption laws were initially drafted, I urge the legislature, <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>with continued focus on the best interests of our Commonwealth’s children, to revisit the adoption and relinquishment requirements for termination of parental rights under the Act.</p>

The process undertaken by Mother in this case, employing her own father (“Grandfather”) as a putative adoptive parent for her children, notwithstanding the fact that he remains married to Grandmother (Mother’s mother), and notwithstanding the fact that Mother and Grandfather do not cohabit, strikes me as at best a clumsy and overweening attempt to gain advantage in custody.</p>

While it is unequivocally true “that today’s families are not necessarily the traditional nuclear families that were envisioned at the time our adoption laws were initially drafted”, <em>id., </em>and while I agree that our General Assembly should scrutinize the Domestic Relations Code for anachronistic or obsolete provisions, I have presided over far too many acrimonious custody trials to favor statutory revisions which would encourage or condone the use of TPR petitions to gain leverage in (or perhaps short-cut or foreclose) custody disputes.</p>

Indeed, it was not until Father showed signs of pursuing his custody claims that Mother decided, <em>L.J.B. </em>notwithstanding, to pull the TPR arrow out of the quiver and attempt to nock her bowstring with it. Hence, proclaims the Superior Court: “Only when Father filed his unforeseen petition for custody of Children, did Mother and Maternal Grandfather need court intervention to protect Children.” <em>In re Adoption of M.R.D., </em><a href="/a3d/128/1249-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="128 A.3d 1249" data-case-ids="6770700" data-case-paths="/a3d/128/1249-01">128 A.3d 1249</a>, 1264 (Pa.Super.2015) <em>(fin banc). </em>Whether “unforeseen” or not, one is left to wonder why Mother did not file a petition for confirmation of custody, or simply defend against Father’s complaint based upon his lack of involvement, or seek some other custody relief of the several types sought by litigants in this Commonwealth every day of the week. While Mother’s alternative response (filing a TPR petition and seeking to have Grandfather named as an adoptive “parent”) may have shown creativity and determination, it did not comport with Pennsylvania law. This is especially so given <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>the demonstrable fact that the trial court in this case, like trial courts all across this Commonwealth, has robust discretionary-authority to limit and even completely curtail Father’s custody rights under the custody statutes without resort to the draconian remedy of termination of parental rights under the adoption laws.</p>

Recall that Grandfather and Grandmother cohabit, that they are both grandparents to the children involved in this case, that they are both parents of the petitioner mother in this case, and that they both would be affected by the judicial relief afforded by the lower courts here. Nonetheless, to read the opinions of the trial court and the Superior Court in this case, one might be forgiven for concluding that Grandmother has faded away into the wallpaper. Since Grandfather would now become the “father” of the children as well as their grandfather, Grandmother presumably would now become not just their grandmother but also their step-mother. What is more, Grandmother would continue to cohabit with the children’s new “father,” even though the children live in a separate location with their mother, a person who also is Grandmother’s/stepmother’s natural daughter. While Grandfather would now become not only the grandfather but also the “father” of the children, and accordingly the co-parent of his own daughter, Grandmother would remain only a grandmother, without parental rights. Moreover, in the event that Mother would choose to marry, Grandmother would find herself married to a man who is the “father” of children who live with a stepparent who is not regarded as part of a new family unit.</p>

In any case, it is critically important that our <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>judges not make bad situations worse by allowing often-angry parents to turn custody disputes into orphan factories.</p>
