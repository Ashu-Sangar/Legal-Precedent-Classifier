Cox. <a href="/pa/556/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="556 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="607143" data-case-paths="/pa/556/0368-01">556 Pa. 368</a>, <a href="/a2d/728/0923-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="728 A.2d 923" data-case-ids="11626690,607143" data-case-paths="/a2d/728/0923-01,/pa/556/0368-01">728 A.2d 923</a>, 926-29 (1999). For the purposes of the present appeal, the pertinent facts may be summarized as follows. Cox was a low-level member of a Philadelphia drug operation run by Tim Walker (“Walker”). At some point in early 1992, two other members of the drug enterprise, Roosevelt Watson (“Watson”) and Terence Stewart (“Stewart”), had a falling out with Walker and left Walker’s organization. Watson subsequently robbed one of the houses out of which Walker sold drugs, and he and Stewart later stole Walker’s car. In retribution, Walker instructed Larry Lee (“Lee”), a higher-ranking member of the drug organization, to kill both Watson and Stewart. Lee enlisted Cox to assist in the murders. On August 18, 1992, Watson was shot and killed outside of a nightclub. On November 8,1992, Stewart was shot and killed while driving his vehicle with a woman named Tia Seidle (“Seidle”), who was not injured although she was sitting in the passenger seat of his car.</p>

In an attempt to secure favorable treatment from the prosecution, Cox indicated that he had information about Stewart’s murder. After being advised of his rights, Cox told the police that he was with Lee on the night of Stewart’s murder. Cox stated that Lee instructed Cox to drive to a particular location, where they found Stewart’s parked vehicle. Lee, who was carrying a semi-automatic weapon, told Cox that Stewart was one of the men who had stolen Walker’s car. Cox told the police that when Lee identified Stewart as one of the men who stole Walker’s car, he “knew what was happening.” N.T., 4/10/1995, at 14. Cox and Lee waited for approximately half an hour until Stewart and Seidle exited a residence, entered Stewart’s vehicle and drove away. Cox followed and pulled along the left side of Stewart’s vehicle, at which time Lee lowered his window and fired multiple shots at Stewart. Stewart lost control of his vehicle and crashed into another car, and Cox <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>and Lee immediately fled the scene. The following day, Lee paid Cox $500.</p>
    <p id="b660-4" data-blocks='[["BL_660.4",660,[267,466,1153,365]]]'>After Cox made this confession, the police arrested him for Stewart’s murder. The police then asked Cox if he had any information about Watson’s murder, which they believed was related to Stewart’s murder. Cox told the police that he and Lee spent at least a week searching for Watson in order to kill him, but that they were unsuccessful. Cox told the police that Lee subsequently found and killed Watson by himself.</p>
    <p id="b660-5" data-blocks='[["BL_660.5",660,[266,859,1152,689]]]'>As Cox awaited trial on the Davis murder, he contacted the police to offer additional information about the Watson murder. Again, Cox wanted to share this information because he hoped to garner favorable treatment by cooperating with the police. Cox then confessed that he was with Lee when Lee received a telephonic page from Walker, informing them that Watson would be at a particular telephone booth outside of a nightclub. Cox drove them to the location described by Walker, where they waited for Watson. When Watson appeared, Lee exited the vehicle and shot Watson six times with a silver revolver. Cox then drove them from the scene of the shooting. Three days later, Lee paid Cox $500. Following this confession, the police charged Cox with Watson’s murder.</p>

In addition to Cox’s confessions to these murders and of relevance to this appeal, the Commonwealth introduced the testimony of Philadelphia Police Officer James O’Hara, who performed ballistics testing on a bullet recovered from Watson’s body and two bullets recovered from Davis’ body.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Officer O’Hara testified that markings on one of the Davis bullets matched the markings on the Watson bullet, which proved that they were fired from the same gun. Officer O’Hara could not formulate a conclusion concerning the second Davis bullet because, in his opinion, the second bullet was too damaged to allow a comparison. The Commonwealth sought to couple this ballistics evidence with the testimony of <a id="p609" href="#p609" data-label="609" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*609</a>Kimberly Little (“Little”). Little previously testified in the Davis trial that she observed Cox shoot and kill Davis.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Through Little’s testimony and the ballistics evidence establishing that the same gun was used in the Watson and Davis murders, the Commonwealth sought to establish Cox’s participation in the Watson murder. Over Cox’s objections, the trial court permitted the Commonwealth to introduce this evidence for the limited purpose of establishing Cox’s identity and access to the weapon used to murder Watson.</p>

Counsel filed an amended petition raising numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel with regard to both the guilt and penalty phases of his trial. Of relevance, for the first time, Cox challenged the failure of trial counsel to conduct an independent investigation of the ballistics evidence and sought discovery of the ballistics evidence. Commonwealth v.

The PCRA court denied Cox’s guilt phase claims as a matter of law, but conducted an evidentiary hearing to address Cox’s claims related to the penalty phase. Following the hearing, the PCRA court denied all of the penalty phase claims. Cox appealed the PCRA court’s ruling, raising fourteen issues for consideration. This Court affirmed the PCRA court’s denial of all fourteen claims. <a href="/pa/603/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="983 A.2d 666" data-case-ids="4196831,7292900" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0223-01,/a2d/983/0666-01">Id.</a></p>

In 2012, the district court granted Cox’s petition. Before turning the ballistics evidence over to Cox’s expert for an evaluation, the Philadelphia Police Department reexamined the ballistics evidence and issued a new report. By the time of the district court’s order, Officer O’Hara had retired, and the second examination was performed by Officers Kelly Walker and Jesus Cruz. The new report, issued on April 30, 2013, agreed with Officer O’Hara’s conclusion that one Davis bullet and the Watson bullet were fired from the same gun. Contrary to Officer O’Hara’s conclusion, however, the new report did not find the second Davis bullet to be too damaged to allow a comparison. Instead, based upon the evaluation by Officers Walker and Cruz, the new report concluded that the second Davis bullet was not fired from the same gun that fired the Watson bullet.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

He alleged due process violations based upon the admission of the ballistics evidence in the Watson murder; ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to seek independent ballistics testing; and ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failing to raise this particular claim on direct appeal. PCRA Petition, 6/28/2013, at 8-16.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> With respect to his due process claim, Cox contended that the new ballistics report undermined the link between the Davis and Watson shootings, and if this new evidence had been available at the time of the Watson/Stewart trial, “it is likely that the Davis evidence would have been excluded from the Watson/Stewart trial entirely.” PCRA Petition, 6/28/2013, at 10. Without the Davis evidence, Cox argued, there would have been no evidence that he had a propensity for violence, and so there is a reasonable likelihood that he would not have been found guilty of the Stewart murder and sentenced to death. <a href="/pa/603/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="983 A.2d 666" data-case-ids="4196831,7292900" data-case-paths="/pa/603/0223-01,/a2d/983/0666-01">Id.</a></p>

Id. at 6. The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss, to which Cox filed a response. In evaluating the timeliness of Cox’s claim, the PCRA court applied a four-part test that considered whether Cox established that the evidence (1) could not have been discovered prior to the conclusion of the trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence; (2) is not merely cumulative; (3) would not be used solely to impeach the credibility of a witness; and (4) would likely result in a different verdict if a new trial were granted.

Section 9543, titled “Eligibility for relief,” governs this inquiry. Among other requirements not pertinent to this appeal, section 9543 delineates seven classes of allegations that are eligible for relief under the PCRA. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(2). Of relevance here is the “after-discovered evidence” provision, which states that a claim alleging “the unavailability at the time of trial of exculpatory evidence that has subsequently become available and would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced” is cognizable under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9543(a)(2)(vi).

It was not until six years later, in 2001, that Cox first attempted to obtain the ballistics evidence through his first PCRA petition, in connection with his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek independent testing thereof. By raising this claim in his first PCRA petition, Cox has effectively conceded that the testing could have been done at the time of trial. Moreover, Cox <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>admitted to committing the Davis murder, and so Cox always knew that more than one firearm was used in the perpetration of that crime. See N.T., 4/4/1995, at 157-58. Nevertheless, Cox has never explained why he did not seek independent ballistics testing at the time of trial or on direct appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_15" id="ref_footnote_1_15">14</a> Importantly, our review of the record reveals that Cox has never alleged that he asked trial counsel to seek independent ballistics testing or that his counsel refused such a request. Were that the situation, there could be a basis upon which to conclude that he attempted to act diligently, but that his efforts were thwarted by trial counsel. However, this is simply not the case here. Cox acknowledges that the testing could have been done at the time of trial, but offers no explanation as to why he did not seek such testing at that time. Instead, he took no action to obtain the additional testing for six years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_16" id="ref_footnote_1_16">15</a> It is this lengthy, unexplained delay that defeats the possibility of a conclusion that Cox acted with reasonable effort to obtain ballistics testing. As in Stokes, Cox’s failure to act, and failure to explain his lack of action, precludes a finding of due diligence.</p>

The distinction between the use of the terms "facts” in section 9545(b)(l)(ii) and "evidence” in section 9543(a)(2)(vi) underscores their separate functions. The PCRA "provides for an action by which persons convicted of crimes they did not commit and persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief,” 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 9542. Section 9545(b)(l)(ii) does not explicitly assist in providing such relief. The function of a section 9545(b)(l)(ii) analysis is that of a gatekeeper. Its inquiry, therefore, is limited to considering only the existence of a previously unknown fact that would allow a petitioner to avoid the strict one year time-bar. In contrast, the purpose of an inquiry under section 9543(a)(2)(vi) is to ensure that the claim presented is cognizable under the PCRA, and so it requires a more thorough analysis. As such, the matter upon which the claim is based is assessed in terms of its evidentiary merit, by considering the purpose for which it would be used and its potential impact on the outcome of trial. Through consider<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>ation of these factors, section 9543 assists the goal of the PCRA to provide relief to the wrongfully convicted by ferreting out colorable claims of wrongful convictions.</p>
