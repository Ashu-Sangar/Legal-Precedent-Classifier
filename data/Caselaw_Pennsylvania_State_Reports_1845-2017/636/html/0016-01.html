On February 16, 2016, Candidate filed a nominating petition, containing 2744 signatures, to be a candidate for the nomination of the Democratic Party for the office of United States Senator. On February 23, 2016, Joseph A. Sestak (“Objector”) filed a timely petition to set aside the nominating petition, alleging that the nominating petition did not contain at least 2000 valid signatures of registered Pennsylvania Democrats as required by 25 P.S. § 2872.1(2). The Commonwealth Court ordered representatives of the parties to meet at the Lancaster County Board of Elections to review the signatures on the nominating petition. On March 11, 2016, the parties struck certain signatures by agreement, leaving 2186 signatures remaining. The parties then entered into a stipulation, agreeing that 461 signatures contained a name and signature matching that of a person registered to vote in the county, but the address on the nominating petition did not match the address of record in the Commonwealth’s SURE registry for the individual of that name.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The parties further stipulated that whether these 461 signatures should be struck presents a “common and singular question of law” determinative of Objector’s challenge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

This provision was identical to section 961.907, which (as noted hereinabove) was suspended by the Secretary of the Commonwealth in July 1995. 25 <em>Pennsylvania Bulletin </em>2844 (July 15, 1995); 25 P.S. § 961.5103(a).

In any event, the effect, if any, of section 961.1901(b)(2)(iii) was blunted entirely, since, as discussed supra, under both section 8 of the NVRA and section 961.1901(d)(1) of the 1995 PVRA, the cancellation of a voter’s registration based upon a change of address was severely circumscribed. <em>See </em><a href="/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="52 U.S.C. § 20507">52 U.S.C.A. § 20507</a>(b)(2), (d), (f); 25 P.S. § 961.1901(d)(1), 1902.</p>
