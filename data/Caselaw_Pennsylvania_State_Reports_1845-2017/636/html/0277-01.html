According to the credited testimony and other evidence presented in the orphans’ court, Isabel Wilner (“Decedent”), born in 1920, died at age 91 in March 2011. She was a lifelong Episcopalian and, during her career as a librarian and author of children’s books, she lived in or near Baltimore, Maryland, where she attended the Church of the <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Nativity (the “Maryland church”). She also spent time in Tunkhannock, Pennsylvania, where she ultimately decided to live during her retirement. While residing in Tunkhannock, Decedent attended Saint Peter’s Episcopal Church (the “Pennsylvania church”). She remained on good terms with both churches throughout her life.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[269,669,1151,148]]]'>Decedent never married. Her intestate heirs were her niece Dana Wilner (“Appellee”) and her nephew David Wilner, who is not involved in this litigation.</p>
    <p id="b332-5" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[269,839,1154,574]]]'>Charles Welles, Esq., a lawyer in Tunkhannock, drafted a will for Decedent, nominating Decedent’s friend Margaret Young as executrix and naming the Maryland church as the primary beneficiary. Decedent executed the will in June 2007. Testamentary formalities took place at the office of another Tunkhannock attorney, Judd Fitze, Esq. The subscribing witnesses were Attorney Welles and Attorney Fitze’s secretary. Attorney Fitze was present for the execution and notarized the signatures. Attorney Welles made two conformed copies of the will.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> He kept one such copy for his files and gave the other copy and the original will to Decedent.</p>

Additionally, her eyesight was failing. She therefore lived in a first-floor bedroom. Decedent’s live-in caregiver was Linda Baker (appellant herein), a close friend and a cousin by marriage. At Decedent’s request, Baker put the original will in an unlocked metal box near Decedent’s first-floor bedroom. Baker placed the conformed copy in a locked safe in an upstairs bedroom. The key to the safe was kept in the drawer of a nearby night table.</p>

The executed deed was recorded with the county recorder of deeds. As for the codicil, Attorney Welles followed the same procedure as with the will: he made conformed copies, kept one copy for his files, and gave the original and a conformed copy to Decedent. Again, Baker put the executed codicil in the downstairs metal box and placed Decedent’s conformed copy in the upstairs safe.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Appellee also advised Decedent that she should move out of her house and live in a nursing home. Appellee’s presence and remarks caused Decedent to become visibly distressed to the point where Decedent asked not to be left alone with Appellee.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Subsequent phone calls from Appellee were also upsetting to Decedent and made it difficult for Baker calm her down or keep her calm.

When Baker checked the upstairs safe, she found that all papers had been removed, including the conformed copy of the will.

In its opinion, the court initially acknowledged that, when an original will in the testator’s possession cannot be located, a rebuttable presumption arises that the testator destroyed it with the intent to revoke it. <em>See Estate of Wilner, </em>No. 2011-13, <em>slip op. </em>at 8-9 (C.P.

She contends, moreover, that the two-witness rule as applied to a will’s contents is best able to serve its underlying purposes when there is another, earlier will, and the law seeks to prevent individuals from falsely claiming that a later will, benefiting them and now conveniently missing (in its original form, at least), supersedes the existing will. As that situation did not arise here, Baker proffers that application of the two-witness rule in the present circumstances would not promote its objectives.</p>
    <p id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.6",336,[265,1741,1155,519]],["BL_337.1",337,[192,341,1154,411]]]'>More particularly, Baker argues that woodenly applying the rule to benefit Appellee would be especially inequitable because, in Baker’s view, Appellee may have caused the will to become missing. Thus, according to Baker, even if the two-witness rule is ultimately retained as a general precept, this Court should recognize an exception applicable where (as here) various factors are present such as: the attorney who drafted the will — and who has no financial stake under the will — is able to produce a conformed copy from his files; he is available to testify regarding the authenticity of the copy and <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>the will’s execution; there is no suggestion that the testator may have altered the will; codicils are available which reaffirm the will; and there is evidence of estrangement between the testator and the intestate beneficiary. Overall, Baker argues that she presented compelling evidence of the will’s contents to the orphans’ court. As such, she maintains that the decision of that tribunal, which observed the evidence first-hand, should be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b337-4" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[191,778,1156,946]]]'>Appellee responds by noting that the Code specifies that “[a]ll wills” must be “proved by the oaths or affirmations of two competent witnesses,” 20 Pa.C.S. § 3132, thus refuting Baker’s suggestion that it is silent with respect to lost wills. Appellee observes, more generally, that this legislative directive is substantially similar to Section 2 of the Wills Act of 1917, which this Court construed to require proof by two witnesses as to both the execution and the contents of a lost will. <em>See Hodgson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/270/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="270 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1066005" data-case-paths="/pa/270/0210-01">270 Pa. at 213</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=112%20A.%20778" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="112 A. 778">112 A. at 778</a> (“Under the [1917] act, to establish a lost will, there must be proof by two witnesses, not only of due execution, but of the contents, substantially as set forth in the copy offered for probate.”); <em>Harrison’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/316/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="316 Pa. 15" data-case-ids="1158982" data-case-paths="/pa/316/0015-01">316 Pa. at 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=173%20A.%20407" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="173 A. 407">173 A. at 408</a> (same).

Such provisions cover matters pertaining to, <em>inter alia, </em>revocation, modification, rules of interpretation, bequests to trusts, the abolition of devices of estates in fee tail, the alienage of the testator, testamentary guardians, and clauses imposing a penalty for contesting a will. We find it unlikely that the General Assembly intended for all of these measures to have no governance over duly established lost wills. Finally, and as set forth above, the Code also includes the two-witness proof mandate, and it would seem especially incongruous to read the statute as subjecting available wills to this rule while imposing no requirement at all in relation to the proof of lost wills.</p>

They do not appear to contemplate the contents of a will, lost or otherwise. As well, such focus upon the validity of the signatures is consistent with the specialized term, to “prove” a will, as applied in the probate context.</p>

By contrast, and for several reasons, formal testamentary procedures must be followed in the execution of a will. As one commentator has observed, for example, individuals are often careless in conversation and informal writings about the disposition of their property, and, as such, testamentary formalities serve a “ritual function” which “precludes the possibility that the testator was acting in a casual or haphazard fashion.” Ashbel G.

Another adds that conformance with such formalities also serves a “channeling function” because courts are “seldom left to puzzle whether the document was meant to be a will,” and hence, they can more efficiently handle a large number of estates.

Additionally, in many cases it will be unlikely that anyone besides the testator and the drafting attorney is aware of the contents of the will.

This is true for multiple reasons, including that: there is no need for such knowledge by the witnesses for them to fulfill their role in confirming the validity of the testator’s signature; and prior to death, the testator may not wish to divulge the terms of the will to anyone other than his or her attorney. Finally, it is unlikely that a disinterested witness — such as an attorney’s secretary or paralegal — would be able to recall the document’s contents in any event given the amount of time which may pass between execution and death and the large number of wills such persons may witness over time.</p>

For example, we assume that the Legislature does not intend an unreasonable result. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1); <em>Vitac Corp. v. WCAB (Rozanc), </em><a href="/pa/578/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="578 Pa. 574" data-case-ids="1329425" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0574-01">578 Pa. 574</a>, 581, <a href="/pa/578/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="854 A.2d 481" data-case-ids="1329425,9215296" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0574-01,/a2d/854/0481-01">854 A.2d 481</a>, 485 (2004). Because the statutory text does not distinguish between lost wills and original wills which are available for probate, our interpretation of the scope of the two-witness rule will apply equally to lost wills and original, executed wills. Therefore, if we were to conclude that the statute requires proof by two witnesses of the contents of lost wills, the statute would necessarily also require proof by two witnesses of the contents of available wills. This, in turn, would mean that, whenever two witnesses familiar with a will’s contents cannot be found, the testator’s wishes would be defeated notwithstanding that the original, executed will is available for probate and two witnesses are present who can testify to its validity. This would constitute an unreasonable result. Notably, as well, there was nothing in the 1917 act which suggested that the two-witness rule applied to a will’s contents <em>only </em>when it was lost. Thus, the same concern with regard to unreasonable results would have pertained in that context, albeit the Court in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>— a decision by which the <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>Superior Court considered itself bound and on which Appellee heavily relies — did not appear to recognize the difficulty.

In this respect, it is notable that the Code’s provision governing proof of a will is immediately followed by a section relating to “self-proved” wills. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 3132.1. Under that provision, an attested will is made self-proved through the attachment of a testator’s acknowledgement and witness affidavits confirming that each witness signed the will freely and voluntarily. <em>See </em>20 Pa.C.S. § 3132.1(b). As explained, these witnesses are not assumed to know anything about the will’s terms.

After the orphans’ court admitted the copy of the lost will for probate, Appellee appealed to the Superior Court, which, citing the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate, </em>reversed, but indicated its view that “under the narrow circumstances of this case, an appropriate exception could be carved out.” <em>In re Estate of Wilner, </em><a href="/a3d/92/1201-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="92 A.3d 1201" data-case-ids="6963631" data-case-paths="/a3d/92/1201-01">92 A.3d at 1210</a>.

Accordingly, Appellant argues in her brief that her case presents “narrowing circumstances” that “cry out for a narrow exception to” the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate, </em>Brief of Appellant at 17-18, and, notably, never requests that we overrule that decision in its entirety. Likewise, Appellee merely argues that the rule is a creature of statute and is mandatory, and does not address whether it is wise to abandon it, even in part. Finally, and perhaps most disquieting, the Commonwealth as <em>parens patriae </em>takes no official position on whether an exception to the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>should be adopted, but urges this Court to proceed with the utmost caution if it chooses to adopt one, as the rule is longstanding and any exception thereto might easily engulf the rule in time. Given its longstanding character, the Commonwealth’s concerns, and, particularly in the absence of arguments vis-a-vis the continued vitality of the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>as a general matter, I would take the course charted for us by the parties and the courts below: determining whether an exception to <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>should be crafted for cases such as the one herein.</p>
    <p id="b350-4" data-blocks='[["BL_350.4",350,[269,446,1154,1595]]]'>Turning to that task, I would simply hold that the rationale in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>is inapplicable where, as here, the will’s execution is proved by two witnesses and an alleged conformed copy of the will is authenticated by a disinterested attorney who drafted the will. Indeed, the role of a disinterested attorney who himself drafted the will is a critical element not contemplated in our prior opinions addressing lost wills. Keeping in mind an attorney’s duty of loyalty to his client, his duty as an officer of the court to be candid in its proceedings, as well as the ethical rules governing attorneys drafting wills benefiting themselves or their family members, <em>see </em>Pa. R. Profl Conduct 1.7 (prohibiting conflicts of interest); Pa. R. Profl Conduct 3.3 (requiring candor to the courts); Pa. R. Profl Conduct 1.8 (prohibiting an attorney from “pre-par[ing] on behalf of a client an instrument giving the lawyer or a person related to the lawyer any substantial gift unless the lawyer or other recipient of the gift is related to the client”), I believe the special circumstances attendant in this ease — the existence of a contemporaneously-made conformed copy, as well as the special reliability of such a witness— together with the traditional credibility-determining function of the orphans’ court, to be sufficient to reasonably dispel concerns of fraud. As such, I would simply adopt an exception to the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>under these limited circumstances, and, on that basis, reverse and remand to the Superior Court for reinstatement of the orphans’ court’s order admitting Decedent’s will to probate. I would thus leave the question of <em>Hodgson’s Estate’s </em>continued vitality for another day, when it has been fairly raised by the parties, passed upon by the courts below, and adequately briefed before this Court.</p>

Although the majority correctly points out that the decision in <em>Hodgson’s Estate, </em>in an effort to avoid fraud, gave insufficient weight to the risk that the testator’s wishes will not be fulfilled, it does not follow that the mere credibility function of an orphans’ court is sufficient to avoid such fraud. Moreover, although the majority notes that other jurisdictions have legislatively abandoned the two-witness rule in favor of a clear and convincing evidence standard, it nonetheless cites to jurisdictions which have adopted other, more solicitous rules, <em>see </em>Majority Opinion at 293, n. 11, 142 A.3d at 806, n. 11 (noting that other jurisdictions have required “either two witnesses or one witness plus a copy of the will” and that yet others “allow a copy of the will to be introduced and either provide that the copy suffices so long as it is proved to be complete”), and does not explain why its clear and convincing evidence standard is chief among these listed rivals.</p>

Since long before the American Revolution, this Commonwealth has required that a will be written, providing proof-positive evidence of its terms. <em>See </em>Wills Act of 1706, 1 Sm.L. 33 § 1 (providing that all wills that are “in writing” and otherwise formally sufficient “shall be good and available in law”); Wills Act of 1833, P.L. 249, § 6 (providing that “every will shall be in writing ... otherwise such will shall be of no effect”); Wills Act of 1917, P.L. 405, § 2; Wills Act of 1947, P.L. § 2; 20 Pa.C.S. § 2502 (“Every will shall be in writing <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>... subject to ... rules and exceptions [not implicated herein].”). Although we obviously cannot require a party offering a lost will for probate to demonstrate its contents by providing the will itself, we can respect the foregoing legislative judgments in large measure by requiring a copy of the substance of the will authenticated by a disinterested attorney who drafted its terms, or under similarly especially reliable circumstances. Doing so would be as consistent as possible, in the context of lost wills, with the longstanding writing requirement for wills, as it would rely in part on the existence of a writing representing the best evidence available as to the will’s terms, authenticated by a person with a professional duty to be truthful on the matter. Indeed, given the aforementioned duties of an attorney, his testimony would appear sufficient to ameliorate the risk of fraud caused by the loss of an original will.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>

    <p id="b352-4" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[267,1209,1154,1011]]]'>In addition, I fear the majority’s decision today runs the risk of overcorrecting the possible errors of <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>by opening the door too wide to potential fraud by would-be testamentary beneficiaries. Although the majority rightly explains that the clear and convincing evidence standard “requires evidence that is so clear, direct, weighty, and convincing as to enable the trier of fact to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue,” Majority Opinion at 805 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Maldonado, </em><a href="/pa/576/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="576 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="16703" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0101-01">576 Pa. 101</a>, <a href="/pa/576/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="838 A.2d 710" data-case-ids="16703,9299392" data-case-paths="/pa/576/0101-01,/a2d/838/0710-01">838 A.2d 710</a>, 715 (2003)), it may quizzically permit probate on the basis of significantly weaker evidence than the legislature has cognized for more reliable, available wills. Put simply, a single -witness (or even a single hearsay statement), persuasive to a finder of fact, might well be sufficient to dispose of a decedent’s property, and be shielded by our deferential standard of review. In light of the foregoing, I believe the majority’s efforts to ameliorate the ills caused by the rule in <em>Hodgson’s Estate </em>give rise to their own significant policy concerns.</p>

It reasons that the General Assembly intended Section 3132 to apply to lost wills because the phrase "all wills,” as used therein, "logically subsumes lost wills.” Majority Opinion at 286-87, 142 A.3d at 802. In my view, the majority’s view that "all wills” must necessarily include lost wills does not acknowledge that the phrase must be viewed in context with the remaining provisions of the Code, which do not address lost wills, and, thus, may denote a narrower meaning excluding them from its reach. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Meyer v.
