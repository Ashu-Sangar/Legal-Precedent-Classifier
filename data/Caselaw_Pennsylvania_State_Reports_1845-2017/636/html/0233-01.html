Mitchell and Little began dating in high school and had a turbulent relationship marked by frequent arguments. In September of 1996, Mitchell threatened to kill Little if she ever left him. A son, Malik, was born to the couple in January of 1997. Mitchell and Little married in April of 1997, when Little was eighteen and Mitchell was nineteen. Mitchell lived with Little and her mother for several months in the spring of 1997. Little ended the relationship as arguments continued, and she asked Mitchell to move out in July of 1997.

After several calls, Mitchell convinced Little to allow him to come to her home. Mitchell arrived at Little’s residence at approximately 4:15 p.m., and the two argued about Brian, the man whom Little was seeing. Mitchell left shortly after 6:00 p.m., and spent a portion of the evening drinking alcohol with friends.

Ms. Britton reported that Mitchell called her at approximately 1:00 a.m. on September 10, 1997, and stated that he was going to Little’s house to kill her.

Mitchell attended the PFA hearing, and, when Little did not appear, the court dismissed Little’s petition and vacated the temporary PFA order. When Mitchell returned home, his mother informed him of Little’s death. Mitchell denied any involvement, but his mother was concerned and insisted that he be evaluated at a hospital. Mitchell agreed, and went to St. Francis Hospital at approximately noon on September 10, 1997. Homicide detectives quickly identified Mitchell as a suspect and approached him in the hospital’s waiting area when he was released. Mitchell agreed to accompany the detectives to their office, where he provided a statement in which he confessed to raping Little on September 1,1997, and to raping and murdering her on September 10, 1997. In addition to the charges relating to the September 1,1997 rape, Mitchell then was charged with criminal homicide, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (“IDSI”), and unlawful restraint.

The trial court deferred sentencing upon those convictions until after the trial on the remaining charges, which commenced before a jury on October 4, 1999. During the guilt phase of the trial, the Commonwealth introduced Ms. Britton’s testimony about the two telephone calls from Mitchell, which occurred shortly before and shortly after the murder. Mitchell pursued a diminished capacity defense based upon a psychological condition and long-term alcohol abuse. The jury rejected Mitchell’s defense and found him guilty of first-degree murder for the September 10, 1997 killing of Little, as well as the remaining <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>charges arising from the September 1, 1997 sexual assault.

Thus, Mitchell’s judgment of sentence became final on that date. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(3). On February 21, 2007, Mitchell timely filed a <em>pro se </em>PCRA petition. Lawyers with the Federal Community Defender Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania subsequently entered an appearance on Mitchell’s behalf. Following several extensions of time, Mitchell filed an amended PCRA petition on April 28, 2009. Among the thirteen claims that Mitchell raised in his amended petition was an allegation of trial counsel ineffectiveness for failure to investigate and develop evidence that would have undermined Ms. Britton’s credibility as a witness. As noted, <em>supra, </em>at Mitchell’s trial in 1999, Ms. Britton testified regarding two telephone calls that she received from Mitchell on the night of the murder. The first occurred at 1:00 a.m., when Mitchell told her that he planned to kill Little because she had “disrespected” him. N.T. Trial at 326.

Although Ms. Britton did not disclose in either her July 23,1998 statement or during Mitchell’s trial that she had spoken to police officers on the morning after the murder or that she only remembered the telephone calls after going to bed on the following day, she testified at the PCRA hearing that she informed the trial prosecutor of these facts before Mitchell’s trial when she met with the prosecutor to review her statement. Ms. Britton also testified that, had Mitchell’s trial counsel interviewed her prior to trial, she would have disclosed the manner in which she remembered the telephone conversations.

To the extent that Ms. Britton’s testimony at the PCRA hearing conflicted with the trial prosecutor’s testimony, the court credited the prosecutor over Ms. Britton. The PCRA court specifically declined to credit Ms. Britton’s testimony that she would have disclosed the manner of her recollection if trial counsel had interviewed her, noting that Ms. Britton did not reveal the relevant information for more than eight years after Mitchell’s trial, despite having numerous prior opportunities to do so in statements to the police, in meetings with the prosecutor, at Mitchell’s trial, or in her first interview with Attorney Wright on August 1, 2007. Because Mitchell failed to establish that an interview with Ms, Britton prior to trial would have yielded the information that Attorney Wright discovered in 2008, the PCRA court concluded that Mitchell failed to prove that he <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>was prejudiced by trial counsel’s failure to conduct such an interview. Thus, trial counsel was not ineffective.

Op., 12/10/2015, at 6. Mitchell learned these facts in 2008, as evidenced by Attorney Wright’s affidavit. The PCRA court noted that Mitchell chose to rely upon the relevant facts as the basis for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his first PCRA petition, but then sought to recast the facts in his second petition as establishing a claim premised upon the existence of after-discovered evidence. However, because the claim was not predicated upon previously-unknown facts that could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence, the PCRA court concluded that Mitchell’s petition failed to establish an exception to the time bar, leaving the court without jurisdiction to entertain the petition.

My reasoning, however, does not wholly align with the majority’s rationale insofar as the disposition rests on the proposition that the relevant post-conviction finding — namely, that prosecution witness Sheila Britton would not have apprised trial counsel of circumstances per which she recalled her telephone conversation with Appellant — entails a “legal conclusion.” Majority Opinion at 245-46, 141 A.3d at 1285.

He also admitted to threatening her if she reported the rape. Knowing that he was supposed to report to St. Francis, which was the agreement arranged at the preliminary hearing on the rape charges, he instead went to the victim’s home and continued the argument about the other man.
