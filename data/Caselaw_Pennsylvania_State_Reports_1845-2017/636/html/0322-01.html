We conclude that section 505(b)(2.1) does not affect a person’s right to use deadly force within his or her home, but rather creates an evidentiary presumption relevant to the evaluation of such a claim of self-defense, and is therefore a procedural statute. Because section 505(b)(2.1) became effective prior to Childs’ trials, he was entitled to jury instructions in conformance therewith. We therefore affirm the Superior Court’s decision vacating Childs’ judgment of sentence and remanding for a new trial.</p>

Although the legislature did not explicitly provide that section 505(b)(2.1) applies retroactively, there is a necessary implication that it intended retroactive application. This implication, Childs argues, arises because the legislature drafted section 505(b)(2.1) to have no effect outside of trial, and from language contained in the preamble to Act 10, which states that the purpose of Act 10 was to codify the common law and constitutional rights of citizens to protect themselves in their homes. Lastly, Childs contends that even if we were to determine that section 505(b)(2.1) is substantive, it would still be applicable to him (as well as to other cases pending at the time of its enactment) pursuant to the doctrine of abatement. <em>Id. </em>at 27-29.</p>

While both parties construct their arguments in terms of the retroactive application of section 505(b)(2.1) and the Superior Court addresses retroactivity in its decision, once the conclusion is made that the statute is procedural, the question of retroactive application is not truly at issue in this ease. A fundamental principle of statutory construction is that all statutes are to be applied prospectively unless the legislature expressly provides for retroactive application. 1 Pa.C.S.A. § 1926.

This provision of the Vehicle Code required DOT to stamp a document received <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>from a dealer with a work identification number within one business day of receiving the document, and further provided that “if the displayed stamp is not legible, a certification by the department of the date that the application was received shall be accepted by ... [a] court as prima facie evidence of that date.” 75 Pa.C.S.A. § 1103.1(d.1). Section 1103.1(d.1) was enacted in December 1994 and became effective in February 1995, but all of the dealership’s violations were alleged to have occurred in 1993. Furthermore, DOT provided the certifications as to the dates in September 1994, also prior to the enactment of section 1103.1(d.1). The dealership challenged the trial court’s reliance on section 1103.1(d.1) as an improper retroactive application of a statute.</p>

Rather, we concluded that the “[t]he courts below have taken out of context the excerpt from subsection (d.l) on which they relied [ (the final sentence regarding illegibility and a certification by the DOT as prima facie evidence) ] to allow admission of the documents.” <em>Morabito’s Auto Sales, </em><a href="/a2d/715/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="715 A.2d 384" data-case-ids="11705171,559462" data-case-paths="/a2d/715/0384-01,/pa/552/0291-01">715 A.2d at 386</a>.
