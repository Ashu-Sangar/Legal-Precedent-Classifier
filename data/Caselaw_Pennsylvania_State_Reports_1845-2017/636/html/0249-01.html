The City then disputed ASE’s view of the statute, stressing the discretionary nature of the statutory language. The City asserted ASE’s issue, properly framed, was whether the trial court abused its discretion in failing to award a penalty and fees. In the City’s view, ASE’s contrary reading ignored the right to a Section 3935 award is created and controlled by the statute, and the statute does not vest a jury with the ultimate power to issue an award. The City also argued the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying an award because the amount sought by ASE was, by ASE’s own admission, incorrect; the City claimed it was within the court’s discretion to conclude the non-payment of those amounts was neither arbitrary nor vexatious.</p>

The City also notes the text of the Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act (CASPA), 73 P.S. §§ 501— 516, a prompt payment statute applicable to non-governmental parties, provides for a penalty and attorney fees similar to the Procurement Code, but explicitly states penalties and attorney fees “shall” be awarded where payment is “wrongfully withheld,” the amount of which is then determined by the court or arbitrator. 73 P.S. § 512(a)-(b).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> The City contends CAS-<a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>PA’s use of “shall,” as opposed to “may,” is significant as it demonstrates the General Assembly was cognizant of the distinction between mandatory and discretionary bad faith penalty awards; had the Legislature intended to make the Procurement Code awards mandatory as well, it would not have used permissive language. Moreover, the City argues the Commonwealth Court improperly rested its decision on a Missouri case involving a distinguishable statute, and the perceived broad legislative intent underlying the Procurement Code as a whole, rather than applying the rules of statutory construction and acknowledging the narrow circumstances in which Pennsylvania courts have interpreted “may” to mean “shall.”</p>

Finally, the City claims, if the Commonwealth Court’s decision is not reversed, the result is an award essentially directed by jurors who were not comprehensively instructed on the meaning of “arbitrary or vexatious,” or told their finding of bad faith would result in a 1% penalty and counsel fees paid from public funds. The jury was not instructed in this regard, argues the City, because the trial court believed, properly so, it had discretion to decide the ultimate question of whether a statutory award was warranted.</p>

Thus, ASE contends it is unclear what burden a contractor would bear, if “may” is read as permissive.

Accordingly, there is an additional burden of proof under the Procurement Code, requiring a heightened showing of wrongful conduct before an award can be made where public funds are at issue.

ASE argues that, at a minimum, a jury finding of bad faith should create a strong presumption of entitlement to a penalty and attorney fees, and the government should bear the burden to prove why no award should issue. In this case, ASE notes, the trial court’s single-sentence explanation for its denial of the award did not specify any standard used or factors considered, and the “passing reference to conflicting testimony” regarding damages is an insufficient basis to decline to issue any award. ASE argues such evidentiary conflicts are relevant only to the proper calculation of the award. Citing a multi-factor test employed in other areas involving awards of attorney fees, ASE argues consideration of such “traditional factors” weighs heavily in its favor. <em>See </em>ASE’s Brief at 31, <em>citing, e.g., Ursic v.

Moreover, since the trial court ultimately awarded ASE no statutory penalty or attorney fees despite the jury’s finding of bad faith, the City was not aggrieved by the trial court’s decision.

Whether the City of Allentown (the “City”) acted in bad faith was a finding that should have been made by the trial court, not the jury.

The text of section 3935 authorizes awards of interest penalties and attorneys’ fees if the government agency withholds payments in bad faith, and to that end, describes in detail what bad faith is (withholding arbitrarily or vexatiously) and what it is not (withholding pursuant to the good faith provisions of section 3934). The text mentions no other factor to be considered in connection with such awards. Yet this Court today interprets this text to permit a trial court (or an arbitrator or the Board of Claims) to deny an award of interest penalties and attorneys’ fees under section 3935 even if it has been proven that the government agency withheld payments in bad faith, apparently based upon consideration of any other factor or factors it considers relevant, including matters entirely dehors the evidentiary <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>record.

On the other hand, given the potential severity of awards under section 3935, the General Assembly also established a high evidentiary burden (proof of bad faith) for their imposition. Under section 3935, a finding of bad faith requires proof that the withholding of payment was either done arbitrarily or vexatiously. 62 Pa.C.S.A. § 3935. This Court has held that arbitrary conduct must be shown to be "based on random or convenient selection or choice rather than on reason or nature[,]” and vexatious conduct has "the sole purpose of causing annoyance,” <em>Thunberg v.

      <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.7",325,[230,1842,1122,543]]]'>For this reason, I reject the Majority's assertion that the language of section 512(a) of the Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act (“CAS-PA") provides an apt parallel to section 3935 of the Procurement Code. The relevant portion of section 512(a) provides that where a party has failed to comply with CASPA's payment terms, an arbitrator or court shall award an interest penalty on the amount that was “wrongfully withheld.” 73 P.S. § 512(a). Section 512(a) further provides that an amount will not be considered to have been wrongly withheld if it "bears a reasonable relation to the value of any claim held in good faith by the owner, contractor or subcontractor....” <em><a href="/pa/545/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="682 A.2d 295" data-case-ids="465016,7860548" data-case-paths="/pa/545/0607-01,/a2d/682/0295-01">Id.</a> </em>This is a lower evidentiary obligation than is proof of bad faith under section 3935. In addition, under CASPA, attorneys’ fees are awarded to the substantially prevailing party as of right, without the need for any showing of misconduct. 73 P.S. § 512(b).</p>

The Majority does observe that awards under the Procurement Code "implicate the public treasury,” but does not explain why this should be a relevant factor for consideration under section 3935, Majority Op. at 265-66, 142 A.3d at 788. While it is of course true that the Procurement Code, of necessity, implicates the public treasury, no provision in the Procurement Code authorizes, or even implies, a government agency may ever ignore its payment obligations to private parties merely because such payments are made from the public treasury. To the contrary, as indicated hereinabove, the Procurement Code plainly states, in no uncertain terms, that "[t]he government agency shall pay the contractor or design professional strictly in accordance with the contract.” 62 Pa.C.S.A. § 3932(a). Where a government agency fails to do so, and that failure is proven to have been in bad faith, section 3935 must result in the imposition of attorneys’ fees and interest penalties. The fact that public funds are at issue is taken into account by the higher evidentiaty standard of proof of bad faith to support the award of interest penalties and attorneys’ fees.</p>
