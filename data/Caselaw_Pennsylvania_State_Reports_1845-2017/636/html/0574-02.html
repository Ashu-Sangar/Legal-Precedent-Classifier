I would hold that the statutory provision at issue, 23 Pa.C.S. § 5325(2), which provides grandparents standing to seek custody of their grandchildren solely on the basis of parents’ separation or divorce, is not narrowly tailored because it does not require an allegation that the children are at risk of harm, and therefore, the statute unconstitutionally infringes on parents’ fundamental right to control access to their children. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that we should affirm the trial court’s order <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>granting Parents’ motion to dismiss Grandparents’ custody complaint for lack of standing.

I agree with the majority that Subsection 5325(2) implicates parents’ fundamental right to be free from litigation regarding their children, especially in light of the nature of child custody litigation and the negative effects it can have on children. See Maj. Op. at 590,146 A.3d at 213 (explaining that the strain caused by child custody litigation itself can be an infringement of a parent’s rights). Therefore, allowing grandparents to come into court infringes on parents’ fundamental rights to raise their children, and specifically, their right to keep their children out of court, including during the time prior to the court reaching the merits of the case. It is worthy of emphasis that throughout child custody proceedings, children may be required to participate in physical and mental <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>examinations, be present for home evaluations, provide in-court testimony, etc.</p>

It is beyond cavil that the state has a “longstanding interest in protecting the health and emotional welfare of children.” Hiller v. Fausey, <a href="/pa/588/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="588 Pa. 342" data-case-ids="3788399" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0342-01">588 Pa. 342</a>, <a href="/pa/588/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="156" data-cite="904 A.2d 875" data-case-ids="3788399,8473694" data-case-paths="/pa/588/0342-01,/a2d/904/0875-01">904 A.2d 875</a>, 886 (2006). Of course, “protecting ... children” implies there is something we are protecting them from. Thus, in my view, in order to conduct the last step of the analysis, which is to determine whether the statute is narrowly tailored, we must first define the specific harm to children against which the legislation seeks to protect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> To that point, we are not looking for whether children are at risk of <em>any </em>harm when their parents separate or divorce. Of course, separation and divorce place children at some risk. Rather, because Subsection 5325(2) provides grandparents standing to further a relationship with their grandchildren, the statutory provision seeks to redress harm to children as a result of the lack of such relationship.</p>

As discussed above, the infringement at issue here is forcing parents to litigate and justify their custody decisions. The harm sought to be cured is any harm caused by <a id="p600" href="#p600" data-label="600" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*600</a>parents limiting contact between grandchildren and children. Thus, for the statute to be narrowly tailored, it must ensure that grandparents may hail parents into court only when the grandparents allege they have been precluded from seeing the children and that lack of relationship has caused or will cause the children harm.</p>
    <p id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.4",652,[268,675,1153,1119]]]'>I acknowledge that the legislature attempted to tailor the standing statute to situations where children might be particularly benefitted by grandparent relationships by limiting its application to children of separated or divorced parents. However, Subsection 5325(2) is not narrowly tailored to situations where the state’s infringement on parents’ rights is necessary because nowhere in the standing statute does it require grandparents to plead that they have been precluded from seeing their grandchildren and that such preclusion will harm the children. Instead, once grandparents have standing under Subsection 5325(2), the court must take into consideration three factors: 1) the amount of personal contact between the child and the grandparents prior to the filing of the action; 2) whether the award interferes with any parent-child relationship; and 3) whether the award is in the best interest of the child. 23 Pa.C.S. § 5328(c)(1). Directing a trial court merely to consider whether the custody award will interfere with a parent-child relationship is not the same thing as precluding such award unless it is necessary to protect the child. These factors do not require a showing of harm to the child before a court may order custodial time for grandparents.</p>

It is no proxy at all. At this late date, I would think that our courts, if not our legislature, had moved beyond assumptions and biases against divorced parents, most of whom strive in the face of adversity to be the best parents they can be. To maintain any portion of Section 5325(2) is to deny societal reality, to consign roughly half the population to second-class status, and to stigmatize these citizens and their children.

The Majority cites the sound principle that, "when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem.” Maj. Op. at 595, 146 A.3d at 216 (quoting Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, <a href="/us/546/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="167" data-cite="126 S.

Because I cannot discern a principled constitutional distinction between divorced and separated couples in the context of the right to parent (and a child’s right to a parent), I must disagree with the Majority’s severability analysis. Because the due process and equal protection clauses do not countenance discrimination between (or against) separated and divorced parents, the two prongs of Section 5325(2) are intertwined and inseparable. Under these circumstances, it is unlikely that the General Assembly would have intended to confer standing upon grandparents within the context of divorce while declining to do so within the context of separation. See 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925.</p>
