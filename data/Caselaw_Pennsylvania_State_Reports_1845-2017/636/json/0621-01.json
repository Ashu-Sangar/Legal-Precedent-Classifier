        "text": "OPINION\nJUSTICE TODD\nIn this appeal, we consider whether a contractor may maintain an action under the Contractor and Subcontractor Payment Act (\u201cCASPA\u201d) against a property owner\u2019s agents. After careful review, we hold that a contractor may not do so, and, accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nBy way of statutory background, CASPA generally provides that a contractor or subcontractor who improves real property pursuant to a contract is entitled to timely payment pursuant to governing contract terms, or, in the absence of such terms, according to a statutorily-specified timetable, on pain of liability in the form of interest payments, and, if litigation is commenced, penalties and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. Relevant to the issue herein \u2014 ie., whom a contractor or subcontractor is entitled to recover from \u2014 Section 4 of CASPA provides that a contractor or subcontractor is entitled \u201cto payment from the party with whom the contractor or subcontractor has contracted.\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 504. Sections 5 through 12 of CASPA, however, do not use this \u201ccontracting party\u201d language and instead describe the relative obligations and rights of \u201cowners,\u201d \u201ccontractors,\u201d and \u201csubcontractors.\u201d See 73 P.S. \u00a7 505-512. Most centrally, Section 5, entitled \u201cOwner\u2019s payment obligations,\u201d provides that \u201c[t]he owner shall pay the contractor strictly in accordance with terms of the construction contract,\u201d creates a default term for timely payment in the absence of an express term governing the same, and subjects \u201cowners\u201d who do not timely pay contractors to interest payments at a statutorily-provided rate. 73 P.S. \u00a7 505. Likewise, Section 12 provides that \u201cowners\u201d who fail to comply with CASPA\u2019s requirements are subject to \u201ca penalty equal to 1% per month of the amount that was wrongfully withheld,\u201d as well as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. 73 P.S. \u00a7 512.\nFinally, of particular importance herein, Section 2 of CAS-PA defines \u201cowner,\u201d \u201cunless the context clearly indicates otherwise,\u201d as\n[a] person who has an interest in the real property that is improved and who ordered the improvement to be made. The term includes successors in interest of the owner and agents of the owner acting with their authority.\n73 P.S. \u00a7 502.\nAgainst this legal backdrop, the factual and procedural history of this matter is relatively straightforward. Beginning in 2005, Appellant Scungio Borst & Associates (\u201cSBA\u201d) entered into a series of written and oral construction contracts with Appellee 410 Shurs Lane Developers, LLC (\u201c410 SLD\u201d), which 410 SLD\u2019s part-owner and president, Appellee Robert DeBolt (\u201cDeBolt\u201d), executed on 410 SLD\u2019s behalf. Therein, SBA agreed to improve real property owned by 410 SLD in connection with the development of a condominium complex, and did so until November 2006, when SBA\u2019s contracts were terminated with approximately $1.5 million in outstanding payments due. SBA requested payment, but 410 SLD, again through DeBolt, refused.\nAccordingly, SBA filed the instant action against 410 SLD; its alleged successor corporation, Appellee Kenworth II, LLC (\u201cKenworth\u201d); and DeBolt in his personal capacity. SBA asserted, among other claims, violations of CASPA. Central to this appeal, DeBolt filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to SBA\u2019s claim under CASPA, arguing he could not be held liable under CASPA because he was not a party to SBA\u2019s contract with 410 SLD, and citing Section 4 for the proposition that CASPA applies solely to parties to a construction contract. SBA responded that DeBolt was liable under Sections 2 and 5 because he was an agent of 410 SLD who acted with his authority in ordering the subject work. (The parties do not dispute that DeBolt acted as 410 SLD\u2019s agent in this respect.) SBA further claimed that Section 2 was analogous to Section 260.2a of the Wage Payment Collection Law (\u201cWPCL\u201d)\u2014 which defines an employer subject to liability thereunder as including an employer\u2019s \u201cagents\u201d or \u201cofficers\u201d and which some courts have interpreted as permitting action against such agents or officers in their personal capacities \u2014 and, thus, should be similarly interpreted as permitting actions against property owners\u2019 agents in their personal capacities. The trial court disagreed:\n[410 SLD] was the \u201cowner\u201d of the property and ... DeBolt was not. CASPA imposes payment obligations upon the owner of real property, and a contractor may sue the owner if such payments are not made. ... Although the owner\u2019s \u201cagents\u201d are included in this definition, the legislature cannot have intended to make every \u201cagent,\u201d including even the lowliest employee, liable for a corporate property owner\u2019s debts to its contractors. Instead, the legislature must have intended to hold the principal, i.e., the owner, liable for its agents\u2019 authorized acts in \u201cordering the improvement to be made.\u201d Such an interpretation comports with general agency law.\nTrial Court Opinion, 12/14/2012, at 3 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the trial court granted DeBolt\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nSBA ultimately obtained a default judgment in the amount of $1.9 million against 410 SLD and Kenworth. SBA then appealed the trial court\u2019s order granting DeBolt\u2019s motion for summary judgment to the Superior Court.\nIn a scholarly and comprehensive published opinion authored by Judge Mary Jane Bowes, an en banc panel of the Superior Court affirmed. Scungio Borst & Assocs. v. 410 Shurs Lane Developers, LLC, 106 A.3d 103 (Pa.Super.2014) (en banc). The court first rejected SBA\u2019s primary argument that Section 2\u2019s definition of \u201cowner\u201d clearly and unambiguously permitted it to recover from DeBolt. Preliminarily, the court noted that Section 2 contains a caveat that its definitions apply \u201cunless the context clearly indicates otherwise,\u201d id. at 106 (quoting Section 2), and added that, pursuant to its own precedent, CASPA applies only in the context of a construction contract, id. (citing, inter alia, Prieto Corp. v. Gambone Constr. Co., 100 A.3d 602 (Pa.Super.2014)). The court then found tension between Section 4\u2019s language that a contractor is entitled to payment from \u201cthe party with whom the contractor ... has contracted\u201d and the ensuing sections\u2019 description of a contractor\u2019s right to payment from an \u201cowner,\u201d finding that such tension rendered the statute\u2019s language ambiguous as to whether a contractor could recover from an owner\u2019s agent, in a personal capacity. Accordingly, the court held that Section 2 did not clearly and unambiguously permit SBA\u2019s claim against DeBolt in his personal capacity.\nTurning to SBA\u2019s contention that Section 2 was an analogue to Section 260.2a of the WPCL, the court noted that SBA cited no legislative history or authority suggesting that Section 2 was modeled after Section 260.2a, and remarked that the provisions\u2019 language was materially different. The court further noted that, while the WPCL was intended to provide employees a mechanism to disgorge wrongfully withheld wages from their employers, and while imposing personal liability for employers\u2019 agents gave \u201ctop corporate managers an incentive to use available corporate funds for the payment of wages and benefits rather than for some other purpose,\u201d id at 108 (citing Carpenters Health and Welfare Fund of Phila. and Vicinity by Gray v. Ambrose, Inc., 727 F.2d 279, 282-83 (3d Cir.1983)), CASPA was intended \u201cto protect contractors and subcontractors [and] to encourage fair dealing among parties to a construction contract,\u201d id at 109 (quoting Ruthrauff, Inc. v. Ravin, 914 A.2d 880, 890 (Pa.Super.2006)) (emphasis in Scungio Borst & Assocs). Bearing that distinction in mind, and reiterating CASPA\u2019s dependence upon the existence of a construction contract, the court concluded:\n[T]he construction contract is the starting point of any CASPA analysis. CASPA does not supplant the traditional breach of contract action between contracting parties; it merely makes additional remedies available to contractors and subcontractors when they are not promptly paid by the party with which they contracted.\nId. at 109.\nFinally, the court rejected SBA\u2019s interpretation of Section 2 as imposing liability on owners\u2019 agents on the basis that it would run contrary to the longstanding principles that non-parties to a contract may not be held liable thereunder and that an agent of a disclosed principal is not personally liable for contracts entered into in the scope of his agency on the principal\u2019s behalf. The court reasoned that, if the General Assembly had sought to abrogate such bedrock principles of contract and agency law, it would have done so more expressly. Id. (citing In re Estate of Duran, 692 A.2d 176, 179 (Pa.Super.1997); Buradus v. General Cement Prods. Co., 159 Pa.Super. 501, 48 A.2d 883, 886 (1946), affd per curiam, 356 Pa. 349, 52 A.2d 205 (1947)).\nGiven the foregoing, the court concluded that Section 2\u215b definition of owner did not impose personal-liability on property owners\u2019 agents; instead, the court reasoned:\nThe reference to authorized agents in the definition of owner merely reinforces that their conduct is imputed to and binding upon the owner. Since the term \u201cagent\u201d is not defined in the statute, conceivably that term could include architects, project managers, and designated representatives who are acting on behalf of the owner in dealing with the contractor. \u201cContractor\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] person authorized or engaged by an owner to improve real property.\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 502. That definition is arguably broad enough to encompass agents of the owner. ... The \u201cagent of owner\u201d language was intended to clarify that persons acting on behalf of and with the authority of the owner are not contractors within the meaning of the statute for purposes of the time limitations contained therein. Furthermore, they are not entitled to avail themselves of the additional remedies afforded under CASPA in the event of a dispute with their principals.\nId. at 109-10. In the court\u2019s view, this construction of Section 2 is consistent with Section 4, with well settled principles of the common law of contracts and agency, and still served CASPA\u2019s purpose of protecting contractors because parties could \u201cpierce the corporate veil\u201d to hold shareholders liable. Id. at 110. (DeBolt was a shareholder of 410 SLD.)\nPresident Judge Emeritus John Bender, joined by then-Judges, now-Justices, Sallie Updyke Mundy and David Wecht, dissented, agreeing with SBA\u2019s position that Section 2 of CASPA was analogous to Section 260.2a of the WPCL, and should be interpreted as providing for agent liability where agents are involved in decisions giving rise to liability.\nThereafter, on SBA\u2019s petition, we granted allowance of appeal to consider whether a contractor may maintain an action under CASPA against a property owner\u2019s agents. Scungio Borst & Assocs. v. 410 Shurs Lane Developers, LLC, 120 A.3d 298 (Pa.2015) (order).\nBefore us, SBA renews its argument that the plain meaning of the foregoing provisions permits it to maintain its action against DeBolt in his personal capacity. As it did below, SBA explains that CASPA provides for an \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d liability, and that, as detailed above, Section 2 defines an owner as including \u201cagents of the owner acting with their authority.\u201d Thus, SBA reasons, because of 410 SLD\u2019s breach of contract, DeBolt, an \u201c \u2018agent of the owner acting with [his] authority,\u2019 \u201d is individually liable to SBA under CASPA. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 13-14 (quoting 73 P.S. \u00a7 502).\nIn the alternative, assuming arguendo that CASPA is ambiguous, SBA reasserts its view, rejected by the Superior Court, that Section 2\u2019s language defining an \u201cowner\u201d as including \u201cagents of the owner acting with their authority\u201d is analogous to Section 260.2a of the WPCL\u2019s definition of \u201cemployers\u201d as including an employer\u2019s \u201cagent[s] or officer[s],\u201d and, thus, that this Court should interpret Section 2, as other courts have interpreted Section 260.2a, as imposing personal liability on agents with decision-making authority. Specifically, SBA posits that \u201cthe intent of both acts is to protect workmen\u201d by ensuring that they get paid for work performed, that both statutes define liable entities as including their agents, and, thus, they should be interpreted as similarly imposing liability on agents who are decision-makers. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 13-16. SBA contends this limitation on agency liability deflates the trial court\u2019s concern that its interpretation could render all of a firm\u2019s employees liable for its debts.\nFurther, SBA disputes the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that SBA cited no authority or legislative history in support of its analogy between CASPA and the WPCL, and contends that the court\u2019s view that the statutes use materially different terms is equivalent to a \u201cclaim ... that the use of \u2018agent\u2019 in both acts is an accident,\u201d but \u201c[c]ommon sense dictates otherwise [and the] use of the same term in both acts is a facial similarity, not a facial difference.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19 n.2. SBA further submits that the Superior Court\u2019s analysis ignores the presumption that the legislature is familiar with extant law when enacting legislation and that it may use statutory language already interpreted in a particular way to indicate its intent to obtain a similar interpretation of a new statute. SBA notes that the judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing language of the WPCL predate the General Assembly\u2019s enactment of CASPA, and, thus, reasons that the presumption applies herein. Thus, SBA contends the Superior Court\u2019s determination that CASPA merely provides additional remedies to contracting parties is erroneous, and that the statute, like the WPCL, actually incentivizes agents to remedy owners\u2019 violations in order to protect contractors.\nFinally, SBA challenges the Superior Court\u2019s view that Section 2\u2019s reference to agents merely clarifies that agents\u2019 conduct is imputed to owners and explains that agents are not contractors within the meaning of its terms. SBA contends that view is inconsistent with CASPA\u2019s definition of an \u201cowner\u201d subject to liability under, inter alia, Sections 505 and 512. SBA adds that, insofar as \u201cowners\u201d subject to liability are intended to include \u201cagents of the owner acting with their authority,\u201d \u201cit follows that \u2018agents of owners\u2019 are subject to liability under CASPA,\u201d and \u201c[t]he majority\u2019s interpretation of \u2018agent of the owner\u2019 as a mere device for distinguishing agents from contractors is unsound.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 20-21.\nDeBolt, by contrast, argues that a party may recover under CASPA only from a party with whom it contracted. He submits that the language of Section 4 suggests as much, and that it would be absurd to interpret the remaining provisions of CASPA as breaking from longstanding, basic contract and agency law principles to impose liability on an agent for his principal\u2019s obligations, essentially rendering agents as personal guarantors of their principals\u2019 construction contracts. De-Bolt thus agrees with the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that Section 2\u2019s language was merely intended to establish that an agent\u2019s conduct is imputed to an owner, and that an agent is not himself a contractor. He claims that SBA\u2019s reliance on the WPCL is flawed, reasoning that \u201cthe statutes are incongruous, and there is no authority or legislative history to conclude that CASPA and the WPCL were intended to be parallel provisions, or that the terms should be similarly construed.\u201d Appel-lee\u2019s Brief at 9. DeBolt asserts that the legislature enacted the WPCL to cure the unequal bargaining power between employers and employees, whereas there is no similar inequality among property developers and their contractors.\nBecause the issue of whether a contractor may bring a CASPA action against a property owner\u2019s agent is one of statutory construction \u2014 a pure question of law \u2014 our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Freedom Medical Supply, Inc. v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., 131 A.3d 977, 980 (Pa.2016). In interpreting a statute, this Court endeavors to \u201cascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). Because, \u201cgenerally, the best indicator of legislative intent is the plain language of the statute,\u201d we begin our inquiry by considering the words of the statute. Com., Ofc. of the Gov. v. Donahue, 626 Pa. 437, 98 A.3d 1223, 1237 (2014); 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (\u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit\u201d). In doing so, we construe words and phrases according to their \u201ccommon and approved\u201d usage or, as appropriate, their \u201c \u2018peculiar and appropriate\u2019 or statutorily provided meanings.\u201d Freedom Medical Supply, 131 A.3d at 983 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903). Finally, we bear in mind that words and phrases must be viewed \u201cnot ... in isolation, but ... with reference to the context in which they appear.\u201d Meyer v. Comm. Coll. of Beaver Cnty., 625 Pa. 563, 93 A.3d 806, 813 (2014).\nThus, our initial inquiry is whether the plain language of Section 2\u2019s provision that \u201cowner\u201d means a \u201cperson who has an interest in the real property that is improved and who ordered the improvement to be made,\u201d and includes \u201cagents of the owner acting with their authority,\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 502, is clear and unambiguous with respect to agent liability. We conclude it is not. On the one hand, as SBA argues, one can read Section 2\u2019s definition of owner \u2014 as including \u201cagents of the owner acting with their authority\u201d \u2014 to indicate that such agents are equivalent to owners for purposes of the statute. Under such a reading, an owner\u2019s agent would share the owner\u2019s statutory obligations to timely pay contractors, as well as potential liability where contractors are not timely paid. On the other hand, as the lower courts concluded, one can read Section 2\u2019s first clause \u2014 defining an \u201cowner\u201d as \u201c[a] person who has an interest in the real property that is improved and who ordered the improvement to be made\u201d \u2014 as the term\u2019s definition. Under that view, Section 2\u2019s second clause \u2014 providing that \u201c[t]he term includes successors in interest of the owner and agents of the owner acting with their authority\u201d\u2014 as, essentially, a proviso (albeit an awkward one) modifying the first clause and clarifying that an owner remains liable under CASPA\u2019s operative provisions notwithstanding the owner\u2019s employment of an agent to order the subject improvements, or the owner\u2019s conveyance of its interest in the subject property to another entity. In our view, both constructions are reasonable interpretations of Section 2\u2019s text, and, accordingly, we conclude that Section 2 is ambiguous with respect to agent liability.\nWhere statutory language is ambiguous, this Court resolves such ambiguity by considering, inter alia, the occasion and necessity for the statute; the circumstances under which it was enacted; the mischief to be remedied; the object to be attained; the former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects; the consequences of a particular interpretation; and contemporaneous legislative history. 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(c). Furthermore, subject to several exceptions for particular types of statutes not implicated herein, we liberally construe statutes \u201cto effect their objects and promote justice.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(c). Thus, we assess the foregoing factors to determine which of the parties\u2019 views is most consistent with legislative intent.\nWe begin our inquiry in this regard with a brief review of the law concerning timely payment of contractors prior to CASPA\u2019s enactment, the legislative history attendant CAS-PA\u2019s passage, and its substantive effect. Prior to CASPA\u2019s enactment, an unpaid contractor would typically pursue a breach of contract claim against the property owner. Yet, a contractor so proceeding could face a series of potential pitfalls. Under traditional contract law, a contractor was entitled to payment according to the terms of its contract, or, in the absence of such a term, within a \u201creasonable time\u201d or upon completion of its work. See 17 C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 79. Under these standards, a contractor would face the option of potentially costly litigation over whether delays in payment were \u201creasonable,\u201d or awaiting the conclusion of its work to be paid, an unsatisfying option for large and lengthy construction projects. Similarly, under traditional contract law, an unpaid contractor would be required to pay its own litigation costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses. See 20 C.J.S. Costs \u00a7\u00a7 3, 173. Thus, if a contractor\u2019s damages were less than the cost of litigation, it might well be dissuaded from vindicating its rights.\nIn 1994, however, the General Assembly considered H.B. 906, the legislation which became CASPA, then subtitled \u201c[an act requiring] timely payment to certain contractors and subcontractors; and providing remedies to contractors and subcontractors.\u201d Engaging in no floor debate whatsoever, the legislature passed H.B. 906 in near-unanimous votes before the House and Senate. CASPA displaced the common law standards vis-\u00e1-vis what constitutes timely payment in the context of construction contracts with, as detailed above, a statutorily-specified timetable, and provided additional incentives \u2014 in the form of interest payments at a statutorily-provided rate, penalty damages, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, and costs \u2014 that reduced the aforementioned disincentives for contractors to pursue their contractual rights.\nIn our view, the General Assembly in enacting CASPA intended to address the problems inherent in reliance on common law contract doctrine to solve payment disputes in the construction field, and did not intend, as SBA suggests, to impose liability on agents. First, we note that CASPA\u2019s subtitle focuses on two subjects \u2014 timely payment and remedies\u2014 and does not suggest that its provisions impose liability on non-contracting parties.\nSecond, SBA\u2019s claim that Section 2 permits a contractor to recover from a property owner\u2019s agents creates tension with Section 4\u2019s provision that \u201c[performance by a contractor ... in accordance with the provisions of a contract shall entitle the contractor or subcontractor to payment from the party with whom the contractor ... has contracted,\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 504 (emphasis added), and Section 7(a)\u2019s similar focus on contracting parties, see 73 P.S. \u00a7 507(a) (providing that a subcontractor is entitled to payment \u201cfrom the party with whom the subcontractor has contracted\u201d). Plainly, SBA\u2019s approach would extend a contractor\u2019s right to payment beyond that contemplated in Sections 4 and 7, as agents are not ordinarily parties to their principals\u2019 construction contracts. Likewise, SBA\u2019s interpretation of Section 2 is difficult to reconcile with the myriad provisions of CASPA which regard a construction contract as central to a contractor\u2019s claim. See, e.g., 73 P.S. \u00a7 504 (conditioning entitlement to payment on \u201c[performance ... in accordance with the provisions of a contract\u201d); 73 P.S. \u00a7 505 (requiring payment in strict compliance with \u201cthe terms of the construction contract\u201d); 73 P.S. \u00a7 506(a) (permitting owners to withhold payments for deficiently performed work \u201caccording to the terms of the construction contract\u201d). SBA\u2019s view of the statute dispenses with that centrality, and extends liability to agents, who, again, may be entirely foreign to the agreement. Although SBA correctly notes that Sections 5 through 12 also set forth the liability of \u201cowners,\u201d in our view, the only way to harmoniously view CASPA, as a whole, is to conclude that Sections 5 through 12 do not intend thereby to impose agency liability.\nThird, SBA\u2019s interpretation would require that a property owner\u2019s agents personally assume the obligations of the owner\u2019s construction contracts with respect to payments to contractors, contrary to longstanding and fundamental common law agency principles. See Vernon D. Cox & Co. v. Giles, 267 Pa.Super. 411, 406 A.2d 1107, 1110 & n. 4 (1979) (noting that it \u201cis a basic tenet of agency law that an individual acting as an agent for a disclosed principle [sic] is not personally liable on a contract between the principle [sic] and a third party unless the agent specifically agrees to assume liability\u201d and that \u201c[t]he fact that a corporate officer cannot be held personally liable on contracts entered into while acting in his corporate capacity is a particular application of this principle\u201d) (citing, inter alia, Revere Press v. Blumberg, 431 Pa. 370, 246 A.2d 407 (1968); Yentis v. Mills, 299 Pa. 25, 148 A. 909 (1930); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 320 (1958)). Had the General Assembly intended to do so, we conclude it would have made a clearer statement to that effect, rather than resort to an ambiguous clause in a definitional provision such as Section 502. Accord Delaware River Port Auth. v. Pa. Public Utility Comm\u2019n, 393 Pa. 639, 145 A.2d 172, 175-76 (1958) (noting that this Court presumes that the General Assembly, in enacting changes to the common law, will make an express statement). Indeed, it is a fair inference that a law imposing personal liability on agents who authorize construction work would occasion some meaningful debate or dissent, and, as noted, CASPA generated none in the legislature. While SBA asserts that its interpretation merely requires only high-level decision-making agents to personally guarantee their principals\u2019 construction projects, tellingly, SBA offers nothing in CAS-PA\u2019s text that would suggest such a limitation.\nMoreover, we find SBA\u2019s argument that Section 2 is analogous to Section 260.2a of the WPCL unpersuasive. As an initial matter, we note that this Court has not definitively interpreted Section 260.2a as permitting an employee to bring an action against its employer\u2019s agents. In any event, we note that SBA has offered no legislative history or prior decisional law demonstrating that Section 260.2a was, in fact, a model for Section 2 of CASPA. Furthermore, we find that the language of the respective sections is not sufficiently similar to compel the conclusion that they be similarly construed. As noted supra, Section 2\u2019s definition of \u201cowner\u201d is composed of two parts, defining owner as \u201c[a] person who has an interest in the real property ... and who ordered the improvement to be made,\u201d and adding a proviso that \u201c[t]he term includes successors in interest of the owner and agents of the owner acting with their authority.\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 602. By contrast, Section 260.2(a)\u2019s definition of \u201cemployer\u201d is a single, continuous list of qualifying entities that is not similarly structurally divisible. See supra note 5. We thus find SBA\u2019s analogy inapt.\nIn sum, for the foregoing reasons, we hold a contractor may not maintain an action under CASPA against a property owner\u2019s agents. Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nOrder affirmed.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer, Donohue and Dougherty join the opinion.\nJustice Wecht did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 501 etseq.\n.

Dion, 341 Pa.Super. 12, 491 A.3d 123 (1985) (approving Ward but limiting it to instances where an employer itself defaults); Mohney v. McClure, 390 Pa.Super. 338, 568 A.2d 682 (1990) (holding that such actions are permissible only against officers and agents involved in salient decision-making).\n. Act of Feb. 17, 1994, P.L. 73, No. 7 \u00a7 1.\n. Our view of CASPA\u2019s purpose in this regard is consistent with numerous decisions describing CASPA as protecting contractors and subcontractors by encouraging fair dealing among parties to construction contracts, which stem largely from Judge R, Stanton Wetticlc\u2019s decision in Richardson v, Sherman, 26 Pa. D. & C.4th 193 (Ct.Com.Pl.Allegheny 1996). See, e.g., Nippes v. Lucas, 815 A.2d 648 (Pa.Super.2003); R.W. Sidley, Inc, v. U.S. Fidelity & Guar. Co., 319 F.Supp.2d 554 (W.D.Pa.2004); Ruthrauff, supra; Zimmerman v. Harrisburg Fudd I, L.P., 984 A.2d 497 (Pa.Super.2009); Lomas v. Kravitz, 130 A,3d 107 (Pa.Super.2015).",
