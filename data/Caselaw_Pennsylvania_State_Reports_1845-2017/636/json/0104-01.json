Whether the Superior Court erred by holding an outside medical provider\u2019s peer review proceedings regarding its employees who staff a hospital\u2019s Emergency Department under a contract with that hospital are not entitled to protection from disclosure under the Pennsylvania Peer Review Protection Act?\n2. Whether the sharing of peer review records by a third-party medical provider that operates a hospital\u2019s Emergency Department with the administration of that hospital constitutes a waiver of peer review protection as to those records?\n3. Whether a hospital that contracts with a third-party medical provider to operate the hospital\u2019s Emergency Department may claim protection under the Peer Review Protection Act for records of peer review proceedings conducted by the medical provider regarding its employees who staff the hospital\u2019s Emergency Department?\nThese matters are to be listed for argument with the petitions granted at 40, 41 & 42 WAL 2016.",
