        "text": "OPINION\nJustice WECHT.\nSection 906 of the Crimes Code provides that \u201c[a] person may not be convicted of more than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal attempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy for conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906. The question in this case, raised under a derivative theory of ineffective assistance of counsel, is whether that provision proscribes only convictions for two or more distinct inchoate crimes, or whether it also prohibits convictions for two or more counts of the same inchoate crime. We hold that Section 906 bars convictions only for multiple distinct inchoate crimes. Because the Superior Court concluded otherwise in remanding for an ineffectiveness hearing, we reverse.\nOn November 8, 2008, Scott Kingston was driving home from a party with his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Mroz, who was sitting in the passenger seat. Kingston drove his vehicle off the road and into a ditch. When police officers arrived, Mroz told them that Kingston, who was visibly intoxicated, had been driving the vehicle. The police arrested Kingston and charged him with driving under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance (\u201cDUI\u201d), 76 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802, and several other Motor Vehicle Code violations. A blood test revealed that Kingston\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was 0.26% shortly after the accident. Kingston had three prior DUI convictions. If convicted of a fourth, he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of one-year incarceration. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(b)(4).\nPrior to his trial, Kingston sent Mroz three letters from the Wyoming County Jail, where he was being held on charges unrelated to this appeal. In his first letter, Kingston asked Mroz to speak to Kingston\u2019s parents, and to find out whether they were willing to testify that Kingston\u2019s father was driving the vehicle on the night of the accident. A few weeks later, Kingston sent Mroz a second letter, asking her to tell \u201cthem\u201d that she was driving on the night of the accident. Kingston assured Mroz that if she took the blame for the collision \u201cthey\u201d could only \u201cgive [her] a fine.\u201d Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.t.\u201d), 3/24/2010, exh. 2. Twelve days after that, Kingston sent Mroz a third letter, advising her as follows:\nI found out if you plead the 5th and say that you were toxicated you whont get nothing out of it and it should be dropped we got to do something time is running out and I got to get a lawyer be for Jan. 14-09 at 1:00 did you get that statment that I sent you honey find out and see if you should do that but dont say that I was driving the car if thay asek hoo was just say you was baby because thay cant get you for a DUI because thay did not take nothing.\nId. at exh. 3 (verbatim).\nIn March 2009, Mroz testified for the Commonwealth at Kingston\u2019s preliminary hearing. Contrary to Kingston\u2019s wishes, Mroz testified that Kingston was driving at the time of the accident. The charges were held for court, and Kingston proceeded to trial. However, due to an administrative oversight, Mroz did not receive notice that the Commonwealth had subpoenaed her to testify at Kingston\u2019s trial until after it had commenced. When she failed to appear on the morning of Kingston\u2019s trial, the court issued a bench warrant for Mroz and proceeded without her. The jury ultimately acquitted Kingston after Kingston\u2019s father falsely testified that he was driving the vehicle on the night in question.\nThe day after Kingston\u2019s trial, Mroz met with a detective from the Bradford County District Attorney\u2019s Office and explained the subpoena mix-up. Mroz also told the detective about the letters that Kingston had sent to her from jail. The Commonwealth subsequently charged Kingston with, inter alia, three counts of soliciting perjury and three counts of soliciting to hinder apprehension or prosecution. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4902, 5105. A jury convicted Kingston of all six counts, and the trial court imposed a consecutive sentence for each. On direct appeal, the Superior Court affirmed Kingston\u2019s judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Kingston, 1031 MDA 2010 (Pa.Super. May 26, 2011) (unpublished memorandum).\nOn May 2, 2012, Kingston timely filed a petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-46. Therein, Kingston alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the imposition of consecutive sentences for each of his solicitation convictions. Kingston argued that, pursuant to Section 906 of the Crimes Code, his six convictions should have merged into only two for sentencing purposes, one for soliciting perjury and one for soliciting to hinder apprehension or prosecution. The PCRA court dismissed Kingston\u2019s petition without a hearing, concluding that Kingston\u2019s ineffectiveness claim lacked arguable merit because Section 906 \u201cdoes not prohibit multiple convictions for the same type of inchoate crime.\u201d PCRA Court Order, 8/23/2012, at 2. Kingston appealed the PCRA court\u2019s dismissal of his petition to the Superior Court.\nA divided three-judge panel of the Superior Court held that Kingston\u2019s ineffectiveness claim had arguable merit, and remanded the case to the PCRA court for a hearing on the remaining prongs of the Pierce test. See Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987) (setting forth Pennsylvania\u2019s three-factor inquiry for ineffective assistance of counsel claims). The Superior Court acknowledged that no existing precedent supported Kingston\u2019s reading of the statute, but concluded nonetheless that Section 906 bars his multiple convictions for distinct solicitations designed to culminate in a single underlying crime. Although the majority avowedly relied upon the plain language of the statute, it focused mainly upon the policy underlying Section 906\u2019s treatment of multiple inchoate convictions. Specifically, the court explained that the statute is based upon \u201ca recognition that the [societal] harm in inchoate crimes resides \u2018not in the acts already accomplished, but in the danger that [an] appellant would succeed in his criminal endeavor.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Kingston, 2014 WL 10558605, at *4 (Pa.Super. Oct. 29, 2014) (unpublished memorandum) (quoting Commonwealth v. Crocker, 256 Pa.Super. 63, 389 A.2d 601, 604 (1978)).\nThe court also concluded that Kingston\u2019s six separate solicitations were designed to culminate in the commission of only two crimes. The court reasoned that, although Kingston\u2019s letters to Mroz requested different methods of perjury or hindering prosecution, \u201cthey were all methods to the same end \u2014 namely, exculpation of Kingston o[n] the DUI charges.\u201d Id. The court emphasized that Kingston\u2019s three contrived narratives were mutually exclusive. If she wanted to exculpate Kingston, Mroz had to select one of these stories and stick with it. The court likened the situation to \u201ca defendant soliciting another person to break into a house later that evening by going through the front door, the back door, or through a window.\u201d Id.\nThe Honorable Mary Jane Bowes dissented. In her view, Section 906 \u201cdoes not preclude a sentence on multiple solicitation counts where the defendant, on separate dates, solicited a person to commit the same crime.\u201d Id. at *7 (Bowes, J., dissenting). Judge Bowes stressed that \u201cSection 906 has consistently been applied to preclude multiple sentences for criminal attempt to commit crime X, criminal conspiracy to commit crime X, and criminal solicitation to commit crime X, not to prohibit sentencing on multiple acts of criminal solicitation.\u201d Id. According to Judge Bowes, the Superior Court majority essentially had redrafted the statute to read, \u201ca person may not be convicted of more than one criminal attempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy for conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime.\u201d Id.\nJudge Bowes also rejected the majority\u2019s conclusion that Kingston intended for all six of his solicitations to culminate in only two crimes. She noted that Kingston thrice solicited Mroz, sending three separate letters spread across several weeks. For this reason, Judge Bowes rejected as inapposite the majority\u2019s analogy to a situation in which a defendant solicits another person \u201cto break into a house later that evening by going through the front door, the back door, or through a window.\u201d Finally, Judge Bowes observed that the court\u2019s interpretation of Section 906 would yield absurd results, namely, that \u201ca person who solicits a person on two occasions, a year apart, to murder his or her spouse could only be sentenced on one count of solicitation because the spouse could only be murdered one time.\u201d Id. at *5-6.\nWe granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to resolve the novel question of statutory interpretation underlying Kingston\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. Snead v. Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Penna., 604 Pa. 166, 985 A.2d 909, 912 (2009) (citing In re Milton Hershey Sch., 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006)). Specifically, we consider whether Section 906 forbids multiple convictions for two or more violations of a single inchoate offense when all of the violations are designed to culminate in a single underlying crime. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906.\nIn all matters involving statutory interpretation, we apply the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 et seq., which directs us to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). To accomplish that goal, we interpret statutory language not in isolation, but with reference to the context in which it appears. See Consulting Eng\u2019rs Council of Penna. v. State Architects Licensure Bd., 522 Pa. 204, 560 A.2d 1375, 1377 (1989). A statute\u2019s plain language generally provides the best indication of legislative intent. See, e.g., McGrory v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 591 Pa. 56, 915 A.2d 1155, 1158 (2007); Commonwealth v. Gilmour Mfg. Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003); Penna. Fin. Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995) (\u201cWhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity the legislative intent is to be gleaned from those very words.\u201d). Only where the words of a statute are ambiguous will we resort to other considerations to discern legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c); see In re Canvass of Absentee Ballots of Nov. 4, 2003 Gen. Election, 577 Pa. 231, 843 A.2d 1223, 1230 (2004) (citing O\u2019Rourke v. Commonwealth, 566 Pa. 161, 778 A.2d 1194, 1201 (2001)).\nThe Commonwealth argues that Section 906 merely prevents trial courts from imposing a sentence for more than one of the three preparatory offenses listed in the statute whenever a defendant\u2019s conduct is designed to culminate in the commission of a single crime. The provision does not, according to the Commonwealth, bar multiple sentences when a defendant is convicted of multiple counts of a single inchoate offense. In support of its position, the Commonwealth provides only a few conclusory assertions regarding the General Assembly\u2019s intent. Without any accompanying citations or supporting analysis, the Commonwealth contends that (1) the legislature intended for \u201cseparate inchoate crimes to be punished\u201d individually; (2) the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 906 was \u201cunreasonable and contrary to the intent of the legislature\u201d; and (3) \u201c[n]o lawmakers wanted to enact a \u2018volume discount\u2019 on criminal conduct.\u201d Brief for the Commonwealth at 16.\nKingston\u2019s arguments are similarly perfunctory. Echoing his Superior Court brief, Kingston argues that the trial court\u2019s imposition of six consecutive sentences was contrary to the Superior Court\u2019s holdings in Commonwealth v. Grekis, 411 Pa.Super. 513, 601 A.2d 1284 (1992), and Commonwealth v. Crocker, 256 Pa.Super. 63, 389 A.2d 601 (1978).\nBefore proceeding to our analysis of Section 906, we first dispense with Kingston\u2019s reliance upon Crocker and Grekis. Crocker provides no support for Kingston\u2019s argument because the appellant in that case was convicted of two different inchoate crimes, not multiple counts of a single inchoate crime. Grekis also is distinguishable. There, the Superior Court rejected as meritless the appellant\u2019s argument that his convictions for three separate counts of solicitation to commit involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (\u201cIDSI\u201d) violated Section 906. The court explained that the appellant\u2019s claim was \u201cwithout factual basis\u201d because the trial court imposed a sentence for only one of his IDSI convictions and imposed no further penalty for the remaining counts. Grekis, 601 A.2d at 1294. Even so, the court observed that Section 906 was inapplicable because the appellant\u2019s three solicitations were designed to culminate in three distinct crimes. At all events, whether Kingston\u2019s solicitations were directed toward the commission of the same crime is not before this Court, the language that Kingston cites is obiter dicta, and this Court is not bound by the decisions of the Superior Court.\nOur analysis begins with the plain language of Section 906, which provides that \u201c[a] person may not be convicted of more than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal attempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy for conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906. Pennsylvania courts have applied this provision in situations where a defendant commits two or three inchoate offenses while preparing to commit a single underlying crime. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bright, 361 Pa.Super. 261, 522 A.2d 573 (1987); Commonwealth v. Gonzales, 297 Pa.Super. 66, 443 A.2d 301 (1982); Commonwealth v. Tingle, 275 Pa.Super. 489, 419 A.2d 6 (1980). To illustrate, suppose that Dan, with the requisite criminal intent, asks Abe to commit a robbery. Abe agrees and takes a substantial step toward the commission of the robbery. Dan has committed three inchoate crimes. Yet, pursuant to Section 906, he may be punished for only one.\nThe question that we face distills to whether \u201cmore than one of the inchoate crimes\u201d refers to more than one substantive inchoate crime only, or whether it also connotes more than one count of a particular inchoate crime. In effect, Kingston maintains that multiple counts constitute discrete \u201ccrimes\u201d in the same way that criminal attempt, criminal solicitation, and criminal conspiracy are discrete \u201ccrimes.\u201d Although we acknowledge that the word \u201ccrimes,\u201d at least in the abstract, might encompass two or more violations of a single substantive criminal offense, a close examination of the necessary predicates to Kingston\u2019s argument reveals that his interpretation of Section 906 is not so reasonable as to render the statute ambiguous.\nThis Court does not dissect statutory text and interpret it in a vacuum. See Mishoe v. Erie Ins. Co., 673 Pa. 267, 824 A.2d 1153, 1155 (2003). We cannot disregard the fact that \u201cinchoate crimes,\u201d as used in section 906, precedes three expressly enumerated inchoate offenses. Section 906 forbids convictions for \u201cmore than one of the inchoate crimes\u201d listed. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906. To accept Kingston\u2019s interpretation would require us to privilege the unspoken \u201ccounts\u201d over the express enumeration of distinct inchoate offenses. We perceive no basis for adopting such a tortured interpretation. In contrast to Section 906, the Crimes Code is replete with provisions that speak in terms of \u201ccounts\u201d or \u201cviolations\u201d of a particular criminal offense. See, e.g., 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7507.1(a.l) (listing circumstances under which \u201cseparate violations\u201d of this section occur); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6305(f)(2) (\u201cNo more than one violation of subsection (a) per person arises out of separate incidents which take place in a 24-hour period.\u201d); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3213(f) (\u201cThe department shall have the authority to assess a civil penalty of up to $5,000 against any facility for each violation of this subsection.\u201d); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4902(e) (providing that the Commonwealth may charge \u201ca single count\u201d of perjury based upon a defendant\u2019s mutually exclusive statements); ef. 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1930 (\u201cWhenever a penalty or forfeiture is provided for the violation of a statute, such penalty or forfeiture shall be construed to be for each such violation.\u201d). We have held that all sections of the Crimes Code \u201care necessarily interrelated and should be read and construed as an entirety.\u201d Commonwealth v. Lobiondo, 501 Pa. 599, 462 A.2d 662, 664 (1983).\nViewed as a whole, Title 18 evinces the General Assembly\u2019s appreciation of the distinction between convictions for more than one of several specifically enumerated crimes and convictions for multiple violations of a single crime. The General Assembly included no language in Section 906 limiting convictions for two or more successive violations of a single inchoate crime. Instead, it barred multiple convictions for \u201cmore than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal attempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906.\nKingston\u2019s argument that Section 906 \u201cbars the imposition of sentences for multiple counts of the same inchoate charge,\u201d Brief for Kingston at 7 (capitalization modified), is untenable. It requires either that we ignore existing words in the statute or that we add additional words to it. We can do neither. Section 906 does not prevent convictions for more than one count of the inchoate crime of solicitation; it applies only to convictions for \u201cmore than one of the inchoate crimes of criminal attempt, criminal solicitation or criminal conspiracy.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 906. The General Assembly\u2019s use of the plural \u201ccrimes\u201d is illuminating. Even if Section 906 spoke in terms of convictions for \u201cmore than one of the inchoate crime\u201d of attempt, solicitation, or conspiracy, we would face a baffling command at best. Unless we proceed to inject the word \u201ccounts\u201d or \u201cviolations\u201d into the statute, the question necessarily would arise: \u201cMore than one what?\u201d\nMroz neither agreed nor attempted to commit perjury or to hinder the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Kingston. Thus, as it relates to this appeal, Kingston was convicted of solicitation only. Nevertheless, the Superior Court departed from the plain language of Section 906 because it reasoned that, if the General Assembly wanted to prohibit convictions for two or more different inchoate offenses, but not for multiple counts of the same inchoate offense, then it would have replaced the phrase \u201cfor conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime,\u201d id., \u201cwith the much shorter \u2018same conduct.\u2019 \u201d Kingston, 2014 WL 10558605, at *4. Although that language would be more concise, it would do nothing to clarify that \u201cmore than one of the inchoate crimes\u201d means only more than one distinct inchoate crime. The Superior Court majority did not engage in any further analysis of Section 906\u2019s text, nor did it explicitly find the statute to be ambiguous.\nEven if we were willing to look beyond Section 906\u2019s unambiguous language, contra 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b), none of the traditional principles of statutory interpretation support Kingston\u2019s reading. It is not difficult to imagine why the General Assembly would proscribe multiple convictions for distinct inchoate offenses in circumstances where a defendant\u2019s conduct was designed to culminate in the commission of a single underlying crime. Successive steps in a criminal undertaking often will constitute a criminal solicitation, a criminal conspiracy, and a criminal attempt, because all three offenses necessarily overlap. All conspiracies follow a solicitation of some kind; there can be no acceptance without an offer. In addition, the difference between an \u201covert act\u201d necessary to establish a criminal conspiracy and a \u201csubstantial step\u201d evidencing a criminal attempt is one of degree only. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 903(e) (\u201cNo person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime unless an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.\u201d), 901(a) (\u201cA person commits an attempt when, with intent to commit a specific crime, he does any act which constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that crime.\u201d).\nIt is less clear why the General Assembly would bar plural convictions for defendants who attempt repeatedly to commit the same crime. The Superior Court reasoned that \u201cthe policy behind Section 906 rest[s] on a recognition that the harm in inchoate crimes resides \u2018not in the acts already accomplished, but in the danger that [an] appellant [mil] succeed in his criminal endeavor,\u2019 \u201d Kingston, 2014 WL 10558605, at *4 (quoting Commonwealth v. Crocker, 256 Pa.Super. 63, 389 A.2d 601, 604 (1978)). This policy statement is based upon the commentary to Section 5.05(3) of the Model Penal Code (\u201cMPC\u201d), which states that \u201c[a] person may not be convicted of more than one offense defined by this Article for conduct designed to commit or to culminate in the commission of the same crime.\u201d MPC \u00a7 5.05(3). As the Superior Court noted in Crocker, the drafters of the MPC explained that Section 5.05(3)\nreflects the policy, frequently stated in these comments, of finding the evil of preparatory action in the danger that it may culminate in the substantive offense that is its object. Thus conceived, there is no warrant for cumulating convictions of attempt, solicitation and conspiracy to commit the same offense.\nMPC \u00a7 5.05, cmt. 180 (Tent. Draft No. 10,1960).\nThe explanatory note to Section 5.05 of the MPC likewise provides as follows:\nSubsection (3) provides that a person may not be convicted of more than one inchoate offense for conduct designed to culminate in the commission of the same crime. See also Section 1.07(l)(b), which prohibits conviction of both the inchoate offense and the substantive offense that is its object.\nMPC \u00a7 5.05, note.\nThe Superior Court acknowledged that Kingston committed six separate solicitations, but found that \u201cthey all envisioned culmination in but two criminal acts,\u201d perjury and hindering prosecution. Kingston, 2014 WL 10558605, at *5. This conclusion may seem logical in light of the MPC\u2019s avowal that inchoate crimes warrant punishment only because of the potential that they might lead to the commission of the predicate offense. See MPC \u00a7 5.05, cmt. 180 (Tent. Draft No. 10,1960). But the Superior Court\u2019s reliance upon this language was misplaced. In enacting Chapter nine of our Crimes Code, the General Assembly manifestly rejected the philosophy expressed in the MPC commentary that inchoate criminal liability derives entirely from the risk that an inchoate act might lead to the commission of the underlying substantive offense.\nIn contrast to the MPC\u2019s risk-of-danger approach, this Court has explained that the purpose of Pennsylvania\u2019s solicitation statute \u201cis to hold accountable those who would command, encourage, or request the commission of crimes by others.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hacker, 609 Pa. 108, 15 A.3d 333, 336 (2011). Thus, Pennsylvania law recognizes that inchoate crimes may present significant social dangers unconnected to the risk that they might culminate in the commission of the underlying substantive offense. Consistent with this theory of inchoate criminal liability, the General Assembly has chosen to define the crime of attempt to include situations in which \u201cit would have been impossible for the accused to commit the crime attempted.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 901(b). Finally, Pennsylvania law differs from the MPC insofar as our Crimes Code permits convictions for conspiracy or solicitation even if a defendant is convicted of the underlying predicate offense. Compare Commonwealth v. Miller, 469 Pa. 24, 364 A.2d 886, 886-87 (1976) (holding that criminal conspiracy does not merge into the underlying substantive offense or offenses) with MPC \u00a7 1.07(l)(b) (\u201c[A defendant] may not ... be convicted of more than one offense if one offense consists only of a conspiracy or other form of preparation to commit the other....\u201d). For these reasons, the Superior Court\u2019s rationale rests upon the mistaken perception that our Crimes Code imposes liability for inchoate crimes only if there exists a unique danger that a defendant will succeed in his or her criminal endeavor.\nIn any event, a policy-based analysis cannot overcome the unambiguous language of Section 906. See Penna. Fin. Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan, 664 A.2d at 87 (\u201cWhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity the legislative intent is to be gleaned from those very words.\u201d). Section 906 does not forbid the imposition of consecutive sentences for multiple violations of a single inchoate offense. Accordingly, Kingston\u2019s PCRA claim lacks arguable merit.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed.\nJustices BAER, TODD, DONOHUE, DOUGHERTY and MUNDY join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. In order to obtain relief based upon an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a petitioner must establish that: (1) the underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) no reasonable basis existed for counsel\u2019s actions or failure to act; and (3) petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of counsel's error such that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different absent such error. Pierce, 527 A.2d at 975.\n. The Commonwealth also argues now that Kingston\u2019s solicitations were not designed to culminate in the commission of the same crime. Brief for the Commonwealth at 13. Because the Commonwealth did not appeal this issue, we will not consider it.\n. Although Section 906 bars \u201cmultiple convictions,\u201d the Superior Court has held, and we have assumed without explicitly deciding, that the statute proscribes multiple judgments of sentence. Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 39 A.3d 977, 983 (2012); Commonwealth v. Grekis, 411 Pa.Super. 513, 601 A.2d 1284, 1295 (1992) (\"[Section 906] is designed to eliminate multiple convictions, i.e., judgments of sentence, for conduct which constitutes preparation for a single criminal objective.\u201d). Neither the Commonwealth nor Kingston disputes this approach. Thus, we assume for purposes of this appeal that Section 906 prohibits multiple judgments of sentence.\n. Kingston also argues that his convictions for soliciting perjury should have merged with his convictions for soliciting to hinder apprehension or prosecution. According to Kingston, \u201cboth individual crimes were designed to culminate in the commission of the same crime, which was to elicit false testimony under oath, at the time of [t]rial.\u201d Brief for Kingston at 9. Kingston did not raise this issue with the PCRA court in his Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement, and the Superior Court did not address it. See Kingston's Rule 1925(b) Statement, 12/5/2012, at 1-2 (unnumbered); Kingston, 2014 WL 10558605, at *5 (\"While there are six separate solicitations involved, they all envisioned culmination in but two criminal acts....\u201d). Thus, we need not consider this argument.\n. See supra n. 2.\n. In reKenin\u2019s Trust Estate, 343 Pa. 549, 23 A.2d 837, 842 (1942) (\u201c[I]n every case[,] what is actually decided is the law applicable to the particular facts; all other legal conclusions therein are but obiter dicta.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n. Commonwealth v. Cook, 558 Pa. 50, 735 A.2d 673, 679 n. 8 (1999) (\"[T]his court is not bound by rulings of a lower court in this Commonwealth.\u201d).\n. Dan is guilty of solicitation because he requested that Abe engage in specific criminal conduct that constitutes robbery. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 902(a). Dan also is guilty of attempt because Abe, who is Dan's accomplice, took a substantial step toward the commission of the robbery. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 901, 306 (defining an accomplice to include a person who, with the intent of promoting or facilitating the commission of an offense, solicits another to commit it). Finally, Dan is guilty of conspiracy because he and Abe agreed that Abe would commit the robbery. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903(a). Dan\u2019s intent to promote or to facilitate the robbery satisfies the mens rea requirement for all three crimes, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 901-903, and Abe\u2019s substantial step toward the commission of the robbery also constitutes an overt act necessary to establish conspiracy. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903(e).\n. To illustrate the distinction, consider the following hypothetical. Imagine a provision that states, \"no person may be employed by more than one of the co-equal branches of the legislative branch or the judicial branch in any five-year period.\u201d This language clearly would prohibit a legislator from serving as judge during (or within five years after) his or her legislative tenure. However, it would not prevent a trial court judge from moving to an appellate court, or a member of the House of Representatives from moving to the Senate. The unambiguous statutory text forbids employment in multiple \"branches,\u201d a prohibition that no one reasonably could construe as barring multiple positions within a single branch.\n. Even if the General Assembly intended to accomplish this result, it is unlikely that it would have used Section 906, or a provision like it, to do so. If the General Assembly wanted to restrict, or prohibit outright, multiple solicitation convictions, it likely would have done so within the section defining criminal solicitation. Indeed, the General Assembly did just that in the context of criminal conspiracy. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 903(a) (providing that a person is guilty of conspiracy if he agrees with another \u201cperson or persons\u201d to commit, attempt to commit, or solicit a crime), 903(b) (defining a single conspiratorial relationship to encompass persons who have conspired to commit the same crime, even if they did not know the identity of some co-conspirators), 903(c) (\"If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are the object of the same agreement or continuous conspiratorial relationship,\u201d). We have held that, \u201cwhere a section of a statute contains a given provision, the omission of such a provision from a similar section is significant to show a different legislative intent,\u201d Fletcher v. Penna. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, 603 Pa. 452, 985 A.2d 678, 684 (2009).",

From my point of view, the statute is materially ambiguous in such regard, and accordingly, the rule of lenity should be applied to enforce horizontal and vertical preclusion.\nIn its reasoning rejecting vertical preclusion, the majority first states that acceptance of such proscription \u201cwould require us to privilege the unspoken \u2018counts\u2019 over the express enumeration of distinct inchoate offenses.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 449, 143 A.3d at 924. In point of fact, however, no such privileging is required, since extension of a rule of preclusion across the two categories which are facially encompassed within the statute simply is not an either-or proposition. Along these lines, I also do not see what is added through the observation that the Crimes Code may otherwise frequently speak in terms of \u201ccounts\u201d or \u201cviolations.\u201d See id. at 449-50, 143 A.3d at 924-25. Straightforwardly, a crime is simply a violation of the law, see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (17th ed.1999); accord 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 106, so that the use of the terms \u201cviolation,\u201d versus \u201ccount,\u201d versus \u201ccrime\u201d would seem to me to be immaterial. Accordingly, the answer to the majority\u2019s defining question\u2014 \u201c[m]ore than one what?\u201d \u2014 seems apparent. Majority Opinion, at 450, 143 A.3d at 925. Section 906 bars convictions of more than one crime or crimes in the delineated circumstances.\nThe majority also finds the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201ccrimes\u201d in Section 906, as opposed to \u201ccrime\u201d to be clarifying. See Majority Opinion, at 450-51, 143 A.3d at 924-25. From my point of view, again, little grammatical difference arises out of the use of the plural form, and certainly not one so great as to remove the manifest ambiguity from the statute.\nIn terms of the policy, it seems to me that the Legislature may have contemplated both horizontal and vertical preclusion to mitigate some of the conceptual difficulties surrounding inchoate offenses by curtailing their proliferation in association with a single object crime. Notably, and in all events, the Sentencing Code has been structured to allow a range of serious penalties and to afford sentencing courts discretion to consider various factors, which would include whether there may have been multiple acts or instances of solicitation, for example. In Appellee\u2019s case, the status of solicitation of perjury as a third-degree felony (carrying a maximum prison sentence of seven years, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1108(8)), and solicitation of hindering prosecution as a misdemeanor of the second degree (implicating a maximum sentence of two years, see id. \u00a7 1104(2)), would have left Appellant exposed to an aggregate maximum sentence of at least eighteen years\u2019 imprisonment arising out of his various efforts to thwart his prosecution for DUI, even assuming that vertical preclusion would apply. See generally Commonwealth v. Hoke, 599 Pa. 587, 594, 962 A.2d 664, 668 (2009) (explaining that inchoate crimes have the same maximum sentences as the underlying crime, per Section 905(a) of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 905(a)).\nI recognize that the majority\u2019s construction of Section 906 is consistent with the approach of some other courts, see, e.g., State v. Badillo, 260 Or.App. 218, 317 P.3d 315, 320 (2013), and, in fact, may reflect the more likely underlying objective of the drafters of the Model Penal Code who originally formulated the proscription. See American Law Institute, Proposed Official Draft of the Model Penal Code \u00a7 5.05(3) (1962). Nevertheless, left to my own devices, in the face of these sorts of material ambiguities in statutes implicating substantial criminal liabilities, I favor more consistent application of the rule of lenity, thus leaving it to the Legislature to make its intentions plain and explicit to the degree that it favors more punitive approaches. Accord, e.g., Commonwealth v. Booth, 564 Pa. 228, 234, 766 A.2d 843, 846 (2001) (explaining that, \u201cwhere ambiguity exists in the language of a penal statute, such language should be interpreted in the light most favorable to the accused\u201d (citing Commonwealth v. Wooten, 519 Pa. 45, 53, 545 A.2d 876, 879 (1988))). In this vein, I regard some of the courts\u2019 efforts to draw firm conclusions from ambiguous language to be problematic in their own right.\nFor the above reasons, I would affirm the order of the Superior Court.\n. As an example of the difficulty arising out of the litigation of multiple inchoate crimes, in the present case the Commonwealth was required to forego one of the conspiracy convictions given that the relevant offense had mistakenly been characterized as solicitation on the jury verdict slips deriving from the nineteen charged, interwoven, and substantially overlapping inchoate crimes. See N.T., May 17, 2010, at 3.\n. In this regard, Appellee was also convicted of conspiracy to solicit another person (Steven Boiler) to solicit Mroz to hinder the prosecution and commit perjury.\nParenthetically, while these sorts of double inchoate offenses may implicate conceptual legal questions in their own right, see, e.g., Ira P. Robbins, Double Inchoate Crimes, 26 Harv. J. on Legis. 1 (1989), Appellee has not challenged these conspiracy convictions on such terms.\n. In this respect, I note that the Commonwealth already has had the benefit of the Legislature\u2019s allowance for multiple, factually-overlapping crimes (solicitation of hindering prosecution and solicitation of perjury), arising out of the same conduct.\nI would also not rule out that some of Appellee\u2019s acts may have been directed toward separate crimes, i.e., variously, to incite his father, his mother, and Ms. Mroz to commit perjury. See generally Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 674, 39 A.3d 977, 983 (2012) (plurality) (discussing the \"narrow view of the object crime\u201d taken by the Court in past decisions). In this respect, I note only that the present appeal has not been framed in a way that requires sifting through fact-bound matters of this sort.\n. I acknowledge that there is a trend toward diluting the rule of lenity. See, e.g., Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 138-39, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 1919, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998) (indicating that the rule applies only when a criminal statute contains a \u201cgrievous ambiguity or uncertainty,\u201d and \"only if, after seizing eveiything from which aid can be derived,\u201d the Court \u201ccan make 'no more than a guess as to what Congress intended\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted)). For my own part, given the substantial liberty interests involved, I remain a closer adherent to the more traditional formulations. See, e.g., United States v. Wiltberger, 18 U.S. 76, 105, 5 Wheat. 76, 5 L.Ed. 37 (1820) (\"probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take.\u201d).",
