        "text": "OPINION\nJustice DOUGHERTY.\nIn this appeal by the Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) from a grant of mandamus relief, we revisit an issue that evenly divided the Court in Commonwealth v. Gehris, 618 Pa. 104, 54 A.3d 862 (2012), concerning the proper construction of the lifetime-registration triggering language \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d in Pennsylvania\u2019s former sex offender registration statute, Megan\u2019s Law II (formerly codified at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1) (superseded)). In accordance with the Gehris Opinion in Support of Reversal (OISR), as supplemented by our analysis below, we hold the provision, considered in the context of the statutory language as a whole, is amenable to two reasonable constructions; and we further hold the statute, which sets forth a graduated scheme of registration, encompasses a recidivist philosophy. We therefore conclude the statute requires an act, a conviction, and a subsequent act to trigger lifetime registration for multiple offenses otherwise triggering a ten-year period of registration. Accordingly, we affirm.\nSection 9795.1 provided, in relevant part, as follows:\n(a) Ten-year registration. \u2014 Except as set forth in subsection (a.l) or (b), the following individuals shall be required to register with the Pennsylvania State Police for a period of ten years:\n(1) Individuals convicted of any of the following offenses:\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2901 (relating to kidnapping) where the victim is a minor.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2910 (relating to luring a child into a motor vehicle or structure).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3124.2 (relating to institutional sexual assault).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126 (relating to indecent assault) where the offense is graded as a misdemeanor of the first degree or higher.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4802 (relating to incest) where the victim is 12 years of age or older but under 18 years of age. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5902(b) or (b.l) (relating to prostitution and related offenses) where the actor promotes the prostitution of a minor.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5908(a)(3), (4), (5) or (6) (relating to obscene and other sexual materials and performances) where the victim is a minor.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6312 (relating to sexual abuse of children).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6318 (relating to unlawful contact with minor).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6320 (relating to sexual exploitation of children).\n(2) Individuals convicted of an attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit any of the offenses under paragraph (1) or subsection (b)(2).\n\u2021 \u215c \u215c\n(b) Lifetime registration.-The following individuals shall be subject to lifetime registration:\n(1) An individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a).\n(2) Individuals convicted:\n(i) in this Commonwealth of the following offenses:\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3121 (relating to rape).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123 (relating to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3124.1 (relating to sexual assault).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3125 (relating to aggravated indecent assault).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4302 (relating to incest) when the victim is under 12 years of age.\n\u215c * *\n(3) Sexually violent predators.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a) \u2014 (b) (emphases added). Under both Megan\u2019s Law II and SORNA, PSP is tasked with maintaining Pennsylvania\u2019s sex offender registry. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.1(1) (Megan\u2019s Law II) (superseded); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.16 (SOR-NA).\nThis dispute arose after appellee had completed his sentence for the underlying crimes. Proceeding under a belief he was subject to a ten-year SORNA registration period (a belief shared at sentencing by the court and the prosecutor), appel-lee filed a Petition for Review in the Nature of a Complaint in Mandamus in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction on July 19, 2012, shortly before expiration of that period. The petition sought to compel PSP to correct appellee\u2019s sexual offender registration status from lifetime registrant to ten-year registrant and to remove him from the registry when the ten-year period expired. In the course of litigation, the parties attached exhibits including the transcripts from appel-lee\u2019s guilty plea and sentencing proceedings; ultimately, the parties stipulated discovery was unnecessary and cross-motions for summary judgment were filed.\nThe facts respecting sex offender registration are thus undisputed. Appellee was twenty-one years old when he met the sixteen-year-old female victim on-line late in 1999. Appel-lee developed a relationship with the victim which ultimately resulted in a series of sexual encounters. The age of consent in Pennsylvania is sixteen, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3122.1; thus, the consensual sexual relationship itself was not criminal. However, during the course of the relationship, appellee persuaded the victim to take and transmit sexually explicit photographs of herself and he also photographed the two engaging in sexual acts. It is a crime to photograph or cause to be photographed a minor engaging in consensual sex and causing a minor to take sexual photographs of herself. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6312(d).\nAfter the victim\u2019s father found sexually explicit photographs on the victim\u2019s computer and reported them to police, appellee admitted to the sexual relationship, as well as the explicit photographs taken by him and taken by the victim at his request.\nIn December 2000, a criminal complaint was filed in Montgomery County charging appellee, a first-time offender, with seven counts of sexual abuse of children (photographing, videotaping, depicting on computer, or filming sexual acts), twenty counts of sexual abuse of children (possession of child pornography, relating to other images of child pornography found on his computer), and single counts of unlawful contact with a minor, corruption of minors, and criminal solicitation.\nOn October 5, 2001, appellee entered an open guilty plea to single counts of sexual abuse of children and unlawful contact with a minor \u2014 each of which was an enumerated offense for purposes of Megan\u2019s Law II reporting under Section 9795.1(a) \u2014 and corruption of minors, which was not. The remaining charges were withdrawn. Sentencing was deferred for a pre-sentence report and sexual offender assessment.\nOn February 28, 2002, appellee was sentenced to concurrent 5- to 23-month terms of imprisonment on the first two counts and a consecutive five-year probationary term for corruption of minors. As required by Megan\u2019s Law II, the court also informed appellee a collateral consequence of his convictions required him to register as a sex offender. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.3. The parties and the trial court believed appellee was subject to a ten-year registration period, not lifetime registration. See N.T. 2/28/02 at 29-30, 45. Thus, appellee\u2019s mother testified, \u201cMy son made a mistake, a terrible, terrible error in his life that\u2019s affected him. He\u2019s been punished. He will be punished. He has a ten-year reporting component to this punishment[,]\u201d to which the trial court replied, \u201cI know.\u201d Id. at 29-30. The trial prosecutor confirmed, \u201cHe\u2019s now facing a ten-year registration for Megan\u2019s Law. That\u2019s true. But why is he facing this ten-year registration? He is because what he did is a serious offense.\u201d Id. at 45. In addition, appellee was found not to be a sexually violent predator (SVP), and thus he was not subject to lifetime registration under the provision applicable to SVPs. Id. at 59-60; see 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9795.1(b)(3). The court further found appellee was unlikely to reoffend. N.T. 2/28/02 at 63, 68. Finally, the court advised appellee of the potential criminal consequences of the registration requirement: he would commit a felony of the third degree if he failed to fulfill his obligations under Megan\u2019s Law II. Id. at 60.\nAfter appellee was released from prison, he duly registered as a sex offender with the PSP on August 2, 2002; he then successfully completed all aspects of his criminal sentence and complied with all aspects of his reporting obligation. See Appellee\u2019s Petition for Review at 3; Appellant\u2019s Preliminary Objections at 1. Appellee contacted PSP and requested removal of his name from the registry after August 2, 2012, but PSP refused, claiming his guilty plea to both sexual abuse of children and unlawful contact with a minor triggered lifetime registration under Section 9795.1(b)(1), because he was \u201can individual with two or more convictions\u201d of offenses listed in subsection (a). See Appellee\u2019s Petition for Review at 4; Appellant\u2019s Preliminary Objections at 2; Appellant\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment at 5-6.\nPSP\u2019s refusal to remove appellee\u2019s name from the registry led to this mandamus action. A divided en banc Commonwealth Court, in a published opinion authored by then-President Judge Pellegrini, granted appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied PSP\u2019s cross-motion. The court accordingly directed PSP to change appellee\u2019s designation as a lifetime registrant to a ten-year registrant. A.S. v. Pennsylvania State Police, 87 A.3d 914, 923 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014) (en banc).\nThe majority below characterized the question as involving whether appellee\u2019s guilty plea to two separate crimes involving photographs of the same minor constituted one or two convictions for purposes of Section 9795.1(b)(1). The court then examined Gehris, where the evenly-divided Court affirmed a determination of lifetime registration by operation of law, with the dispositive order accompanied by an Opinion in Support of Affirmance (OISA) by Justice Todd (joined by former Justices Eakin and McCaffery) and an OISR by former Chief Justice Castille (joined by Justices Saylor (now Chief Justice) and Baer).\nAfter summarizing those opinions, which will be more fully described below, the court deemed the Gehris OISR to be more persuasive. In the court\u2019s view, failure to adopt the OISR approach would render the distinction between the ten-year registration in subsection (a) and the lifetime requirement in subsection (b) \u201cmeaningless,\u201d since every event involving a minor taking his or her own picture could support multiple charges and convictions. In addition, the court opined, the OISR interpretation fostered the purpose of the statute, \u201cwhich allows a person to reform\u201d in the ten-year registration period, and provided a bright-line for administration. A S'., 87 A.8d at 922. The court then concluded appel-lee\u2019s conduct arose from a single criminal episode and one \u201clogically related act,\u201d id. at 922 <& n. 11, citing and discussing Commonwealth v. Hude, 500 Pa. 482, 458 A.2d 177 (1983), rendering it one conviction, leading to a ten-year registration period. AS., 87 A.3d at 923.\nJudge Brobson authored a dissenting opinion, which Judge Leadbetter joined. The dissent noted the majority\u2019s interpretation was in tension with the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Merolla, 909 A.2d 337 (Pa.Super.2006), and subsequent decisions applying Merolla, including the unreported panel decision in Gehris. The dissent recognized \u201cit may be a reach to pronounce the law on this issue settled finally,\u201d but noted the question was settled in the Superior Court and Merolla\u2019s statutory analysis, which was approved by the Gehris OISA, was sufficiently compelling not to adopt a contrary reading, which would lead to confusion. Id. at 929-30 (Brobson, J., dissenting).\nOn this direct appeal, the parties track and supplement the positions in the Gehris opinions concerning the proper construction of Section 9795.1(b)(1). PSP maintains any person with two or more qualifying convictions at the moment of sentencing, such as appellee, is subject to lifetime registration. PSP claims it properly interpreted and applied the statute and appellee had no right to mandamus relief.\nPSP develops the provision is clear and unambiguous, appel-lee pleaded guilty to two qualifying offenses, and the Commonwealth Court was obliged to look no further. PSP asserts the panel majority\u2019s finding that appellee\u2019s conduct was one logically related act, making his two convictions one, cannot be squared with the plain language of the statute or applicable canons of statutory construction. PSP notes the panel failed to account for the fact the phrase \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d is clear and unambiguous, as recognized in both Gehris opinions. PSP stresses a single prosecution and court proceeding may result in multiple convictions, as happened here. PSP believes the panel inserted words into the statute which are not present in the text.\nAssuming an ambiguity exists, PSP posits, the General Assembly clearly intended \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d to encompass multiple convictions from a single criminal episode. PSP relies on the fact the phrase \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d remained unchanged in Megan\u2019s Law III and SORNA, which it believes signaled the General Assembly approved of the existing interpretation of Section 9795.1(b)(1) by the intermediate court in Merolla.\nPSP finally contends the panel incorrectly relied on the recidivist philosophy as that philosophy is a sentencing concept having no bearing on the intent behind a non-penal public protection law. PSP posits the purpose of Megan\u2019s Law II was not to punish, but rather to protect the public, and so the recidivist philosophy is not a reliable guide to legislative intent. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 40, citing, e.g., Commonwealth v. Leidig, 598 Pa. 211, 956 A.2d 399, 404-06 (2008).\nAppellee responds that the Commonwealth Court, after considering the General Assembly\u2019s policy declaration and the graduated two-tier structure of the statute, correctly found Section 9795.1(b)(1) to be ambiguous when read in the context of the entirety of Megan\u2019s Law II. Appellee notes a single judgment of conviction follows from each criminal case regardless of the number of guilty counts. Appellee then contends Section 9795.1(b)(1) has a latent ambiguity, revealed when the plural term \u201cconvictions\u201d is applied to offenses arising from the same criminal act, episode, or course of conduct. He reasons the ambiguity does not arise from confusing words, but from a disparity between what the statute states is the desired result and a flawed methodology which could prevent that result if a term is construed in a certain way. Appellee maintains it is evident Section 9795.1(b)(1) is ambiguous as reasonable minds could, and have, disagreed about the meaning of \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d in the context of the overall statutory construct.\nAppellee further contends the panel majority correctly discerned a recidivist philosophy reflected in the statute. Appel-lee concedes the registration provision is facially remedial as its intent is to protect the public from sexual offenders. However, he notes the statute can also be interpreted as penal because an individual who fails to register is subject to criminal prosecution. Appellee notes, in a prosecution for failure to register, a penal context, he would have the benefit of the construction precept that penal statutes must be strictly construed, ie., the \u201crule of lenity.\u201d See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1). Relatedly, appellee contends, where an ambiguity exists in the language of a penal statute, such language should be interpreted in the light most favorable to the defendant. See Commonwealth v. Booth, 564 Pa. 228, 766 A.2d 843, 846 (2001).\nContinuing with this theory, appellee posits there is a need for uniformity in interpreting statutes having application in both penal and non-penal contexts. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 33-34, citing Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 11 n. 8, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (\u201cEven if \u00a7 16 [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16, defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d] lacked clarity on this point, we would be constrained to interpret any ambiguity in the statute in petitioner\u2019s favor. Although here we deal with \u00a7 16 in the deportation context, \u00a7 16 is a criminal statute, and it has both criminal and noncriminal applications. Because we must interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context, the rule of lenity applies.\u201d). Appellee argues the canon of strict construction logically should apply whether he is a ten-year or lifetime registrant and regardless of whether the issue arises related to correctly ascertaining his duty to register under Section 9795.1(b)(1) or in a prosecution for failure to register.\nIn appellee\u2019s view, the General Assembly\u2019s graduated, two-tier registration regime, in addition to creating ambiguity, is a compelling indication a recidivist philosophy infuses Section 9795.1(b)(1). Appellee posits the tiers were designed to segregate less serious, first-time offenders from more serious, violent, or repeat offenders and establish dramatically different periods of supervision. Appellee further notes many, if not all, of the ten-year registration offenses involve crimes where a single non-violent episode may easily generate multiple violations. Appellee concludes that, to prevent evisceration of the two-tier structure, the Court should affirm that Section 9795.1(b)(1) does not apply to offenders whose two first-time convictions arose from a single charging document and a single, non-violent course of criminal conduct.\nThe issue involves statutory interpretation, which is a question of law, and our review is plenary and non-deferential. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Conklin, 587 Pa. 140, 897 A.2d 1168, 1175 (2006). In such cases, the Statutory Construction Act directs courts to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly. Id., citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cThe statute\u2019s plain language generally provides the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d See, e.g., McGrory v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 591 Pa. 56, 915 A.2d 1155, 1158 (2007); Commonwealth v. Gilmour Mfg. Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003). It is only when statutory text is determined to be ambiguous that we may go beyond the text and look to other considerations to discern legislative intent. \u201cWhere statutory or regulatory language is ambiguous, this Court may resolve the ambiguity by considering, inter alia, the following: the occasion and necessity for the statute or regulation; the circumstances under which it was enacted; the mischief to be remedied; the object to be attained; the former law, if any, including other statutes or regulations upon the same or similar subjects; the consequences of a particular interpretation; and administrative interpretations of such statute.\u201d Freedom Med. Supply, Inc. v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Co., 635 Pa. 86, 131 A.3d 977, 984 (2016), citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c).\nIn this appeal, we have the advantage of not writing upon a blank slate: the Gehris OISA and OISR each offered a developed, reasoned expression concerning the meaning of Section 9795.1(b)(l)\u2019s text \u201c[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a).\u201d The opinions agreed there was no facial ambiguity in that sentence. See Gehris, 54 A.8d at 862 (OISA) (stressing \u201cclear and unambiguous language chosen by the legislature\u201d); id. at 874-75 (OISR) (\u201cIn and of itself, subsection (b)(1) ... is not ambiguous or unclear.\u201d) In addition, the OISA acknowledged the OISR offered \u201ca reasoned, plausible, policy-based rationale for interpreting [subsection] (b)(1) as reflecting a recidivist philosophy.\u201d Id. at 862 (OISA). The OISA concluded, however, the plain language of subsection (b)(1) \u2014 which, unlike other statutes where a recidivist philosophy had been discerned\u2014 contained \u201cno temporal separation\u201d between commission of the enumerated offenses, constrained the Court from concluding a recidivist philosophy animated the provision. Id. at 866-68.\nFor its part, the Gehris OISR reviewed prior cases, both from this Court and the United States Supreme Court, involving the recidivist philosophy, Because we are ultimately persuaded by the core of the OISR\u2019s ensuing analysis (as supplemented by additional points developed below), we simply reproduce its essence here:\n[W]e are satisfied that Section 9795.1, which sets forth a graduated scheme for Megan\u2019s Law registration, similar in nature to the graduated schemes discussed in this Court\u2019s prior case law, encompasses the recidivist philosophy in addition to its perhaps more obvious goals of public protection and deterrence. Of course, registration may not be punitive for purposes of the constitutional protections afforded to offenders, as this Court concluded in [Commonwealth v.] Williams [, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962 (2003) ]. Nevertheless, registration obviously has serious and restrictive consequences for the offender, including prosecution if the requirement is violated. Registration can also affect the offender\u2019s ability to earn a livelihood, his housing arrangements and options, and his reputation. See also Fross v. County of Allegheny, 610 Pa. 421, 20 A.3d 1193 (2011).\nThe \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d language in subsection (b) seems clear and unambiguous on the surface. But if Section 9795.1 is viewed as a whole and the General Assembly\u2019s legislative findings and declaration of policy at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791 are read closely, it is clear that the primary concern is with sexually violent predators. Considering the nine subsections in Section 9791, the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d appears nine times, particularly in the provision addressing repeat offenders: \u201csexually violent predators pose a high risk of engaging in further offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments and that protection of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791(a)(2). References to nonviolent offenders are comparatively few, just four in all, and two of these pertain specifically to recent amendments accounting for the circumstance of released \u201coffenders\u201d who may be homeless or without a \u201cfixed place of habitation.\u201d See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791(a)(1) & (b)(3); see also Commonwealth v. Wilgus [615 Pa. 32], 40 A.3d 1201 (Pa.2012).\nIt is evident that in drafting Section 9795.1, the General Assembly meant to set up a graduated registration scheme. In this tiered approach, more serious (primarily violent) offenders and \u201ctrue\u201d recidivists who squander a given opportunity to reform are understandably subject to lifetime requirements. By contrast, lesser, first-time offenders, especially those who are nonviolent, receive an opportunity for rehabilitation and eventual freedom from the requirements if they \u201cstay on the path\u201d for ten years.\nWithout in any way condoning the criminal conduct that led appellant to his current circumstances, we would conclude that the record in this case directs application of the ten-year registration requirement. Appellant\u2019s two Megan\u2019s Law offenses were nonviolent, perhaps triggered by situational problems in his marriage and career, and arose out of the same course of conduct, which ultimately did not result in direct harm to any actual victims. Appellant had no criminal past, much less a history of Megan\u2019s Law offenses, and was taken into custody without resisting. In open court, he expressed remorse and regret and accepted responsibility for his actions. He voluntarily undertook psychotherapy and has embraced the treatment, was not found to be a sexually violent predator and, in fact, was described by a former SOAB [Sexual Offenders Assessment Board] member as a good candidate for rehabilitation. It is true that appellant was convicted of \u201ctwo or more\u201d Megan\u2019s Law subsection (a) offenses, and without consideration of how this statutory scheme falls within the sphere of [the] recidivist philosophy legislation detailed above, a strict, mechanical application of Section 9795.1(b) would result in imposition of the lifetime registration requirement. But, we would conclude that Section 9795.1 embodies the recidivist philosophy and reflects a belief that f\u00edrst-time and lesser offenders are capable of reform and rehabilitation if given an opportunity to do so under the still-punitive aegis of relatively lighter discipline, as well as the threat of harsher treatment next time, should there be a next time....\nGehris, 54 A.3d at 878-79 (OISR).\nTo this analysis, we add the following points. A statute is ambiguous when there are at least two reasonable interpretations of the text. See Freedom Med. Supply, 131 A.3d at 984; Warrantech Consumer Prod. Servs. v. Reliance Ins. Co. in Liquidation, 626 Pa. 218, 96 A.3d 346, 354-55 (2014); Delaware County v. First Union Corp., 605 Pa. 547, 992 A.2d 112, 118 (2010). In construing and giving effect to the text, \u201c\u2018we should not interpret statutory words in isolation, but must read them with reference to the context in which they appear.\u2019 \u201d Roethlein v. Portnoff Law Assoc., 623 Pa. 1, 81 A.3d 816, 822 (2013), citing Mishoe v. Erie Ins. Co., 573 Pa. 267, 824 A.2d 1153, 1155 (2003). Accord Commonwealth v. Office of Open Records, 628 Pa. 163, 103 A.3d 1276, 1285 (2014) (party\u2019s argument that statutory language is ambiguous \u201cdepends upon improperly viewing it in isolation;\u201d when language is properly read together and in conjunction \u2022with rest of statute, legislative intent is plain). The United States Supreme Court also takes a contextual approach in assessing statutes and in determining predicate ambiguity. See generally King v. Burwell, \u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 2489, 192 L.Ed.2d 483 (2015) (\u201cIf the statutory language is plain, we must enforce it according to its terms. But oftentimes the meaning \u2014 or ambiguity \u2014 of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context. So when deciding whether the language is plain, we must read the words in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Yates v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct 1074, 1081-82, 191 L.Ed.2d 64 (2015) (\u201cWhether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words. Rather, \u2018[tjhe plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\u2019 Ordinarily, a word\u2019s usage accords with its dictionary definition. In law as in life, however, the same words, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things.\u201d (internal citations omitted)).\nNeither the OISA nor the OISR in Gehris cited this precept advising a contextual approach to assessing legislative intent and statutory ambiguity. The OISR\u2019s approach in considering the overall statute, including legislative policy findings, in ascertaining the legislative intent and finding Section 9795.1 to be ambiguous is consonant with that principle. Compare Roethlein, 81 A.3d at 822-24 (disapproving lower court\u2019s focus on two words (\u201cexcess charges\u201d) in Loan Interest and Protection Law, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 7101-7505, in isolation; in discerning plain meaning of statute, Court considered definitional provisions, other substantive provisions, and statute\u2019s title and preamble, ultimately concluding language was not ambiguous).\nSecond, also respecting whether the language, considered in context, is reasonably amenable to multiple interpretations, there is a cautionary factor here that was not present in Gehris or Merolla. Those cases involved appeals from the judgment of sentence; the issue of ten years versus lifetime registration was actually contested at the sentencing proceeding. Sentencing in this case occurred over four years before Merolla and there was no dispute: the prosecutor, appellee and the trial judge all believed this first-time offender, who was not a sexually violent predator, was subject to ten-year registration. The dispute here arose only when PSP, ten years later, and after Merolla had been decided, acted upon a different interpretation of the text.\nThe implications of Megan\u2019s Law II figured in trials and guilty pleas on a daily basis in the Commonwealth. The fact that it never occurred to those in the trenches in this particular case in 2002 that a first-time, non-violent and non-SVP offender could be subject to anything but the lower-tier period of registration provides some further measure of support to the conclusion that the provision, considered in context, is at least reasonably amenable to multiple interpretations.\nThird, although we have indeed held the registration provision is not punitive for purposes of constitutional challenges, the circumstances here suggest the question of strict construction may be more complex and nuanced than the Court had reason to appreciate previously. Whether the statute is deemed a penal one subject to the rule of lenity and strict construction or not (we do not deny the force in PSP\u2019s reliance upon existing authority), the fact is that interpretations \u2014 and predictions \u2014 of the statute\u2019s effect have to be made by different persons and entities at different times: prosecutors in charging decisions, defense counsel in rendering advice, defendants in determining courses of action, trial judges in imposing sentence, courts on appeal, PSP in enforcement, and then the defense, prosecution and courts repeated again if the defendant is charged with violating his or her registration obligation. Given the obvious burden of registration and the potentially serious criminal consequences of a lapse, as recognized in the Gehris OISR, 54 A.3d at 878, to state the law is not \u201cpenal\u201d is little answer to a defendant who had good reason to believe he had done all required of him, only to find himself staring at lifetime registration. At a minimum, the circumstances suggest appellee\u2019s argument premised upon the imperative for consistent interpretation of a statute having both penal and non-penal consequences, as recognized by the United States Supreme Court in Leocal, supra, has more force than the Court had reason to believe in addressing questions of strict construction and the rule of lenity in other contexts, including the narrower context presented in Gehris.\u2019\nFourth and finally, and returning to the subject of predicate ambiguity, we note there is some validity in the point made in the dissent below that it would be absurd and unreasonable if a single act, giving rise to a single prosecution yielding two convictions for overlapping predicate offenses, subjected an offender to lifetime registration.\nIn conclusion, we hold the statute requires an act, a conviction, and a subsequent act to trigger lifetime registration for multiple offenses otherwise triggering a ten-year period of registration. Accordingly, the award of mandamus relief is hereby affirmed.\nFormer Justice EAKIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nChief Justice SAYLOR and Justices BAER and DONOHUE join the opinion.\nJustice DONOHUE files a concurring opinion.\nJustice TODD files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice WECHT files a dissenting opinion.\n. Megan\u2019s Law II was succeeded by Megan\u2019s Law III (Act 152 of 2004), which in turn was superseded by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.10-9799.41, which became effective over ten years after appellee's registration obligation began. The issue of whether appellee is subject to lifetime registration is a Megan's Law II question, not a SORNA question.\nThe Court has granted review in a separate appeal involving the same basic provision, as retained under SORNA, Commonwealth v. Lutz-Morrison, 636 Pa. 395, 143 A.3d 891, 2016 WL 4273555 (2016), also decided today.\n. The Gehris OISR explained: ''[t]he essence of the recidivist philosophy is to afford first-time offenders (or offenders convicted of less serious offenses) some amount of time within which to modify their behavior away from criminality. Should they fail to take advantage of the opportunity, and transgress a second time or more, the \u2018next\u2019 sentence will be more severe.\" Gehris, 54 A.3d at 875 (OISR by Castille, C J., joined by Saylor and Baer, JJ.).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6312(b), 6312(d), 6318(a)(5), 6301(a)(l)(i), and 902(a), respectively.\n. The issue in Merolla was raised in the Commonwealth's appeal from the judgment of sentence, where the Commonwealth argued Merolla\u2019s plea of nolo contendere to two separate counts of indecent assault constituted two convictions, requiring lifetime registration. The panel looked to criminal sentencing decisions of this Court involving the recidivist philosophy and the \"three strikes statute,\" see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714; stressed Section 9714(a)(2) had language referring to the person having \"previously\" been convicted, while Megan\u2019s Law II had no such language; and stressed Section 9714 was a penal provision, while the reporting requirements in Megan\u2019s Law II are directed at public safety. Based on its \u201cliteral\u201d reading, the panel concluded lifetime registration was required, stressing such \u201cheightened registration is not an additional punishment.\" Merolla, 909 A.2d at 345-47. Notably, the panel did not discuss the counter-arguments, if any, forwarded by Merolla.\n. Notably, the dissent found appellee\u2019s second argument, which the majority did not address given its disposition, distinguished Gehris. Appellee argued the Legislature could not have intended the difference between ten-year and lifetime registration to depend on the number of existing convictions in a circumstance where the offender engaged in a single act resulting in multiple convictions. A.S., 87 A.3d at 931. Specifically, appellee argued the elements of the two predicate offenses of sexual abuse of children and unlawful contact overlap in such a way that an individual could commit both offenses by a single act, such as here, where he contacted the victim to cause her to photograph herself engaging in a sexual act. Id. The dissent opined it would be unreasonable and absurd to hold an offender was subject to lifetime registration where the offender engaged in a single act, but concluded a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the two offenses here involved such a single act. Therefore, the dissent found the question could not be resolved on summary judgment and the case should be remanded. Id. at 931-34.\n. PSP, which filed a reply brief, does not specifically respond to appellee's reliance upon Leocal, but repeats that Megan\u2019s Law II was simply not a penal law subject to strict construction. In addition, PSP notes the rule of lenity was invoked by the dissent in Commonwealth v. Wilgus, 615 Pa. 32, 40 A.3d 1201, 1210 (2012) (Castille, C.J., dissenting, joined by Baer, J.), a case involving prosecution for failing to register, but the Wilgus majority did not discuss the rule.\n. The action below sounded in mandamus, which \"lies only 'to compel official performance of a ministerial act or mandatory duty where there is a clear legal right in the plaintiff, a corresponding duty in the defendant, and a lack of any other adequate and appropriate remedy at law.\u2019 \u201d See Crozer Chester Med. Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 610 Pa. 459, 22 A.3d 189, 193 (2011), quoting Delaware River Port Auth. v. Thornburgh, 508 Pa. 11, 493 A.2d 1351, 1355-56 (1985).\nPSP does not dispute mandamus relief is appropriate if we were to sustain appellee\u2019s reading of the statute. The question thus focuses narrowly on the proper construction.\n. See Commonwealth v. McClintic, 589 Pa. 465, 909 A.2d 1241 (2006) (construing \"three strikes\" provision in Sentencing Code, i.e., 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9714); Commonwealth v. Shiffler, 583 Pa. 478, 879 A.2d 185 (2005) (same); Commonwealth v. Dickerson, 533 Pa. 294, 621 A.2d 990 (1993) (same); Commonwealth v, Jarowecki, 604 Pa. 242, 985 A.2d 955 (2009) (construing Crimes Code grading provision governing possession of child pornography, i.e., 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6312).\n. The OISA also explained why it concluded the statute was not a penal provision subject to strict construction in favor of the defendant. Geh-ris, 54 A.3d at 865 (OISA).\n. In addition to discussing the sentencing cases cited in the OISA (Dickerson, Shiffler, McClintic and Jarowecki), the OISR briefly noted Supreme Court opinions supporting that certain sentencing schemes \"imply a recidivist philosophy.\u201d Gehris, 54 A.3d at 875, citing Sykes v. United States, 564 U.S. 1, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L,Ed.2d 60 (2011); United States v. Rodriquez, 553 U.S. 377, 128 S.Ct. 1783, 170 L.Ed.2d 719 (2008).\n. In a footnote, Justice Todd's dissent posits that our reading of the statute means that an individual who lures a child into a motor vehicle, kidnaps the child, and forces the child to participate in prostitution and child pornography would need only register as a sex offender for ten years. Dissenting op. at 432-33, n. 1, 143 A.3d at 914, n. 1. However, Section 9795.1 makes clear an individual deemed to be a sexually violent predator is subject to lifetime registration. Furthermore, 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9795.4 states, \"[ajfter conviction, but before sentencing, a court shall order an individual convicted of an offense specified in Section 9795.1 (relating to registration) to be assessed by the board.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9795.4(a). Included in those specified crimes are all the crimes referenced by the dissent. 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9795.1. Following the assessment by the Board, the district attorney may request a hearing allowing the court to determine whether the Commonwealth has proved the offender to be a sexually violent predator by clear and convincing evidence. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4(e). Thus, contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, those convicted of multiple crimes which normally would be subject to only a ten year registration period may indeed be subject to lifetime registration regardless of this decision; indeed, the dissent\u2019s hypothetical, properly analyzed, shows the balanced, graduated operation of the scheme.\n. It is true the registration term was not part of a negotiated plea, but the shared understanding may have factored into counsel\u2019s advice to his client respecting entry of an open plea. The question of whether a negotiated plea agreement which included obligations under sexual offender registration legislation is enforceable under SORNA is pending before the Court in Commonwealth v. Martinez, Nos. 30, 32 & 34 MAP 2015 (argued the same day as this appeal) (construing SORNA\u2019s effect upon such plea agreements reached under Megan\u2019s Law II). Appellee does not forward a contract-based argument similar to the one at issue in Martinez.\n. We caution we do not purport to resolve the question whether registration provisions such as this one warrant strict construction, but merely seek to highlight points revealed here, which were not made apparent in Gehris.\n. We respect that Justice Todd remains unconvinced by the analysis in the Gehris OISR, as supplemented by tire Court today. However, we obviously disagree with our learned colleague\u2019s suggestion, Dissenting op. at 432, 143 A.3d at 913-14, that we have not explained how the language of Section 9795.1(b)(1), when viewed in context, is ambiguous. See Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878-80 (OISR) (explaining a close reading of Section 9795.1, as a whole, and the legislative findings and declaration of policy at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791, make clear the primary concern of the statute is with sexually violent predators and not with nonviolent offenders).\n. Contrary to PSP\u2019s position, we do not believe the General Assembly\u2019s passage of virtually identical language in SORNA signals approval of Merolla or counsels a different result. As PSP otherwise recognizes, the Statutory Construction Act provides such a presumption regarding legislative intent may arise \"when a court of last resort\u201d has construed statutory language and the General Assembly, in a subsequent enactment, opts not to change the language. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(4); Commonwealth v. Wanamaker, 450 Pa. 77, 296 A.2d 618, 624 (1972). Merolla was not a decision by this Court. Furthermore, the stated purpose of SORNA was not directed to PSP\u2019s consideration, but primarily focused upon bringing Pennsylvania sex offender registration law into compliance with the federal Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.10; see also In re J.B., 630 Pa. 408, 107 A.3d 1, 3 (2014). Additionally, PSP cites no affirmative indicator, in the legislative history or otherwise, that the General Assembly was focused upon, or intending to approve, Merolla. Finally, for the reasons stated in the text, we do not believe the \"literal\u201d reading adopted in Merolla accurately reflects the legislative intent.",

Majority Op. at 406, 143 A.3d at 897-98. The Majority further finds that the term \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d must be interpreted with deference to the recidivist philosophy underlying the statute, a philosophy that is made plain by the graduated scheme of registration the legislature set forth, among other statutory features. Id. Finally, the Majority holds that \u201cthe statute requires an act, a conviction, and a subsequent act to trigger lifetime registration for multiple offenses otherwise triggering a ten-year period of registration,\u201d and affirms the award of mandamus relief. Id. I join the Majority as to each of these points, but I write separately to explain the full import, in my view, of the finding that Megan\u2019s Law II embodies a recidivist philosophy, and to explain that our holding does not allow an individual whose first time convictions arise out of multiple first tier (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a) (repealed)) offenses to escape lifetime registration if the circumstances otherwise warrant it.\nFirst, as this Court has explained, in several contexts, a statute embodying a recidivist philosophy evinces a legislative intent \u201cto punish more severely offenders who have persevered in criminal activity despite the theoretically beneficial effects of penal discipline.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Shiffler, 583 Pa. 478, 879 A.2d 185 (2005) (applying recidivist interpretation to three strikes sentencing law and concluding that defendant\u2019s prior plea of guilty to three counts of burglary counted as only one prior offense); accord Commonwealth v. McClintic, 589 Pa. 465, 909 A.2d 1241 (2006) (again applying recidivist interpretation to three strikes law); Commonwealth v. Jarowecki, 604 Pa. 242, 985 A.2d 955 (2009) (applying recidivist philosophy to prohibit sentence enhancement under possession of child pornography statute for multiple simultaneous convictions).\nIn each of the aforementioned cases, application of a recidivist philosophy meant that \u201cenhanced punishment [could not] be imposed unless all of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions preceded commission of the principal offense, and each prior offense and conviction occurred in chronological sequence.\u201d See Jarowecki, 985 A.2d at 962, n. 11 (quoting Cynthia L. Sletto, Annotation, Chronological or Procedural Sequence of Former Convictions as Affecting Enhancement of Penalty Under Habitual Offender Statutes, 7 A.L.R. 5th 263, \u00a7 2[a] (1992)). That is to say, \u201ceach offense, following the first, must have been committed after the defendant\u2019s conviction of the immediately preceding offense.\u201d Id.\nAlthough a recidivist philosophy typically animates a purely penal statute, it should be given the same effect where, as here, it underlies a statute with both penal and non-penal consequences. See Majority Op. at 421-22, 143 A.3d at 907 (citing Commonwealth v. Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878-79 (OISR)). Furthermore, the philosophy should be given its full effect regardless of whether a defendant is charged for one act or multiple acts, regardless of whether the conduct comprises a one criminal episode or many, and regardless of the number of victims, direct or indirect. Pursuant to a recidivist philosophy, an \u201coffender is deemed incorrigible not so much because he or she has sinned more than once, but because the offender has demonstrated, through persistent criminal behavior, that he or she is not susceptible to the reforming influence of the conviction process.\u201d Shiffler, 879 A.2d at 195. The Majority\u2019s sequential interpretation \u2014 requiring an act, followed by a conviction, followed by another act \u2014 is faithful to this philosophy.\nNext, contrary to the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Todd (Dissenting Op. (Todd, J.) at n. 1), uniform application of the recidivist philosophy to the registration statute does not afford an unwarranted \u201cvolume discount\u201d to registrants who have \u201csinned more than once.\u201d See Shiffler, 879 A.2d at 195. The Commonwealth\u2019s discretion to bring multiple charges against a defendant, and the trial court\u2019s discretion to impose multiple sentences, which may run consecutively as opposed to concurrently, if the trial court sees fit, ensures that a defendant will be punished based on the severity of his conduct and the quantity of his acts. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Davidson, 595 Pa. 1, 938 A.2d 198, 221 (2007) (holding that \u201ccharging, trying, convicting and sentencing defendant for multiple counts of possession of child pornography\u201d is proper because each image constitutes a distinct act and abuse of a child).\nMoreover, all registration-eligible offenders (including first tier offenders) are required to undergo a sexually violent predator assessment. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4. Pursuant to the statute, anyone, after assessment, deemed to be a sexually violent predator, even if he or she has been convicted of offenses that otherwise trigger a ten-year registration period, is subject to life registration. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1 (repealed). This safeguard is consistent with the statute\u2019s overall purpose and recidivist philosophy, reflected by its graduated registration scheme, to subject to lifetime registration only the \u201cmore serious (primarily violent) offenders and \u2018true\u2019 recidivists who squander a given opportunity to reform.\u201d See Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878-79 (OISR). Justice Todd\u2019s view that Section 9795.1(b)(1) cannot possibly apply solely to recidivists \u2014 because such an interpretation would allow a serial, violent sex offender, who happens to evade prosecution in between the commission of his criminal acts, to avoid lifetime registration \u2014 is without merit, given the existence of Section 9795.1(b)(3). See Dissenting Op. (Todd, J.) at n. 1.\n. Section 9795.4 provides:\n(a) Order for assessment. \u2014 After conviction but before sentencing, a court shall order an individual convicted of an offense specified in section 9795.1 (relating to registration) to be assessed by the board. The order for an assessment shall be sent to the administrative officer of the board within ten days of the date of conviction.\n(b) Assessment. \u2014 Upon receipt from the court of an order for an assessment, a member of the board as designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment of the individual to determine if the individual should be classified as a sexually violent predator. The board shall establish standards for evaluations and for evaluators conducting the assessments. An assessment shall include, but not be limited to, an examination of the following [factors].\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4 (repealed).\n.

        "text": "Justice TODD,\ndissenting.\nAs the majority recognizes, this appeal is primarily a reconsideration of the issue this Court reviewed, but could not authoritatively resolve, in Commonwealth v. Gehris, 618 Pa. 104, 54 A.3d 862 (2012): the meaning of Megan\u2019s Law II\u2019s provision that \u201c[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a) \u201cshall be subject to lifetime registration\u201d as a sexual offender. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1). I authored the Opinion in Support of Affirmance (\u201cOISA\u201d) in Gehris, expressing the view that the foregoing provision clearly and unambiguously provides that any individual who accrues multiple convictions for offenses set forth in Section 9795.1(a) is subject to lifetime registration as a sexual offender. Gehris, 54 A.3d at 862 (OISA). Then-Chief Justice Castille authored the Opinion in Support of Reversal (\u201cOISR\u201d) in Gehris, reasoning that this provision, read in light of Megan\u2019s Law II\u2019s remaining provisions, incorporates a \u201crecidivist philosophy\u201d and, therefore, provides that only an individual who is convicted of one or more offenses set forth in Section 9795.1(a), and subsequently reoffends and is convicted again of one or more offenses set forth in Section 9795.1(a), is subject to lifetime registration as a sexual offender. Gehris, 54 A.3d at 868 (OISR). Because I continue to view the salient statutory provisions as clear and unambiguous, and because, in my view, Section 9795.1 incorporates no such recidivist philosophy, the analyses of the OISR in Gehris and the majority hereinabove notwithstanding, I respectfully dissent.\nAs I expressed in my OISA in Gehris, in my view, Section 9795.1(b)(1) clearly and unambiguously provides that any individual who accrues multiple convictions of offenses set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a) is subject to lifetime registration as a sexual offender:\nThe plain language of Section 9795.1(b)(1) specifies: \u201cThe following individuals shall be subject to lifetime registration: (1) An individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a).\u201d This language, when viewed in accordance with its commonly understood and ordinary meaning, requires any individual who is convicted two or more times of the particular offenses set forth in subsection (a) to register for life. Relevant to the question of whether the legislature intended to require lifetime registration in situations where the multiple convictions stemmed from acts which were part of one criminal episode, I deem the legislature, through the use of the unadorned language, \u201c[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a),\u201d to have elected not to require any particular sequential or temporal ordering of the multiple convictions in order for the lifetime registration requirements to apply. Rather, the legislature simply mandated that, at the point in time at which a defendant acquires two or more convictions for specified sexual offenses against children, the registration requirement is triggered.\nGehris, 54 A.3d at 866 (OISA). The majority recognizes that this provision\u2019s language, at least in isolation, provides as much. See Majority Opinion at 419, 143 A.3d at 906 (noting that \u201coftentimes the meaning \u2014 or ambiguity \u2014 of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context\u201d). Yet, the majority reasons that this language, considered in light of the remainder of Megan\u2019s Law II\u2019s provisions, as well as its purported \u201crecidivist philosophy,\u201d among other factors, is ambiguous, and, indeed, provides that only an individual who is convicted of one or more offenses set forth in Section 9795.1(a), subsequently reoffends, and is convicted again of one or more offenses set forth in Section 9795.1(a), is subject to lifetime registration as a sexual offender. See Majority Opinion at 416-23,143 A.3d at 903-08. I remain unpersuaded.\nFirst, the \u201ccore of the [Gehris ] OISR\u2019s ensuing analysis,\u201d which the majority adopts today, is as follows:\n[W]e are satisfied that section 9795.1, which sets forth a graduated scheme for Megan\u2019s Law registration, similar in nature to the graduated schemes discussed in this Court\u2019s prior case law, encompasses the recidivist philosophy in addition to its perhaps more obvious goals of public protection and deterrence. Of course, registration may not be punitive for purposes of the constitutional protections afforded to offenders, as this Court concluded in [Commonwealth v.] Williams, [574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962 (2003) ]. Nevertheless, registration obviously has serious and restrictive consequences for the offender, including prosecution if the requirement is violated. Registration can also affect the offender\u2019s ability to earn a livelihood, his housing arrangements and options, and his reputation. See also Fross v. County of Allegheny [610 Pa. 421], 20 A.3d 1193 ([Pa.] 2011).\nThe \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d language in subsection (b) seems clear and unambiguous on the surface. But if Section 9795.1 is viewed as a whole and the General Assembly\u2019s legislative findings and declaration of policy at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791 are read closely, it is clear that the primary concern is with sexually violent predators. Considering the nine subsections in Section 9791, the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d appears nine times, particularly in the provision addressing repeat offenders: \u201csexually violent predators pose a high risk of engaging in further offenses even after being released from incarceration or commitments and that protection of the public from this type of offender is a paramount governmental interest.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791(a)(2). References to nonviolent offenders are comparatively few, just four in all, and two of these pertain specifically to recent amendments accounting for the circumstance of released \u201coffenders\u201d who may be homeless or without a \u201cfixed place of habitation.\u201d See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791(a)(1) & (b)(3); see also Commonwealth v. Wilgus [615 Pa. 32], 40 A.3d 1201 (Pa.2012).\nIt is evident that in drafting Section 9795.1, the General Assembly meant to set up a graduated registration scheme. In this tiered approach, more serious (primarily violent) offenders and \u201ctrue\u201d recidivists who squander a given opportunity to reform are understandably subject to lifetime requirements. By contrast, lesser, first-time offenders, especially those who are nonviolent, receive an opportunity for rehabilitation and eventual freedom from the requirements if they \u201cstay on the path\u201d for ten years.\n[W]e would conclude that Section 9795.1 embodies the recidivist philosophy and reflects a belief that first-time and lesser offenders are capable of reform and rehabilitation if given an opportunity to do so under the still-punitive aegis of relatively lighter discipline, as well as the threat of harsher treatment next time, should there be a next time.\nMajority Opinion at 417-18, 143 A.3d at 905 (quoting Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878-79 (OISR)) (alterations original). This rationale rests its conclusion on essentially two premises:\n(1) Section 9795.1 contains a \u201cgraduated scheme\u201d and is at least somewhat punitive in nature, and therefore analogous to the statutes in Commonwealth v. Dickerson [533 Pa. 294], 621 A.2d 990 (Pa.1993), Commonwealth v. Shiffler [583 Pa. 478], 879 A.2d 185 (Pa.2005), Commonwealth v. McClintic [589 Pa. 465], 909 A.2d 1241 (Pa. 2006), and Commonwealth v. Jarowecki [604 Pa. 242], 985 A.2d 955 (Pa.2009), which contain similarly graduated schemes and are punitive in nature, and which this Court has interpreted as incorporating a \u201crecidivist philosophy\u201d requiring conviction, re-offense, and subsequent conviction; and\n(2) The legislative findings incorporated into Megan\u2019s Law ITs provisions, its statement of purpose, and their oft-repeated use of the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d as compared to their references to \u201cnonviolent offenders\u201d evidence a primary concern with recidivists.\nIn my view, neither premise leads to the majority\u2019s conclusion.\nFirst, as detailed in my OISA in Gehris, the language of Section 9795.1 is significantly distinct from the language of the statutes at issue in Dickerson and its progeny:\n[T]he specific nature of the language employed in the statutes at issue in [Dickerson, Shiffler, McClintic, and Jarowecki ] \u2014 i.e. \u201c[wjhere the person had at the time of the commission of the current offense previously been convicted,\u201d in the case of 42 Pa.C.S.A. (s) 9714(a)(2) (emphasis added), and \u201csecond or subsequent offense,\u201d in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6312(d)(2) (emphasis added) \u2014 implies a requirement that there be a separation in time between imposition of the successively greater sanctions in order to give the individual a chance to change his or her behavior in response to the lesser sanction. By contrast, as noted above, the language of Section 9795.1(b)(1) has no such language suggesting temporal separation is required between the commission of the enumerated offenses for the lifetime registration requirement to apply.\nGehris, 54 A.3d at 866 (OISA) (emphasis original). Thus, insofar as the language of Section 9795.1 is not analogous, it is improper for this Court to treat it as such. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nMoreover, this Court has previously held that the purpose of Section 9795.1 is non-punitive, further weakening the analogy to the punitive statutes at issue in Dickerson and its progeny, as well as their underlying purpose \u2014 punishing with increasing force in an effort to avoid recidivism. As I stated in Gehris:\n[T]he primary purpose of the registration requirement is not to punish an individual convicted of sexual offenses, but, instead, registration is mandated for the protection of the public. See [Commonwealth v.] Williams, 574 Pa. [487,] 504 832 A.2d [962,] 972 [ (2003) ] (\u201c[T]he legislature\u2019s intent in requiring offenders to register with the State Police regarding their whereabouts was not retribution; ... rather its purpose was to effectuate, through remedial legislation, the non-punitive goal of public safety.\u201d) Consequently, unlike the \u201cthree strikes\u201d sentencing statute at issue in [Dickerson], [Shiffler], and [McClintic] and the mandatory sentencing for possession of child pornography at issue in [Jarow-ecki ], which imposed successively greater levels of penal discipline for each successive conviction for the same type of crime in order to dissuade an individual from repeating that criminal conduct in the future, the principal objective of the registration requirement is not to alter the convicted individual\u2019s behavior through punishment.\nGehris, 54 A.3d at 866-67 (OISA).\nBearing these distinctions in mind, the only remaining similarity between Megan\u2019s Law II and the statutes at issue in Dickerson and its progeny relied upon by the majority is that each possesses a \u201cgraduated scheme\u201d \u2014 i.e., each imposes different levels of \u201cpunishment\u201d corresponding to increasingly severe offenses. Yet, as I explained in my Gehris OISA, in light of its distinct text and purpose, it is more appropriate to view the \u201cgraduated scheme\u201d in Section 9795.1 as estimating that persons who frequently commit sexual offenses are more dangerous to the public, requiring lengthier registration:\nAlthough the overall structure of Section 9795.1 conditions its registration scheme, in part, on the nature of particular sexual offenses, since lifetime registration is required of those who commit the arguably more serious offenses enumerated in Section 9795.1(b)(2), I find it significant that the legislature also chose to impose the very same lifetime registration requirement for those convicted of two or more of any of the offenses enumerated in Section 9795.1(a)(1), the vast majority of which are offenses against children. This, from my perspective, evidences a deliberate legislative judgment, consistent with its objective of protecting public safety, to make the differing length of registration requirements dependent not only on the nature of the specific sexual offenses for which an individual is convicted, but, also, on the occurrence of a multiplicity of certain types of offenses, particularly those committed against children. In my view, this reflects a considered determination by the legislature that, in order to protect the safety and general welfare of the public, the frequency with which a convicted defendant is determined to have engaged in certain types of prohibited conduct with children is a particularly important factor in determining whether he or she should be subject to lifetime registration.\nGehris, 54 A.3d at 867-68 (OISA).\nTurning to the majority\u2019s view that Section 9795.1 is ambiguous in light of Megan\u2019s Law II\u2019s emphasis on protecting the public from sexually violent predators, I first note that the majority does not explain how Section 9795.1(b)(l)\u2019s language acquires additional potential meanings in light of those provisions. Moreover, I find the majority\u2019s analysis on this point, insofar as it compares the number of times the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d appears in the salient statutory provisions to the number of references to nonviolent offenders, unpersuasive as an indicator that the General Assembly was primarily concerned with protecting the public from recidivists who have failed to reform after conviction as opposed to individuals who engage in multiple sex crimes.\nI am likewise unpersuaded by the majority\u2019s supplemental analysis buttressing the Gehris OISR\u2019s conclusion that Section 9795.1(b)(1) is ambiguous. First, the majority notes the longstanding principle that language must be viewed in the context of a statute as a whole, that neither the OISA or OISR in Gehris directly cited this principle, and that the OISR\u2019s approach is \u201cconsonant with\u201d it. See Majority Opinion at 418-20, 143 A.3d at 905-06. Although I do not disagree with the majority that words must be considered in context, the majority does not explain how Section 9795.1(b)(l)\u2019s language becomes ambiguous in context.\nThe majority next seeks to support its finding that Section 9795.1(b)(1) is ambiguous by reference to \u201c[t]he fact that it never occurred to those in the trenches\u201d \u2014 i.e. the defendant, his counsel, the Commonwealth, and the court \u2014 \u201cthat a first-time, non-violent and non-SVP offender could be subject to anything but the lower-tier period of registration,\u201d reasoning that such fact \u201cprovides some further measure of support to the conclusion that the provision, considered in context, is at least reasonably amenable to multiple interpretations.\u201d Id. at 421, 143 A.3d at 907. In my view, the mere fact that others\u2014 even members of the bench and bar \u2014 have adopted what amounts to a misinterpretation of a statute \u2014 should not bear on the discrete legal question of whether its text is reasonably susceptible to such interpretation.\nFinally, the majority reasons that \u201cthere is some validity in the point made in the dissent below that it would be absurd and unreasonable if a single act, giving rise to a single prosecution yielding two convictions for overlapping predicate offenses, subjected an offender to lifetime registration.\u201d Id. at 422, 143 A.3d at 907. I disagree. The enactment of statutes criminalizing (or requiring registration for) \u201coverlapping predicate offenses\u201d arising from one act may also be viewed as evidencing a legislative judgment that a single act may create distinct harms or, as salient here, future risks.\nIn closing, I recognize that the appellant in this case is not the typical offender to whom sexual offender registration requirements apply. Appellant and the victim herein were engaged in a consensual and legally permissible sexual relationship when Appellant solicited and created the illegal pornographic images that give rise to his convictions. Nevertheless, it is this Court\u2019s duty to consider the proper interpretation of Section 9795.1 not solely as it applies to the parties herein, but as it applies to future parties in cases across the Commonwealth.\nFor these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n. Moreover, even assuming Section 9795.l\u2019s increasing periods of registration are directed at increasingly serious offenses, such proposition does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Section 9795.1(b)(1) applies solely to recidivists. Under such a view, the General Assembly would necessarily have to deem an individual who lures a child into a motor vehicle, kidnaps the child, and forces the child to participate in prostitution and child pornography \u2014 an individual who, under the majority\u2019s interpretation of Section 9795.1(b)(1), need only register as a sexual offender for 10 years \u2014 as having committed a less serious offense than, for example, an individual who, for example, is convicted of possessing child pornography and subsequently reoffends.\nIn response, the majority contends this illustration is inapt because the aforementioned offender may well be determined to be a sexually violent predator subject to lifetime registration. Majority Opinion at 418-19 n. 11, 143 A.3d at 905 n. 11. Furthermore, Justice Donohue, in her concurrence, rejects this position because a \u201cserial, violent sex offender, who happens to evade prosecution in between the commission of his criminal acts\u201d is likely to be deemed a sexually violent predator subject to lifetime registration pursuant to Section 9795.1(b)(3). Concurring Opinion (Donohue, J.) at 425-26, 143 A,3d at 910. The concurrence reasons that the classification process and the imposition of lifetime registration for sexually violent predators is a \"safeguard\u201d consistent with the statute's recidivist philosophy subjecting \u201cmore serious (primarily violent) offenders and 'true' recidivists who squander a given opportunity to reform.\u201d Id. at 425-26, 143 A.3d at 910.\nIn my view, the concurrence's reliance on this \u201csafeguard\u201d does not account for the Commonwealth's significant evidentiary burden necessary to classify offenders as sexually violent predators. See Williams, supra; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9792, 9795.1, 9795.4 (2000). Moreover, insofar as both violent and non-violent one-time offenders, multiple offenders who do not happen to be apprehended, and those the majority and concurrence refer to as \"true\u201d recidivists, are all subject to assessment and potential classification as sexually violent predators, I do not view the assessment process and potential lifetime registration as consistent with a particular legislative concern for \u201ctrue\u201d recidivists.\n. The majority also considers, but does not definitively resolve, whether Section 9795.1(b)(1) is penal in nature, requiring application of the rule of lenity which mandates strict construction of statutes in a defendant's favor. See Majority Opinion at 420-21, 143 A.3d at 906-07. Although I rejected this approach as inconsistent with the statute\u2019s remedial purpose in my OISA in Gehris, see Gehris, 54 A.3d at 865-66 (OISA), insofar as the majority does not rest its decision today on application of that rule, I think it unnecessary to presently repeat that view in toto. I do note, however, that an unambiguous statute is capable of only one reasonable interpretation, and, thus, is not capable of, much less in need of, strict or expansive construction.

        "text": "Justice WECHT,\ndissenting.\nLike it or not, our decision in this case should be controlled by the unambiguous language of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1) (superseded). I join in the bulk of Justice Todd\u2019s incisive analysis of that provision and in the well-reasoned conclusion that she draws in her dissenting opinion. Like Justice Todd, I believe that Subsection 9795.1(b)(1) \u201cclearly and unambiguously provides that any individual who accrues multiple convictions for offenses set forth in [Subsection 9795.1(a) ] is subject to lifetime registration as a sexual offender.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 426,143 A.3d at 910.\nHowever, I believe that the plain meaning of the statutory language should mark the beginning and the end of our analysis. In particular, I think it unnecessary to invoke judicially derived interpretations of the statute\u2019s \u201coverall structure\u201d when the legislature\u2019s actual words compel the result. I would not go so far as to assume or suggest that the statutory framework \u201cevidences a deliberate legislative judgment ... to make the differing length of registration requirements dependent not only on the nature of the specific sexual offenses for which an individual is convicted, but, also, on the occurrence of a multiplicity of certain types of offenses, particularly those committed against children,\u201d or that \u201cthe frequency with which a convicted defendant is determined to have engaged in certain types of prohibited conduct with children is a particularly important factor in determining whether he or she should be subject to lifetime registration.\u201d Id. at 432,143 A.3d at 913 (quoting Commonwealth v. Gehris, 618 Pa. 104, 54 A.3d 862, 867-68 (2012) (Opinion in Support of Affirmance (\u201cOISA\u201d))). These are reasonable speculations. But they are speculations nonetheless.\nIt is axiomatic that, \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, there is no need to look beyond the plain meaning of the statute \u2018under the pretext of pursuing its spirit,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[o]nly \u2018[w]hen the words of the statute are not explicit\u2019 may a court resort to the rules of statutory construction[.]\u201d Warrantech Consumer Prods. Servs., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co. in Liquidation, 626 Pa. 218, 96 A.3d 346, 354 (2014) (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b)). Our definition of \u201cambiguity\u201d is of central importance to this analysis. \u201cA statute is ambiguous when there are at least two reasonable interpretations of the text under review.\u201d Id. at 364-66.\nLike Justice Todd, I am unpersuaded by the reasoning of the Opinion in Support of Reversal (\u201cOISR\u201d) in Gehris, quoted by today's Majority, regarding the threshold finding of ambiguity. According to the Majority:\nThe \u2018two or more convictions\u2019 language in subsection (b) seems clear and unambiguous on the surface. But if Section 9796.1 is viewed as a whole and the General Assembly\u2019s legislative findings and declaration of policy at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9791 are read closely, it is clear that the primary concern is with sexually violent predators.\nMajority Opinion at 417, 143 A.3d at 911 (quoting Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878-79 (OISR)).\nFrom the frequency with which the term \u201csexually violent predator\u201d appears in the statutory text, as compared with the number of references to nonviolent offenders, the Majority and the OISR in Gehris derive support for the proposition that Section 9795.1 reflected a recidivist philosophy, reserving the most serious registration consequence for \u201cmore serious (primarily violent) offenders and \u2018true\u2019 recidivists.\u201d Id. (quoting Gehris, 54 A.3d at 879 (OISR)). In response to Justice Todd\u2019s observation that the Majority has not explained adequately how the statute is ambiguous, the Majority reiterates that, in context, \u201cthe primary concern of the statute is with sexually violent predators and not with nonviolent offenders.\u201d Id. at 422 n. 14,143 A.3d at 907 n. 14 (citing Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878-79 (OISR)).\nLike Justice Todd, I think it significant that no reasonable alternative interpretation of the language \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d arises from the proposition that \u201cthe primary concern\u201d of the statute is with sexually violent predators. Nonetheless, I differ with Justice Todd in her suggestion that, because \u201cthe vast majority of [Subsection 9795.1(a)(1) offenses] are offenses against children,\u201d we may presume \u201ca deliberate legislative judgment, consistent with its objective of protecting public safety, to make the differing length of registration requirements dependent not only on the nature of the specific sexual offenses for which an individual is convicted, but, also, on the occurrence of a multiplicity of certain types of offenses, particularly those committed against children.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 431-32, 143 A.3d at 913 (quoting Gehris, 54 A.3d at 867-68 (OISA)). I view this analysis as positing an alternative \u201cprimary concern\u201d of the statute which, like that suggested by the Majority, does not flow inexorably from the unambiguous language of Section 9795.1(b)(1).\n\u201cGenerally, the best indicator of legislative intent is the plain language of the statute.\u201d Warrantech, 96 A.3d at 354. After concluding that the text of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1) is susceptible to only one reasonable interpretation, as Justice Todd and I both do, we reach the end of the story. There is no further need or warrant to inquire into or speculate about the General Assembly\u2019s intent, its objective, or its \u201cprimary concern\u201d in enacting that text into law. The General Assembly made its intent clear through the use of the unambiguous language, \u201c[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a) \u201cshall be subject to lifetime registration\u201d as a sexual offender. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1).\nFinally, I write separately to emphasize that I share deeply the concerns underlying the Majority\u2019s reasoning. Were we not constrained by the unambiguous statutory text, I readily would endorse the Majority\u2019s approach. Although this Court in Commonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 832 A.2d 962, 986 (2003), held that sexual offender registration requirements are non-punitive for purposes of due process, lifetime registration as a sexual offender undoubtedly remains a uniquely burdensome consequence of criminal conviction. As the Majority and the Gehris OISR correctly noted, the registration requirement can affect an individual\u2019s employment opportunities, housing options, and reputation, and can result in criminal prosecution if violated. See Majority Opinion at 417, 143 A.3d at 904-05 (quoting Gehris, 54 A.3d at 878 (OISR)). It is the Mark of Cain.\nLike the Majority, I believe that the statutory scheme should embody a recidivist philosophy. Unfortunately, that is not what the legislative words did. I agree that fairness and justice are not achieved by the General Assembly\u2019s uniform treatment of first-time, nonviolent offenders and those who commit the most serious and heinous sexual offenses. However, we are not addressing any constitutional challenge. This case presents a question of statutory interpretation. This Court may not alter the meaning of unambiguous statutory language in order to achieve what it perceives to be a preferable result. The statutory scheme operated to impose a perhaps unduly harsh consequence upon those individuals who will receive the benefit of the ruling reached by today\u2019s Majority. But this consequence is mandated by the statutory text, I respectfully dissent.\n. See Dissenting Opinion at 431, 143 A.3d at 913 (quoting Commonwealth v. Gehris, 618 Pa. 104, 54 A.3d 862, 867 (2012) (Opinion in Support of Affirmance)).",
