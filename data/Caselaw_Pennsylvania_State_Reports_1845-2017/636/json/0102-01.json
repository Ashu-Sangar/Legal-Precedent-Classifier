Whether the Superior Court\u2019s holding directly conflicts with previous Superior Court holdings that an outside entity can be appointed or retained by a hospital to conduct peer review and that the review is entitled to protection under the Pennsylvania Peer Review Protection Act?\n2. Whether the Superior Court\u2019s holding directly conflicts with the intent of the Peer Review Protection Act and this Court\u2019s holdings that the provision of peer review materials to the hospital does not constitute a waiver of the Peer Review Protection Act?\nThese matters are to be listed for argument with the petitions granted at 39 & 40 WAL 2016.",
