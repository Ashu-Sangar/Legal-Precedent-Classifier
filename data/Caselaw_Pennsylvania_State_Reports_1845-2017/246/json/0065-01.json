        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nOn May 4, 1912, the plaintiff, a switch-cleaner in the service of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., was riding upon one of its cars; he stood just inside the front door, so that he might observe and report defects in the track. Two vans belonging to the defendant, and driven by his employees, were coming toward the car on an adjacent parallel track. The first van passed without difficulty, but the horses of the second one turned diagonally across the track on which the car was slowly approaching, and collided with it, driving the tongue of the wagon through the sheet-iron dash-board, and knocking the controller box from its place with such force that it struck and severely injured the plaintiff. The jury rendered a verdict in his favor, upon which judgment was entered; the defendant has appealed.\nThe first assignment complains that the charge was \u201clacking in proper and necessary instructions as to the proximate cause of the injury suffered by the plaintiff and the responsibility of the defendant therefor.\u201d We feel that this criticism is not sound. While the trial judge did not use the phrase \u201cproximate cause,\u201d yet, he distinctly told the jury that if the accident was caused solely by the motorman\u2019s running the car into the wagon, when by proper care, he conld have avoided so doing, there could be no recovery against the defendant. He also instructed plainly that in order to find for the plaintiff the jury would have to believe that the accident was due to the negligence of the driver in permitting his lines to lie loose upon the backs of the horses and then taking them up without due care, in such a way as to swing the horses precipitately in front of the approaching car. There was positive evidence to the effect that, \u201cThe reins of the horses were down on the horses\u2019 backs,\u201d that, \u201cno driver had hold of them......no man had hold of the reins,\u201d and further, that, \u201cas soon as the driver picked his lines up the one horse came right over against the car.\u201d If this was believed, as the verdict shows it was, the evidence would justify a finding that the careless driving of the defendant\u2019s employee was the proximate cause of the accident; and the issue involving the testimony in question was fairly submitted to the jury.\nThe next two specifications of error contain excerpts from the charge in which the trial judge stated that the \u201cdriver of a wagon is obliged to see ruts in broad day light.\u201d The defendant contended that the accident was caused by a wheel of his wagon dropping into a rut in the street, and the instructions complained of were given in dealing with this phase of the case. According to the evidence presented by the plaintiff, the alleged defect in the highway did not cause the accident; but, under the defendant\u2019s version, it might have done so. The judge told the jury that if they believed the accident was due to a hole, or rut, in the street, which the driver could not see, they might conclude the injury to the plaintiff was caused by \u201can accident that was unavoidable.\u201d But, he also truly said, there was no evidence that the driver could not see the alleged hole, adding that, in broad day light, one is obliged to observe ruts in a street. It is not necessary to discuss this assignment at length, for the testimony shows the driver admitted that he actually saw the rut \u201cin front\u201d of him before he \u201cgot to it\u201d; and under such circumstances, our decision in Smith v. City, 217 Pa. 118, justified the instruction complained of in these assignments.\nUnder the fourth and fifth assignments, to quote from the paper book of the appellant, \u201cthe complaint is that the jury were instructed to allow for future losses in the absence of evidence showing permanent diminution of earning power.\u201d The proofs show that the plaintiff was sixty-one years old at the time of his injury; that prior to the accident he had enjoyed good health and worked regularly for twenty-seven years as an employee of the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., earning at least $12.60 a week for the last three or four years of that period; that he was a married man, and lived at home with his wife and three daughters, the youngest of whom was 19 years of age; that as a result of the accident his health was bad,, and he had great difficulty in standing upright or in walking any considerable distance; that for this reason he had not been able to work, or to earn any wages whatever; that \u201chis legs will never be straight, because they are broken and curved and already healed, and they will never be any straighter than they are now\u201d; that the \u201cprognosis is not very encouraging,\u201d and in the opinion of medical experts it was impossible to say \u201cwhat strength he will develop later on.\u201d When the testimony is taken as a whole, it forms a sufficient basis for the instructions given by the trial judge to the effect that the plaintiff was entitled to recover whatever he was \u201cliable to lose\u201d in the way of future earnings.\nThe last three assignments of error complain of the refusal to charge the defendant\u2019s points. Since appellant\u2019s paper-book contains no argument in support of these particular specifications, we assume that they are not pressed. The points were properly declined, however, for the first two asked instructions on contributory negligence, whereas, there was absolutely no evidence to bring that issue into the case or to justify a finding that the plaintiff was to. any degree guilty in that respect; the other requested, binding instructions, which could not have been properly given under the circumstances at bar.\nWhile the instructions on the measure of damages were somewhat scant, and the adequacy of the charge may be justly criticized in that and, possibly, in other respects, yet, it contains no positive misstatements of law, or anything tantamount thereto. At the trial, the appellant made no specific objection to any particular part of the charge; moreover, he neither complained of its inadequacy, nor submitted any requests for instructions on the proximate cause of the accident, or-upon the measure of damages or the evidence relating thereto. In Fortney v. Breon, 245 Pa. 47, we recently said, \u201cUnder such circumstances, the rule is that if an instruction is clearly erroneous on the question of damages,. it is ground for reversal, no matter whether specific instructions were requested or not, but if the charge be only inadequate, it is the duty of counsel to ask for more definite instructions, and failure to do so will, as a rule, be deemed a waiver of any objection that might otherwise be made, especially where it is obvious that no harm was done by the matter complained of (Burns v. Penna. R. R. Co., 239 Pa. 207); and this rule applies in the present instance.\u201d A litigant is entitled as a matter of right to except generally to a charge (Foley v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 240 Pa. 169), and under such an exception he may assign all actual errors of law, or any material matter that is so inadequately presented as to be calculated to mislead the jury; moreover, he may assign the whole charge \u00e1s inadequate, if.it fails to present the real questions in the case, or if its general effect is to give a wrong or misleading impression to the jurors concerning the material issues involved or their duties in connection therewith. But, it is still the general rule that, \u201cerror cannot be assigned of what was not said by the trial judge, without a request so to charge\u201d (Merritt v. Poli, 236 Pa. 170, 174); and that one \u201cmay not sit silent and take his chances on a verdict, then if it is adverse, complain of a matter which, if an error, would have been immediately rectified and made harmless\u201d (Rezner Mfg. Co. v. B. & L. E. R. R., 233 Pa. 369, 372). Upon subjects concerning which no particular requests are made, a court is only responsible for the probable \u201cgeneral effect\u201d of the charge \u201con the minds of the jury,\u201d to be judged by its \u201csalient points\u201d and \u201cthe thoughts that permeate it through and through\u201d; as to such matters, \u201ccounsel may still have the benefit of errors of commission, but they should not complain of omissions\u201d (Reeves v. D., L. & W. Rd. Co., 30 Pa. 454, 460; Lehigh Valley Railroad Co. v. Brandtmier, 113 Pa. 610, 619; Person and Riegel Co. v. Lipps, 219 Pa. 99, 112; Pierson v. Duncan, 162 Pa. 187, 193). After a careful review of the whole record, we are convinced that no substantial error was committed in the trial or in the manner in which the present case was submitted to the jury.\nThe several assignments are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.",

In an action to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by plaintiff in consequence of the collision of a trolley car on -which plaintiff was riding and defendant\u2019s van, an instruction to the jury 4o the effect that if the accident was occasioned solely by the r .Norman\u2019s running the car into the wagon when by proper care he <sould have avoided so doing, there can be no recovery, and in ordfi/r to find for the plaintiff the jury would have to believe that the accident was due to the negligence of the driver, is not open to tKe charge of inadequacy on the question of proximate cause, wheire it appeared that the plaintiff, an employee of a transit company,, was riding on the platform of a street car; that defendant\u2019s van driven by one of his employees approached the car on an adjacent parallel track, that the horses of the van turned diagonally afcross the track on which the car was running and collided with it, ^driving the tongue of the wagon into the car and knocking the controller box violently from its place so that it struck the plaintiff and inflicted the injuries complained of, and there was evideuce that the driver was negligent in allowing the reins to lie loose on the hacks of the horses and in taking them up without due care in such a way as to swing the horses precipitately in front of the approaching car.\n2. Where in such case the evidence was conflicting as to whether or not a rut in the highway caused the horses to swerve, the trial judge committed no error in charging the jury that if they believed the accident due to a hole or rut in the street which the driver could not see, they might conclude that the injury to plaintiff was . caused by an unavoidable accident, but as there was no evidence that the driver could not see the alleged hole and that in broad day light, he was obliged to observe ruts in a street; and this is particularly true where the driver admitted that he saw the rut in front of him before he got into it.\n3. In such ease, an assignment of error complaining that the jury were permitted to allow for future losses in the absence of evidence showing permanent diminution of earning power, is without merit where the proofs showed that plaintiff was sixty-one years old at the time of the injury, that prior thereto he had been in good health and had been steadily employed for twenty-seven years; that during the last three or foiir years of such period, he earned $12.60 per week; that as a result, of the accident, his health was bad; that he had difficulty in standing upright or in walking any considerable distance; that he had been unable to work or earn any wages whatever; that his legs would never be straight; and where the opinion of medical experts was that the \u201cprognosis is not very encouraging\u201d and that it was impossible,.to say what strength he would develop later on; and the trial judgb^made no error in allowing the jury to find for plaintiff whatever be was \u201cliable to lose\u201d in the way of future earnings. \\\nPractice, C.
