All the questions here involved are based upon the assumption that the trusts under the will of Asa Packer will continue for twenty-one years after the death of Mary Packer Cummings, which occurred October 29,1912; but since we have construed the will to the contrary and decided that the trusts in question terminated upon the death of Mary Packer Cummings [See, Packer\u2019s Est. (No. 1) ], it is not necessary to consider the various points attempted to be raised by the several assignments of error.\nThe appeal is dismissed; the costs to be paid by the appellants and others as ordered by the Orphans\u2019 Court when the record is returned to it.",
