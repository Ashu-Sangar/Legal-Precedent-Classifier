Reighard, Appellant.\nContracts \u2014 Brokers\u2014Suit for commissions \u2014 Principal and agent -JPower of agent to contract with broker \u2014 Ratification.\nIn an action by a broker to recover commissions for the sale of stock, the case is for the jury and a verdict for the plaintiff will be sustained where the only defense is that the contract with the plaintiff was neither authorized by defendant nor subsequently ratified by him, and the evidence on this question is flatly contradictory.\nArgued Oct. 16, 1914.\nAppeal, No. 158, Oct T., 1914, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Allegheny Co., July T., 1912, No. 1909, on verdict for plaintiff in case of M. K. McMullin v. S. S. Reighard, Charles A. Lytle and John W. Westhead, executors of the will of David P. Reighard, and George R. Webb.\nBefore Brown, Potter, Elkin, Stewart and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for broker\u2019s commission.\nThe facts appear in the following opinion of Brown, J., sur defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and for judgment n. o. v.:\nM. K. McMullin brought this action against George R. Webb and D. P. Reighard. Webb was not served. Reighard was served; filed a defense; subsequently died, and his executors were substituted; and the action against the executors proceeded to trial, resulting in a verdict for plaintiff.\nPlaintiff claimed that in December, 1911, Webb and Reighard owned the capital stock and bonds of the Duquesne Light Company, of the par value of $1,085,000; that Webb acting for himself and Reighard employed him to secure a purchaser therefor, and agreed to pay him $25,000 if he secured such purchaser; that he secured as purchaser, M. B. Staring, with whom, on February 9th, 1912, the sale was closed at the price of $870,-000.\nDavid P. Reighard (one of the defendants) in the fourth paragraph of his affidavit of defense, averred:\n\u201c4th. That he was never informed by the said plaintiff, or the said George R. Webb, that the said George R. Webb had represented himself to said plaintiff as agent for him, the said Reighard, to make said contract with said plaintiff, nor was he ever informed, either by the said plaintiff, or the said George R. Webb, that such contract was made by said Webb with said plaintiff.\u201d\nThis averment was flatly contradicted at the trial, plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testifying that he was informed of Webb\u2019s agreement and assented to it.\nIt is an unbending principle, that the assent of a principal to the act of an agent may be given after it is performed. When given after the act is performed, it is in the nature of a ratification of the act, and is intended to clothe the act with the same qualities as if there had been a prior appointment.\nWhether Reighard assented to the act of Webb in employing McMullin an agreeing to pay him $25,000; whether McMullin secured the purchaser \u2014 were issues of fact for the jury, and the jury found for plaintiff\u2014 a finding amply warranted by the testimony.\nVerdict for plaintiff for $28,416.67, and judgment thereon. Defendants appealed.\nErrors assigned, among others, were in dismissing motions for a new trial and judgment n. o. v.\nWilliam A. Griffith, of Griffith and Mitchell, for appellants.\nSamuel McClay, with him, W. A. Seifert and Reed, Smith, Shaw & Beal, for appellee.\nOctober 26, 1914:"
