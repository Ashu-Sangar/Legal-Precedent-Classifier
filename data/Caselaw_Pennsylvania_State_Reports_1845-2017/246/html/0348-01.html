As commonly understood, although not technically exact, a perpetuity is something which may last forever, and the rule against perpetuities is a rule that prevents certain existing conditions from continuing for an indefinite period. The legal significance thereof will appear more fully as we proceed. The rule is aimed at the suspension of alienation of property, compelling such a limitation of future interests as will require them to vest, if at all, within a certain time. The rule promotes alienability by destroying future interests. Alien-ability is its object, the destruction of future interests is the means of obtaining that object. Public policy is against the tying up of property, and it uses the rule against perpetuities as a knife to cut out the limitations, which, if they were allowed to take effect, would produce the consequences which are to be avoided. The rule, against perpetuities first took form in England in the discussion of cases arising on executory devises of chattels real, and first was suggested at bar in 1616, although the word “perpetuity” had appeared in the English reports as early as 1595. At first the validity of contingent interests depended on the nature of the contingency upon which they were limited to take effect, and no question as to the remoteness of a limitation of a freehold estate arose until 1661. Lord Chancellor Nottingham, in 1681, in the Duke of Norfolk’s Case, 3 Ch. Cas., 1, established the points (1) that the validity or invalidity of the future interest depended on its remoteness, and not on the nature of the contingency, and (2) that the contingency was'required to occur within a life or lives in being. Subsequently the limits within which the contingency must occur were extended (1) to cover the time necessary for the birth of a posthumous child, where gestation actually occurs, as every, life is to be <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>considered as beginning at tbe time of conception, then (2) twenty-one years were added to provide for tbe minority of children in esse at the expiration of the life estate. Later the consideration of minority was lost sight of, and the period of twenty-one years was allowed in gross, without reference to an existing minority. The rule was developed entirely at common law. It was brought to America as part of the common law of England, and is imbedded in the common law of Pennsylvania. Foulke on Rule against Perpetuities, Chap. 15. Ownership of property does not carry with it the right to dispose of that property to any person and upon any contingency that the owner may desire to name. The law, for reasons of public policy, still imposes some rer straints upon the right to dispose of property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[294,1153,1147,643]]]'>The rule against perpetuities is by far the most important restraint which the law places upon the right to create future interests. It is fundamental that the rule deals only with future estates. No present interest, whether alienable or not, is objectionable under the rule against perpetuities, although restraints upon the alienation of present interests may be prohibited by other rules of law. 30 Cyc. 1466. The remoteness against which the rule is directed is remoteness in the commencement or first taking effect of limitations, and not in the cesser or determination of them.

Bender, <a href="/pa/225/0434-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="225 Pa. 434" data-case-ids="965309" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0434-01">225 Pa. 434</a>.</p>

The evolution of the rule was probably due primarily to the desire of the courts to prevent property from being inalienable. If future interests in property may be created in favor of persons not in being, a title to the property cannot be made; it is taken put of com<a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>merce; the rule therefore restrains,, within limits, the creation of such interests.” 30 Cyc. 1467. “It is not enough that the future interest may, or even that it will in all probability, vest within the limits. It must necessarily so vest.” 30 Cyc. 1483. “It was the indestructibility, not only of springing and shifting uses, and of executory devises, but also of future trusts, which forced upon the judges the rule against perpetuities, in order to set bounds to the remoteness of not only legal but equitable limitations; and it acts upon perpetuities wherever they appear, except in conveyances in mortmain, or to charitable uses. A perfect definition of a perpetuity has not been given, and the nearest approach to it is found in Lewis on Perpetuities, ch. 12, where it is said to be a future limitation, whether executory or by way of remainder, and of real or personal property, which is not to vest till after the expiration of, or which will not necessarily vest within, the period prescribed by law for the creation of future estates, and which is not destructible by the person for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation, except with the concurrence of the person interested in the contingent event.” Hillyard v. Miller, <a href="/pa/10/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="962710" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0326-01">10 Pa. 326</a>; Mifflin’s App., <a href="/pa/121/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="121 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="561230" data-case-paths="/pa/121/0205-01">121 Pa. 205</a>. “A perpetuity may be defined to be a future limitation, restraining the owner of the estate from aliening thé fee simple of the property discharged of such future use or estate before the event is determined or the period is arrived when such future use or estate is to arise.” 1 Sanders on Uses and Trusts, 196. “Perpetuities are grants of property wherein the vesting of an estate or interest is unlawfully postponed; and they are called perpetuities not because the grant, as written, would actually make them perpetual, but because they transgress the limits which the law has set in restraint of grants that tend to a perpetual suspense of the title, or of its vesting. The law allows the vesting of an estate or interest, or the power of alienation, to be postponed for the period of lives in being, and twenty-<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>one years and nine months thereafter; and all restraints upon the vesting that may suspend it beyond that period are treated as perpetual restraints, and therefore as void, and consequently the estates or interests dependent upon them are void, and nothing is denounced by the law as a perpetuity that does not transgress this rule.” Philadelphia v.

A limit has, therefore, been fixed on for the creation of executory interests, and every executory interest which might, under any circumstances, transgress this limit is void altogether. If no lives are fixed on then the term of twenty-one years only is allowed.” Williams on Real Property (6th Am.

Counsel for the defendants urge that the price paid Barton was adequate, that he was not defrauded into making a bad bargain, that the coal could have been bought for less money had it not been desired to insure to the owner thereof ample and suitable surface whereon to operate, that when Barton sold the coal he must have foreseen that the surface might be required for operating purposes, that the coal without the surface right was not of as much value as it was with it, that Barton must have foreseen the possibility of a long delay in the mining of the coal and that this land in his own hands and in the hands of his heirs or assigns would be subject to this right until such time as the owner of the coal found it suited his best convenience to begin mining operations, and that Barton demanded and received such a price as would recompense him and his heirs for any lost appreciation in the value of the surface.

The covenant in form is an option, but without limit as to time of acceptance. “An option is a unilateral agreement, binding upon the optionor from the date of its execution, but does not become a contract inter partes in the sense of an absolute contract to convey on the one side and to purchase on the other until exercised by the optionee.” Barnes v. Rea, <a href="/pa/219/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="219 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1002670" data-case-paths="/pa/219/0279-01">219 Pa. 279</a>. “An option is not a sale.

It is simply a contract by which the owner of property agrees with another person that he shall have the right to buy his property at a fixed price within a certain time. By such an agreement he does not sell his land, nor does he at that time enter into an absolute contract to sell and convey, but he does agree to sell something, that is, the right or privilege to buy at the election or option of the party with whom the agreement is made. The optionee under such an agreement takes, not lands, nor even an absolute agreement that he shall have lands conveyed to him, but he does get something conveyed to him, that is, the right to call for a conveyance of the land if he elects, to purchase in the manner specified. The owner parts with his right to sell his, lands, except to the second party, for a limited period.

To vest means to give an immediate fixed right of present or future enjoyment. Anderson’s Dictionary of Law, 1087. An estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of future enjoyment. 2 Bouvier’s Law Dictionary (Rawle’s Ed.) 1193. It is vested when there is an immediate right of present enjoyment or a present fixed right of future enjoyment. 40 Cyc. 198, note 93.

Black's Law Dictionary (2d Ed.), 1204. An estate vests in a person who is given a present and immediate interest, as distinguished from an interest whose existence depends on a contingency. To vest is to give a legal or equitable seisin. McClellan’s Est., <a href="/pa/221/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="221 Pa. 261" data-case-ids="956144" data-case-paths="/pa/221/0261-01">221 Pa. 261</a>. “An estate is said to be vested in interest when there is a present fixed right in some one of future enjoyment of it. It is not vested, but contingent, when either the person who is to enjoy it, or the event upon which the estate is to arise is uncertain.” Johnson’s Est., <a href="/pa/185/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="185 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="898030" data-case-paths="/pa/185/0179-01">185 Pa. 179</a>. In the present case there is no present fixed right of future enjoyment of any of this land in anybody; under the option. A privilege to acquire such right was given by the Barton deed, but no such right was conveyed thereby. The event upon which the estate is to arise, to wit, the acceptance of the option to purchase, is uncertain, being unconfined as to limit of time. The interest created by this option, therefore, is not vested, but contingent, and is within the rule against perpetuities. In that respect this case differs from one where the owner of land conveys the coal thereunder, with general mining rights and the right to use surface for mining purposes, as in Dewey v. Great Lakes Coal Company, <a href="/pa/236/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="236 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="986659" data-case-paths="/pa/236/0498-01">236 Pa. 498</a>, cited by counsel for the defendants. In a case like that the rights are conveyed by the deed and vest immediately. There a present fixed right of future enjoyment is conveyed, although the right of enjoyment may not be exercised immediately.</p>

But this option was intended to be unlimited as to time. To undertake <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>to limit its continuance to “a reasonable time” would be exactly contrary to the intention of the parties, and cannot be done, as will be seen by authorities hereinafter cited. Besides, that would be to treat the rule against perpetuities as a rule of construction, instead of as a peremptory command of law, which, as already seen, we cannot do. It may not be out of place just here to note how carefully the clause in the Thaw will limiting the life of the “Coke Trust” was drawn to avoid the rule against perpetuities, when the testator said: “It is my will that the coke trust hereby created shall continue during the natural lives of all of my children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, if any, who shall be living at the date of my death, and of the survivors or survivor of all. said children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, and for and during the further period of twenty-one years next ensuing after the death of the survivor of all said children, grandchildren and great grandchildren, unless said coal shall have been sooner exhausted.” It was said by Mr. Justice Paxson in Smith’s App., <a href="/pa/88/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="88 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="1061267" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0492-01">88 Pa. 492</a>: “It matters not how many lives there may be so that the candles are all burning at the same time, for the life of the longest liver is .but a single life.”</p>

In England it was held originally by Mr. Justice Fry, in the Court of Chancery, in Birmingham Canal Company v. Cartwright, L. R. 11 Ch. D. 421 (1879), that a covenant to give a certain person, his heirs or assigns, the refusal of purchasing certain mines, upon terms and conditions mentioned, at the happening of an event specified, but unlimited as to the time within which that event should occur, was not obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities, because “the total interest in the land, so to speak, is divided between the covenantor and the covenantee, and they can together at any time alienate the land absolutely.” But that decision was ex<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>pressly overruled by the Court of Appeals in the later ease of London &amp; South Western Railway Company v. Gomm., L. R., 20 Ch. D. 562 (1882), where, by deed dated August 10, 1865, after reciting that it was seized in fee simple of certain land which it no longer needed, the plaintiff company conveyed the land to George Powell, in fee simple, but with a covenant in the deed that Powell, his heirs or assigns, would, at any time thereafter, whenever the land might be required for the railway or the works of the company, and whenever thereunto requested by the company on a six calendar months’ notice, upon payment of the price agreed upon, reconvey the land to the company. Powell sold the land to Gomm. In holding that specific performance of the covenant could not be enforced, and after stating that the option could not be construed as requiring an acceptance “within a reasonable time,” because that would be contrary to the intention of the parties, but was to be considered as unlimited in point of time, the Master of the Rolls, Sir George Jessel, said: “If then the rule as to remoteness applies to a covenant of this nature, this covenant clearly is bad as extending beyond the period allowed by the rule. Whether the rule applies or not depends upon this, as it appears to me, does or does not the covenant give an interest in the land? If it is a bare or mere personal contract it is of course not obnoxious to the rule, but in that case it is impossible to see how the present defendant can be bound. He did not enter into the contract, but is only a purchaser from Powell who did. If it is a mere personal contract it cannot be enforced against the assignee. Therefore the company must admit that it somehow binds the lands. But if it binds the land it creates an equitable interest in the land. The right to call for a conveyance of the land is an equitable interest or equitable estate. In the ordinary case of a contract for purchase there is no doubt about this, and an option for repurchase is not different in its nature. A person exercising the option <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>has to do two things, he has to give notice of his intention to purchase, and to pay the purchase-money; but as far as the man who is liable to convey is concerned, his estate or interest is taken away from him without his consent, and the right to take it away being vested in another, the covenant giving the option must give that other an interest in the land. It appears to me therefore that this covenant plainly gives the company an interest in the land, and as regards remoteness there is no distinction that I know of, unless the case falls within one of the recognized exceptions, such as charities, between one kind of equitable interest and another kind of equitable interest. In all cases they must take effect as against the owners of the land within a prescribed period. It was suggested that the rule has no application to any case of contract, but in my opinion the mode in which the interest is created is immaterial. Whether it is by devise or voluntary gift or contract can make no difference.” In a concurring opinion, Sir James Hannen said: “I must say that it appears to me to be a startling proposition that the power to require a conveyance of land at a future time does not create any interest in that land. If it does create such an interest, then it appears to me to be perfectly clear that the covenant in this case violates the rule against perpetuity. This covenant plainly would restrain the future owner from alienating the estate to anybody he pleases, it restricts him to aliening it to the railway company in the. event of the company exercising their option.” Lord Justice Lindley, also concurring, said: “I agree with the observations made by the other members of the court, that this covenant creates an interest in land and is void for remoteness.”</p>

In Winsor v. Mills, in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (1893), <a href="/mass/157/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="157 Mass. 362" data-case-ids="803872" data-case-paths="/mass/157/0362-01">157 Mass. 362</a> (32 N. E. Repr. 352), there was an action to have a trust deed declared void on the ground that it was violative of the rule against perpetuities, which was a proceeding much like the one now before us. It was held there that an agreement which gave to the defendant, and his heirs- and assigns, a right to purchase a portion of land, at fifty cents per square foot, at any time before it otherwise should be sold or disposed of in accordance with the agreement, provided for the possible creation of an estate in lands at some time in the distant future, and clearly came within the rule against perpetuities. In delivering the opinion of the court Mr. Justice Knowlton said: “The mere fact that a contingent interest may be released by persons in being, and that a good title may thus be made, is not enough to take the case out of the rule, if the estate cannot be aliened by those having vested interests in it, because a possible future interest is created which may not vest within the time fixed by law,” citing the Gomm case, and Gray on the Rule against Perpetuities, 198. “Undoubtedly,” said the court, “the fact that the holders of vested interests cannot convey tends to create a perpetuity.” In Starcher v. Duty, in the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia (1907), <a href="/w-va/61/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="61 W.

S.) 913</a>], there was an action to compel specific performance of an option contract to sell real estate. It was held that the contract, made originally for one year, and providing for its extension for another year, and from year to year, by the payment of a stipulated sum annually, was void by the rule against perpetuities. In considering the case Judge Miller said: “It is claimed that this contract partakes of the nature of lease contracts. The answer to this argument, how<a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>ever, is that leases of land like those considered in the authorities cited create vested estates in the lessees, and the covenant for perpetual renewal is one which runs with the land, without any restraint upon the right to alienation by the lessor of his property subject to the lease, and hence the authorities relied on are inapplicable.” After referring to the Gomm case at some length, and to various definitions of a perpetuity, and citing the Massachusetts case, Judge Miller continued: “Where a contract raises an equitable right in property which the obligee can enforce in chancery by a decree for specific performance, such equitable right is subject to the rule against perpetuities. The mere fact that a contingent interest may be released by the persons in being, and that a good title may thus be made, is not enough to take the case out of the rule. Unless, therefore, we can read into this contract some terms of limitation requiring the optionees to exercise the right to take the property within some reasonable time, not too remote, it is clearly within the rule, and must be declared void. To attempt this would be to make a new contract for the parties, for they have provided that the option may be extended annually to an indefinite period, and may be to a time beyond which the rule against perpetuities will not allow. The contract therefore is illegal, and was void from its very inception, and everything done by -either of the parties designed to carry the contract into effect which is auxiliary thereto must be considered as unauthorized and inoperative.”</p>

We cannot conceive of a more violent breach of the rule against perpetuities. Such an impress on land ought not to be sustained, and it cannot be. It isolates the property. It takes it out of commerce. It removed it from the market. It halts improvements. It prevents the land from answering to the needs of growing communities. No homes can be built or towns laid out on land so encumbered, because the land always remains subject to be taken under the option. sIt is not a matter which affects the rights of individuals only. The entire community is interested. The welfare of the public is at stake. It is contrary to the well settled public policy of the state that such an option or right to purchase land should be held to be good. It was for the express purpose of destroying such serious hindrances to material and social prosperity and progress that the rule against perpetuities was brought forth. And the rule must be rigidly enforced. In Coggins’ App., <a href="/pa/124/0010-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="124 Pa. 10" data-case-ids="563106" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0010-01">124 Pa. 10</a>, Mr. Chief Justice Paxson designates the rule against perpetuities as “a rule of property, founded upon the highest considerations of public policy, and too firmly imbedded in our system of jurisprudence to be disturbed save by an act of assembly.” We, therefore, reach the following conclusions of law:</p>

The covenant in question was declared to be void because in violation of the rule against perpetuities. We quite agree with the learned court below that it would be difficult to conceive any case which could be deemed more violative of the rule and a greater hindrance to alienation than the one at bar. The case turns very largely upon the character of the interest in the surface which the optionees took under the covenant. If it was a present, fixed and vested interest in the land the rule against perpetuities would have no application. But is a mere option to purchase land, unlimited as to time and indefinite in duration, which may be exercised in ten years, or in a hundred years, or in a thousand years, or which may never be exercised at all, depending upon the wish or pleasure of the optionee, a present vested interest? To ask this question would seem to answer it. In no proper legal sense can a mere privilege of exercising a future right to purchase be deemed a present vested interest in land. The optionees may never exercise their option, and failing to do so, they would never acquire a vested interest in the land. While the precise question has not been raised or decided in <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>Pennsylvania, other jurisdictions have considered and decided it adversely to the contention of appellants here.

Mills, <a href="/mass/157/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="157 Mass. 362" data-case-ids="803872" data-case-paths="/mass/157/0362-01">157 Mass. 362</a>; Starcher v. Duty, <a href="/w-va/61/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="61 W. Va. 373" data-case-ids="8630340" data-case-paths="/w-va/61/0373-01">61 W. Va. 373</a>. We think the reasoning of these cases is unanswerable and they are cited with approval by this court.</p>
