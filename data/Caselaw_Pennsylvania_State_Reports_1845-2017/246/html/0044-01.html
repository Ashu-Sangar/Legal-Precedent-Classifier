In a suit in equity brought by certain street railway companies to enjoin a county from preventing the plaintiffs from running their ears over a bridge newly erected by the county, the defendant filed a Cross-bill praying for a decree fixing the compensation to be paid by plaintiff for the use of the bridge. It appeared that the plaintiffs and defendant had previously, by agreement, fixed the annual rental to be paid for the use of a former bridge at $600, and that this bridge had been lawfully demolished, and that a new bridge had been- erected by the county at a cost of more than $575,000. The court admitted evidence as to the excess in cost which the building of the new bridge adapted for street railway use as well as for ordinary travel necessitated over what the cost would have been had only ordinary travel been provided for, and found such excess to be $100,000; and further found that the agreement relating to the old bridge was terminated when the bridge was demolished; that the county was not restricted to charging merely a license fee for the use of the new bridge, based upon the increased cost of maintenance, and could charge the railroad companies a reasonable rental; that a rental of $3,000 annually for the first two years, $4,000 annually for the succeeding two years, and $5,000 annually thereafter for the next six years was reasonable, and decreed that the plaintiff be enjoined from using the bridge except upon compliance with these terms. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

This county bridge was demolished and removed,, after having been condemned, in 1910, and a new and larger county bridge was erected in its place. The county of Berks filed a cross-bill, praying for a decree fixing and determining the rental to be paid by the appellants for the use of the new bridge. In dismissing the appellants’ bill and making the decree asked for in the cross-bill, the court found facts and reached legal conclusions as follows :</p>

Co. and the Reading Traction Co., to whom it had leased and whose rights subsequently passed to the United Traction Co. and théreafter to the Reading Transit Co., entered into an agreement with the County of Berks, whereby the latter consented to the construction by the railway companies of a double track railway, to be operated by electricity, with overhead wires, etc., upon and over a county bridge across , the Schuylkill river, known as the Harrisburg bridge (then an iron structure about 1,000 feet long, forty feet wide, having <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>a roadway of twenty-six feet, and erected at a cost of-$150,000) with stipulations that, upon the bridge, the railway companies’ cars should have no preference over other vehicles, and should not be run at a speed of more than four miles an hour, nor more than one car or train of cars at one time — that the county should not be obligated to maintain said bridge for the use of the railway companies or for the purposes of the agreement, and • should not be liable for injury to persons or property resulting from the railway companies’ use of said bridge— and that the railway companies should pay to the county the annual sum of $600 to be applied to keeping the bridge in repair, the payments to be continued as long as the cars of the railway companies should run across or over said bridgé, and a failure so to run them for three consecutive months to be taken as an abandonment of the line and a surrender of the right granted, which was to be exercised within one year or forfeited. The bridge being within the limits of the City of Reading, the consent of the latter to its occupation by the railway companies as indicated was given by resolution of councils approved January 16,1895.</p>

In the meanwhile and before anything was done under the agreement the County of Berks refused to be bound by it, and the railway companies attempting to proceed, applied to this court for an injunction prohibiting them from constructing their tracks upon the bridge. In that proceeding it was found that the bridge was inadequate to support the burden intended to be imposed upon it as well as too narrow to admit of a double track and its operation without undue interference with the general travel and traffic over the bridge, and finally, on August .26, 1895, after requiring the railway companies to strengthen the bridge sufficiently to permit, with safety, the laying and operation of a single track upon it, a decree was made allowing the construction and operation of such single track by the railway companies, on condition of their payment to the county of the annual <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>sum of $600, so long as the track should remain upon the bridge — that cars should be run thereon at a speed not exceeding four miles an hour and that not more than one car or train of cars should be on the bridge at one time — that the railway companies protect the county against liability from their use of it and against any damage to the bridge therefrom, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and that the county should not be obligated to maintain said bridge for the use of the railway companies or the purposes of the railway — and that failure to run cars for three months should be taken as an abandonment and surrender of the rights granted by the decree, etc.</p>

In 1910 the bridge, which in the interval had been used by the railway companies, was condemned as unsafe, and in obedience to notice by the county to the railway companies their traffic over it was stopped, the county agreeing not to treat this as an abandonment of any rights. Pursuant to due and lawful proceedings, and unopposed by the railway companies, the iron bridge was entirely demolished and removed by the county, and a new concrete bridge over 1,300 feet long, eighty feet wide,, having a roadway about sixty feet wide, and costing upwards of $575,000, has been erected. The county and the railway companies have agreed to the latter’s laying of a double track upon the new bridge, without prejudice, however, to any right of the county to pre. scribe new terms and conditions to be observed by the railway companies for that privilege and the operation of the railway on the bridge, or, in the event of a failure <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>to agree thereon, to apply to the court for the imposition of such new terms and conditions upon the railway companies.</p>

The county, by way of condition, has demanded an annual payment by the railway companies of $5,000 for a period of ten years, the amount payable thereafter to be readjusted at the expiration thereof. This demand has been declined by the railway companies, and they have filed their bill to enjoin the county from interfering with their laying and operating a double track upon the new bridge, while the county has filed a cross-bill praying for a decree in accordance with its demand and an injunction against the railway companies prohibiting them from using the new bridge for their purposes until the terms and conditions of their occupancy of it be fixed and determined.</p>

The travel over the bridge is very considerable, and in the natural course of things will become steadily greater • — especially in the event of connections with other lines under the Transit Co.’s control so as to bring their traffic and travel into the city over the bridge.</p>

The subject matter of the agreement of 1893 between the county and the railway companies, and of the suit to No. 606 Equity Docket 1894 and the decree of 1895 made therein, was the bridge structure then existing and the use of the same by the railway companies. Necessarily, by the unavoidable demolition and removal of that structure and destruction of its use for any purpose the agreement was terminated and the decree exhausted, and all rights and liabilities created by either ended; and the right of the railway companies to occupy the present bridge structure became dependent upon new arrangements as to terms and conditions if the county desire to impose such.</p>

When that bridge passed away the agreement of 1893 passed away with it. The learned chancellor below was so manifestly correct as to this that we are not called upon to say anything further upon the subject. When the new and much larger county bridge was erected the appellants had no right to occupy it without, the consent of the county; but that consent could not have been arbitrarily withheld from them: Berks County v. Reading City Passenger Railway Company, et al., <a href="/pa/167/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="167 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="866796" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0102-01">167 Pa. 102</a>. The terms upon which they had the right to use it became a matter of agreement, in the first instance, between them and the county, and when they were unable to agree, the equitable jurisdiction of the court below was properly invoked by the county in its cross-bill, for the purpose of determining the terms and conditions upon which the appellants might use it: Pittsburgh &amp; West End Passenger Railway Company v.

Pittsburgh Railways Company, <a href="/pa/240/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="240 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="993168" data-case-paths="/pa/240/0105-01">240 Pa. 105</a>; and Monongahela Bridge Co. v.

The answer to this is found in the following from the opinion of the court below: “In each of the cases cited a railway company had acquired the right to use with its tracks and cars a toll bridge owned by a corporation upon payment to it of a certain rental, and the city had consented to its occupation of the bridge as part of the highways without imposing any conditions. Subsequently the city had acquired the stock of the bridge company, thereby becoming the owner of the bridge, and declaring it free, reserving no payments from the railway company. It was held that the city could not thereafter exact any rental from the railway company, but was restricted to demanding from it such a license fee as would reasonably cover the cost and expense of repairs, maintenance and supervision required by the extraordinary use to which the structure was subjected — a right vested in it by reason and in the exercise of its police power. The language of the decisions, however, carefully confines them to the case of a right already acquired and lawfully used, as contradistinguished from one to be newly acquired upon terms and conditions imposed by the municipality, and to be used in accordance with them. The power in the latter case to exact something more is nowhere negatived, but explicitly recognized, as in the earlier cases, the intention to disturb which is disavowed, and under <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>which, where they apply, the authority to demand and the obligation to pay are not referable to the police power. As already pointed out, it is with a question of the initial grant of a new right upon original conditions that we have here to do, not with one of a. demand based upon the continued use of a right previously granted and accepted on other, or without, conditions. In passing upon the question here arising the inquiry is whether the county in its demand is exceeding what is fair and reasonable under all the circumstances, so as to make it in effect an attempt arbitrarily to defeat the railway companies’ use of the bridge: see Berks Co. v. Rdg., Etc., Cos., <a href="/pa/167/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="167 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="866796" data-case-paths="/pa/167/0102-01">167 Pa. 102</a>, 115, 118.” On this appeal the real question is whether the compensation fixed by the decree of the court below for the usé of the county bridge by the appellants was based upon proper and competent evidence and is fair and reasonable under all the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b84-4" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[292,1343,1151,1081]],["BL_85.1",85,[162,359,1149,99]]]'>Under the evidence which was considered by the learned chancellor below we find no error in any fact found by him, and the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth assignments are dismissed. The ninth finding is as follows: “The cost of the construction of the new bridge of a width sufficient to permit a double track upon it, has been about $100,000 greater than it would have been had no railway tracks but the ordinary travel only been provided for — and the cost to the railway companies of a bridge of their own adequate for their purposes, having a life of 30 to 35 years would be from $60,000 to about that sum, not including changes of route, new tracks, etc., and the price of land to be taken, and thereto would be added the annual expense of maintenance and repairs.” This fact was pertinently found, and the evidence in support of it, which is complained of by the first, second and third assignments, was properly received as helpful to the court in determining what would be proper compensation for the use of the bridge by the appellants, so constructed by the coun<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>ty as to accommodate their growing needs. The first second and third assignments are overruled.</p>
    <p id="b85-3" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[162,470,1151,1085]]]'>The fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh assignments complain of the admission of evidence as to the compensation paid by the street railway or traction companies in other counties for the use of public bridges. This was not proper testimony for the consideration of the court. The question before it was as to the compensation to be paid for the use of a particular bridge, under all the circumstances surrounding its construction. What might be proper compensation for the use by a trolley company of an entirely different kind of bridge, situated elsewhere, could throw no possible light upon the question of the proper compensation to be paid for the use of the Harrisburg bridge in the City of Reading. But this evidence did the appellants no harm, for the learned chancellor distinctly says, in overruling the exceptions to his findings of fact and conclusions of law, that he gave no consideration whatever to it. Its mere admission does not, therefore, call for a reversal of the decree. In this respect the proceeding below differs from a common law action: Sawtelle’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/84/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="84 Pa. 306" data-case-ids="1053523" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0306-01">84 Pa. 306</a>.</p>

    <p id="b85-5" data-blocks='[["BL_85.7",85,[162,1893,1149,211]]]'>There is nothing in the remaining assignments of error calling for further discussion. The legal conclusions reached by the court below properly followed the facts found, and the decree is affirmed at appellants’ costs.</p>
