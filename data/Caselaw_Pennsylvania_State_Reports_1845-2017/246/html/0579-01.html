Counsel was persistent in pursuing him, and finally after frequent efforts to confer with him, by keeping himself incognito, and representing to the testator’s aunt that he desired to see her about a real estate transaction, she went to his office, and while there was told by counsel that she had more influence over the testator than anybody else, and was threatened that if she did not use. this influence to have her nephew turn over to his mother a part of his money, he would have a guardian appointed for him and cause her to be the central figure of a scandal. This was communicated to the testator by the aunt, and in our judgment shows the reason for the use of his language in the will, when he says, “I am not making this will because it has been said that said party (meaning his aunt) has an undue influence over me, but for love and esteem.”</p>

She had divorced his father, who had left all he had to him. He had bought her a home, which she sold, and she consented to his confinement in jail.

But these are matters about which we have no concern. The law wisely secures equality of distribution where a man dies intestate. But the very object of a will is to produce inequality, and to provide for the wants of the testator’s family; <em>to </em>protect those who are helpless; to reward those who have been affectionate, and to punish those who have been disobedient. It is doubtless true that narrow prejudice sometimes interferes with the wisdom of such arrangements. This is due to the imperfections of our human nature. It must be remembered that in this country a man’s prejudices are a part of his liberty. He has a right to them; he may be unjust to his children or relatives; he is entitled to the control of his property while living, and by will to direct its use after his death, subject only to such restrictions as are imposed by law.

Direct proof of fraud is absent, and “When the effort is to establish undue influence without direct proof upon the point, it cannot be made out by circumstances which, though to be expected if there was fraud, are equally consistent with its absence, and such circumstances cannot, whether taken singly or collectively, justify an inference of wrong doing.” Phillips’ Est., <a href="/pa/244/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="244 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="1003479" data-case-paths="/pa/244/0035-01">244 Pa. 35</a>, quoted from Caughey v.
