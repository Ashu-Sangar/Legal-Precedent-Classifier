      <em>. 1. </em>In an action by a brakeman against his employer, a railroad company, to recover damages for personal injuries, brought under the Act of Congress of April 22,1908, Chap. 149, 35 U. S. Stat. 65, making common carriers engaged in interstate commerce liable in damages to any employee injured, inter alia, by the negligence of another employee of such carrier, it appeared that plaintiff was injured while crossing over the top of box cars of a freight train upon which he was employed. He testified that his fall was due to unusual and violent jerks of the train caused by a speed in excess of twenty-five miles an hour, in violation of a rule of defendant company, and the negligence of the engineer in suddenly and repeatedly applying the brakes. No other witnesses testified to the excessive speed of the train, but four witnesses for the defendant testified that the speed was not in excess of nine miles an hour. It appeared that the average speed of the train for its entire route was sixteen and one-fourth miles an hour, and that the accident happened at the foot of a down grade on a short curve, just at the beginning of an up-grade, and at the end of a stretch of straight track nearly two thousand feet long. The plaintiff’s evidence as to the violent jerks of the train was also contradicted. <em>Held, </em>the weight of the evidence was not so clearly against the plaintiff that the court could withdraw the case from the jury, and a verdict and judgment for plaintiff was sustained.</p>

In such case it could not be held as a matter of law that plaintiff had assumed the risk of the injury from which he suffered, and it was not error for the court to submit the question to the jury with instruction that plaintiff had “assumed all the obvious and open risks of his employment in the ordinary operation of the train on which he worked as brakeman, and also of such risks as <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>to which he had been informed.

The other three were positive however,.and were employees of longer experience than the,plaintiff himself, in train work. If the weight of the. evidence depended solely upon the number of witnesses testifying to the rate of speed, with no reference to other collateral facts and circumstances, this testimony would be very strongly against the .plaintiff. But there are certain significant facts in the case, throwing light on the rate of speed that a heavily loaded train of cars like this, would probably have attained at the place of this accident. There was a stretch of straight track nearly two thousand feet long, down which it appears that the train ran, to the curve at the foot of it, where the accident occurred. Under ordinary running conditions the speed of a train, under such circumstances, would naturally be much accelerated, so that this one would most probably , have attained a rate above its average speed of sixteen and one-fourth miles per hour. Yet the trainmen estimated <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>its speed at the time of the accident, at only half the average rate per hour, at which the train record shows that it had actually travelled during the entire trip. One of the men even fixed the rate, as low as six miles per hour. This would seem to be quite improbable, and the jury may have for that reason, found the fact, against the defendant’s witnesses.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b491-3" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[143,712,1150,877]]]'>Under such circumstances, it was clearly for the jury to determine the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight to be given to their testimony and the court cannot reverse its finding. The plaintiff was a.much interested party. All the other witnesses as to speed and the application of the brakes, were employees of the defendant, and possibly influenced by that fact. There was some contradictory evidence as to where the upgrade began. Some of the defendant’s witnesses placed it farther west than the point fixed by the plaintiff. The civil engineer of the road fixes the up-grade at about one foot per mile going eastward at the point where the accident occurred. These differences in the testimony as to the actual grade, and as to the speed of the train at the time of the accident, were necessarily submitted to the. jury at the trial.</p>

The court cannot, under such circumstances set up its own individual judgment against the findings of the jury as to the weight of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses, nor can it arbitrarily adopt the testimony of a majority of the witnesses as conclusive: Hitler v.

Hartman, the appellee, was employed as a brakeman by the Western Maryland Railway Company, engaged in interstate commerce. On November 7, 1912, he went to Gettysburg, this State, under orders to report <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>for duty on a freight train, which left that place before daybreak on the following morning for Port Covington, Maryland. The train was a long one, drawn by two locomotives. Before it left Gettysburg the appellee and another brakeman went into the caboose with the consent of the conductor, who told them they would have to leave it and go forward before the train reached Hanover. As it approached the town of New Oxford, not far from Hanover, shortly before three o’clock in the morning, the appellee and the other brakeman left the caboose and went forward, crossing over the tops of box cars. While doing so the appellee fell or was jolted from the top of one of them, and, falling between two of them, was so severely injured that it was necessary to amputate his right foot. In this action, brought under the Act of Congress of April 22, 1908, he bases his right to recover on what he alleges was the negligence of the engineer of the train in running it at an excessive rate of speed and in suddenly putting on the brakes while it was passing around a curve, causing the jolt or jar which threw him to the ground. The case went to the jury on these two allegations of negligence, and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, upon which judgment was duly entered. "</p>

This testimony was sufficient to send the case to the jury under the federal statute, for, if <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>believed, it showed the negligent operation of the train by the engineer, in violation of one of the express rules of the company, to have been the direct cause of the injuries sustained by the appellee. It is, however, earnestly insisted by learned counsel for appellant that the appellee had not shown himself qualified to testify to the rate of the train’s speed, and that even if he had done so, in view of the positive contradiction of his testimony by a number of competent witnesses called by the defendant, who testified advisedly as to the rate of speed at which the train was running, a verdict ought to have been directed for the defendant. Why this could not have been done appears in the brief, but clear, opinion of the learned president judge of the court below, denying a new trial and overruling the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, and on that opinion the second, third and fourth assignments are dismissed.</p>

This assignment does not call for a reversal of the judgment. In his charge to the jury the learned trial judge specifically referred to the fact that the testimony of the plaintiff as to the rate of the train’s speed was but an expression of his own individual judgment, in which, he was not corroborated by any one; and as against his testimony the attention of the jury was called to that of the two engineers, the fireman and the other brakeman, that the rate of speed was less than nine miles an hour.
