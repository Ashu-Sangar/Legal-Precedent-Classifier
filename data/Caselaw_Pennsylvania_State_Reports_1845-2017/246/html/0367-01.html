On the space intervening between the <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>fence and the track there was a watch box, four and a half feet square that stood one foot and a half from the fence; Beyond this box there was an unobstructed view south of several hundred feet. The plaintiff had crossed the railroad at this place almost daiíy for many years and he had full knowledge of the situation and of its danger. When the automobile was fifty-four feet from the first track it was stopped and the plaintiff, after listening for a train directed the chauffeur to go on. When about ten feet from the first track he heard a warning cry from someone on the street and in looking south he saw a train approaching on the second track and he jumped from his seat. Before the automobile was stopped it ran to the first track and across it and across the space seven feet wide between the tracks and the front end of its frame and one of its fenders and its radiator came in contact with the engine. The automobile was not overturned but because of the impact with the engine or because the chauffeur reversed it, it ran back and the plaintiff was knocked, down and run over by it. A verdict was directed for the defendant on the ground of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence.</p>
