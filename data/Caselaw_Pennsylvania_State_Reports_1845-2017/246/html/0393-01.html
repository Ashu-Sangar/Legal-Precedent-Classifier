The agreement of May 12, 1886, above referred to did not provide that the title to No. 906 North Broad street should be cleared of encumbrances at the expense of Mary Elton, Mrs. Meurer and Mrs. Davis. That is, however, what is contended for by the plaintiffs in the cross-bill. Mrs. Meurer and Mrs. Davis, with their husbands and their unmarried sister, it is true, agreed that this property should be conveyed to Mrs. Stokes. But they did not hold the title. This was vested in the trustee under their father’s will. They had no more power to control its transfer, or the encumbrances upon it, than had Mrs. Stokes and her husband. The undertaking that the trustee should clear up the encumbrances and then convey it was no more binding on them than it was on her. Mrs. Stokes as well as her sisters covenanted that this property should be conveyed clear of encumbrance. Who could convey it? Nobody but the trustee. Who, thereforé, was to pay off the encumbrance upon it? Manifestly the same person, the trustee under Anthony Elton’s will. The expenditure for this purpose was to be made primarily by the estate. While it was expressly stipulated that Mrs. Stokes should not be charged with any deduction from her share in her father’s estate “by reason of this agreement,” it is not claimed that it was intended that her sisters should be <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>charged with the value of the Broad street property. If they ought not to be charged with that, it cannot consistently be held that they should bear the expense involved in clearing its title of liens. Naturally,- therefore, the cost of doing so would ultimately fall on the four shares in the estate in equal proportions, unless it resulted from a suit in which the estate had been involved on account of Ellis Stokes. How much of this expenditure was charged against Mrs. Stokes is not clearly averred, and it is impossible from the meagre reference made by the cross-bill to the judgment or decree in the United States Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to say whether or not it was connected with the litigation in which Mr. Elton was involved on account of Ellis Stokes. Merely to say that it was unjust and illegal to charge the amount paid out in this way against the principal of the share in which the plaintiffs in the cross-bill are interested as remaindermen, is not enough. The illegality and injustice of the charge must be shown by sufficient explanatory averments, and these are wanting.</p>

The facts above referred to, if they had the importance attached to them by the cross-bill, would be relevant only as bearing on the question of the relative proportion of the share that each of the parties in the case owns in the estate of Anthony Elton. That such is the view of the plaintiffs in the cross-bill appears by their first three prayers. Matters of that kind, however, may and should be set up by way of answer, and they have thus in fact been brought before the court in these very proceedings. A cross-bill should not be filed where no discovery is sought, and where the matters in defense thereby set up are equally available by answer, since in such a case it would not only be unnecessary but useless.
