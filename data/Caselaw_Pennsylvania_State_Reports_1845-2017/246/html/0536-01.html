Voluntary manslaughter is a homicide or killing intentionally committed Under the influence of pas<a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>sion. The term passion as here used includes both anger and terror, provided they reach a degree of intensity sufficient to obscure temporarily the reason of the person affected. Passion, as used in defining manslaughter, means any of the emotions of the mind known as anger, rage, sudden resentment or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection. Although anger is the passion usually existing in cases of this class yet there are other passions, as sudden resentment or terror, rendering the mind incapable of cool reflection — reducing the grade of the crime. Passion which will reduce homicide to manslaughter consists either of anger or terror— terror from the belief on the part of the slaughterer that his life is in danger is sufficient, although his belief may be unfounded, as for instance, if you were sitting quietly in your home and some one were to come in and, even though joking, by means of his action and threats, that he did not mean to carry into execution, if he raised in your mind such a condition of sudden terror as that your passions were suddenly aroused and your reason, in a way, dethroned, and even though he did not mean to do you an injury you were instantly, under those circumstances, to take his life, the killing might be unlawful but it would not be malicious and would not be murder and would be manslaughter. Tn this case, if you find the killing was not justifiable and was unlawful but without malice and the shot was fired by the defendant under the influence of sudden anger or passion caused by an assault of the deceased or by the threatening manner he approached the defendant or under the influence of terror caused by threats made by the deceased, then the crime would not be murder but would be manslaughter.</p>

Thus, if there be sufficient provocation in the first instance and passion such as we have described has <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>been aroused and yet after that there has been time for the passion to pass away and the mind to become cool and reason to resume its sway, then, although the provocation previously existed, the passion is not present and the offense, if life is taken, is not manslaughter but murder. And although the passions may have been aroused, if it were.on a trivial matter and the provocation were not sufficient to warrant such passion, then the killing would not be manslaughter but murder. To justify a conviction of manslaughter and not murder the death must have occurred in the heat of blood and on immediate provocation, there having been no previous malice.”</p>

Croson, <a href="/pa/243/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="243 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="1001619" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0019-01">243 Pa. 19</a>. In the first assignment of error presented in this appeal, it is alleged that the trial court erred in overruling defendant’s challenge for cause, of one of the jurors, who admitted that he held an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant, formed from the previous reading of an account of the case. Upon examination, however, the juror stated that he would be able to render such a verdict as would be warranted by the evidence, unaffected by the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>opinion which he held. This brought him within the limits of the established test, and the exercise of the discretion of the lower court which had the juror before it, will not be disturbed. Com. v. Minney, <a href="/pa/216/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="216 Pa. 149" data-case-ids="950346" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0149-01">216 Pa. 149</a>; Com. v.

    <p id="b569-3" data-blocks='[["BL_569.5",569,[145,613,1151,703]]]'>In the second assignment of error, complaint is made by counsel, that the trial court erred in refusing a motion to withdraw a juror and continue the case, for the alleged reason that one of the jurors had slept during a portion of the time, at the trial. Opportunity was given to counsel to take testimony in support of this allegation, but no proof was produced. The investigation of the matter, by the trial judge satisfied him that there was no merit in the suggestion that the juror in question was asleep, during any portion of the trial, or that he failed to take in anything of importance. That the discretion of the trial court was properly exercised in this matter, we have no reason to doubt.</p>
    <p id="b569-4" data-blocks='[["BL_569.6",569,[143,1326,1154,1081]],["BL_570.1",570,[299,334,1147,535]]]'>In the third assignment of error, counsel for appellant complain that in the cross-examination of the witness Mormon, the district attorney went beyond the scope of the direct-examination. We do not see that it went farther than was required to bring out the whole truth with reference to the subject of the inquiry. Nor does it appear that the trial judge in commenting upon this testimony made it any stronger than he was warranted in doing. He cautioned the jury that they were to take their own recollection of the testimony, and not that of counsel, or of the court. The criticism of the trial judge, for his definition of voluntary manslaughter, which appears in the fifth and sixth specifications of error, is without justification. The definition which he gave was an ample one. Nor does the suggestion in the seventh assignment, that the court unduly minimized the testimony as to the shots which were fired outside the house, before the shooting occurred inside, seem to us to merit any serious consideration. Upon the former appeal, we expressed the opinion that the interests of <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>justice required fuller instructions to the jury upon the rights of a householder to defend himself against a violent intruder. Upon the last trial the court met this suggestion by dwelling fully upon this phase of the case, and the result is, that counsel for appellant now complain of the extent of. the instruction, and of the detailed illustrations 'that were given. It would seem that in this particular it is difficult to satisfy the requirements of counsel. Their complaint is in this respect, somewhat captious, and is not well founded.</p>
    <p id="b570-4" data-blocks='[["BL_570.5",570,[299,878,1147,426]]]'>In the ninth assignment, an extract from the charge is presented which is alleged to have been erroneous. Wherein it was incorrect does not appear. . It was merely a recital of the substance of the testimony of two of the witnesses. This evidence was properly a subject of argument for the jury, but it presents no question of law which properly calls for consideration upon our part.</p>
    <p id="b570-5" data-blocks='[["BL_570.6",570,[298,1316,1163,912]]]'>Upon the case as a whole, we find that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth, contained the ingredients necessary to constitute murder of the first degree. Beyond this inquiry it is not our duty, or our province to go. We are not to review the facts in order to determine the question of guilt or innocence. That was for the jury. Appellant has had the benefit of a second trial, very carefully conducted, and has been afforded full opportunity to present the facts upon which he relied, as a defense. His counsel have been untiring in his behalf, and have exerted themselves with a zeal that has gone to the extreme. limit, in invoking the aid of. every possible legal position which they deemed might be of advantage to the defendant. The microscopic scrutiny of the record by counsel for appellant has not resulted in presenting to us anything which we feel can fairly be regarded as erroneous in the trial of the case.</p>
