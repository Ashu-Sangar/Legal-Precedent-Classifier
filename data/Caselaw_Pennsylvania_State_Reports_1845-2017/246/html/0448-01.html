The award was confirmed by the court but the administrators failed to make payment. The court ordered the accountants to pay the holders of the decedent’s promissory notes their respective ratable proportions. On appeal to the Supreme Court the decree of the lower court was held void for uncertainty. The lower court then entered a decree showing definitely the parties to whom the money was payable and the amount payable to each, with interest from the date of the final confirmation of the auditor’s report and directed payment. <em>Held, </em>no error.</p>

H. Overbaugh, et al., upon which decedent is joint maker,” was finally confirmed on the 2d day of December, 1907. Said administrators having failed to make said payments, Wm. H. Overbaugh, on the 11th day of March, 1912, petitioned the court for an order upon them, either to pay said award to him for payment to the parties holding said notes, or to pay the sum to said holders directly. The testimony taken in support of said petition showed the. dates and amounts of the notes in question, the names of the payees, and that Wm. BE. Overbaugh, George D. Gitt, Carl Erdman, and John Krug were the four joint makers who had paid said notes in full, without any contribution toward their payment by the de<a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>cedent, who was also a joint maker of the same, or by his estate.</p>

H. Overbaugh, et al., had severally contributed to the payment of the notes in question. Said court, therefore, held that the petitioner should be required “to show definitely the parties to whom the money is payable, and the amount payable to each. When this , is done a decree can be entered requiring its payment by the administrator.” This has now been done. The undisputed evidence, since taken, shows that the notes , in question, on which the decedent, Jesse Forry, was joint maker with Wm. H. Overbaugh, George D. Gitt, Carl Erdman, and John Krug, were paid in full by the.four last named parties, by the contribution of equal amounts by each of them for that purpose. The total face value of said notes was $10,900,00, and the total of principal and interest paid by said parties thereon was,$11,319.00. The several,notes, and the checks used to pay them were produced. Wm. BE. Overbaugh, Carl Erdman, George D.
