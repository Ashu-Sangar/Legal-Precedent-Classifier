At the trial on an indictment for murder, it appeared that defendant met deceased in a street; that defendant who had a shoe box under his arm, walked up to deceased, pulled a pistol from the box, shot deceased twice and then turned and started to run, when he fired a third shot. The shots killed deceased. The Commonwealth did not prove a motive for the killing. The defense was that defendant was insane when he fired the shots, and evidence was offered that he was the subject of insane delusions that people were trying to poison him and that his wife had been unfaithful to him. The trial, judge charged the jury to the efEect that if by reason of insanity the defendant did not know the difference between right and wrong, that his mind was so diseased in relation to these delusions that there was an irresistible, overwhelming force driving him on and impelling him to commit the crime, he was entitled to an acquittal, but that if they, should not so find, then they should take into consideration the circumstances of the shooting with a view to determining whether defendant was guilty and the degree of guilt, if any. The jury found a verdict of guilty of murder of the second degree, upon which sentence was passed. Held, no error.</p>

Y., and he has fully described the course of the bullet, or bullets, after they entered the body of the deceased, causing in his judgment almost instant death. The doctor also arrived at the store before the deceased expired. His evidence upon that subject is as follows: “Q. Did you arrive there before Mr. Hern died? A. Yes. Q. Describe his condition when you arrived. A. Mr. Hern was lying on the floor; I should say he breathed about three or four times. He was practically dead — pulseless. Q. How long after you arrived there was it before you pronounced him dead? A. Oh, it couldn’t have been two minutes. Q. About what time in the day was that? A. I should judge it was between 12: 00 and 12:30. Q. Then the body, as I understand, was taken to the undertaking establishment over in <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>Waverly, or South Waverly? A. Waverly. Q. Who, any one, assisted you in performing the autopsy? A. Dr. Harry Fish of Sayre.” It will not be necessary to read all of his testimony on that subject, but he was asked this question, after describing the course of the bullets: “Q. Are you able to state, doctor, what caused the death of Mr. Hern? A. Yes, sir. Q. What caused his death? A. Bullet wound of the heart. Q. Were the bullets marked there in your presence, that you took from the body and from the clothing? A. Yes, sir.”</p>

He said that it was such a marked condition of mind that would lead a man irresistibly to commit crime. “He said to me he wanted to right a wrong”; that is, he asked him why he committed this act, and the defendant said to him he “wanted to right a wrong,” and said at first he only intended to hurt him, and that after the first shot he “went wild” and didn’t know what he did. That is the statement of Dr. Eeed — that at first he only intended to hurt him, but after the first shot he “went wild” and then <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>didn’t know what he did.

This is characterized by certain delusions, which will produce an irresistible impulse to kill.” Upon cross-examination he said his delusions were that people were trying to kill him; and then he also referred to this delusion about the relations with his wife twenty years ago at Antrim; and he says in his judgment as a professional man that it is incurable.</p>

A number of witnesses, as I have gone over the testimony, I have called to your attention, who have testified to the defendant’s good reputation. Now, the application of that evidence is this: the presumption is that the defendant is a person of good reputation, and in considering the testimony offered by the defendant to reinforce this presumption all reasonable doubts are to be resolved in favor of the defendant. The defendant has called several witnesses — neighbors and acquaintances, who testified to his good reputation and character as a law-abiding citizen. This evidence is to be weighed and considered in connection with the other evidence in the case, and. to be given due weight and <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>consideration in determining the facts in this case which are submitted to you. The law presumes every person sound and sane — that being the normal condition, and when insanity of the defendant is set up as a defense, it is incumbent on the defendant to rebut the word “presumption of sanity” and show by fairly preponderating evidence that he was insane at the time of committing the alleged crime.

In determining that question, gentlemen, take into consideration his flight. The evidence shows that he immediately started to run away, and he was pursued by the officers, who fired a revolver in the air several times before they were able to overtake the defendant; that he was overtaken somewhere down by the railroad track, and was thrown upon the ground, and resisted in the first instance, arrest. Also take into consideration while he was running away he threw away the box that he had, in the course of his flight. Also take into consideration that he had two revolvers, loaded-one a 32 caliber, I think, containing five, and another one, a 38 caliber, containing six chambers, also he was well supplied with cartridges. Something has been said in the course of the arguments about some of the cartridges being wound with paper. You will have the privi<a id="p417" href="#p417" data-label="417" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*417</a>lege of taking these ont with you, and examining them. You will observe in the revolver where three are discharged, are those cartridges that are wound with paper, that were used on this occasion. You will have them out with you and you can examine them for yourselves. Take those matters all into consideration. Also take into consideration when was it, if the defendant had these two revolvers in the box, (I think one of the witnesses describes — perhaps the chief of police) that he saw him take the revolver out of the box — if he had these two revolvers in the box when he fired the shot that killed the deceased, when did he take the other revolver out and put it in his pocket? Take those circumstances all into consideration. Also take into consideration in determining this question that when in the lock-up he took his cousin to one side and asked him to come in alone, so that he could give him this one revolver that he had in the lock-up there, and his cousin informed someone else of it ard they went in and got it. Take into consideration also his statement to Dr. Reed, when he was examining him — talking with him — that at first he didn’t intend to kill him but only to injure him, but after he fired the first shot he then became excited or mad and didn’t know what he was doing. Take that all into consideration — take all the facts and all the circumstances into consideration in determining whether or not the defendant is guilty; and if guilty, what crime he has committed under the law and under the evidence. Of course, it makes no difference what the crime was that he committed if, at the time, he didn’t know, by reason of insanity, the difference between right and wrong; that his mind was so diseased he could not form an intention to take life; or that if he did know the difference between right and wrong, was his mind so diseased, in relation to these delusions, that there was that irresistible, overwhelming force driving him on and impelling him to commit this crime, and he hadn’t the power or the intelligence to resist. If you. find that to he true, <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>we think he is entitled to an acquittal on the ground of insanity.</p>

The first two assignments of error complain of the charge of the court as being misleading and unfair. It covers fifty-eight pages of printed matter, and we have not been persuaded that the learned judge failed to fully instruct the jury on any feature of the case, or that the charge is open to the criticism contained in the second assignment. The remaining seven assignments, complaining of rulings on offers of evidence, and of the refusal to allow a question asked a juror on his voir dire, are equally without merit, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
