The defendant, owner of the Pine lots adjoining plaintiff’s land on the east, contends that the western boundary of the Pine lots is the Lackawanna river, that there is no space between them and the river, that the land in dispute is contained within the Pine lots and therefore belongs to the defendant. The sole issue in this case therefore is to determine whether or not the Lackawanna river is the western boundary of Pine lots Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6 which, if they run to the river, include the land in dispute. If the Lackawanna river is the western boundary of these lots, the plaintiff has no title to the land in question. If it is not, the defendant has no title.</p>

The plaintiff disputes this and contends that the Pine lots must be located on the ground by the courses and distances given in the surveys which places this western boundary some distance east, of the river. The western line of the Pine lots as contended for by the plaintiff, is not marked upon the ground by any natural or artificial monuments. Before attempting to determine the western boundary of the Pine lots it is necessary to have in mind the rule of law which governs in the location of land. It is stated in 4 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 2 Ed., page 764, as follows: “Natural monuments are objects permanent in character which are found upon the land as they were placed by nature, such as streams, lakes, and ponds, shores and beaches, also highways and streets, walls, fences, trees, hedges, springs and rocks, and the like.</p>

Consequently, wher<a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>ever natural monuments, referred to in the description of a deed as marking the boundary, can be found, they fix the limits of the premises granted, though they correspond neither with the courses and distances, nor with the quantity of the land given in the same descriptions.” The same principle is laid down in 5 Cyc. 918: “In the absence of marked and established boundaries, natural objects called for as the boundary of a survey, being more certain and permanent, control calls for courses and distances; but this rule will not be enforced when either the instrument itself or the clearly expressed intention of the parties would be thereby defeated, or when the rejection of a call or calls for natural objects would reconcile other parts of the description and leave enough to identify the land.” In Leading Cases in the American Law of Real Property, Sharswood and Budd’s Edition, Vol. 4, page 357, we have the following statement of the rule: “The first rule is that, where there is a conflict between monuments, whether natural or artificial, and the courses and distances named in a deed, the former must control and the distances must be contracted or extended and the courses deflected so as to accord with the monument.”</p>

By reason of imperfection of instruments, as well as inéqualities of surface and carelessness of assistants, extreme accuracy is not to be attained by the compass and chain; while, on the other hand, calls for natural objects, or, what is much-the same, known and established lines of contiguous tracts, admit of perfect certainty. When a vendor, therefore, conveys.by established landmarks, the subject of the <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>grant will neither overrun nor fall short of them.

We are supported in this view by the opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart in Collins v. Clough, <a href="/pa/222/0472-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="222 Pa. 472" data-case-ids="959415" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0472-01">222 Pa. 472</a>, where, on page 481, he says: “With the question of priority of location settled, it would yet remain with the plaintiffs to show that the original location of the warrants under which they claim, embraces the disputed territory. The law indicates in no uncertain way the kind of evidence required for the purpose, and makes clear distinction between what is best and what but secondary. Involved in the very idea of priority is that of separate individual location. We are then dealing here with a survey actually made of an independent, separate member of an established block. Such a survey is to be located by the work of the surveyor found upon the ground, if it can be traced; in other words, by its own marks and monuments, aided, if need be, by the legal presumptions: Ferguson v. Bloom, <a href="/pa/144/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="144 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="823774" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0549-01">144 Pa. 549</a>. Where admitted marks and monuments are found answering to the calls of the survey they establish conclusively the location. As has been said, these are the official footsteps of the deputy surveyor, and are therefore the highest and best-evidence of the true location. If some only of these original marks-and monuments can be found, it is. entirely competent to show that others, answering to the calls did at one time exist, and where. If the testimony fails to supply them all, the legal presumption will supply those unaccounted for. It is only in the absence of such marks upon the ground, and the total failure of the evidence to supply them, that recourse can be had to the lines and calls of the block, or the lines and calls of any <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>junior member of that block or any other. Both these methods cannot be resorted to at the same time: Ferguson v. Bloom, <a href="/pa/144/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="144 Pa. 549" data-case-ids="823774" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0549-01">144 Pa. 549</a>; Grier v. Penna.

In this conclusion we are supported by our Pennsylvania decisions. In Klingensmith v. Ground, <a href="/watts/5/0458-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts 458" data-case-ids="1844000" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0458-01">5 Watts 458</a>, the court say: “A corner tree is not always to be had where it is wanted, and where that is the case, it is the practice to mark the next convenient one, leaving the exact point of intersection to be determined by an extension of the lines, as marked on the ground. Where a running stream is called for, it is always understood that the ownership extends to low water mark, and so far has this been held in Pennsylvania, that a traverse line has been held, technically to pursue the meanders, so as to include the points that would otherwise be thrown out by it. Though the words ‘near the creek,’ strictly speaking, imply the existence of space betwixt the object immediately expressed, and the object of reference beyond it, they indicate, in popular meaning, no more than the whereabout. Such is the general rule and what is there to take the case out of it? If the words ‘thence up the creek north,’ do not call for the creek as a boundary, why was the creek mentioned at all? The argument on the other side is, that the course being also given, no more is necessary to close the survey. But if the course were sufficient to express the whole intent, we are unable to conjecture why a natural object should have been employed.” In Younkin v. Cowan, <a href="/pa/34/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="34 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="417939" data-case-paths="/pa/34/0198-01">34 Pa. 198</a>, on page 200, Woodward, Judge, delivering the opinion of the court lays down the following rule: “That lines actually marked on the ground constitute the survey of a land warrant and control the surveyor’s return, even where that calls for a natural or other fixed boundary; and that where lines are not actually run and marked on the ground the survey is to be carried to its calls of adjoiners, even though it overrun the distances returned on the survey, are fixed and familiar rules of property that are not questioned in this case.” In Wharton v.

In the draft “Down Lackawanna” is used with reference to Pine lots 4 and 5 in the Same relation as “No. 3,” “No. 36” and “No. 6” are used. - Therefore, from the draft, the conclusion is irresistible that “Down Lackawanna” is a call just as “No. 3,” “No. 36” and “No. 6” are calls.

The draft of the survey returned is made out according to the courses and distances actually run and marked upon the ground, and not made to call for the river on any side or point whatever. At some distance from the survey, however, the Allegheny river is laid down upon a straight line without any regard to its meanders, as if it were intended by the artist merely to show that the land included within the survey lay near to the river.”</p>

Garvin is distinguished in the following reference by Agnew : “The diagram exhibited no protraction to the river, and the closing line was represented as a straight line of 238 perches long, leaving a large vacancy between it and the river. The return did not call for the river as a boundary, but it was represented at some distance off with the words written within representation, ‘up Allegheny.’ ” The opinion was written by Justice Thompson, the present Chief Justice, who was careful to distinguish the case upon its facts. He remarked that generally a survey is to be <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>carried to its calls unless there are actual lines on the ground excluding them; that a call to stand as a boundary must be indicated to be such with sufficient certainty to show that it was so intended. The representation of an object at a distance from a closing line without any words indicative of an intent to make it a boundary would hardly be sufficient to constitute it such. The line plotted at a distance would have little weight, he remarked, if the river had been made the call, and as it is not so made in terms and appears to be excluded by the draft, it is a circumstance of controlling influence, as held in Kelly v. Graham, supra. Thus it was the Intent' of the surveyor (appearing clearly in the return of survey) to bound the survey on the 238 perch line, and not on the river, which controlled the decision. Instead of impugning the general doctrine the case supports it, and the judge remarked: “We are predisposed to presume the existence of an intent to bound surveys on navigable waters by the stream, not only on account of the supposed advantage arising from such location, but because it is in accordance with practice.”</p>
