It was a profitable business, which, under our decisions, justified taxation of at least so much of the building, in which the school is conducted, as is devoted to the purpose of this business, because it is obvious that the sale of tobacco, for example, is outside the function of the conduct of the school for the children re<a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>ferred to in the record. The effect of the sale of food or meals to the school children (Cf. White v.

It has been uniformly held, in the construction of the statute, that exemption does not result from the fact that profits, realized in what may be called the business activity of the institution, are devoted to its charitable purposes: American Sunday-School Union v. Phila., supra; U. of P. Christian Assn. v. Phila., supra.

It also adjoins St. Agnes’s Church and is occupied by the rector, his assistants and servants. It appears to be conceded, as it must be, that the rectory would not be exempt, if dissociated from the school: Article IX, section 1, Constitution, supra; Act of March 17, 1925, P. L. 30, supra; City of Pittsburgh v. The Third Presbyterian Church, <a href="/pa-super/10/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="10 Pa.

Exemption is claimed, however, on the ground that the rector of the parish is required<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> to perform certain duties in the school. Father York testified that instruction in “church history and catechism, anything that pertains to the Catholic church” was given “twice a week <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>either by myself or the assistant rector......” The chancellor found that “this [school] building adjoins the rectory, connects with it by a doorway and a short flight of steps at the second floor level”; that “the rector of the church is also the principal of the St. Agnes’s Parochial School. He uses one room in the rectory for his office as principal.” The school had six teachers, nuns or sisters. Even if the rectory be considered as devoted to two uses, — (a) as the residence of the rector of the church, (b) as the residence of, and containing the office of, the principal of the school, — it is taxable as a rectory. While faculty residences which are an integral part of an institution of learning are exempt (Northampton Co. v. Lafayette College, <a href="/pa/128/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="128 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="567106" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0132-01">128 Pa. 132</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20A.%20516" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="18 A. 516">18 A. 516</a>; White v. Smith, supra), the coordinate use for a purpose disentitling the building to exemption, is a bar to the exercise of the equitable jurisdiction asserted. Claims for partial exemption must, in the first instance, be presented to the board of revision, with the right of appeal, as has been stated.</p>

Barber, supra, we said: “Part of the building is used solely by the church, and part is rented out for school purposes. The rooms being all under the same roof makes no difference in principle. The parts rented, and producing income are liable to taxation. There is in fact no express warrant in the act for dividing the building for purposes of taxation and exempting any part of it when other parts produce income. But such division was sustained by Judge Allison in Association v. Donohugh, 7 W. N. 208, upon grounds of equity and the broad intent of the statute and has been received with general acquiescence.” See, also, Board of Home Missions v. Phila., <a href="/pa/266/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="266 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="1056046" data-case-paths="/pa/266/0405-01">266 Pa. 405</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20A.%20664" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="109 A. 664">109 A. 664</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> Since that time the practice of exempting part of a building from taxation has become common and the right to judicial review has been provided by the legislature.
