Nothing further was done by anyone until seven months later when on December 10, 1929, the Commonwealth produced the original bond and filed a photostatic copy thereof, together with a detailed affidavit of default, with the prothonotary of Northumberland County and thereupon the prothonotary entered judgment in favor of the Commonwealth and against the brewery and surety company for the sum of $10,000.</p>

The bond on its face shows that it was given under the authority of section 8 of Act No. 3 (47 P. S. section 128), which calls for a bond executed to the Commonwealth, “and a warrant of attorney to confess judgment in the penal sum of ten thousand dollars, with surety to be approved by the board, which bond shall be conditioned for the faithful observance of all the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the manufacture......of intoxicating liquors, and the conditions of the permit,......” Nothing in this act calls for a preliminary forfeiture or proof of failure of the principal to observe and comply with the laws and the permit before the warrant of attorney to confess judgment in the sum of $10,000 can be exercised. The recitals in the bond do not purport to express any other intention of the parties than that this bond was given pursuant to section 8 authorizing the entry of judgment by the commonwealth at any time after the delivery of the bond, and we will not presume in a case like this and in an equitable proceeding that the intention of the parties was to execute a bond, not as the law required, but with such terms that the hands of the Commonwealth would be tied in the event of a violation of its laws and the conditions of the permit. “Where a bond is given under the authority of a statute in force when it is executed, in the absence of anything appearing to show a different intention it will be presumed that the intention of the parties was to execute such a bond as the law required, and such statute constitutes a part of the bond as if incorporated in it, and the bond must be construed in connection with the statute and the construction given to the statute by the courts. Such a bond must be given the effect which in <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>reason must have been intended by the statute”: 9 C.

In the present case,......the warrant authorized any attorney of record to enter judgment ‘after default.’ No averment of default was filed nor is there anything tending to indicate such delinquency, ......Accordingly, on the face of the record, no default is apparent. Under these circumstances it was necessary, before a valid judgment could be entered, to file an averment stating in what respect a default had occurred.” See also Purvis v.

Neither the bond nor the statute under which the bond was given provides a method of forfeiting the bond. The method of forfeiture is provided by the general rules and regulations prescribed by the Pennsylvania Alcohol Permit Board pursuant to the provisions of section 17 of the Act of 1926. Article XYI, section 1 (b) of the rules and regulations provides that upon revocation of the permit of any person for violation of any law relating to intoxicating liquors, the board shall submit proof of such violation, by United States mail or personally, to the surety on the bond to the Commonwealth, and shall notify the surety that the bond is therefore forfeited and the amount therein stated due and payable. Counsel for the board shall thereupon enter judgment on the bond and proceed to recover the amount stated.” The power to forfeit is vested in the board as incidental to the power conferred by statute, namely, to hold hearings and to make findings of a violation of the condi<a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>tions of the bond and to suspend and to revoke its permits when there is proof of failure of the principal to faithfully execute it in accordance with law (section 18 and section 13 of Act No. 3). By section 17 of the act they are authorized to make and promulgate appropriate rules and regulations for carrying into effect the provisions of the act. Extrajudicial bodies have the powers conferred on them by statute and also such powers as are implied necessarily from the grant of statutory powers. See Day v. Public Service Commission et al., <a href="/pa/312/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="312 Pa. 381" data-case-ids="1150685" data-case-paths="/pa/312/0381-01">312 Pa. 381</a>.</p>

Besides, how could the United States prove any particular amount of damages to have been sustained by them in a suit on this bond? What do they lose? It would be difficult, I think, by any course of proof, or any process of reasoning, to show that the United States had sustained any particular amount of damages in a case of this description, or to adopt any rule by which the damages could be measured by a jury, or be liquidated by agreement between the parties. The sum, for which the parties are to become bound, is manifestly a penalty <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>or forfeiture, inflicted by the sovereign power for a breach of its laws. It is not a liquidated amount of damages due upon a contract, but a fixed and certain punishment for an offense.
