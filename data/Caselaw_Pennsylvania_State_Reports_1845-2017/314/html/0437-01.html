    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[280,1321,1159,533]]]'>When testator made the will, the immediate objects of his bounty were his third wife (the life tenant), an expected child, and the appellant, an adult daughter by his first wife; before the codicil was executed, the child had died. Testator devised his residence to his widow in fee; devised his real estate at Bay Head, received from his second wife, to her sons in fee; personal property of a genealogical interest, he gave to a cousin; the remainder of his personal property in his residence, he gave to his widow. To his daughter, the appellant, he gave $15,000.</p>

But the court must give effect to the words of the will, which leave no support for the inferences suggested by appellants. Testator prescribed what his daughter (who was not disinherited) and his widow should receive; the language employed had a well-recognized meaning; if he did not anticipate and provide for a contingency possibly arising in the ultimate distribution of his widow’s estate, the court may not make another will for him: Cf.

His direction “to pay over [on the death of his wife] the principal of my said residuary estate to such persons and for such estates as the same would go to and vest in, under the Intestate Laws of Pennsylvania had I died intestate,” clearly designates her, in the light of the then settled rule, as a member of the class entitled, and, as there is no clear expression of contrary intention, the award to her personal representative was correct.</p>
