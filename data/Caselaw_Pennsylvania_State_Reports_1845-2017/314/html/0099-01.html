He was employed by the Gorham Company, subcontractor of the building’s bronze and ornamental iron work. Defendant was the subcontractor for the brick and hollow tile work and constructed, twelve inches from the main wall on the fifth floor, a “furring” wall, from the upper tier of which fell the piece of tile. This wall was eight feet in length from one window to another and was fourteen feet in height. It was built up to a line four feet below the ceiling, except at the middle, where the tiles were extended to the ceiling. It consisted of hollow tiles twelve inches wide and three inches thick. The tiles were set in cement. The wall’s only attachment to the main wall was by “returns” at each end, which were cemented to the main wall. Between the “returns” at each end, the tiles were not anchored to the main wall by metal ties. Except for these “returns” and a small attachment to the ceiling from the center of the top, this wall was not supported by ceiling brace, floor brace, or by any metal ties.</p>

At common law it was held that every man must have some knowledge ‘of the quality of his beast’ (1 Hale P. C. 430) and use appropriate means to keep that beast from harming people. Public welfare requires that this same salutary rule apply to the inanimate objects in a man’s possession and subject to his intelligent control.

In that case this court said: “Defendant knew that tiles supported only on three sides are more apt to fall than those supported on all four sides; and hence, in making the opening, and in inspecting the tiles surrounding it at the time it was made and thereafter until it was closed, defendant was bound to exercise care proportionate to the risk to which it thereby exposed those who would be constantly using the floor below.”</p>

Appellant argues that “the duty breached (if any duty existed) rested on the general contractor to protect persons working on the floor from any danger lurking in this wall.” Appellant cites as the leading case on this question, Hooey v. Airport Const. Co. et al., <a href="/ny/253/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="253 N.Y. 486" data-case-ids="1991631" data-case-paths="/ny/253/0486-01">253 N. Y. 486</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20N.E.%20752" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="171 N.E. 752">171 N. E. 752</a>. In that case an employee of the subcontractor was assigned the building of the walls of hangars. Other subcontractors, roofers, carpenters, and manufacturers of sash had their allotted tasks. One day the south wall of hangar No. 2 had been carried by the subcontractor to the level of the window sills. On the next day by 11 a. m. the brick piers had been built between the windows, and between the windows and the door. “The masons then gave way until the sash was set in place. They left their tools, bricks, and mortar on the <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>spot, for they would have to return at a later stage and construct the brick sills. An employee of the subcontractor for the sash began his work at the wall on the morning of the next day. The wall was eight inches thick, about fifty feet long, and nine feet high, with neither roof nor rafter nor partition to bind it to the hangar of which it was to form a part. It had been left standing in the open country, swept by heavy winds, without braces or supports. Shortly after the plaintiff began placing the sash, the piers toppled over and buried him below.” He sued the general contractor. The only question <em>decided </em>in that case was whether or not the general contractor was subject to any duty toward the plaintiff which had been breached, “whatever,” as Chief Judge Cardozo said, “may be found to be the liability of others.” He also said: “The question is a closer one whether the mason subcontractor was also in default. ...... So far as the record shows, the subcontractor might reasonably assume, when its masons stepped aside, that the general contractor, there at hand upon the job, would not fail in the discharge of duties incidental to the enterprise.” That case, therefore, did not decide whether or not the mason subcontractor who actually did the work which was left unbraced or unsupported, was guilty of negligence toward the plaintiff. The facts of that case differ from the facts of the case now before us in this essential respect. The subcontractor who built the walls had reason to expect, as appears from the quoted facts, that the walls would stand alone <em>but a very short time </em>until the work would be carried forward. It does not appear that the mason subcontractor had reason to expect that heavy winds would demolish the wall before the work of the other contractors would make it secure. Here the tile stood at least four days before the plaintiff was injured. Meanwhile no one had done anything to further secure the tiles and it is a fair inference that it would have been inexpedient to carry this work forward as planned until the tile had “set.” Therefore, <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>the defendant subcontractor should have anticipated that before the work already done was permanently secured, some persons would be endangered by it, and therefore the defendant should have done what common prudence called for. The jury was justified in finding that the duty breached was the defendant’s, even though there might also have been some breach of duty on the part of the general contractor. “Where negligences are concurrent, both defendants are jointly and severally liable for the injuries thereby occasioned”: Hughes v. Pittsburgh T. Co., <a href="/pa/300/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="300 Pa. 55" data-case-ids="1125934" data-case-paths="/pa/300/0055-01">300 Pa. 55</a>, 60, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20A.%20153" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="150 A. 153">150 A. 153</a>.

Judge Crane said: “Negligence is gauged by the ability to anticipate. The Angus Company apparently knew that its men were not the only ones at work upon the building. As the iron work went up, the stone work soon followed. Both classes of employees were working together. When the Angus Company placed boards over the iron beams forming a scaffold or flooring for its derricks, could it reasonably anticipate that other workmen on the structure would walk over the flooring? On the evidence this was a question for the jury....... It was the duty of the defendant to erect its platform or flooring with due regard of the user by others; that is, it was under the duty to use reasonable care to construct it safely for those whom it had reason to anticipate would naturally and customarily use it in the course of the work.”</p>

The court would not have been justified in holding as a matter of law that the duty of defendant in respect to this tile ended when it was put in place. Possibly his duty <em>to the principal contractor </em>then ended— the contract between them is determinative of that question. But his duty to those who might be lawfully beneath that tile before the cement had done its work was not terminated when the tile was placed. It might as well be argued that one who has a contract to deliver a dangerous beast to a man’s premises, discharges his full duty in relation to that beast when he turns the beast loose on the premises indicated. In such a case his <em>contractual </em>duty might have been fully discharged by the delivery stated, but his <em>social-legal </em>duty would not have been discharged if the beast had been delivered and set free at a place where it might reasonably be expected that it would do human harm. A subcontractor who had a contract to extend a copper wire a certain distance would not be justified in leaving the wire in a position where persons would be liable to come in contact with it, <em>if he had reasonable grounds to believe that a considerable period of time would elapse before another contractor would tie that line to a pole and that immediately after he, the first contractor, had extended the </em>line, <em>it would be charged with dangerous voltage of electricity. </em>These are examples of situations more extreme than the situation before us, but, the principle that should guide us in determining the nature of the duty owing and whether or not it was breached is the same <em>in all three cases. </em>That principle is that “the law exacts of one who puts a force in motion that he shall control it with a skill and care proportioned to the danger created”: 20 R.

McGivern [<a href="/pa/303/0555-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="303 Pa. 555" data-case-ids="1130027" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0555-01">303 Pa. 555</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20A.%20794" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="154 A. 794">154 A. 794</a>].” In the latter case this court held that “where a husband contracts for work in and about a house used by himself and family as a home, and on the installation of the improvements the work is performed in a defective or improper manner and injury results to the wife, the contractor is answerable to her in damages even though she was not a party to the contract.” In that case this court said in an opinion by the present Chief Justice, quoting from Sehermerhorn’s Outlines in Tort, page 328: “ ‘A is, however, held to owe C a duty of care where, although C was no party to the contract, it should, under the circumstances, have been obvious to A that C would necessarily, in the natural course of things, be brought into contact with or would use the defective article or structure so furnished.’ ” In view of this recent decision it is unnecessary to discuss or attempt to distinguish at length the case of First Presbyterian Congregation v. Smith and Minnahan, <a href="/pa/163/0561-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="163 Pa. 561" data-case-ids="859083" data-case-paths="/pa/163/0561-01">163 Pa. 561</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=30%20A.%20279" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="30 A. 279">30 A. 279</a>, relied upon by appellant. That was an action for damage caused by a break in a sewer alleged to have been negligently constructed, and there had been an acceptance by the city of the work. In the case before us there is no testimony that the wall had been accepted by the general contractor. The only evidence that would support the theory of implied acceptance was that a day <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>ox* two before the accident uprights for a scaffold had been erected by another subcontractor to enable his employees to construct the “ceiling” to which the “furring” wall was to be tied. The defense of acceptance was not pleaded.</p>
    <p id="b138-4" data-blocks='[["BL_138.4",138,[257,594,1161,1126]]]'>The duty defendant breached was a duty imposed by law, not a duty self-imposed by contract. It is a primary <em>social </em>duty of every person to take thought and have a care lest his action result in injuries to others. This social duty <em>the law </em>recognizes and enforces, and for any injury resulting from any person’s lack of elementary forethought, the law holds that person accountable. A normal human being is held to foresee those injuries which are the consequence of his acts of omission or commission which he, as a reasonable human being, should have foreseen. The question whether a person charged with negligence or negligent acts or omissions should have foreseen the injuries resulting from those acts or omissions is for the jury, if there is any credible evidence from which a reasonable conclusion can be drawn in support of the claim of neglect of duty. “A verdict should not be directed if on all the facts and circumstances there is room for fair and sensible men to differ in their conclusions”: McCracken v. Curwensville Boro., <a href="/pa/309/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="309 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="1141589" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0098-01">309 Pa. 98</a>, 114, <a href="/citations/?q=163%20A.%20217" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="163 A. 217">163 A. 217</a>. Measured by this testing standard the instant case was for the jury.</p>

Construction work may of necessity be momentarily in a condition dangerous to third persons and if the constructor has reason to believe that it will be carried forward at once by others and rendered safe for third persons in its vicinity, his duty promptly to eliminate or at least reduce the menace he created is corre<a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>spondingly decreased. However, even momentary menaces should be safeguarded against as far as practicable, as for example, constructors do when they erect a sidewalk shelter adjacent to buildings under construction. Here defendant’s unfinished work had to remain unfinished for many days, at least until the cement had “set” sufficiently for the related construction to go forward without damaging the work already done. It was, therefore, manifestly the duty of the subcontractor who fabricated the menace to circumscribe its dangerous attributes as far as was practicable under the circumstances. This the jury found the defendant did not do.</p>

Plaintiff was injured by being hit on the head by a piece of tile while working on a building then under construction. He was employed by a subcontractor doing ornamental bronze work. Defendant was a subcontractor doing brick- and hollow tile-work. Plaintiff was injured February 17th. His evidence showed that all of the defendant’s work had been finished on February 13th, four days before the accident, and that defendant’s men had left the floor at that time.</p>

The wall was to be further tied with other work of the general contractor, but that was not defendant’s business. The brick or tile which is supposed to have fallen on plaintiff was set in cement not later than February 13th, and so remained until the 17th. It is in plaintiff’s evidence and is a matter of universal knowledge that the cement would have so hardened that it would have been necessary for some hard blow to dislodge the tile. It appears in evidence that it was impossible for it to have <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>fallen of itself or from ordinary vibrations. There was no evidence whatever as to the cause of the accident.</p>
