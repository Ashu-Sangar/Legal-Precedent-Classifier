That bond was in the penal sum of $4000 conditioned for the payment of $2,000 “together with all costs, hereinafter mentioned charges, expenses and attorney’s fees.” It recited that Savitz had obtained “an advance” of $12,000 from the association “upon 60 shares of the stock of the said association, <em>m the 32d series ” </em>and had given “as further security a bond and mortgage secured upon premises [described], which bond and mortgage provides, inter alia, that the said obligor and mortgagor will pay......each and every month to the said obligee the sum of sixty ($60) dollars as and for a contribution upon said shares of <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>stock,” and pay interest, premiums, fines, taxes, etc. It set forth that Savitz as a condition precedent to obtaining the advance of $12,000 had agreed to procure and deliver the bond in question in the penal sum of $4,000.</p>

There judgment upon confession was entered on defendants’ bond given as surety for the payment of a loan made by the plaintiff building and loan association. The loan of $10,000 was secured by a second mortgage and by 50 shares of building association stock in the 14th series. The defendants gave their bond as surety for $5,000 conditioned upon their saving the association harmless by reason of the failure of the debtor to pay dues, interest, taxes, etc., until such time as he should have reduced the net amount of the indebtedness to the sum of $5,000. Subsequently, upon default by the debtor, the association agreed to cancel the shares in the 14th series, to apply the withdrawal value to the reduction of the loan and the payment of arrearages, and to accept 30 shares in its 40th series as collateral for the balance due. This was done without notice to or consent of the defendants. It was <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>held that they were discharged of liability under their bond. We quoted from the opinion of the lower court, as follows: “The payment of dues upon that number of shares, and the earning capacity (by way of interest and otherwise) inherent in stock of that amount, and the substantial paid-in value resulting from its age, were material benefits to both Davis and defendants, his sureties.”</p>

Superior Ct. 181</a>, the plaintiff deposited with the defendant association $1,000 in cash as collateral security for the payment of a certain obligation of a mortgagor who borrowed from the association on his bond and mortgage. The case came to the Superior Court merely on the pleadings and.for that reason the facts are not as clearly established as might be desired. The plaintiff, in suing to recover his thousand dollars, averred in his statement of claim that the debtor defaulted, whereupon the association cancelled the stock held by it as security and applied the withdrawal or cancellation value on account of the indebtedness, at the same time taking out a smaller number of shares in a new series, all without notice to plaintiff. The defendant in its affidavit of defense denied many of the averments of the statement of claim. In the course of his opinion Judge Keller, speaking for the Superior Court, said: “......if there had been a substitution of the new shares for the older series, as averred in the plaintiff’s statement, the obligation of the original bond would have been affected, and the case would come within the decision in Double Dollar B. &amp; L.

Appellee, instead of standing on its rights against the plaintiff, proceeded to cure the defaults, which it had the right to do, and then cancelled Savitz’s shares in the 32d series and agreed that thereafter he should pay monthly amounts upon shares in a different series. Appellant’s bond was conditioned upon payments being made upon stock in the 32d series. This was rendered impossible by the action of the association. Each series of shares in a building and loan association stands upon its separate footing and in view of the specific mention made in all of the papers, including appellant’s bond, of shares in the 32d series, the association should before voluntarily agreeing to a closing out of those shares and the substitution therefor of new shares, have consulted and obtained the assent of appellant. Not having done so, it cannot now look to his bond.</p>
    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[195,1221,1156,641]]]'>Appellee argues that it should not be penalized for doing what was helpful to the situation at the time. It is likely that appellant, if confronted with the situation existing upon the default, would have recognized the force of this and would have agreed to the change in the hope that Savitz would work out of his difficulties. In agreeing, however, in effect, to relieve Savitz of his obligation to make payments upon shares in the 32d series and to accept in lieu thereof monthly payments upon different stock, the association departed from the original contract with the result that appellant, as surety, was discharged.</p>
