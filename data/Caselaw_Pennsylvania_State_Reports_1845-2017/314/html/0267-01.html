On December 3, 1900, by a contract attached to the bill as Exhibit A, the owners of certain coal or culm banks “demised, leased and sold ......all the coal in and composing” the banks to defendant, which agreed to “screen, separate and ship” the coal “with due diligence” and to pay specified royalties per ton, varying for specified sizes and with annual mínimums, “until all the merchantable coal of the above sizes; available from the said culm banks has been screened and shipped or paid for.” It was also agreed that defendant “shall have the right to use, sell or otherwise dispose of all the refuse coal and all the coal smaller than the above sizes without any further payments whatsoever.” Defendant took possession and conducted operations.

An important inquiry, then, is what “right, title and interest” remained in them for sale to plaintiff after the sale to defendant? It is conceivable that defendant might have defaulted and that a forfeiture might have been declared, resulting in the re-vesting of title in the vendors, but both the bill and Exhibit B are silent on the subject; or, perhaps, Exhibit A was a sale on installments, title passing as the coal was paid for, but this is not the theory of plaintiff’s bill. As a bill for a declaration of forfeiture, it is defective in various respects. So far as we have been able to understand the transaction pleaded, the vendors had disposed of the culm bank to defendant, which was not in default in paying for any royalty-bearing coal when Exhibit B was executed; there is no averment that defendant was in default as to such coal. The vendors, too, are particular to state that they do not covenant for quiet title and that plaintiff “takes possession with the full knowledge that he is obliged to maintain title......” The ninth and tenth paragraphs of the agreement are as follows:</p>

The provision is that, on default in payment of royalties for 60 days, “the Lessors, at their option, may declare the terms of the lease at an end.” There is no averment that the defendant’s vendor's exercised the option and declared the lease ended; nothing to explain or account for the omission to demand royalties, if due, from July, 1906 to March, 1923, when suit began. Laches appears on the face of the bill: cf. Drake v.

There appears to be support for the following statement made in defendant’s brief: “This is not the case of a person being in possession of a valuable property and having imposed upon him a duty to maintain his title. It is the case of a man attempting to use a. court of chancery to ransack the records, accounts and transactions of a company, beginning with December 4, 1900, in order to discover whether the lessors had a reason for forfeiting the lease which they did not know of, in the hope that something might be found which would enable him, not a party to the original lease, to ask for cancellation in order that he might come into <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>possession and share the benefits with the original lessors or their personal representatives.”</p>

Indeed, Exhibit B is not clear as to what rights assignors thought they had, nor does plaintiff’s bill make it any clearer. Equity will not aid the parties to such a contract: Bispham, Equity (9th ed.), section 166, page 285; Pomeroy’s Equity Jurisprudence (4th ed.), volume 3, section 1276, page 3071. But, as has been said, it is clear that, for 15 years preceding the assignment to plaintiff, his assignors had not attempted to declare or enforce default, if any, under Exhibit A. Finally, it must be added, as, perhaps, not without bearing on this subject, that plaintiff has not been diligent in prosecuting the suit begun in 1923.</p>
