During the period involved, she was a nonresident of this state; although she had notice that the attachment was being pressed, she did not appear at the trial.

Meagher, died March 17, 1931, and secretaries employed by him, one from 1915 until 1923, and the other from 1922 until the date of his death, testified they would have had knowledge of the payment to the plaintiff of the debt had any been made and that no such payment was made. There was also the testimony of an Assistant Trust Officer of The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, executor of the estate of the plaintiff, to the effect that no money had come into the hands of the executor since his death as far as he knew and as far as the records disclosed. There was also testimony tending to show <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>that the defendant, Margaret Heebner Youngman, was without any other estate than that coming to her under the Esrey Trust, and that she was, therefore, without means of paying the debt.”</p>

The one is by Thomas James Meagher against you, No. 394 June Term, 1910. This attachment is against your share of the trust......In due course, we will have our attorneys endeavor to have these attachments removed. We do not know what merit they have. Attachments usually bind until payment......As we recall, the attachments were not pressed against your father’s income because of the spendthrift trust in your father’s will. You may have some personal knowledge in reference to these attachments. If so, please give us any information you can about them......” She subsequently called on him and “employed counsel, who conferred with the attorney for the estate.” She did not “say whether or not she had paid” this judgment; part of her distributive share of the trust fund was set aside to abide this suit after “we took it up between our attorney and her attorney”; “she of course knew it was withheld.” On July 1, 1931, the vice-president advised her: “......our attorneys examined the proceedings in connection with the attachments. They hope to be able to have the attachments removed without going into the question of merit. They are working to this end. We will later advise you as to our success in the proceedings.” On September 1, 1931, he wrote: “Our Attorneys......are pushing as fast as possible the removal of the attachments. We will keep in touch with your Attorney about these proceedings.” On November 16, 1931, he sent her a check on account, <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>stating that an award had been made to her “less $4,000, to be retained to answer attachment.”</p>

Defendant did not plead to the writ, or move to dissolve for laches in prosecution, irregularity, or for any other reason. It, therefore, remained alive as a continuous assertion of the claim in the circumstances.

Accordingly, in 1913, when plaintiff issued the interrogatories, as an additional step in the execution, they were as effectually supported by the writ of attachment (Gilmore v.

At the argument, appellee contended that, though issued within the twenty year period, the interrogatories were not original process, or process of a character rendering inapplicable the presumption of payment, and that more than twenty years had elapsed without demand by plaintiff. This contention disregards an important element in the problem and must be rejected on the ground that, as the attachment was not dissolved or discontinued, but remained available to support the interrogatories, we must treat it, in dealing with the asserted presumption, as if issued in March, 1913, when the interrogatories were served, and as having the same evidential effect as if the existing writ had been discontinued and a new writ issued.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
