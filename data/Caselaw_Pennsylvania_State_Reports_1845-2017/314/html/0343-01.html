When the instrument is in the hands of a holder in due course, who is not a party to the alteration, section 124 provides that “he may enforce payment thereof according to its original tenor.” Section 125 provides that a material alteration is the change of: “1.

The medium or currency in which payment is to be made; or which adds a place of payment where no place of payment is specified, or any other change or addition which alters the effect of the instrument in any respect.” This section of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law has been interpreted in several jurisdictions, as follows:</p>

Prudential Trust Co. v. Coghlin, <a href="/mass/249/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="249 Mass. 184" data-case-ids="3816744" data-case-paths="/mass/249/0184-01">249 Mass. 184</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=144%20N.E.%20283" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="144 N.E. 283">144 N. E. 283</a>.”</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[215,1154,1151,315]]]'>We agree with the court below that “there is in fact no material alteration and obviously no harm has been done the defendants.” Furthermore, since the appellants did not aver that the appellee was a party to the alleged alteration “he may enforce payment according to the original tenor.”</p>
    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.7",379,[213,1482,1153,914]],["BL_380.1",380,[290,371,1154,98]]]'>The appellants next contend that the plaintiff in the court below is an indorsee for collection only. This appears in the affidavit of defense “upon information and belief.” No facts disclosing the nature of the information or the foundations of the belief are averred. Appellants’ pronouncement that “a mere indorsee for collection holds the instrument subject to defenses against his indorser” is correct as a statement of law, but the affidavit of defense does not prima facie make the plaintiff appear as “a mere indorsee for collection.” In Long v. Long, <a href="/pa/208/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="208 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="998170" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0368-01">208 Pa. 368</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20A.%20759" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="57 A. 759">57 A. 759</a>, cited by appellants, the defendant “averred positively that the plaintiff” was “not the bona fide holder of the notes, but was merely an accommodation indorser, without loss by reason thereof; that the real owner” was “the Lebanon National Bank, against which a good defense” was “averred consisting of a set-off for breach of con<a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>tract, in a collateral matter.” The positiveness of averment found in that case is wanting here.</p>
    <p id="b380-4" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[289,480,1155,153]]]'>The learned president judge of the court below succinctly sums up the deficiencies of the affidavit of defense, on this phase of the case, as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[288,643,1157,98]]]'>“(2) The defendant ‘believes’ the endorsements by the payee were put upon the notes after maturity.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[288,753,1156,97]]]'>“ (3) Defendant is ‘informed’ that plaintiff holds the notes for collection only.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b380-7" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[287,862,1158,479]]]'>“(4) General denials that plaintiffs are holders in due course; and an averment that defendants ‘are advised by counsel,’ ‘believe and aver’ that the notes are non-negotiable. These are conclusions and there is no averment that defendant ‘expects to be able to prove’ any of the facts averred under (2), (3) and (4). As to (2) they‘believe’; as to (3) they are‘informed’; as to (4) ‘counsel advises’ them on a question of fact. These averments are plainly insufficient.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b380-8" data-blocks='[["BL_380.8",380,[287,1352,1158,750]]]'>That part of the affidavit of defense where the phrase “expects to be able to prove” appears has already been quoted in this opinion. What defendants “expected to be able to prove” were the terms (undisclosed) of certain alleged agreements heretofore referred to. Defendants admit that they cannot state precisely its terms; therefore, should they be able at the trial to prove the terms of this agreement it does not appear from anything pleaded that such proof would be of any avail to them. Plaintiff cannot be put to the test of a trial by such an equivocal challenge of the good cause of action it pleads. Plaintiff’s averment that it is the bona fide holder of the notes in controversy has not been effectively contradicted.</p>
    <p id="b380-9" data-blocks='[["BL_380.9",380,[290,2110,1153,103]]]'>The rule for judgment was properly made absolute. The judgment is affirmed.</p>
