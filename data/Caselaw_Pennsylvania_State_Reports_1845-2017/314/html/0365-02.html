He was also a director, large stockholder, and owner of $50,000 bonds of the Republic Radiator Company, a Maryland corporation. John B. Eader, president, treasurer, general manager, director, and owner of approximately one-third of the stock of Waynesboro Knitting Company, was likewise a director, owner of some 5% of the stock, and $50,000 bonds of the Republic Radiator Company.

Thereafter, Eader sent Graeber a note dated July 9, 1929, for $17,500, made by the knitting company payable to “Ourselves” and endorsed by it. The execution and endorsement of the note was as follows: “Waynesboro Knitting Company by J. B.

Graeber refused to endorse any notes but stated that if he had the corporate paper of appellee, he could raise his share ($50,000) by discounting it at appellant bank. A note was executed in the knitting company’s name by its president and treasurer for $55,000, and endorsed by Eader, Penney and Landis personally. The $55,000 note represented the $50,000 credit plus a bonus of $5,000 for the bank itself. Furthermore, Graeber secured $60,000 worth of'bonds of the Republic Radiator Company to protect the bank’s loan. The note was discounted by appellant bank and the proceeds credited to the radiator company, which then sent Graeber a check payable to him individually for $5,000 as a bonus.

It is ultra vires for a manufacturing corporation to lend its credit to another by issuing or endorsing bills or notes as an accommodation (Federal Nat. Bank v. Coal Co., <a href="/pa/220/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="220 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1005903" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0039-01">220 Pa. 39</a>). But if a corporation having general power to issue and endorse negotiable paper for its own benefit in the course of business becomes accommodation maker or endorser for another, the corporation will be presumed to have acted within the scope of its powers, and will be liable on the instrument to a holder in due course: Cox &amp; Sons Co. v. North. Brwg. Co., <a href="/pa/245/0418-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="245 Pa. 418" data-case-ids="326229" data-case-paths="/pa/245/0418-01">245 Pa. 418</a>; Putnam v.

We said in the latter case that even though it is known by the holder in due course that, at the time of taking the instrument, it was accommodation paper, liability followed because <em>absence of consideration </em>was no defense to the holder in due course; but, in that case, we did not decide that, where a holder in due course <em>knew </em>that the accommodating party had no power to accommodate, this knowledge would not be a bar to recovery. Lack of consideration and complete want of authority to issue or abuse of power in issuing accommodation paper, when known to a holder before he becomes such, is a defense to the enforcement of payment of such notes.

Where it appears that the title to a note is defective because of the absence of power in the company to execute the instrument or do a thing sought to be enforced, a presumption is raised in the maker’s or endorser’s favor, and the burden is on the holder to show that he or some one before Mm was a holder in due course.</p>

It is also testified that the cashier knew the knitting company could not lend its credit, but his bank was willing to accept it. It is claimed by appellant that as he was engaged in his own business in securing the discount of the |50,000 note, the bank should not be held to have had knowledge of wrongdoing in passing through the institution the accommodation paper of the knitting company, under the authority of Gunster v. Scranton, etc., Co., <a href="/pa/181/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="181 Pa. 327" data-case-ids="891384" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0327-01">181 Pa. 327</a>, followed by a line of cases. The principle there stated is as follows: “The rule that knowledge or notice on the part of the agent is to be treated as notice to the <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>principal is founded on the duty of the agent to communicate all material information to his principal, and the presumption that he has done so. But legal presumptions ought to be logical inferences from the natural and usual conduct of men under the circumstances. But no agent who is acting in his own antagonistic interest or who is about to commit a fraud by which his principal will be affected does in fact inform the latter, and any conclusion drawn from a presumption that he has done so is contrary to all experience of human nature.” This rule has been followed in many cases down to F. N. Bk. of Bangor v. Bangor Trust Co., <a href="/pa/297/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="297 Pa. 115" data-case-ids="1118194" data-case-paths="/pa/297/0115-01">297 Pa. 115</a>. It will be noted that the foundation of the rule of imputed knowledge is “antagonistic interest,” or the situation where an agent is about to commit a fraud on his principal. If neither of these circumstances exists in that the cashier was acting as the only representative of the bank which was transacting business, and his personal interest was incidental or indirect, the rule does not apply, although his conduct and his judgment may have been influenced by his interest in the corporation which received the funds. It is apparent from the record that the cashier, Graeber, while an interested stockholder in an institution that was in financial distress, was, as well, acting for the interests of the bank: he first demanded a bonus of substantial amount; second, procured the endorsement of three individuals in addition to the accommodation endorsement of the knitting company; third, demanded corporate paper purely in the interest of his bank in order that it might be rediscounted at the Federal Reserve Bank; fourth, took bonds as collateral for the note; fifth, at no time was a party to the transaction except in the capacity of the bank’s cashier. It does not appear that when Graeber did all these things he believed them useless or unsafe security or that he felt the bank would lose. Graeber acted for the bank, and <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>Ms knowledge of the defect in the notes is properly imputable to bis principal, tbe bank.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">*</a>

      <p id="b402-7" data-blocks='[["BL_402.7",402,[280,1051,1162,1098]]]'> A line of authorities treat the question as one of direct knowledge rather than of imputed knowledge. These courts have reasoned, as did the court in Cook v. American Tubing and Webbing Co., <a href="/ri/28/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="28 R.I. 41" data-case-ids="8518738" data-case-paths="/ri/28/0041-01">28 R. I. 41</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20A.%20641" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="65 A. 641">65 Atl. 641</a>: “that a corporation shall be held responsible for the knowledge which is possessed by those whom it appoints to represent it. From the nature of its constitution it can have no other knowledge than that of its officers, and, in dealing with such officers, as with the corporation itself, third parties have a right to consider what they know it knows. Indeed, when the presiding officer of a corporation is intrusted with the transaction of its business, with full power to bind the corporation in respect to such business, it seems more proper to call the knowledge which he has actual knowledge of the corporation rather than to say it is imputed.” This case and many others obviously place such a statement upon policy and expediency.
