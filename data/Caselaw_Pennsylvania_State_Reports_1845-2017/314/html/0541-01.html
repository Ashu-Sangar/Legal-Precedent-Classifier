      <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>The sole question presented for our consideration is this: did plaintiffs’ evidence show negligent operation of the car by the motonnan? We are bound to conclude that it did not. Where a passenger is alleged to have been injured while standing or walking in a trolley car, statements that the car “started violently” (Uffelman v. P. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/253/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="253 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1024054,1024087" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0394-01,/pa/253/0394-02">253 Pa. 394</a>), “started with a violent jerk” (Harrar v.

They must be accompanied by evidence inherently establishing that the occurrence was of an unusual and extraordinary character, or by evidence of its effect on other passengers sufficient to show this: Harkins v. P. R. T. Co., supra; Zieger v. P. R. T. Co., supra; McClusky v. Shenango Val. Traction Co., supra.</p>
    <p id="b571-3" data-blocks='[["BL_571.4",571,[202,1529,1154,860]],["BL_572.1",572,[301,328,1158,154]]]'>In Crawford v. Reading T. &amp; L. Co., <a href="/pa/273/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="273 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="1070841" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0074-01">273 Pa. 74</a>, plaintiff testified that as she started to leave the car she was suddenly, violently and unexpectedly thrown back full length on the floor. The entry of a nonsuit was held proper. In Harkins v. P. R. T. Co., supra, the evidence was that the passenger arose to pay her fare and handed the conductor a dollar, and that while she was waiting for her change the car stopped with a jerk and she was thrown and injured. We held that the trial judge acted properly in directing a verdict for defendant. These two cases rule the present one. It is true that in the instant case plaintiff testified on direct examination that a man sitting across from her was “jolted out of his seat,” but on cross-examination she admitted that he “didn’t leave his seat or go out of his seat,” but was simply “jolted about.” This goes no further than the statement in the <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>McClusky Case, <a href="/pa-super/105/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="105 Pa.

    <p id="b572-4" data-blocks='[["BL_572.4",572,[295,492,1162,959]]]'>Plaintiffs rely upon Tilton v. P. R. T. Co., <a href="/pa/231/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="231 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="973939" data-case-paths="/pa/231/0063-01">231 Pa. 63</a>, and Sanson v. P. R. T.

These cases, however, presented strong intrinsic evidence of the unusual character of the jolt or jerk. In the Tilton Case plaintiff was seated when the sudden stop occurred, and was thrown violently forward against the seat in front of him. This of itself was evidence of the unusual nature of the jerk; it is common knowledge that a passenger can be thrown out of his seat only by an unusual or extraordinary jerk, whereas it is not unusual for persons to lose their balance while standing or walking in a car if an ordinary or moderate jerk occurs. In the Sanson Case the jolt was so violent and unusual that plaintiff was thrown through the rear door, across the platform, and into the street. In Kleine v. Pgh. Rys. Co., <a href="/pa/252/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="252 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1021582" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0214-01">252 Pa. 214</a>, and Bliss v. P. R. T.
