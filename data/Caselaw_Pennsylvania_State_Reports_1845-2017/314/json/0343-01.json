        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Maxey,\nThis is a suit in assumpsit to recover on three promissory notes, each for three months, in the respective sums of $2,500, $1,000, and $3,500, made by defendants to the order of themselves. Each note was endorsed in blank and discounted at the Central Trust & Savings Company of Philadelphia (hereinafter referred to as the trust company). The respective dates of these notes were September 2, 1931, September 16, 1931, and September 23, 1931.\nThe statement of claim declares that \u201cbefore the date of maturity of each of said notes, Central Trust and Savings Company of Philadelphia, Pa., duly indorsed each of said notes in blank and for value received by delivery transferred said notes to this plaintiff,\u201d and that the \u201cplaintiff thereby became and still is the holder of said notes without notice of any defects therein.\u201d 208 Pa. 368.\nThen follows the usual averments of presentment for payment on the due dates and the refusal, and the items of credit for payments made on account of the notes.\nTo this statement of claim an affidavit of defense raising questions of law was first filed.. This was dismissed with leave to the defendants to file an affidavit of defense to the merits. Defendants did this, but on a motion and rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, the rule was made absolute and judgment entered. This appeal followed.\nIn the affidavit of defense the question of the non-negotiability of the instrument was raised and upon \u201cbelief\u201d and \u201cinformation and belief\u201d the defendants averred that the trust company\u2019s indorsement did not appear at the time of the delivery by it of the notes to the plaintiff, and that the same was affixed thereon after the dates of maturity of these notes, and that the notes were not negotiated to the plaintiff by the trust company but were delivered for the purpose of collection, and the proceeds applied to the indebtedness of the trust company to the Philadelphia Bank. It was denied that the plaintiff bank is the holder in due course of the notes without any notice of any defects therein and also averred \u201cthat from the knowledge and information in its possession, or which it should have known or acquired, the plaintiff knew or should have known\u201d that the trust company \u201cwas then and there insolvent\u201d at the times of the delivery of said notes to it and that \u201cdefendants then had certain rights of set-off, counterclaims and otherwise against\u201d the trust company \u201cby reason of its deposit balances, excess interest charges and otherwise.\u201d\nThe defendants then aver upon information and belief that these notes were transferred by the trust company to the plaintiff bank \u201ceither for collection, by way of security, pledge, or otherwise, for the purpose of reducing the indebtedness of the\u201d trust company \u201cto the plaintiff; that, the transactions between the\u201d trust company \u201cand this plaintiff covering the transfer of said notes, including those of the defendants above referred to, were evidenced by certain oral and written agreements between them, the exact terms of which the defendants are unable to state precisely, but they have made inquiry from both of said banks and have made demand upon the plaintiff for production or inspection thereof\u201d without success, \u201cand defendants expect to be able to prove the terms of said agreement at the trial of said cause. Defendants therefore believe and aver that plaintiffs are not the bona fide holders and owners of said notes or any of them for value before maturity without notice of any defect therein, but that the Central Trust & Savings Co. are such owners.\u201d\nThe affidavit of defense then denies that \u201cany of said notes were presented for payment for the reason that the said bank was closed at said times, having then suspended business......\u201d They then aver that the plaintii'f made no demand upon them for payment and that upon advice from counsel they believed and averred that because they were also indorsers on the notes as well as makers that they were discharged from liability for failure \u201cto give notice of said alleged dishonor, and notice of protest thereof to the defendants or either of them.\u201d The affidavit of defense then sets up some credits in the sums of $140.60 and $33.23, which it alleges are \u201cthe balances on deposit in the said Central Trust & Savings Co., to the credit of the defendants on October 6, 1933, which, amounts were appropriated on account of the defendants\u2019 indebtedness on said notes; and to the further sums of $492.82, representing the...... sums, illegally withdrawn by the Central Trust & Savings Company from the funds in defendants\u2019 account on deposit with it, .without warrant, right or authority and representing usurious interest charges on defendants\u2019 indebtedness to it over and above the legal rate of 6%.\u201d The affidavit of defense further claims material alteration in the figures on one of the notes, \u201cin that the amount thereof represented by the figures $2,500 was stricken out or deleted, and the figures of $2,481.04, were written in its place by the plaintiffs or by someone on its behalf with its knowledge,\u201d and that therefore they are discharged from liability on this note.\nWe agree with the court below that the affidavit is insufficient to prevent judgment.\nAppellants\u2019 contention that the notes were non-negotiable is based upon the fact that the notes all contain a provision, as follows: \u201cand in addition thereto, all legal costs, and expenses of collection, including an attorney\u2019s fee of 10% of the above sum, in case payment of this note shall not be made at maturity.\u201d We overrule appellants\u2019 contention that these notes were not negotiable.\nThe Negotiable Instruments Law of 1901, P. L. 194 (56 Purd. Stat., page 115), provides in section 1 that \u201can instrument to be negotiable must conform to the following requirements:.....\u201e (2) must contain an unconditional promise or order to pay a sum certain in money.\u201d In section 2, it says, \u201cthe sum payable is a sum certain, within the meaning of this Act although it is to be paid:......(5) with costs of collection or an attorney\u2019s fee, in case payment shall not be made at maturity.\u201d\nThe appellants argue that since the provision in the notes in suit provides for both legal costs and expenses of collection including an attorney\u2019s fee, the notes do not call for a \u201csum certain\u201d within the meaning of the Negotiable Instruments Law. They contend that the provisions of the law call either for \u201ccosts of collection or an attorneys\u2019s fee,\u201d but that the notes in suit call for both. This section of the Negotiable Instruments Law is practically uniform with the laws of other states on this subject, and Brannan\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law (5th edition), sets forth the interpretation of appellate courts that have ruled on this section as folloAvs: \u201cThe word \u2018or\u2019 in this subsection is not material, and an agreement to pay \u2018attorney\u2019s fees and all costs of collection\u2019 does not impair negotiability, since the two phrases mean the same thing. Wood v. Ferguson, 71 Mont. 540, 230 Pac. 592. So also agreement to pay attorney\u2019s fees and \u2018all costs of collection,\u2019 held not to impair negotiability. Anaheim Nat. Bank v. Dolph, 201 Cal. 17, 255 Pac. 184; Golden State Bank v. Dolph, 201 Cal. 767, 255 Pac. 187; First Nat. Bank of Olive v. Dolph, 201 Cal. 767, 255 Pac. 187; Marks v. Kindel, 41 F. (2d) 584; note 17 Va. L. Rev. 188.\u201d\nIn this State when construing the intention of the legislature we have often been obliged to construe the conjunctions \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d interchangeably. Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, section 303, page 412, says: \u201cTo carry out the intention of the Legislature it is occasionally found necessary to read the conjunctions \u2018or\u2019 and \u2018and,\u2019 one for the other......The Married Woman\u2019s Act of 1848, in Pennsylvania, contained a provision making a married woman liable upon her contracts for necessaries, providing, however, that judgment shall not be rendered against her unless it should appear that the debt was \u2018contracted by the wife or incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family,\u2019 etc. It is obvious and was held that \u2018or\u2019 must be read \u2018and.\u2019 \u201d This interpretation is supported by this court in the case of Murray v. Keyes, 35 Pa. 384, 391.\nAppellants next contend that there was a material alteration which avoided the note for $2,500. This note (as are the other two) is in the usual printed promissory note form. In its upper left-hand corner a faint pencil line is drawn through the figure \u201c$2,500\u201d and written above these figures are the figures \u201c$2,481.04.\u201d In the body of the note appear the words, \u201cTwo thousand five hundred dollars.\u201d The substitution in the upper left-hand corner was made, so the statement avers, because a payment of $18.96 had been received by the plaintiff on account of the indebtedness.\nWe hold that the \u201calteration\u201d here was not a material alteration that avoided the instrument under sections 124 and 125 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. The effect of a material alteration of a negotiable instrument without the assent of all parties liable thereon is to avoid it, except when the alteration is made, authorized or assented to by the party against whom the action is brought. When the instrument is in the hands of a holder in due course, who is not a party to the alteration, section 124 provides that \u201che may enforce payment thereof according to its original tenor.\u201d Section 125 provides that a material alteration is the change of: \u201c1. The date; 2. The sum payable either for principal or interest; 3. The time or place of payment; 4. The number or the relations of the parties; 5. The medium or currency in which payment is to be made; or which adds a place of payment where no place of payment is specified, or any other change or addition which alters the effect of the instrument in any respect.\u201d This section of the Uniform Negotiable Instruments Law has been interpreted in several jurisdictions, as follows:\nChanging figures to show balance due. \u2014 Running a line through the figures showing the amount of the note and substituting new figures showing the balance due does not constitute a material alteration. Agricultural Credit Assoc. Inc., v. Iaccuzzo (1928), 167 La. 230, 119 So. 31.\nReducing amount when part payment is made is not a material alteration: Salem First Nat. Bk. v. Elmer (1926, Mo.) 278 S. W. 826.\n\u201cChanging figures to conform to written numbers.\u2014 Under the provisions of section 17, subdivision 1, that where the sum payable is expressed both in writing and in figures, and there is a discrepancy between the two, the sum denoted by words is the sum payable, an alteration of the figures in a check to conform with the written statement of the amount is not a material alteration where the written words clearly express the amount to be paid, as such alteration does not change the legal effect of the instrument: People v. Lewinger (1911), 252 Ill. 332, 96 N. E. 837, Ann. Cas. 1912-D 239\u201d; Uniform Laws Ann., vol. 5, Neg. Inst. Act, page 651.\nDrawing a line through the figures in the left-hand corner of a note and the insertion of different fiures, is not a \u201cmaterial alteration\u201d where the amount expressed in the body of the instrument remains unchanged: Morris Plan Co. v. Epstein (1933), 147 Misc. 164, 263 N. Y. S. 454.\nBrannan\u2019s Negotiable Instruments Law (5th edition), page 966, says: \u201cAn alteration of the marginal figures of a note was not material when the sum stated in words in the body remained unchanged. Prudential Trust Co. v. Coghlin, 249 Mass. 184, 144 N. E. 283.\u201d\nWe agree with the court below that \u201cthere is in fact no material alteration and obviously no harm has been done the defendants.\u201d Furthermore, since the appellants did not aver that the appellee was a party to the alleged alteration \u201che may enforce payment according to the original tenor.\u201d\nThe appellants next contend that the plaintiff in the court below is an indorsee for collection only. This appears in the affidavit of defense \u201cupon information and belief.\u201d No facts disclosing the nature of the information or the foundations of the belief are averred. Appellants\u2019 pronouncement that \u201ca mere indorsee for collection holds the instrument subject to defenses against his indorser\u201d is correct as a statement of law, but the affidavit of defense does not prima facie make the plaintiff appear as \u201ca mere indorsee for collection.\u201d In Long v. Long, 208 Pa. 368, 57 A. 759, cited by appellants, the defendant \u201caverred positively that the plaintiff\u201d was \u201cnot the bona fide holder of the notes, but was merely an accommodation indorser, without loss by reason thereof; that the real owner\u201d was \u201cthe Lebanon National Bank, against which a good defense\u201d was \u201caverred consisting of a set-off for breach of contract, in a collateral matter.\u201d The positiveness of averment found in that case is wanting here.\nThe learned president judge of the court below succinctly sums up the deficiencies of the affidavit of defense, on this phase of the case, as follows:\n\u201c(2) The defendant \u2018believes\u2019 the endorsements by the payee were put upon the notes after maturity.\n\u201c (3) Defendant is \u2018informed\u2019 that plaintiff holds the notes for collection only.\n\u201c(4) General denials that plaintiffs are holders in due course; and an averment that defendants \u2018are advised by counsel,\u2019 \u2018believe and aver\u2019 that the notes are non-negotiable. These are conclusions and there is no averment that defendant \u2018expects to be able to prove\u2019 any of the facts averred under (2), (3) and (4). As to (2) they\u2018believe\u2019; as to (3) they are\u2018informed\u2019; as to (4) \u2018counsel advises\u2019 them on a question of fact. These averments are plainly insufficient.\u201d\nThat part of the affidavit of defense where the phrase \u201cexpects to be able to prove\u201d appears has already been quoted in this opinion. What defendants \u201cexpected to be able to prove\u201d were the terms (undisclosed) of certain alleged agreements heretofore referred to. Defendants admit that they cannot state precisely its terms; therefore, should they be able at the trial to prove the terms of this agreement it does not appear from anything pleaded that such proof would be of any avail to them. Plaintiff cannot be put to the test of a trial by such an equivocal challenge of the good cause of action it pleads. Plaintiff\u2019s averment that it is the bona fide holder of the notes in controversy has not been effectively contradicted.\nThe rule for judgment was properly made absolute. The judgment is affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Philadelphia National Bank v. Buchman et al., Appellants.\nArgued January 5, 1934.\nBefore Frazer, C. J., Kephart, Maxey, and Drew, JJ.\nA. Samuel Buchman, for appellants, did not appear.\nAt common law, notes which provided for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of collection upon default in payment, were non-negotiable: Johnston v. Speer, 92 Pa. 227; Woods v. North, 84 Pa. 407.\nThe legislature used the phrases \u201cexpenses of collection\u201d or \u201can attorney\u2019s fee.\u201d as two distinct items because it employed the conjunction \u201cor.\u201d A material alteration avoided one of the notes.\nBefore the act it was held that an alteration in the principal sum was material: Nagle\u2019s Estate, 134 Pa. 31; Wheeler v. Ahlers, 189 Pa. 138; Potter\u2019s Estate, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 576; First Nat. Bank v. Kane, 13 Del. Co. (Pa.) 421; Craighead v. McLoney, 99 Pa. 211; Colonial Trust Co. v. Getz, 28 Pa. Superior Ct. 619.\nA mere indorsee for collection holds the instrument subject to defenses against his indorser: Lewisburg Nat. Bank v. Broadhead, 2 Kulp (Luz. Co.) 285; Chestnut St. Nat. Bank v. Ellis, 161 Pa. 241; Long v. Long,\nMaurice Heckscher, with him Froncis A. Lewis, for appellee.\nThe clause in question is by its own terms never invoked unless the notes are not paid at maturity. This being the case, even regardless of the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Act the negotiability of the notes cannot be affected: Milton Nat. Bank v. Beaver, 25 Pa. Superior Ct. 494.\nThe word \u201cor\u201d frequently has the meaning of the word \u201cand\u201d and this fact is often recognized.\nThe notations, endorsements and marks complained of upon one or more of the notes in suit are neither material nor are they alterations.\nAllegations that defendants believe or are informed plaintiff is a holder of the notes for collection, is not the bona fide holder thereof nor their owner, without allegations of fact to support these beliefs, are insufficient to prevent summary judgment: State Bank of Pitts. v. Zahn, 52 Pitts. 191; First Nat. Bank v. Weinberger, 20 Lack. 323; Powell v. R. R., 20 Lack. 306; Kennedy v. R. R., 29 Dist. Rep. 751.\nMarch 19, 1934:"
