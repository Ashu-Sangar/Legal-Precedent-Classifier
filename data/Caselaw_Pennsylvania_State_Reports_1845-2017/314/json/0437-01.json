        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThese appeals are from the final distribution of the residuary trust estate of J. Bundle Smith, who died in 1908. After the death of his widow, who was life tenant, his trustees filed two accounts of the property which had been awarded to them at the adjudication of the executor\u2019s account, one of the personal and the other of the real estate.\nTwo questions are presented: Did the widow share in the residue? Was there a conversion? The residuary clause provided:\n\u201cSIXTH: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real personal and mixed of whatsoever kind or nature, or from whomsoever inherited, I give, devise and bequeath unto The Beal Estate Trust Company of Philadelphia, in Trust Nevertheless to keep the same invested in good and safe securities (but without restriction to what are known as legal investments), with power to change said investments at discretion, to square, exchange, sell or buy real estate without obligation upon the purchaser to see to or be responsible for the application of the purchase money, and the income thereof to collect and pay over at convenient times as follows: the income of said residuary estate shall be paid to my wife Gertrude Meryweather Smith for and during the term of her natural life. And upon the death of my wife Gertrude Meryweather Smith, to pay over the principal of my said residuary estate to such persons and for such estates as the same would go to and vest in, under the Intestate Laws of Pennsylvania had I died intestate.\u201d\nThe learned court below was of opinion: (a) that decedent\u2019s widow was within the class of persons whom \u201cthe same would go to and vest in, under the Intestate Laws,\u201d had he died intestate; (b) that there was a conversion of the real estate; (c) that one-third of the total principal must be awarded to the widow\u2019s executor. These conclusions are challenged by the only child of decedent and by the assignee of part of her share.\nDid part of the principal vest in the widow under the direction \u201cupon the death of my wife Gertrude Meryweather Smith, to pay over the principal of my said residuary estate to such persons and for such estates as the same would go to and vest in, under the Intestate Laws of Pennsylvania had I died intestate\u201d?\nThis will is governed by the general rule, long in effect, that \u201cwhere a testator gives his estate to his heirs or next of kin or to those who may be entitled under the intestate laws, these classes are to be determined as of the date of his death, even though a life estate intervenes, \u2014 the only exception to the rule being where the will contains an expression showing a clear and unequivocal intention to the contrary [citing authorities]. Further, it is immaterial that the life tenant is one of the class who will take the remainder: Bache\u2019s Est., 246 Pa. 276, 279\u201d; Whiteside\u2019s Est., 302 Pa. 452, 454, 153 A. 728, 729. See, also, Bechtel\u2019s Est., 303 Pa. 107, 154 A. 366.\nTo bring themselves within the exception, \u2014 \u201cwhere the will contains an expression showing a clear and unequivocal intention to the contrary,\u201d \u2014 appellants present various considerations, said to be suggested by the words of the will in their relation to the circumstances in which the will and codicil were executed in 1905 and 1906.\nWhen testator made the will, the immediate objects of his bounty were his third wife (the life tenant), an expected child, and the appellant, an adult daughter by his first wife; before the codicil was executed, the child had died. Testator devised his residence to his widow in fee; devised his real estate at Bay Head, received from his second wife, to her sons in fee; personal property of a genealogical interest, he gave to a cousin; the remainder of his personal property in his residence, he gave to his widow. To his daughter, the appellant, he gave $15,000.\nAppellants contend that the clear intention to give the widow only a life interest in the residence is shown by the facts: that she received absolutely certain property specified; that she received the entire income of the residue for life; that there was a remainder over, without power of appointment in her; that testator intended only such connections by marriage to take as he specified (his second wife\u2019s sons); that presumably he did not intend to disinherit his daughter; that these considerations exclude the idea of increasing his widow\u2019s estate, which might pass to strangers (as, the briefs state, will be the fact). But the court must give effect to the words of the will, which leave no support for the inferences suggested by appellants. Testator prescribed what his daughter (who was not disinherited) and his widow should receive; the language employed had a well-recognized meaning; if he did not anticipate and provide for a contingency possibly arising in the ultimate distribution of his widow\u2019s estate, the court may not make another will for him: Cf. Tatham\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 269, 95 A. 520; Stoler\u2019s Est., 293 Pa. 433, 143 A. 121. His direction \u201cto pay over [on the death of his wife] the principal of my said residuary estate to such persons and for such estates as the same would go to and vest in, under the Intestate Laws of Pennsylvania had I died intestate,\u201d clearly designates her, in the light of the then settled rule, as a member of the class entitled, and, as there is no clear expression of contrary intention, the award to her personal representative was correct.\nWe also agree that there was equitable conversion; that the words used indicate intention to create a fund from both kinds of property and to bequeath it as money. Throughout the will, it appears that testator understood the distinction between words technically applicable to realty and to personalty, and correctly employed them. After disposing of property specifically, he gave his remaining \u201cestate, real personal and mixed of whatsoever kind or nature\u201d to the trustee \u201cto keep the same invested in good and safe securities (but without restriction to what are known as legal investments), with power to change said investments at discretion, to square, exchange, buy or sell real estate......and the income thereof to collect and pay over......\u201d; and, upon his widow\u2019s death, \u201cto pay over the principal ......\u201d He was creating and dealing with a fund intended for the production of income during the lifetime of the widow and for ultimate distribution as money,\u2014 not with so much realty and personalty: Marshall\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 77, 23 A. 391; Battenfeld v. Kline, 228 Pa. 91, 77 A. 416; Bailey\u2019s Est., 276 Pa. 147, 119 A. 907; cf. Dieterich\u2019s Est., 15 D. & C. 733.\nDecrees affirmed, costs to be paid out of the fund for distribution.\nAs testator died in 1908, the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 914, declaring the construction of wills in certain classes of cases, has no application: Section 2 of the act; Bonsall\u2019s Est., 7 D. & C. 421, affirmed 288 Pa. 39, 135 A. 724.",
