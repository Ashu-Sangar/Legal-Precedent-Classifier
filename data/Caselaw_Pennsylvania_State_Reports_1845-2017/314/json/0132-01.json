The court below, upon an appeal from the board of revision reduced the assessment to $968,000. The property owner appeals.\nExperts for the parties disagreed widely as to the value of the land. The court considered all of this testimony and we find nothing in the record to disturb the conclusions therefrom. See Appeal of Westbury Apartments, Inc., 314 Pa. 130.\nWe add that it is not necessary for a judge, where there are widely varying opinions of experts as to the value of property, to average the values testified to; but he must, upon a consideration of the testimony of the experts called for both sides, determine the market value of the property.\nDecree affirmed at the cost of appellant.",
