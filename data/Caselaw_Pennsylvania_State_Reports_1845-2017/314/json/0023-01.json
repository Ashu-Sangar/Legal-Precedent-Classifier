Appellant\u2019s petition was presented to the judges of the court of common pleas sitting as a return board, and was in effect an attempt to have that body determine an election contest. This the lower court properly refused to do. \u201cA recomputation is not a substitute for a contest in which the legality of the votes actually cast may be passed upon.\u201d Luzerne County Election Returns, 301 Pa. 247, 258.
