A. Nimick, and included in the description the portion of the vacated part of First avenue, title to which was at issue in this proceeding. At the first trial of the case evidence was offered by defendant of acts and declarations of the parties, and particularly of the grantor prior to the date of the deed, and during the negotiations between the parties, to show that there'was an intention to convey the entire vacated portion of the street fronting on land owned by the grantor, which evidence was excluded. On appeal the decision was reversed and a new trial ordered, on the ground that such testimony should have been admitted. (See Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Company v. Bovaird &amp; Seyfang Mfg. Co., <a href="/pa/229/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="229 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="971780" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0295-01">229 Pa. 295</a>.) On the second trial of the case, the evidence previously excluded was admitted, but the lower court instructed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff on the ground that it was insufficient to sustain a verdict for the defendant.</p>

He was also a witness on this trial, and he was very clear that the words of the agreement expressed precisely what was intended to be conveyed, and Mr. Bovaird himself, the only witness offered as to what had occurred previous to the consummation of the sale, testified that the agreement represented fairly what was the subject of negotiation between him, on behalf of Bovaird &amp; Seyfang, and Mr. Herron, agent for Mr. Nimick, the grantor, saying further, when asked the plain question as to whether the agreement of February 21, 1890, shown witness, fairly represented the conversation between him and Mr. Herron as to the subject of this sale, “I think it does,” and from the time the agreement was concluded, and the price agreed upon, <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>the witness said he had never met Alexander Nimick. So that at the conversation between Mr. Nimick and this witness, which occurred some time before the agreement was made, there were actually no negotiations for a sale, the only negotiations which resulted in the sale occurring between the witness, Mr. Bovaird, and Mr. Herron, the agent for Mr. Nimick, and both of these witnesses testify in substance that the agreement properly represented what was the subject of negotiation for the sale.</p>

In the conversation referred to as occurring between the grantor, Nimick, and the witness, as agent for the grantees, there were no negotiations for a sale, and even if they had been considered such, they were merged in the agreement and in the negotiations which occurred at the time of the execution of the agreement, and the witnesses state specifically that the agreement fairly represents what was the subject of conversation and negotiation for sale.</p>

Bovaird and Seyfang Mfg. Co., <a href="/pa/229/0295-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="229 Pa. 295" data-case-ids="971780" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0295-01">229 Pa. 295</a>. We had some doubt then as to whether judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto should not have been entered upon the whole record, but that doubt was resolved in favor of plaintiffs, and a venire facias de novo was awarded. We then thought, and are of the same opinion still, having due regard to the law, the most favorable view to be taken of the contentions of plaintiffs, is that under all the facts and circumstances the case was for the jury. It w;as so determined then and nothing in the present record warrants a different conclusion now. Indeed, in the light of the parol testimony which was properly introduced at the second trial, defendant presents a much stronger case. In the former case it was held that declarations or statements made by the grantor to the purchasers or their representative while the negotiations were pending as to the land to be included in the grant were properly admissible- in evidence. In view of what was then decided as to this question it is perfectly clear that the testimony of Walter Bovaird was properly admitted, and that the effect of it was for the jury.. The acts and declarations of Alexander Nimick testified to by this witness, formed part of the transaction that resulted in the purchase of the property and the execution and delivery of the deed to the purchaser. It strengthened the case of the defendant and could be considered by the jury in determining what land was intended to be included in the grant. It is argued now, as it was before, that it is the province of the court to construe written instruments, and of course it must be conceded that this is the general rule. But this question was fully considered <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>when the case was here before, and all that was said then by this court is applicable now. We cannot agree with the view expressed by the learned court below in discharging the rule for judgment non obstante, and in refusing a new trial. Directing a verdict for plaintiffs was clear error. It will serve no useful purpose to prolong this discussion.</p>
