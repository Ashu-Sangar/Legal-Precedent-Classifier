The defense of moral insanity or irresistible impulse can only be recognized in the clearest cases, where it is shown to have been habitual, or at least to have evinced itself on more than a single instance.

Upon the trial of an indictment for murder, where the defense relied upon was insanity in the form of delusions of oppression and threats against the defendant’s life which produced homicidal mania at the time of the killing, it appeared that the defendant had been a boarder at the home of the deceased, who had ordered him out of the house a short time before the homicide; that a few days prior to the shooting the defendant had borrowed a gun and on the afternoon of the shooting he had returned to the residence of the deceased and deposited the gun on the porch; that in the evening the deceased upon opening the door in response to a rap was shot in the head by the defendant who stood on the outside with the weapon in his hand. The defendant in a voluntary confession said that he had committed the deed because the deceased had treated his own wife badly and had threatened defendant’s life. There was testimony that the defendant had had improper relations with the wife of the deceased. The defendant testifying in his own behalf said that he did not remember what he did after taking up the gun and that his first realization that he had killed the deceased came at a later time, and also that he did not know just what he had in mind when he entered the yard. He testified further that the so-called threats all antedated the killing, and he did not say that at the time of the homicide he had any immediate hallucinations or that he was forced by an irresistible impulse to kill deceased. The evidence depended" upon to show insanity tended to show that the defendant <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>was melancholy by nature and from time to time imagined that others wanted to harm or to kill him; but that he was normally a mild-mannered man who did not attempt harm. There was no testimony that his alleged delusions had in the past ever impelled him to attempt to punish, much less to kill, his supposed enemies, and the only testimony concerning homicidal tendencies was that of an expert witness who testified that “many cases of paranoia have homicidal tendencies.” <em>Meld, </em>a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree was justified.</p>

Calhoun, a man about fifty years old, shot and killed Benjamin Galloup on the night of December 16, 1911. Calhoun had been a boarder in the home of the deceased, who had ordered him out of the house a short time before the homicide. Several days prior to the shooting the defendant borrowed a gun from a member of the Galloup family, and on the afternoon of December 16th he returned to the residence of the deceased and deposited the gun on the porch; that evening a rap came at the door, and as soon as Galloup opened it he was shot in the head by the defendant, who stood on the outside with this weapon in his hand; Calhoun was arrested; at first he refused to make any admissions, but soon made what the Commonwealth proved to be a voluntary confession, in which he said that he committed the deed because Gal<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>loup had treated his wife (Mrs. Galloup) badly and had threatened his, the defendant’s life. The theory of the Commonwealth was that a breach had occurred between the murdered man and his slayer, caused by the discovery of the latter’s improper relations with the former’s wife; and there is positive testimony in the case that late in September or early in October, 1911, the defendant accompanied Mrs. Galloup to a neighboring town, where they stayed over night occupying a room together as man and wife.</p>

I do not remember after that what I done.” He was then asked the question, “What is your first recollection now after picking up the gun?” and he replied, “I could not say, I don’t know.” The defendant later said that his first realization that he had killed Galloup came when told by the mayor of Huntingdon that seven or eight people had seen him do the deed; the witness was then asked what he had in his mind when he entered the yard just prior to the killing, and said, “I don’t know just what I had in mind when I entered the yard......” On cross-examination he said that he went in the back way and picked up the gun, and then the question was put to him, “There your mind ends?” and he replied, “There is a blank to me. Yes.” The defense, as we understand it from the contentions of counsel, was insanity in the form of delusionjs of oppression and threats against the defendant’s life which produced homicidal mania; but Colhoun when upon the stand testified that the so-called threats all antedated December 16th, 1911, and he did not say that at the time of the homicide he had any immediate hallucinations or that he was forced by an irresistible impulse to kill Galloup; as <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>just shown, his testimony was that he did not realize the nature of the act he was committing, — that he actually did not know that he was doing the deed at the time of the shooting. The evidence depended upon to show insanity was that of the prisoner himself and the written depositions of five persons in the west who had known him before he came to Huntingdon in August, 1911, together with the testimony of two doctors called as experts. The lay witnesses testified that the defendant was peculiar and melancholy by nature and from time to time imagined that others wanted to harm or to kill him; but that he was normally a mild-mannered man who did not attempt harm, and when he suspected that anyone was going to injure him he habitually moved to another neighborhood. One of the witnesses, a relative who had known the defendant for about fifteen years, said, “I would not call him a purely insane man. He was insane to a certain extent; but he really didn’t have his own mind.” Another relative who had known the defendant all his life stated, “At times he was apparently perfectly sane.” None of the witnesses from the west had any personal knowledge through contact with Calhoun for about eighteen, months before the date of the murder, and no one was called to prove insanity who had associated with him after he came east. There was no testimony that the alleged delusion that others, wanted to kill the deffendant had in the past ever impelled him to attempt to punish, much less to kill, his supposed enemies; and when his chief medical expert was asked, “Is this disease of such a nature and are the delusions of such a character as might readily produce a homicidal mania?” he replied, “Many cases of paranoia have homicidal tendencies.” This reply is the nearest and practically the only testimony we find in the case concerning homicidal tendencies in any direct connection with the defendant. When this witness was asked specifically whether the alleged disease from which he said the de<a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>fendant suffered would be diagnosed as “partial insanity” or “total insanity,” he did not give a responsive answer. In point of fact, the evidence would not justify a finding that the defendant had in the past suffered from total insanity (sometimes described as general, habitual or fixed insanity) or from partial insanity accompanied by a homicidal tendency. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth produced a number of persons who had worked or associated with the defendant since his arrival in Huntingdon, and who testified that they believed him to be sane; medical testimony to the same effect was also produced.</p>

Counsel for the defendant stated the common law definition of murder to one of the jurors, and then asked, “What do you understand by the words, a person of sound memory and discretion?”; another was asked, if the testimony satisfied him that the accused was insane at the time of the crime and had committed the deed while under the control of an irresistible impulse to take life, “Would you deem him legally responsible for his deed?” The trial judge was clearly right in refusing to allow either of these questions. Counsel may not examine a proposed juror upon his understanding of the law, and that is what these interrogations amounted" to. One called, to the book as a juror may be asked the broad question, whether, if sworn as a trier, he would accept and act upon the law as stated to him by the court; and this is as far as the examination on the voir dire may properly proceed along that line. (On this general subject, see Hall v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20W.N.C.%2025" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="22 W.N.C. 25">22 W. N. C. 25</a>.)</p>

Here the testimony adduced merely amounted to an expression of opinion on the mental state of the defendant at the time of the trial, founded upon the witness’s conversations with the accused and observation of him while in prison and during his cross-examination; as it appears upon the record, we see no error in the admission of this evidence. The witness was not called by the Commonwealth as a principal or leading expert, and his testimony was most brief; whether or not it was urged beyond its legitimate scope does not appear, but considering the whole body of the evidence, it is not probable that it exercised any controlling weight in determining the verdict.</p>

We agree with the trial judge, that “When these excerpts are read into the whole charge ......the defendant has no just ground for complaint”; and that is the test to apply: Commonwealth v. Johnson, <a href="/pa/133/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="133 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="812896" data-case-paths="/pa/133/0293-01">133 Pa. 293</a>, 305. In reference to the specific legal questions raised by these assignments: the instruction that “the insanity which constitutes the defense must be shown to have existed at the time the act was committed,” was entirely correct: Ortwein v. Com., <a href="/pa/76/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="76 Pa. 414" data-case-ids="1038859" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0414-01">76 Pa. 414</a>, 424; Coyle v.

The use of the word “idiotic” was inapt, but this was immediately followed by other words appropriate to the defense, and ivhen the portion of the charge in question is taken as a whole, it is clear that the jury could not have been misled by the word complained of. In view of the testimony given by W. C. Calhoun, one of the witnesses for the defense, to the effect that the defendant occasionally had “fits of anger” and at such times “avouM commit acts that no sane man would commit,” the statement that “transitory frenzy” was not recognized in the criminal law of Pennsylvania as a defense to murder (Com. v. Renzo, <a href="/pa/216/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="216 Pa. 147" data-case-ids="950361" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0147-01">216 Pa. 147</a>, 149), was not inappropriate. The instruction that if the jury were satisfied by the fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant did the killing “without knowing what he was doing” they should acquit on the ground of insanity, but “if, on the other hand, the evidence does not so satisfy you,” he should not be acquitted, was entirely appropriate and correct; and this is particularly so, in view of the testimony of the defendant that he did not know what he was doing at the time he fired the shot. It is not necessary to cover every possible element of a defense at one time; in other parts of the charge the “trial judge told the jury that if the defendant’s mind was so affected that he did not appreciate the nature and consequence of his act or realize that it was wrong, he should be ac<a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>quitted; he particularly instructed that if they believed the defendant had an irresistible impulse to commit the crime, — that “he was impelled by an impulse or a spell, ......or delusion that he had no power whatever to resist,” they should acquit him; and almost the last words uttered were the affirmance of one of the defendant’s points which instructed, — “even if the jury believe that the prisoner could distinguish at the time the crime was committed the difference between right and wrong; yet, if they further believe that, with reference to the particular act for which he is now on trial, his reason, conscience and judgment were so entirely perverted as to render the commission of the act a duty of overwhelming necessity, then this state of mind would excuse the crime and the defendant would not be guilty of murder.” Under these circumstances, the appellant’s contention that the charge was inadequate in that it did not sufficiently instruct upon moral insanity or irresistible impulse, cannot be sustained. Before leaving the consideration of this particular complaint, it may be well to note that the defendant did not say that he suffered from a distinct impulse to commit the act, and there was not sufficient testimony to show a present existing or a past habitual tendency to homicidal mania; in Com. v. Mosler, <a href="/pa/4/0264-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="4 Pa. 264" data-case-ids="401928" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0264-01">4 Pa. 264</a>, 267, Gibson, C. J., stated, “The doctrine which acknowledges this mania is dangerous in its relations, and can be recognized only in the clearest cases. It ought to be shown to have been habitual, or at least to have evinced itself on more- than a single instance...... To establish it as a justification in any particular case it is necessary either to show, by clear proof, its contemporaneous existence by present circumstances, or the existence of a habitual tendency developed in previous cases, becoming in itself a second nature”; also see Coyle v. Com., <a href="/pa/100/0573-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="100 Pa. 573" data-case-ids="498452" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0573-01">100 Pa. 573</a>, 578, and Com. v.

The requests were all refused; but in answering them the trial judge again told the jury, “In order to excuse one who has committed the crime of murder, on the ground of insanity, it must be shown by fairly preponderating evidence that at the time when he committed the act his mind was so affected by disease that he did not know the nature and consequence of his act, or if he did know the nature and consequence of it, then he didn’t know that it was wrong and would be punished by law, or that he was so impelled by an impulse that he had no power whatever of resisting, and the burden of proof is upon him.” Many reasons justify the refusal of these requests, and the answer (in accord with the law, Com. v.

The point is faulty so far as it relates to partial insanity, in that the limiting expression, “he believed that it was either his life or that of the deceased,” is too general and indefinite to comprehend a state of facts, imagined by the defendant, sufficient to excuse the homicide on the ground of hallucinations; <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>and it does not suggest the absolute necessity for tbe alleged delusion to have so operated on tbe mind of tbe accused as to bave caused bim to kill for bis own supposed protection.
