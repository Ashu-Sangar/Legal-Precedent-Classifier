(a) It must be conceded that if testator had stopped at the first dispository clause his widow would have taken an absolute estate • but his will must be construed by its four corners, and that shows unmistakably an intent to give her a lesser estate. Her dispository clause raised only a presumption of fee which was explained and modified by subsequent provisions. The clause immediately following the first defines the extent and mode of her enjoyment which he intends she shall have of it. She might consume part or the whole of it, but power of disposition of “remaining property,” if any, was denied her, for that was specifically and directly given to certain children. She might sell and transfer the “title,” for the purpose of maintenance, but for no other. The fact that testator made provision, carefully and at length, for his children, shows that he had in contemplation a surplus of which they would have the benefit. The provision was unlike that in Good v. Fichthorn, <a href="/pa/144/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="144 Pa. 287" data-case-ids="823792" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0287-01">144 Pa. 287</a>, to be made by the widow, but came directly from him. The children appear as intended objects of his bounty as clearly defined as the wife. The principle which underlies cases of this class is well settled. Both the admitted rules of legal construction and the statute of wills regard a limitation over after the death of the first taker in such case as evidence of an intention that the devisee or legatee of the prior estate in order of enjoyment is to have no more than an estate or interest for life: Sheets’ Est., <a href="/pa/52/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="52 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="1002227" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0257-01">52 Pa. 257</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b374-4" data-blocks='[["BL_374.4",374,[294,611,1160,962]]]'>(b) The devise to Mrs. Miller and her children falls within the principle of Hague v. Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a>; Vaughan’s Est., <a href="/pa/230/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="230 Pa. 554" data-case-ids="8846654" data-case-paths="/pa/230/0554-01">230 Pa. 554</a>; and, therefore, a life estate in her, and the remainder in the children who might be living at her death. The reason of the rule lies in the fact that the devise to children is to them as a class which cannot be ascertained until the death of the parent when the possibility of issue is extinct, and the parent can therefore, from necessity, take only a life estate. It is immaterial to the application of the rule that there are no children in existence when the will is made. In Oyster v. Knull, <a href="/pa/137/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="137 Pa. 448" data-case-ids="821482" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0448-01">137 Pa. 448</a>, it was said nothing could “be predicted of the facts that the plaintiff was only ten years of age when his father died and has since remained unmarried and childless,” and it is well settled that the devise will open up to let in children born after testator’s death: Hague v. Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a>.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b374-5" data-blocks='[["BL_374.5",374,[292,1595,1156,534]]]'>The clause of prohibition of sale “by third parties,” which follows this clause, is insensible as it stands. Read as a general prohibition it is against public policy; but restricted to the ascertainment of the class as was probably intended, it is legitimate and entirely in harmony with the construction above adopted, for it could not be known until then who were entitled to convey. There could have been no other purpose than to ensure the enjoyment of testator’s bounty by his descendants: Hague v. Hague, <a href="/pa/161/0643-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="161 Pa. 643" data-case-ids="854216" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0643-01">161 Pa. 643</a>.</p>

If the heirs of Mr. Keown had filed a bill in equity against his widow to enforce conveyance of this land and she had united with them in asking a decree, there could have been no <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>reason for refusing. The parties would have been competent to act and there was a strong equity to conveyance. The heirs of Mr. Keown, now also become the heirs of Mrs. Keown by intestacy, had full power to do, and voluntarily did, what the court might have done in the other event. It is objected that the agreement contemplates conveyance for a consideration. But the declared purpose was to recognize and establish Mr. Keown’s title, and conveyance was a mere matter of evidence of an executed purpose, while the consideration expressed to be paid John Keown, Jr., was in fact the legacy which his father had given and to which he would, have been entitled in any event. Assuming, then, that Mr. Keown was the owner of this tract of land, as his heirs claimed and his wife’s heirs admitted, it passed under his will and is a proper subject of partition as part of his estate.</p>
