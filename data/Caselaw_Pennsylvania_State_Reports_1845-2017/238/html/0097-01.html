    <p class="summary" id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.7",129,[159,1129,1151,592]]]'>Although the defendant in good faith tried to do as the contract requires, it failed to fill the space between the outer and inner casings with liquid cement. Of this the plaintiff complains and alleges that great injury is likely to follow “by reason of gas which probably will escape into the mine from the well now in course of drilling in the event gas should be encountered.” The defendant avers that it has taken every reasonable precaution to safeguard the property of plaintiff and that there is no probability whatever, if gas be discovered, that it will escape into the plaintiff’s coal mines.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b129-7" data-blocks='[["BL_129.8",129,[159,1734,1151,649]],["BL_130.1",130,[292,359,1156,98]]]'>At the threshold of the case it is highly important to determine whether the precautions already taken are sufficient to prevent the probable escape of gas. To permit the gas to escape into the mine would cause great damage to plaintiff and it might entirely destroy the property. The defendant has a right to bore through the stratum of coal in order to reach its gas, but every reasonable precaution must be taken to avoid injury to plaintiff’s property. There can be no absolute certainty about the matter. Neither side affirms positively what will follow in the event that gas should be found. The plaintiff avers that the gas probably will escape into the <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>mine. The defendant alleges that there is no probability that the gas will find its way into the mine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b130-4" data-blocks='[["BL_130.4",130,[288,469,1160,1628]]]'>The question then is: Whether reasonable precautions have been provided to prevent the escape of gas? The gas, if found, will pass from the gas sand through a four-inch tube, encased in a 6%-inch casing, which is placed in an eight and one-fourth-inch casing and this latter casing enclosed in a ten-inch casing and the whole tube surrounded by cement from the surface to the bottom of the Pittsburgh seam of coal. In order to prevent the escape of gas there are provided the four lines of pipe and the cement filling outside of the ten-inch casing. The coal mine contains sulphur water. The acid of this water corrodes iron. The witnesses differ as to the time it would take to destroy an iron pipe or to weaken it so that it would not hold the gas. There is much testimony on the part of plaintiff that the precautions provided in the contract are necessary to prevent leakage of gas. Mine inspectors and mining engineers, who have had experience in and about coal mines testify that the grouting required is a reasonable precaution. On the other side witnesses, who have had a large experience in the drilling of oil and gas wells through coal seams are of opinion that the filling with liquid cement of the space between the inner and outer casings is not necessary. It appears that many thousand gas wells have been drilled through coal veins and the witnesses, who are men of practical experience, testify that they never knew an instance where the gas escaped through the pipes into the coal mines. In some way, which is not clearly explained, it seems that the pipes thus used are not seriously affected by the sulphur water.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b130-5" data-blocks='[["BL_130.5",130,[288,2109,1156,318]],["BL_131.1",131,[156,348,1151,308]]]'>There is one other consideration which seems to give force to defendant’s contention that there is no human probability that gas will escape into the mine. The four-inch tube in which the gas is conveyed is encircled by a 6%-inch casing. Between this casing and tube is an open space and between the 6% and 8% casing is an<a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>other open, space free of obstructions to a distance of at least 1,100 feet from the surface. If gas should escape from the tube it would naturally pass through such spaces into the open air and it would have no tendency to pass through the remaining lines into the workings of the mine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b131-3" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[151,677,1155,1137]]]'>It seems to be fairly established, therefore, that there is no probability, if gas be struck, that any of it will find its way into plaintiff’s mine and that every reasonable precaution has been adopted to avoid such danger. Further than this the court should not go unless the duty is to enforce strictly the terms of the agreement of 20th April, 1908. The defendant in one particular has failed to carry out the agreement. It made a reasonable effort in good faith to do what the contract requires. Twenty-two sacks of cement were poured into the space between the two casings. It is demonstrated by a mathematical calculation, the only way it could be shown, that the quantity of cement was not sufficient to fill entirely the space between the two casings. The liquid cement was poured in until the space seemed to be filled as no more could be put therein. The testimony does not show the cause of the trouble. No fault is alleged on the part of the defendant. The space is not filled with liquid cement. Nor is there a suggestion of any way to fill it at this time. The contract has not been performed and cannot now be performed in this particular.</p>

This would occasion great loss to the defendant and, as we have seen, it would result in no material benefit to the plaintiff. Under existing conditions and in the light of the testimony there is no probability of gas from the well escaping into the mine. That the space between the casings be filled with cement is not apparently a necessary precaution against accident. Under such conditions is <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>the plaintiff entitled to an enforcement of the letter of this contract?</p>
