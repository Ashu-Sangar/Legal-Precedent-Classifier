The prohibition of the law is not only against the use of power machinery by convicts, but against power machinery in the institutions in aid of the convict’s labor.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[127,626,1150,476]]]'>1. The plaintiff is a manufacturer of mats at No. 1027 North Fourth street in the City of Philadelphia, State of Pennsylvania, and sells his manufactured product, inter alia, within the State of Pennsylvania. The defendant is warden of the Western Penitentiary located in Allegheny County, State of Pennsylvania, a State institution, wherein convict labor is performed; as such warden he has control of the employment of the inmates in this institution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b349-7" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[128,1121,1151,811]]]'>2. Mats are manufactured in the Western Penitentiary wholly by the hand and foot labor of the convicts — to the stage where shearing and braiding is required for the purpose of rendering them more merchantable in the open market. This finishing process of shearing and braiding is done by machines operated by steam power. These machines are located within the limits or walls of the penitentiary property, in a separate building and in part of said building separated by a partition from the convict laborers; these machines are operated entirely by free labor. To manufacture salable, merchantable mats for the general trade it is essential that they be smoothly and evenly sheared and braided. To do this by hand or foot labor exclusively is oppressive, severe and burdensome upon the laborers.</p>
