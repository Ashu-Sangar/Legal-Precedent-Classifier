    <p class="summary" id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[136,516,1152,701]]]'>On part of plaintiffs, however, it is contended that they are not confined to the remedy by forfeiture of the unexpired term, but that under the further provisions of said contract or lease they are entitled to a judgment for the rent for the unexpired term. The provision of the lease on which this contention rests is that “In case default be made any time in the payment of any one of said installments of rent when due and forthwith on any other breach of covenant upon the part of the lessee, the whole of the rent shall at the option of the lessors become due and payable and the lessors or their attorney may enter or confess judgment against the lessee for the whole amount of said rent, etc.”</p>

Such an interpretation of the written agreement does not, we think, harmonize with what seems to have been the evident intention of the parties. The remedy by forfeiture is, under the general rule for the benefit of the lessor and he is not obliged to invoke it against his will. But even assuming that the lessors had seen fit to assert their right of forfeiture, this would not still, under the provisions of the lease, have relieved the defendant from the payment of rent thereafter falling due. This would seem to be the meaning of that provision of tbe lease that “In case default be made at any time in the payment of any one of said installments of rent when due and forthwith on any other breach of covenant upon the part of the lessee the whole of the rent shall, at the option of the lessors become due and payable, and the lessors or their attorney may enter or confess judgment against the lessee for the whole amount of said rent.” This provision is supplemental to the prior provision whereby the lessors may forfeit <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>by reason of any unauthorized assignment of the lease. Such forfeiture would not end the contractual relations of the parties, but would still leave the defendant liable for all future rent, under the provision which we have just quoted. That such was the intention of the parties and that such is the meaning of their contract is further evidenced, we think, by the following provision: “A determining of the term or receipt of rent after default, or after judgment or after execution shall not deprive the lessors of other actions against the lessee for possession or for rent or damages, but the lessors may use the remedies herein given or those provided by law.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[330,1018,1158,638]]]'>We conclude therefore, that whilst the provision of the contract whereby the lessors may declare a forfeiture of the lease is one of the remedies at their disposal, yet, it is not an exclusive one, and if at their option it had been exercised, their right would still remain of entering judgment against the lessee for the whole amount of the rent and the defendant, we think, cannot be heard to complain that instead of declaring a forfeiture and supplementing such declaration of forfeiture with the judgment confessed for rent, the plaintiffs have entered judgment for the rent without declaring a forfeiture.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[330,1674,1156,372]]]'>It is- further contended on part of the defendant that the judgment entered in this case is without authority in law or under the terms of the lease, as in said lease no provision is contained authorizing the decision of the question of default by the lessors, and the entry of judgment against the lessee upon the ex parte affidavit of the plaintiffs or their representative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-7" data-blocks='[["BL_206.6",206,[327,2057,1155,372]],["BL_207.1",207,[141,366,1149,811]]]'>We must assume that the provision in the contract authorizing the plaintiffs, by their attorney, in certain events to confess judgment was intended to have a meaning and in certain contingencies to become operative. It is true that the contract of lease makes no provision whereby the fact of the alleged breach shall first be determined before judgment is entered. It is equally true <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>that no provision is made whereby the defendant can he heard before entry of judgment against him. In the absence of any such provision we think that the averment of the plaintiffs under oath of a breach of condition is sufficient in the first instance to support the judgment. Then, too, the contract itself provides that “for entering said judgment or judgments this lease or a copy thereof shall be a sufficient warrant to any person.” If the breach of condition be denied, such denial may be made the basis of a proceeding to open the judgment, as may also any denial on the part of the defendant that the rent represented, being the amount of the judgment, is properly due. For these reasons we conclude that the rule to strike off the judgment cannot be sustained and the same is therefore discharged.</p>
