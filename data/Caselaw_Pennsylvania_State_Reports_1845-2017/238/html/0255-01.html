C. Buchanan is entitled to receive a salary at the rate of one thousand dollars a year as provided by an act of assembly which was passed after he was inducted into his office and which increases the salary which he previously received. The relators contend that the words “public officer” in the section of the Constitution above <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>quoted mean a public officer which is recognized by the Constitution and not a legislative public officer; and they cite authorities of some of the lower courts of this State to sustain that contention. But we think these authorities are not in accordance with the decision of our Superior and Supreme Court, as found in a number of cases. There is no doubt that a distinction is to be made between the situation of one who occupies a constitutional office and that of an officer whose position is created by statute. The former has an exemption from the control of the legislature which does not exist in favor of the latter. But this distinction in our opinion does not exist when the sole question before the court is the interpretation of an act of assembly the sole purpose of which was to increase the salary of public officers. In other words, the words “public officer” when we are considering simply the question of raising or lowering the salary, must be given a meaning which it is evident that the legislature intended they should have. If we turn to the text books or to the decisions of our courts to find a definition of a public officer, we find that it would embrace the relators in this case. Wherever an officer exercises important duties and has delegated to him some of the functions of government, and his office is for a fixed term, and the power, duties and emoluments become vested in a successor when the office becomes vacant, such official may properly be called a public officer. The powers and duties attached to the position give it its character, and in considering the duties imposed upon the directors of the poor, we find one of the important things that they have to do is to make estimates and report them to the commissioners as a basis upon which they exercise the sovereign power of levying taxes. We find also that they are charged with the care and custody of the poor of the county and of the expenditure of money collected from the people by taxation and paid to them out of the county treasury. We find that they are <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>elected by tbe people as other public officers are elected and at the general election held for the election of other public officers, and they are elected for a specific term and they must give an account of how they expended the money committed to their care.</p>

A brief reference to the statute creating the office and prescribing his duties and powers will remove any doubt as to the character of his position. The special act provides for the erection of a house for the employment and support of the poor in Washington County. Pursuant to its provisions three directors of the poor are elected by the voters of the county for the term of three years and compensated for their services out of the public funds. They take an official oath, and are empowered to make rules and regulations for the government and support of the poor and house of employment and of the revenues thereunto belonging and of such persons as shall come under their cognizance. They are required to furnish annually an estimate of the probable expense of the poor and poorhouse to the county commissioners, who must assess and collect the amount of the estimate and pay the same to the poor directors by warrants drawn on the county treasurer. The directors disburse the fund in supporting and maintaining the poor of the county, and are required annually to render an account of moneys received and expended by them to the county auditors.</p>
