Eble. Mrs. Eble was a woman of considerable business experience, of strong mind and of unimpaired mental faculties. She died at the age of sixty-nine, possessed of an estate of $25,000 and left to survive her a husband, three sons and two daughters. By her will, which was executed three months before her death, she left her estate in trust, to pay a fixed amount weekly to her husband for life and to divide the remainder of the income among her children in the following proportions : one-eighth to her daughter Rose, the contestant and plaintiff in the issue, who had left her home and <a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>from whom she was estranged, one-eighth to her eldest son, Alfonso, who had received a considerable amount of money from her and one-fonrth to each of her other children. At the end of five years, the principal of the estate was to be divided among her children in the proportions she had directed the income to be distributed.</p>
    <p id="b616-4" data-blocks='[["BL_616.4",616,[293,676,1164,1352]]]'>The circumstances connected with the making of the will were these: Mrs. Eble had requested her son, Alfonso, to act as executor of her will. He declined to do so, and advised her to go to the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company. She went to the company accompanied by her son, John, who withdrew after they had introduced themselves, and she, while alone with the trust officer, told him what disposition she wished to make of her estate and her reasons for not making the distribution among her children equal. Two days later she went to the trust company alone and received the draft of the will, in which the provision for Rose was five dollars only, and took it away with her. Two weeks later she returned with the draff, and told the trust officer that while she disapproved of her daughter’s conduct, she desired to make a more liberal provision for her. He then rewrote the will and read it to Mrs. Eble, who expressed her satisfaction with it and took it to a bank where she was known and signed it in the presence of two officers of the bank who witnessed it. On returning the will to the trust officer, she was told that she had not signed it properly. She took it back to the bank, resigned it in the presence of the witnesses and then returned it to the trust officer who retained possession of it until it was offered for probate.</p>

The most that can be said of this testimony is that John had an opportunity to influence his mother and a motive for so doing. But there was no evidence that he had ever exercised any influence.</p>
