The personal property is there presumptively treated as cash although in fact it consisted in part at least of securities. It has been suggested that by the codicil Mrs. Bradley undertook to dispose of <em>all </em>her personal property; but this is a mistake. She disposes of “my personal property ......as follows,” and then immediately gives a specification of items which are to form the subject of this eodicillary gift. The simple question then is whether or not there was property on hand answering the description of “stocks I have on interest.” It is insisted that this form of expression was intended to embrace any sort of investment bearing interest, and therefore the mortgage which Mrs. Bradley had on hand. But the primary meaning of the word “stocks” is shares in a corporation or commercial company; Webster’s Diet. Bouvier: On the face of the will there is nothing to show its intended use in a different sense. The gift is of “stocks,” with their incidental product; and it is immaterial what this product may be called, whether by its ordinary name of dividends, or an equivalent, such ■as income, or interest: Reed v. Head, <a href="/mass/88/0174-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="88 Mass. 174" data-case-ids="2124646" data-case-paths="/mass/88/0174-01">88 Mass. 174</a>,177; Gibbons v. Mahon, <a href="/us/136/0549-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="136 U.S. 549" data-case-ids="1217872" data-case-paths="/us/136/0549-01">136 U. S. 549</a> (10 Sup. Ct. Repr. 1057). The mention of interest in this connection, was obviously intended solely as a mark of distinction from other assets, and identification, of the thing given— “stocks that I have on interest” — and when the fact of productiveness had been established, the gift became specific and separated from the general residuary dispo<a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>sition. As this is an incident of fact, the burden is obviously on the legatee as a basis of claim to show it; and the proof here goes no further than the productiveness of Mrs. Bradley’s stock in the Wilkinsburg Real Estate <em>&amp; </em>Trust Company. The fact that the Wireless Telegraph Company has declared no dividend since Mrs. Bradley’s death, would seem to imply that it was unproductive before.</p>
