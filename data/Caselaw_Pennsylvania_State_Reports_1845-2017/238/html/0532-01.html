The fund, seventeen hundred dollars, under a decree of this court, was paid into court “for the benefit of such of the said parties as shall appear to be entitled thereto.” The plaintiff, by the undenied averments of the bill, admits the offer of commission of two per cent, to whoever would secure a purchaser, but avers that it does not know who is entitled thereto.</p>

Henry Fitzpatrick, one of the claiming defendants, is a real estate broker; he was licensed as such, complying with an ordinance of the City of Pittsburgh in relation thereto, on the first day of August, 1909. He was the agent of the St. Peter’s Italian Roman Catholic Church and of the priests in charge for the purpose of procuring a suitable location and site for church and parochial purposes. As such agent, he brought to the notice of said church authorities various properties, running back for a period of five years or more prior to the date of the transaction in this case; among others, he frequently and continuously called attention to the property owned by the plaintiff corporation, described in the first paragraph of the bill, made part hereof, <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>known as the Central Turnverein of Pittsburgh’s property on Forbes street. Objection was made to this property on account of its distance from the then site of this church organization and on account of the high price at which it was understood the property was being held.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b562-4" data-blocks='[["BL_562.4",562,[304,668,1157,864]]]'>Fourth. Some time prior to May 31, 1910, Reverend Father Alfonso. Parziali, the then priest in charge of said congregation, sent for Fitzpatrick and told him he was willing to pay eighty-five thousand dollars, perhaps more, up to ninety thousand dollars, for said property, and authorized him to acquire it. On June 9th he gave Fitzpatrick an agreement in writing, to pay the amount of eighty-five thousand dollars therefor; this was handed to.E. C. Brainerd, who, Fitzpatrick assumed, had listed the property and with whom he was ready to co-operate; Brainerd apparently took up this proposition and communicated with the plaintiff association; no speedy result being attained through Brainerd, Fitzpatrick directly entered into negotiations with the president of the plaintiff corporation, G. A. Wickman, and on June 23, 1910, submitted the following proposition:</p>

A meeting of the plaintiff association was then called, to consider this proposition; in substance, it was accepted and referred to the sales committee of the plaintiff association; on June 30th Fitzpatrick, with Father Parziali, who was then disclosed as the pur-. <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>chaser to the plaintiff association, with counsel for the various parties met and shortly thereafter the transaction was closed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b563-3" data-blocks='[["BL_563.4",563,[140,509,1153,1301]]]'>Sixth. In the meanwhile the other claimant, Louis H. Kaiser, janitor and care taker of plaintiff’s property, not a real estate broker, and one of the members of plaintiff association, in April, 1909, had rented this property to Father Parziali for some church function; in April, 1910, he again rented the property for the same purpose to the same party. Kaiser, knowing that there was a two per cent, commission for any one who would bring about a sale, began negotiations with Father Parziali for the purchase thereof, showed him through the building; assisted him in making measurements, and submitted the asking price, ninety-eight thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars — the testimony is not clear as to the amount; he obtained from Father Parziali, on or before May 1st of that year, an offer in writing for eighty-five thousand dollars. This offer was promptly submitted to the plaintiff association. On June 14th Father Parziala withdrew his former offer and reduced it to eighty thousand dollars, which latter offer he repeated on June 15th. He then declined to deal further with or through Kaiser, having meanwhile taken up negotiations with his own agent, Fitzpatrick, and which culminated as set forth in the preceding findings.</p>

Fitzpatrick was the first of the claimants to bring this property in a general way to the attention of the church authorities; he did not submit an offer and did not communicate with the vendors until after Father Parziali had entered into negotiations with Kaiser for the same property at the same price; he did not disclose the name of his principal until after his offer was accepted, nor did he disclose to the plaintiff association that his principal might pay more. The reason given by Father Parziali for withdrawing his negotiations through Kaiser was that be believed Kaiser, <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>as an owner, was not in position to deal satisfactorily for him in the purchase thereof; therefore, later, he acted solely through Fitzpatrick as his agent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b564-4" data-blocks='[["BL_564.4",564,[263,499,1159,644]]]'>Eighth. Kaiser, as the representative of the plaintiff association, was the first to cause the church authorities, through Father Parziali, the priest in charge, to make up their minds to purchase this property; he obtained the first offer;' he brought the minds of the parties nearer a conclusion; the letters to him of January 14th and 15th are not an abandonment of a desire to purchase this property; the substance of them is that unless eighty thousand dollars was satisfactory nothing further would be done; this is wholly inconsistent with the vendee’s then outstanding offer through Fitzpatrick, to pay eighty-five thousand dollars and perhaps more.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b564-6" data-blocks='[["BL_564.6",564,[258,1264,1155,525]]]'>First. Fitzpatrick, the admitted agent of Father Parziali, knew that his principal would pay more than eighty-five thousand dollars, perhaps ninety thousand dollars. This knowledge he did not communicate to the vendor; presumptively, as agent, he had the knowledge of his principal in that the latter was dealing through Kaiser for this same property; when he submitted his proposition that he had a responsible party to purchase the land, impliedly he became the agent of the vendor to sell.</p>

Conceding that Fitzpatrick closed the sale, yet his labors only began to be effective after the parties had been brought together by Kaiser. Prior to- May 1, 1910, Fitzpatrick, while calling his principal’s attention to this property with many others, was never authorized to enter into negotiations for the purchase thereof, and never came in contact with the vendor; he did not introduce or bring the vendor and vendee together.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b565-3" data-blocks='[["BL_565.4",565,[104,789,1152,971]]]'>Third. The examination of the property with a view to purchase, the determination to purchase, arose in May, 1910, through the efforts of Kaiser and resulted in the submission of a price, which was promptly submitted and never actually declined; negotiations were pending for the purchase of this property by Father Parziali through Kaiser, before Fitzpatrick was called in directly to represent the vendee. The fact that in connection with these negotiations the vendee employed Fitzpatrick as its agent to consummate what it had in process through Kaiser does not affect the result, to wit: that by Kaiser’s efforts, negotiations were begun and were in existence. The letters of June 14th and 15th, reducing the offer to eighty thousand dollars, were not the end of the negotiations; Father Parziali himself says he changed the medium through whom he would deal for this same property because it was more to his advantage.</p>
