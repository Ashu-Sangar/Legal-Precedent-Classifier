A special verdict was taken, from which it appears that William J. Nicholson, the father of the plaintiff, died in 1819, seized 'of the land in question and leaving a will, a copy of which is made part of the verdict; that William J. Nicholson left surviving him his widow, Susanah Nicholson, and the plaintiff who was his only <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>child; that after his death a posthumous child, a daughter, was born to him not provided for in the will, which lived a few months; that Susanah Nicholson, the widow of William J. Nicholson, died in 1904; that the plaintiff is above the age of 21 years and is without issue, never having been married, and has agreed to sell the land to the defendant for $1,600.00, and that a deed has been tendered but was refused upon the allegation of the defendant that the title in the plaintiff is not a marketable title in fee to the whole of the land. The will of William J. Nicholson, after disposing of some specific legacies, gives all the residue of his estate, including the land in question, to his wife, Susanah, “until my daughter Nancy Nicholson shall arrive at the age of 21 years, after which my wife Susanah shall only have one-third of the proceeds thereof for and during the balance of her natural life......and after the decease of my wife I do give and bequeath the same unto my daughter Nancy Nicholson aforesaid, and her heirs and assigns; and if my daughter Nancy Nicholson shall die in her minority or unmarried or without issue” after her death and the death of my wife Susanah Nicholson I then do give the same to my brother John Nicholson, his heirs and assigns forever.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[296,1653,1157,746]],["BL_387.1",387,[149,353,1152,1835]]]'>It is admitted that the plaintiff inherited one undivided half of the land in question from her deceased sister, the posthumous child above mentioned, and the only question is as to the title of the other half. The devise over to John Nicholson is upon the contingency of the plaintiff dying “in her minority or unmarried or without issue.” She is still unmarried and without issue. If, therefore, the word “or” in either of the cases in which it is here used is to be treated as a disjunctive there can be no question that the plaintiff is not in position to convey a marketable title to the undivided half of the land in question. We are clearly of opinion, however, that these words are to be taken conjunctively. Where a devise over is made if the first taker dies with<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>out issue or heirs or before reaching a certain age the uniform construction has been that the word “or” is to be treated as a conjunctive. Cases to this effect can be found in Dcebler’s App., <a href="/pa/64/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="64 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="1021310" data-case-paths="/pa/64/0009-01">64 Pa. 9</a>, 14. It is there said that this construction has been- so conclusively settled as to have become one of the landmarks of the law not now to be shaken. The only remaining question will then be whether the use of two disjunctives makes any difference. Of course, if the third disjunctive introduces a matter not connected with the second but of a different nature the gift over does not take effect unless both contingencies occur, but where, as in this case, the third contingency is closely connected with the second and in a sense an expansion of it, there appears no reason why the same rule should not be applied. The reason of the rule applies in one case exactly as in the other. But we are not without authority for the exact case in question. In the case of Holmes v. Holmes, 5 Binney 252, Chief Justice Tilgiiman cites with approval the case of Frammingham v. Brand, 1 Wils. 140, decided by Lord Hardwicke, where the devise over was in case the son of the testator should “happen to die in his minority or unmarried or without issue, then I give the inheritance in fee to H. B.,” and where it was held that the son took an absolute estate in fee upon his arrival at the age of 21. In the case of Scott v. Price, 2 S. &amp; R. 59, the executory devise was of a sum of money, which it was determined, however, was to be treated in the same manner as a devise of real estate, and the provision was that upon the contingency of the beneficiary dying before the age of 21 years unmarried or without lawful issue the gift should go over, and it was held that upon arriving at the age of 21 years the gift became absolute.</p>
