He further provided that at the death of either of his sisters the “balance of money in bank be held for survivor to be used for her support.” At the death of both sisters the balance of moneys was to be paid to a charity named.

At the death of both my sisters the balance of moneys is to be paid to the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions.” The bequest to the Board of Foreign Missions was void because of the death of the testator within thirty days of the execution of his will and the entire fund was claimed by the sisters of the testator, the appellants, on the ground that since they were entitled to the whole income and privileged to use the principal in case of necessity the gift was absolute. This claim was not sustained by the auditor but he awarded to them the shares to which they would be entitled under the intestate laws. This award was set aside by the Orphans’ Court and the whole fund in the hands of the executors was awarded to the trustee for the purpose named in the will. From the order making this award the appeal is taken.</p>
