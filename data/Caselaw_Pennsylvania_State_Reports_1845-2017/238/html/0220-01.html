In my opinion it must be so considered and treated in the determination of the questions whether one or both of the pieces were converted into personalty by the will of the testator, and, if so, whether one or both were subsequently reconverted by the beneficiaries and when. The exceptants contend that it was the intention of the testator to convert both tracts into personalty, and the auditor has so found: Severns’s Est., <a href="/pa/211/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="211 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="940098" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0065-01">211 Pa. 65</a>; Jones v.

This election was unequivocally mani<a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>tested when they accepted it as unconverted and proceeded to sell and convey the lots into which it had been divided. In October, 1901, they sold and conveyed one of these lots to Dennis A. Duff and also one to R. C. McElfresh. The executor and widow of the testator joined in the execution of these deeds, but there is no evidence showing that they received any part of the proceeds of the sale, and the fair inference is that the same were received by Warren T. McClarren and George K. McClarren, the beneficiaries under the will who executed the deeds. The executor in his final account in 1902 charged himself with $224.45 received from Dennis A. Duff and $65.64 received from R. F. McElfresh; but there is nothing to show that these sums were any part of the proceeds of the sales of these lots. If they had been it could have been readily proven, and the burden to so prove was on those who now allege it. There is nothing to show that the executor had anything to do with negotiating the sales of these lots, or that he received any part of the proceeds. The only reasonable inference from the facts and circumstances in evidence is that the sales were made by the beneficiaries, Warren T. McClarren and George K. McClarren, and that the proceeds of the same were received by them. The joining of the executor and widow in the execution of the deeds was perfunctory, and no doubt was done at the instance of the purchasers to remove any question in their minds about the title they were acquiring. It appears that one of the lots in this plan of lots had been sold to James W. Lockhart in the testator’s lifetime, and after his death the widow, executor, and Warren T. McClarren and George K. McClarren, August 7,1901, joined in executing and delivering a deed to Lockhart for the same. From this it is argued that the deeds executed by the same parties to Dennis A. Duff and R. C. McElfresh were for lots sold by the testator in his lifetime. This contention, however, is answered by the rule of non sequitur. If such were the fact it could have and should <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>have been proven. It is significant that in the deed to Lockhart it is recited that the lot therein described is “the same lot sold by P. F. McClarren (the testator) to the said James W. Lockhart by Article of Agreement dated 23d day of September, A. D. 1899.” The deeds to Duff and McElfresh were made about the same time as the deed to Lockhart, but contain no such recital.</p>

McClarren and George K. McClarren, who, April 2, 1902, receipted for their distributive shares and executed a release and discharge of the executor “with the same force and effect as if the said balance had been distributed by the Orphans’ Court of Armstrong County.” This practically severed the executor’s connection with the estate. He never exercised or offered to exercise any power or authority conferred upon him by the will in reference to the testator’s real estate. About three years after the widow’s death, under and pursuant to the agreement herein before referred to, he sold the real estate devised to her for life for $8,050, and the remaining lots of that part of the real estate that had been laid out in lots for $4,600. After the executor had filed his account of the personal estate the beneficiaries of the real estate continued to deal with the tract comprising the plan of lots as unconverted, thereby confirming their prior election to accept it as real estate instead of the proceeds thereof. They sold a number of lots and executed and delivered deeds to purchasers, and in various other ways set out by auditor in his report indicated their prior election to take this real estate as land instead of money. Assuming that the will converted this part of the testator’s real estate into personalty, the beneficiaries reconverted it into real estate as early as October, 1901, when they sold a part of the same and executed and delivered deeds to the purchasers therefor: <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Smith v.

Prom the time of the sale of the first lot in October, 1901, down to the final sale of the remaining lots in 1910 all the joint and several acts of the beneficiaries clearly and unequivocally indicated their election to hold this real estate as such. It is disputed that the testator by his will converted this part of the real estate into personalty, but inasmuch as the beneficiaries reconverted it into realty as of the date of October,......, 1901, the distribution of the proceeds of sale is not affected if it be granted that the will did convert it into personalty.</p>

A few days after her death they did so elect by taking possession of it and leasing it, collecting the rents and dividing the same equally between them after paying thereout the taxes assessed on both tracts and the insurance on buildings on this particular tract. After her death December 15,1907, they assumed absolute control and dominion over this part of the real estate and treated and dealt with it as such until it was sold pursuant to the agreement herein referred to. The testator positively and explicitly directs this part of his real estate to be sold after the death of his widow and the proceeds arising from such sale to be equally divided between his two sons.

The original report was referred back to him to make distribution in accordance with the opinion of the court on the exceptions filed thereto and also for further consideration by him of the question raised as to the nature and effect of the deeds made by the executor and the widow and legatees of the testator and delivered to Dennis A. Duff and R. C. McElfresh for lots Nos. 37 and 38. These deeds were made and delivered in 1901 and were held by the court to manifest a clear and unequivocal intention on the part of the legatees to take the real estate of which they were a part in its unconverted state. It was contended, however, by judgment creditors of George K. McOlarren, one of the legatees, that these deeds were made in pursuance of sales by the testator in his lifetime on articles of agreement and therefore could not be given <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>the effect of working a reconversion of this part of the testator’s real estate which by his will he had converted into personalty. The court indicated in the opinion filed that if the auditor should find that these deeds were executed and delivered in consummation of sales made by the testator, and from the testimony offered on the reference of this question to him he has so foundj the reconversion of the real estate of which these lots were a part was not effected until June, 1905, when the legatees in their own right sold and conveyed certain of these lots and thereby clearly and unequivocally expressed their intention to take this real estate in its unconverted state. This change in the date when the reconversion was effected materially affects the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of this real estate. If the reconversion took place in 1901, then the judgments of Alex. Hileman and Mary Montgomery, et al., became the first liens thereon and would be entitled to the proceeds of the sale; but if it did not take place until 1905, the judgments of other creditors became the first liens thereon and would take the proceeds.</p>

Tbe sole controversy between them is, when was this reconversion effected. The auditor was of tbe opinion that it took place shortly after tbe testator’s death or at least prior to tbe time of tbe entry of tbe Hileman and Montgomery judgments, October 18, 1902, and made no distinction between that part of tbe real estate laid out into lots which tbe executor was empowered to sell forthwith and to divide tbe proceeds in equal shares between bis two sons and that part devised to bis widow for life with direction to sell after her death and to divide tbe proceeds thereof between said sons share and share alike. In tbe opinion of tbe court this conclusion of tbe auditor was not sustained by tbe evidence or tbe law applicable thereto. In bis supplemental report tbe auditor still adheres to bis original opinion on this question, but, constrained by tbe views of tbe court, be finds that tbe reconversion of that part of the real estate laid out into lots took place in June, 1905, and of that part devised to tbe widow for life in December, 1907; and in these findings tbe court concurs. Tbe auditor in support of bis views cites Yerkes v. Yerlces, <a href="/pa/200/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="200 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="924326" data-case-paths="/pa/200/0419-01">200 Pa. 419</a>, and Painter v.

Tbe executor could not, by anything be might do or say, work a reconversion. Neither could tbe legatees by their several and independent acts or declarations effect this result. 4. (Tbe declarations or acts which would work a reconversion must be joined in by all tbe parties in interest, and they must be unequivocal acts or declarations clearly manifesting an intention of all tbe legatees of tbe proceeds to take tbe land in lieu thereof. It is impossible to deduce such intention from tbe administration account of tbe personal estate filed by the executor, or from the amicable distribution of tbe balance thereby shown to be in bis bands, or from tbe receipt of tbe widow and legatees of their <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>respective distributive shares and the release and discharge of the executor in pursuance thereof with the same force and effect as if this balance had been distributed by the Orphans’ Court, or from all these acts and declarations combined.

Prom a careful reading of the testimony the first indication by either of the legatees of an intention to take the land in its unconverted condition was when George K. McClarren, October 18, 1904, executed and delivered to Alexander Hileman a power of attorney to make sales of these lots. The intention of George K. McClarren thus manifested was not acquiesced in by the other legatee, Warren T. McClarren, until June 20,1905, when he joined with Alexander Hileman, attorney in fact for George K. McClarren, in executing and delivering a deed for lot No. 13 in this plan of lots, and a few days later they jointly executed and delivered to C. C. Piscus a deed for lot No. 3, thereby clearly and unequivocally declaring their intention to take the land in lieu of its proceeds. Regarding that part of the real estate devised to the widow for life, the proceeds of which after her death were bequeathed to these two sons, they had no right to its possession and did not in any manner whatsoever during the lifetime of the widow express an intention to take it in its unconverted state. After her death December 12, 1907, they did, December 15, 1907, take possession of it by their agent, Alexander Hileman, rented the same, received the rent, paid the taxes, paid insurance on the buildings located thereon, <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>and in other ways manifested a clear and unequivocal intention to take the land in lieu of its proceeds. The auditor, constrained by the views of the court expressed in the opinion on the exceptions filed to his original report, has now found as a fact that the reconversion of that part of the real estate laid out in lots was effected June, 1905, and that the reconversion of that part of the real estate devised to the widow for life was effected in December, 1907; and this finding the court approves. There is absolutely no evidence upon which to base a finding of a reconversion of either of these pieces of real estate at a date earlier than stated in this finding.</p>

(After awarding so much of the fund as it required to pay the debt, interest and costs of the several judgments secured thereon, there remains a balance of $1,210, which the auditor has awarded pro rata to the judgments of Alex. Hileman and Mary Montgomery, et al. These judgments were not a lien on the real estate at the time of its sale or otherwise secured on the proceeds of sale.) They were entered before the legatees elected to take the land unconverted. Subsequently writs of scire facias were issued upon them, but judgments were not entered on these writs until after the land was sold. 6. (The auditor being of the opinion that the proceeds of sale by agreement of the parties was substituted for the real estate, finds that these judgments, although entered after the sale, became liens upon the proceeds. I am unable to agree with this conclusion of the auditor. The lien of a judgment attaches only to the land, and not to the proceeds of its sale: Hahn v. Smith, IP. &amp;W. 484; Homer’s Est., 7 Pa. D.

R. C. Lamberton and Margaret Lamberton, executors, for use of tbe Franklin Trust Company, obtained a judgment against George K. McClarren, distributee, after tbe sale of tbe real estate, and thereupon issued an attachment execution, which was served upon tbe custodian of tbe proceeds of tbe sale of said real estate. Tbe,trust company, by virtue of this execution process, claims this balance of $1,210, which tbe auditor awarded to tbe judgments of Alex. Hileman and Mary Montgomery, et al., and in tbe opinion of tbe court it is entitled to tbe same and its exceptions to tbe auditor’s supplemental report awarding this balance pro rata to tbe judgments of Alex. Hileman and Mary Montgomery, et al., are sustained. Tbe Franklin Trust Company has also excepted to tbe auditor’s charges for services in taking testimony and preparing bis supplemental report. No testimony has been offered to show and tbe court is not in any way advised bow much time was spent by tbe auditor in taking testimony and preparing bis report, and in absence of any information on tbe subject tbe court assumes that tbe auditor’s charges do not exceed tbe compensation allowed him by law, and therefore this exception is dismissed. “Tbe exceptions filed on behalf of Alex. Hileman and Mary Montgomery, et al., to tbe auditor’s failure to allow full payment of debt, interest and costs of their respective judgments against George K. McClarren, for tbe reasons stated in this opinion, are severally dismissed, and tbe balance of $1,210, divided pro rata between these judgments by tbe auditor is now awarded to tbe Franklin Trust Company.</p>

    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.7",265,[146,576,1153,538]]]'>In Severn’s Estate, <a href="/pa/211/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="211 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="940098" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0065-01">211 Pa. 65</a>, 68, it is said: “We, therefore, have in the will an authority given to the executrix to sell and a direction to divide the proceeds of the sale in equal shares among the three legatees. In order to carry out the provisions of the will and make that distribution of the proceeds of the property, a sale of the real estate becomes imperative and is an absolute necessity. This, as appears from the authorities cited above, meets the requirements of our cases and operates as an equitable conversion.”</p>

F. Mc-Clarren worked a conversion of all his real estate. It is manifest that it was the testator’s intention that his two sons should receive the proceeds of the sale of both pieces of real estate, and not the land itself. He devised the homestead to his wife for life, and then directs “that the same be sold by my administrator, at private or public sale, and that the proceeds arising therefrom be equally divided between my two sons share and share alike after her death.” Here are two of the essential requisites of an equitable conversion: a positive direction to sell, and an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will. As to the other part of his real estate, known as the “McClarren Plan of Lots,” the will provides as follows: “As to the residue of moneys from the sale of my real estate, other than that allotted to my wife’s occupation and use, I direct it to be divided in equal shares between my two sons, George K. and Warren T., or in case of their decease, then to their children.” This is a positive direction to divide the proceeds of and not the real estate itself between the two sons, and while there is no express direction to sell, there is an absolute necessity to sell to accomplish the <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>purpose of the testator; and that works a conversion: Fahnestock v. Fahnestock, <a href="/pa/152/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="152 Pa. 56" data-case-ids="838073" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0056-01">152 Pa. 56</a>. But there is another clause in the will which not only discloses an intention on the part of the testator that his real estate shall he sold for the purposes of distribution, but also empowers his personal representative to make the sale. It is subsequent to the provisions directing the proceeds of the land to be divided between his sons and is as follows : “I hereby empower my said administrator to sell and' convey by deed or deeds my real estate in accordance with the foregoing.” The power of sale contained in this provision applies to both pieces of real estate, and read in connection with the item of the will directing the division of the proceeds of the plan of lots operates as a conversion of that part of the testator’s land: Roland v. Miller, <a href="/pa/100/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="56" data-cite="100 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="498411" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0047-01">100 Pa. 47</a>.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[289,1226,1161,1028]]]'>The appellant concedes that if there was a conversion of the real estate under the terms of the will, and we so hold, there was a reconversion, but he and the appellee disagree as to the date of the reconversion. The appellant contends that it occurred on April 2, 1902, the date of the execution of the release and discharge of the executor, or when the legatees joined in the execution of certain deeds, and that as his judgment was entered on October 18, 1902, it was the first lien and should be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. The appellee claims and the court below found that reconversion took place as to the plan of lots in June, 1905, and as to the real estate held by the widow for life it took place after her death in December, 1907. It was accordingly held by the learned trial court that the appellant’s judgment having been entered prior to the reconversion it was not a lien on the real estate and was postponed to the lien of the judgments entered subsequent to the reconversion.</p>

The appellant misconceives the purpose as well as the effect of the release. The executor had filed his account of the administration of the personal estate showing a balance in his hands for distribution. The release waived the appointment of an auditor, agreed to distribution, acknowledged the receipt of the amount due from the personal estate, and released and discharged the executor, “with the same force and effect as if the said balance had been distributed by the Orphans’ Court of Armstrong County.” The purpose of the release, as is apparent, was simply to save the time and expense of a distribution of the personalty by the Orphans’ Court. It did not relate to or affect the real estate, nor did it release the executor from his duty to sell the real estate or show an intention on the part of the legatees to accept the land in place of the proceeds of a sale.</p>
    <p id="b267-5" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[126,1285,1152,535]]]'>The execution of the deeds to Lockhart, Duff and McElfresh by the legatees was not an act of reconversion. They were sales by the decedent and the deeds were executed by the executor to carry out thp testator’s contracts. The widow and legatees joined in executing the deeds, as found by the auditor and the court, to save the trouble and expense of a proceeding in court for specific performance. The lots having been sold by the testator, his legatees through the executor, were entitled to the purchase money and not to the real estate.</p>
    <p id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.5",267,[125,1833,1152,587]],["BL_268.1",268,[315,349,1153,142]]]'>The learned court below properly found that the first indication by the legatees to take the plan of lots as land was the execution and delivery of a deed to a purchaser of one of the lots in June, 1905. A few days later they executed and delivered a deed for another lot. These were acts on the part of the legatees clearly disclosing an intention to reconvert and fixing the date of reconversion. As to the part of the real estate devised to the wife for life, there was nothing to indicate an intention to reconvert until after her death when the legatees took possession and dealt with it as real estate. The action <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>of the court helow on this branch of the case is sustained by the recent decision in Brandon v.
