In an action of assumpsit brought by the City of Pittsburgh against a collector of delinquent taxes to recover moneys alleged to have been illegally retained by the defendant, it appeared that the defendant had been appointed collector on April 5, 1909, and that after his appointment he had collected and accounted for the delinquent taxes and water rents upon the basis of compensation to himself at a certain percentage of the penalties collected, doing this under the provisions of the ordinances of the city of March 6, 1906, and of October 14, 1909. The accounts of the collector were duly audited and approved at stated times by the controller of the city. The contention of the city in the suit was that the defendant was entitled to an annual salary of $5,000 in accordance with the Act of March 7, 1901, P. L. 20, and that, therefore, he was indebted to the city in a certain sum representing the excess of percentage of penalties retained by him over said salary. <em>Held, </em>that the suit was improperly brought as, if the city had any right of action against the collector, it was bound to proceed in the manner prescribed by the Act of March 7, 1901, P.

Consequently all of these “laws and ordinances,” except as to the manner of electing the officer, were expressly preserved in force. This of course included the provisions for the compensation of the collector, which theretofore had been lawfully made by the councils of that city. The validity of the ordinance of March 30, 1896, aforesaid, was not and could not be questioned. The legislature, having thus expressly retained in full force this ordinance, we are unable to understand how the defendant is in any way affected by the schedule of the Act of March 7, 1901. That schedule provided for the appointment by the governor of city recorders and for the appointment by the latter of heads of departments — all to hold office until the first Monday of April, 1903. It then proceeded, “The city recorder and the heads of departments to be appointed under this schedule shall receive out of the city treasury annual salaries as follows: the <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>city recorder, ten thousand dollars; the heads of the departments, five thousand dollars.” Thus, even if the compensation of the collector of delinquent taxes ever came under the schedule at all, the provision could not extend beyond the first Monday of April, 1903, by reason of the language of the schedule itself. It is no answer to say that other heads of departments continued to receive the salaries prescribed in the schedule, after the interregnum for which it made provision had ceased. The collector of delinquent taxes stood upon a different footing. His compensation had been already fixed by legislation and by ordinances thereunder, which were expressly retained in force by the very same statute to which the schedule was attached. But the defendant did not receive any compensation in accordance with the ordinance of March 30, 1896. All he received was in accordance with the ordinance of March 6, 1906, passed pursuant to the Act of 1901, and in accordance with the ordinance of October 14, 1909, passed in pursuance of the Act of May 8, 1909. The question then is: Was the enactment of these ordinances a valid exercise of the power conferred by the said statutes? The plaintiff contends that it was not, because the only power conferred upon councils was to fix the compensation in one of two ways, viz: either by a “stated salary” or by “fees”; and, as they did not fix it in either way, the ordinances are therefore void. Our question then requires us to ascertain the meaning of the provision, in the Acts of 1901 and 1909, that</p>

This system, well understood by the legislature, was ex<a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>pressly preserved in the Acts of 1901, and was undoubtedly continued in force until councils made further provision pursuant to the latter acts. The system had stimulated collections and the city had received all it was entitled to receive. The cost of maintaining the office was placed just where it ought to have been — upon those who neglected to pay promptly their share of the public expense, and not upon the tax payers at large. Of course we are speaking merely of the principle of the system. With any features which might need correction, we have nothing to do. But, in view of the foregoing, is it reasonable to suppose that the legislature, possessed of the knowledge which it had, intended a complete departure by the mere use of the word “fees”? The plaintiff’s argument is that the use of the word “fees” by the legislature indicates an intention to exclude the fixing of a salary by percentage. If the intention of the Act of 1901 had been to strike down the system then prevailing, would that same system have been preserved for one hour in the very same statute? If such had been the purpose, it seems to us that it would have been plainly and unequivocally expressed in the statute itself rather than have been left to the discretion of councils, by them to be exercised when they chose. These considerations are very persuasive, though not conclusive, that the authors of the act did not intend to prohibit councils from fixing the collector’s compensation by the method of percentage, when the word “fees” was used. Let us then consider whether the fixing of compensation “by fees,” one of the methods prescribed in the statute, excludes the fixing of it by a percentage upon the amounts collected.</p>

      <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>Thus we learn that, in legislative usage and in judicial interpretation, the word “fee” is used synonymously with the word “percentage” or “commission.” This is in accordance with the popular understanding of the terms. An attorney’s fee is the usual mode of stating the compensation of an attorney, and it may be a percentage of the sum collected. A contingent fee is always based upon the recovery and is always ascertained by a percentage thereof, or by a fractional part thereof, which is the same thing. So that, while the word fee may and often does mean a specific sum given for a certain service, yet it may include a sum to be ascertained by the method of percentage. This being true, it would be a narrow construction to hold that the legislature, in empowering the city councils to fix the compensation of the collector of delinquent taxes by fees, meant thereby to require an ordinance giving him a specific sum of money for each item of service. Besides, this would be impracticable and would necessarily work great hardship. It could not help but bear with undue severity upon the small delinquents, who are the great majority, and be entirely too lenient with the large ones. On the other hand, a percentage upon the amount owing more nearly approaches fairness to delinquent than any other method.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b605-3" data-blocks='[["BL_605.4",605,[118,1718,1151,591]]]'>In view of the foregoing, we are of opinion that the provision in the Act of June 20, 1901, and in the Act of May 8,1909, empowered the councils of the City of Pittsburgh to fix the compensation of the collector of delinquent taxes by a percentage of the penalty imposed upon delinquents. It follows that the ordinances of March 6, 1906, and of October 14, 1909, were valid. It is no answer to say that councils could avoid all question by fixing a stated salary. The statute has authorized compensation in two ways, not in but one, and the method to be adopted is solely for the wisdom of councils.</p>

We are obliged to hold otherwise. That was a case stated, in which the court was of course confined to the agreement upon facts therein contained. We have carefully studied that case, and, as we gather from the report, the recorder appointed Jenkins collector of delinquent taxes; he therefore was entitled to the salary provided in the schedule of the Act of 1901; subsequently, the councils passed an ordinance giving him a percentage on the amounts collected. But councils were only empowered to reduce to a certain figure the salary of such appointive officer provided in the schedule. They were not empowered to deal with the compensation of such officer in any other way. It was held that the ordinance was invalid. If we are correct in our interpretation of that case, the decision of the point in controversy can have no effect whatever upon the questions here presented.</p>
