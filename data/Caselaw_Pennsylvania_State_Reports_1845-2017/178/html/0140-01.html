S. stated that lie would soon be called upon to pay over moneys which he held as a guardian, and at his request M. agreed that the judgment note should be drawn for$3,000, and that S. could draw upon him when the money was wanted.

There was no evidence that the note had been given for $3,000 with any fraudulent intent. In 1895, the amount actually due, including interest, was about $2,400.

That is the first question that you are to determine. And the second question is, if the said judgment is a valid judgment, how much is now due thereon? That is the other question. If the judgment was given for the purpose of delaying, hindering and defrauding Daniel Smith’s creditors, then it would not be a valid judgment at <em>all; </em>and if you should determine that, then the second question disappears.

That is not strictly correct. If a judgment is taken by one person against another, when the person who gives the judgment is involved, is in debt, and especially if he is insolvent, then standing alone it would raise a presumption of fraud. If there was nothing else in it except the single fact that a person had taken a judgment against another for money that he did not owe, or for any considerable amount more than he did owe him, and the person who gave the judgment was at the time indebted to other persons and was insolvent, then if those other persons Avould come and show that fact and nothing more would be shoAvn, the jury would be justified in saying that it was a fraud against the other creditors. But it is not a fraud in law nor is it a fraud in fact for a person to take a judgment for more than is due under certain circumstances. A person may take a judgment from a debtor for more than is due for the purpose of securing future advances, for the purpose, in other words, of doing precisely what Mr. McAlister testifies this judgment was taken for in this instance. A person may honestly do that. And in the case where,' as I. have said, a judgment is taken for more than is due, and Avhere it is not taken for future advances, <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>and where there are other creditors, and the person is insolvent, while the presumption would be that it was a fraud with nothing further in the case, yet even in that case the reason why it was taken may be explained; and if the jury should find from all the evidence in the case that it was taken for an honest and legal purpose, then it would not be a fraud; and the question that you have to determine here is, on all the facts of this case, as you find them to be, whether or not this judgment was taken for an honest or a dishonest puipose. It is a question to be determined upon the evidence. You are not to infer that there was dishonesty from the mere fact of the judgment having been taken, when connected with the testimony that has been given in this case. [You are not to infer that there was fraud because the-plaintiff has called the defendant and called his son-in-law or his brother-in-law, whoever it was. The rule in this case, as in all other cases, is that the plaintiff must make out his case by the preponderance of evidence, and, as in all other, cases, he must get his evidence where best he can, and unless you- have some reason to discredit the testimony of the witnesses, you can’t discredit them simply from the fact that the plaintiff called the defendant or the defendant’s witnesses. You have a right, and it is your duty, to consider who they are, and the relations they stand in to the case, and all that. You are to determine then as to their credibility, and as to what the facts really are. But the plaintiff is to make out his case, and in a question of this kind it is to be made out as in other cases.] [1]</p>

[Now there is one thing that appears in this case that no use was ever made of this judgment to benefit either Smith or Mc-Alister so far as I have been able to see. That is a matter for you, however, to consider and determine, and in a case- of this kind, as it has been argued to you, you are to determine .from the facts and the circumstances and the proper inferences that you can draw as to what it was taken for. There is no one here t,o swear positively that.it was taken for a dishonest purpose; McAlister swears that it was taken for an honest purpose, that is his testimony; there is no one that swears that it was taken, for a dishonest purpose, but you have a right to look at all the circumstances in order to determine what the purpose was; and one of those circumstances I may simply suggest is — and that might throw a good deal of light on it — what it was used for after it was taken, and so far as I recall there is no testimony that McAlister at any time tried to use it for any dishonest purpose, that he made any claim upon it for any more than is actually due. I do not know that there is any evidence that Smith ever tried to use it for- a dishonest purpose. It does not seem to have been actively used at all. It was put upon the record and kept there. If McAlister had gone on and issued an execution and sold Smith’s property and collected the money,, that would have tended very strongly to show that it was taken for a dishonest purpose, because it would have been used for a dishonest purpose if he had claimed $3,000 on it. If he had-gone before this auditor and claimed $3,000 there, that would have been dishonest, and that would have gone very, far toward <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>showing that he took it for a dishonest purpose. You have a right to use whatever was done so far as it bears upon the question of what was intended. Mr. Miller testifies that when he was considering the question of whether he could collect his claim or not, he. did not ask McAlister how much was due upon that judgment. He says he did not expect a true answer, and therefore he did not ask; that is what Mr. Miller says. If he had asked Mr. McAlister, one thing or other would have appeared. If he had asked McAlister and he had claimed ■ $3,000, that would go very far towards satisfying a jury that he took that judgment for a dishonest purpose, because he was trying to use it for a dishonest purpose; on the other hand, if lie had asked him and he had told him there was only so much due, then Mr. Miller would have known what to do. He did not choose to ask him either the one thing or the other.] [1]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b165-5" data-blocks='[["BL_165.4",165,[152,1124,1173,1220]]]'>From all the evidence then, gentlemen, in the case on the one side and on the. other, and the evidence is within a comparatively narrow compass, you have to determine whether this judgment was taken for an honest or dishonest purpose, the law being that the plaintiff had a right to take it if he intended to hold it simply for the purpose of securing money that he subsequently intended and had arranged to advance to Smith. He ought not to have taken it for $3,000 if all he intended to advance was $1,000 or $2,000. I do not know how correct this calculation is on the part of the plaintiff. . According to this calculation it seems that they claim now $2,400 and some odd dollars ; it will be for the jury to determine how that is. Bu,t it would not do for you to say that the man was acting dislionestly even if he acted simply carelessly, and if he did not act with quite as much business tact and care as a person might act and as he ought to have acted even. Your question is, whether he was acting dishonestly, whether McAlister by taking this judgment was intending to hinder other creditors of Smith, persons who at that time were Smith’s creditors, whether lie was intending to hinder or delay them in collecting their debts from Smith, and if you find that he was, then you will find a verdict in this case in favor of the plaintiff, because if he was trying to commit a fraud that renders the whole thing invalid, and then he could not collect even what was honestly due.</p>

The $700 seems to have gone into a revival at one time, and I don’t know that there has been any testimony that that revival wasn’t correct, and if that be correct you can start from that, $1,025, from the time it was revived, and then the $800 from the time it was given.</p>
