The words used are strictly and technically words of - limitation. But these words follow, “ but if she die and leave no child or children then in such a case the said property shall be sold to the best advantage and equally divided among my other legatees and their heirs,” — and they must be taken with what precedes. It is argued by the counsel for the defendants that as the words' “ cMld or cMldren ” are words of purchase therefore the words “ heirs of her body ” were used by <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>the testator in the same sense, — that he purposely used the words “ child or children ” in the second clause of this paragraph to explain in what sense he used the words “ heirs of her body” in the first clause of the paragraph. And that the whole paragraph correctly construed should read, “ I leave and bequeath the said property to Nancy Ramsey and to the heirs of her body, but if she should die and leave no heirs of her body, by that I mean no child or children, then in such case, that is, at her death, the said property shall be sold,” etc. This construction would give to Nancy Ramsey a life estate which would terminate at her death, she having died “ unmarried and without child or children or other lineal descendant” as shown by the admissions of record.</p>

The presumption is that the testator intended that all the words he used should be given their legal signification.

His purpose was to give, in the first instance, an estate tail, to be reduced to a life estate on the happening of a certain contingency, to wit: the death of the first taker before she married and had a “child or children.” The happening of the contingency, — the death of the first taker <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>leaving “no child or children” was to abridge the estate tail or reduce it to a life estate and make effectual the devise over to “the other legatees and their heirs.” Nancy Ramsey had an estate tail, and “ the other legatees and their heirs ” took an executory estate in fee. The executory estate was limited, and was to take effect, after a definite failure of issue of the first taker. If there was no such failure, then the estate tail was to remain as though there had been no limitation over, but if there was such a failure then the estate tail was to be reduced to a life estate and the fee was to vest in the executory devisees. Nancy Ramsey dying leaving no child or children the estate tail, by the happening of that contingency, was to be abridged, and the estate in fee vested in the “ other legatees and their heirs:” Ingersoll’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=86%20Pa.%20245" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="86 Pa. 245">86 Pa. 245</a>; Taylor v.

We think, however, that that case can be distinguished from the one in hand. As was said in Jessup v. Smuck, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20339" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="16 Pa. 339">16 Pa. 339</a>, “the testator was providing for the disposition of his estate after Ms decease, and must be supposed to refer to events and their occurrence in time subsequent to his death.” In the disposition made he provided that Nancy Ramsey should not come into the enjoyment of her estate until after the death of his widow, and he expected his widow to live longer than he did, for he gave her a life estate in the very land devised to Nancy Ramsey. The rule invoked by the counsel for the plaintiff is stated by Powell in these words : “ But in cases of <em>immediate </em>gifts, it is generally true that • a bequest over, in the event of. the death of the preceding legatee, refers to that event occur<a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>ring in the lifetime of the testator; yet this construction is only made <em>ex necessitate rei </em>from the absence of any other period to which the words may be referred, as a testator is not supposed to contemplate the event of himself surviving the object of his bounty: ” 2 Powell on Devises, 768-765. In Jessup v. Smuck, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pa.%20339" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="16 Pa. 339">supra,</a> Mr. Justice Chambers says: “ In the cases which limit the death to the testator’s lifetime, it is admitted that it is adopted from necessity, in aid of what was considered the general intent of the testator, and was not applied where the first taker is referred to or treated as living at a period subsequent to the death of the testator.”</p>

She must wait, not only until after the death of the testator, but until after the death of his widow, the life tenant, before she receives anything. The testator in making the devise to Nancy Ramsey “ referred to an event that would take place subsequent to his death,” to wit: the death of his wife, who was made a life tenant of the very property devised. Again, he provided for a sale of the property and a distribution among persons then in being, — “his other legatees,” — and this provision for a sale, which, of course, would be after his death, is connected as to time with the death of Nancy Ramsey; “ if she die leaving no child or children <em>then </em>in such a case (on the happening of such event) the said property shall be sold and divided equally among my other legatees.”</p>

But Nancy Ramsey, on the 20th day of June, 1881, executed the deed to Jas. I. Brownson, Jr., Esq., which was offered in evidence, and Jas. I. Brownson, Jr., Esq., reconveyed the property conveyed to him back to her and her heirs and assigns. She died seized of the property now in dispute, claiming to hold a fee-simple title thereto under the deed received from Mr. Brownson. These deeds were executed in accordance with the provisions of the act of assembly entitled “ An act to facilitate the barring of entail,” and the question now is, was <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>the executory estate as well as the estate tail barred by this deed executed under the act of 1799.

Taylor, <a href="/citations/?q=68%20Pa.%20485" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="68 Pa. 485">68 Pa. 485</a>, Mr. Justice Shahs wood says, “An estate tail may no doubt be subject to an executory devise over on some condition or event to take effect in abridgment or derogation of it; but such an executory devise can be destroyed by a common recovery suffered by the tenant in tail which enlarges his estate into a fee and excludes all subsequent limitations, whether in remainder or by the way of springing use or executory devise. .... A devise over after an estate tail on a definite failure of issue is not an executory devise but a remainder, for it takes effect, not in derogation or abridgment of the preceding estate, but on its regular determination, though only in the event of the termination of the estate upon the death of the tenant. . . . There is however not much importance in the distinction as to the limitation over after a definite failure of the issue of tenant in tail, since, call it what you will, executory devise, or vested or contingent remainder, it can be barred by a common recovery or by deed duly executed to dock the entail under the act of assembly of January 16,1799 : ” 3 Smith, 388.</p>
