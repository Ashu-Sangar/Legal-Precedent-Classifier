Stevens &amp; Owens erected on the lot in question has a frontage of thirty feet on Pennsylvania avenue, the Juniata river flowing very close (from the map we would approximate the distance as two or three feet) to the southeast comer of said building. The building is a two story frame, the first story at least being used for business purposes. Pennsylvania avenue is the principal business street of Tyrone. It starts at the Ward House and P. R. R. station; thence it runs north a distance of about three hundred (300) feet to the Juniata river which is crossed by the iron county bridge. Pennsylvania avenue from the Ward House to said bridge has been filled up and the floor of the bridge is but a continuation of the grade of the avenue. Passing off the bridge going north you immediately come to the lot of Stevens &amp; Owens; in fact the northern abutment of the bridge extends into Pennsylvania avenue in front of the Stevens &amp; Owens building a distance of about one half the frontage of said building. As has been stated the Juniata river runs along the south border of the Stevens &amp; Owens lot. West of the county bridge there is a gradual bend in the river which, as you stand on the bridge and look west in the general direction of Altoona, curves to the southwest, until at a distance of four hundred feet the railroad bridge of the Tyrone Division P. R. R. is reached. Looking east from the county bridge the river is seen to flow almost due east between the lot of W. F. <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>Conrad on the north and the Ray tannery property on the south, a distance of some two hundred feet until the junction of said river with the Bald Eagle creek is reached, said creek entering the river from the north- almost at right angles. On the north side of the river east of the bridge a wall, intended to serve as a breakwater, has been constructed along the Conrad lot, and the building on the Conrad lot almost overtops this wall.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b566-5" data-blocks='[["BL_566.4",566,[251,725,1173,914]]]'>In 1867 D. T. Caldwell, the then owner of the Stevens &amp; Owens lot, erected a stone wall along the bank of the river to protect said lot. I find as a fact that since that time said lot has lost no frontage on Pennsylvania avenue by the encroachment of the river. The fact that in the deed from W. M. Lyon &amp; Co. to D. T. Caldwell such frontage is stated to be only fourteen feet while the present building of Stevens &amp; Owens, thirty feet in front, is strongly persuasive that no frontage has been lost, and the weight of the testimony convinces me that there has been no decrease of frontage. I also find as a fact that Mr. Caldwell erected his wall on the then bank of the river. He was called as a witness by defendants and he testified that “ he built to the bank of the river.” I also find as a fact that the bank of the river as defined by said wall has not changed since the erection of the wall. West of the termination of the wall it has changed somewhat, being encroached upon by the flow of the stream, such flow by reason of the curve in the river being directed to the north side of the river.</p>

Said proposed wall starts at a point on the southern face of the northern abutment of the county bridge; gradually diverging by a gentle curve from the said abutment it runs up the bed of the river, and when it arrives at a point opposite the old wall it continues to diverge from the old wall; at a point opposite or nearly opposite the southeast corner of the Stevens &amp; Owens building a divergence of nine feet (9.2) has been attained, and as this point is also opposite the northwest comer or angle of the southern abutment of the bridge, the inevitable result is a narrowing of the vent space of the stream by such distance of nine feet. Passing up the stream the proposed wall for a considerable distance continues to diverge from the old wall, such divergence at its widest point being twenty-<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>three feet, and then again the old wall is gradually approached by the new wall until the two unite, or the new unites with a continuation of the old. To compensate for the loss of said nine feet in width of vent space the defendants propose to clean out certain sand bars in the stream opposite the new wall and also erect the new wall three feet higher than the old wall. By a calculation of J. Luden Henry, civil engineer, the vent space for water — at said narrowest point — before it will now overflow the old wall, is only 739/^ square feet; raising the said wall three feet, although the space is narrowed nine feet, will increase the vent space to 886feet. If the new wall is erected as proposed the said narrowest point will be seventy-five and eight tenths feet wide. About 150 feet below the bridge there is a narrow neck between the Ray tannery property and the Conrad lot with vent space of only seventy-six feet wide. On the principle that you can force into the top of a three inch pipe no more water than is passing out at the bottom, if the same narrow neck below the bridge is to be allowed to remain, the narrowing •of the stream by defendants above the bridge would have very little injurious effect in causing the water to overflow; the only ■additional injury would be by the additional friction referred to by Mr. Gfuyer and Mr. Beyer in their testimony.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[162,1512,1179,610]]]'>[I find as a fact that if said narrow neck between the Ray tannery and the Conrad lot is not to be widened the erection of the proposed wall by defendants would not probably cause such ■a perceptible increase in the overflow of Tyrone in times of floods as would justify a chancellor in restraining the erection •of such wall by an injunction. But I also find as a fact that the vent space for water in the vicinty of this Pennsylvania ■avenue county bridge is already too narrow, especially in view -of the well known fact that as the timber in the mountain is cut ■off the volume of water in times of floods is increased.] [1] The vent space of the Juniata river at this point should be widened, wherever widening is practicable, instead of narrowing.</p>

It is true that a sand bar which now protects to a certain degree the south abutment may be washed out and driven away, but said sand bar and also the series or continuation of sand bars which have collected along the south bank or side of she stream approach very nearly in character to nuisances, and should be abated.</p>

If defendants are compelled to withdraw to the front line (extended) of their own lot then, to obtain the additional frontage to their lot on said front line which would enure to them by the erection of the new wall, they would be obliged to construct a wall out into the stream joining their present wall at almost right angles.

    <p id="b581-3" data-blocks='[["BL_581.6",581,[126,421,1173,1070]]]'>Tins is an appeal from the decree of the court of common pleas of Blair county enjoining the defendants until further order from erecting a wall in a stream which passes through the borough of Tyrone in said county, and is known as the Little Juniata. Two of the defendants are the owners of a lot, in said borough, which extends to the bank of said stream, and along it for a distance of one hundred and thirty feet. In the summer of 1894 they employed the other defendant to erect a wall in the stream opposite their lot, and he was engaged in the performance of the work when the proceedings to prevent the con summation of it were instituted. The material complaint in the bill for an injunction was that the erection of the proposed wall would narrow the channel of the stream, and in times of freshets and floods cause the water to overflow a considerable portion of the borough to the injury of the property and health of its inhabitants. This complaint was met with a denial by the defendants that the risk of injury from floods and freshets would be increased by the wall, and with an averment that such risk would be reduced by it. The court, however, was convinced by the evidence in the case that the complaint was well founded, and that the wall would constitute a public nuisance.</p>
    <p id="b581-4" data-blocks='[["BL_581.7",581,[126,1501,1172,859]]]'>The findings of the court under the new equity rules are like the findings of a master under the old practice. They will not be set aside on appeal if they appear to have been authorized by the evidence. An apparent preponderance of testimony in support of the appellants’ contention is not sufficient to condemn them, because in the finding of facts from evidence the credibility of the witnesses is an important factor, and of this the court below had better opportunity to judge than is given to us on appeal. In considering a specification of error which calls in question a finding of fact by the court we must not lose sight of the familiar principle or rule applicable to the report of a master or to the verdict of a jury. With this rule in view we have carefully examined and considered the testimony applicable to the issues of fact in the case before us. The findings based upon this testimony appear to be well sustained by it. It authorized and it fairly supports the answers to the defendants’ requests for findings of fact.</p>

The reason given for the claim is that the evidence in regard to their right and the effect of the wall upon the overflow in times of freshets' and floods is conflicting. They cite as justifying their claim: Newcastle v. Raney, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20Pa.%20562" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="130 Pa. 562">130 Pa. </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=130%20Pa.%20562" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="130 Pa. 562">562</a>; </em>Mowday v. Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=133%20Pa.%20612" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="133 Pa. 612">133 Pa. 612</a>, and Wood v. McGrath, <a href="/citations/?q=150%20Pa.%20458" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="150 Pa. 458">150 Pa. 458</a>. These cases were brought to the attention of the learned judge of the court below, and were plainly and satisfactorily distinguished by him from the case at bar. All that we need add to his opinion on this point is that the borough of Tyrone has a clear right under the act of June 8, 1891, P. L. 210 to widen and deepen, within its limits, the channel of the Little Juniata, and to prevent the erection of any wall or other obstruction therein which will increase the danger from floods and freshets to the property and lives of its inhabitants. The right to widen and deepen the channel of the stream necessarily includes the right to appropriate legal process to prevent interference with the exercise of it. The widening of the channel in accordance with the provisions of the ordinance of September 3,1894, will require the removal of the wall the defendants propose to erect. The erection of the wall would therefore subject the defendants or the borough to an expense that may well be avoided. We must presume in the absence of evidence to the contrary that the ordinance was passed in good faith, and that the borough authorities intended to commence and complete the projected improvement as soon as practicable. That the learned judge of the court below so interpreted this action is manifest from what he said in his supplemental report. There is no visible warrant in this record for a different view of their purpose in passing the ordinance. We have concluded therefore upon a careful con'sideration of the case to affirm the decree continuing the injunction, subject however to such modification of it by the court below as is indicated in said report as proper, if the borough refuses or neglects to prosecute with due diligence the work of widening the channel of the stream, in substantial conformity with its ordinance of September 3, 1894.</p>
