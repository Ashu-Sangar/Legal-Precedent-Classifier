The suit is upon a bond which was given by Mr. Strickler, the defendant, when he was appointed teller of this bank, intended to secure the faithful performance of his duties in that office. Now the allegation upon the part of the' bank is, that he did not discharge his duties faithfully, and the testimony you have heard on the part of the plaintiff is intended to establish that proposition. Of course it is possible to put the proposition in different forms of speech, but after all it comes down to this: did the defendant Strickler embezzle this thousand dollars ? [The mere fact that entries were made in books that were not correct would be a matter of small cohééquence indeed if the facts behind those entries were not such as to cause the bank to suffer loss. Suppose, for example, that entry which is confessedly an incorrect entry had not been accompanied by the removal of $1,000 from the drawer of the bank, certainly the bank would have the thousand dollars there, and the thousand dollars would have given it everything it needed to discharge its entire obligation; so that I say the question after all is whether in point of fact all this money that was put into the bank on that day by the depositors, and thereby made an obligation of the bank, which it was obliged to discharge, whether that money staid there in the bank’s care and custody, or whether a thousand dollars of it was abstracted by the defendant. It is essential to justice to both parties to get at the real point of the ease ;■ it is essential to know what is back of the entries in the books. A mere incorrect entry would <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>not of itself impose an obligation on the defendant. It would be necessary to show that a money loss accrued to the bank.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[167,462,1169,659]]]'>Now that is a question of fact for your disposition, and you have heard it argued carefully and fully upon both sides, and the question is submitted to you.' You have heard the testimony of the witnesses and you have the books before you. You have heard testimony in regard to the character of Mr. Strickler for honesty and integrity, and taking the whole of the testimony together, you must decide whether he has converted to his own use a thousand dollars of the money of the bank. If he did not, the bank, by the very supposition had the money in its drawer to meet its obligations, and as it had the money, the mere incorrect entry in the books did it no harm whatever. It comes, whatever way you look at it, to this point; has the bank suffered a money loss by the conduct of the defendant ?</p>

On that question the bank has the burden of proof. It is its business to satisfy you by the fair weight and preponderance of the evidence that such is the case. If you are not satisfied, then the bank has failed, and your verdict should be for defendant.] [If you are satisfied that he did do so, then he thereby unquestionably failed to discharge his duties as teller with fidelity, and there might be a recovery upon this bond for this amount, with interest from the time it was converted to his own use. That is, as I understand it, the whole case, and to that point the testimony inevitably leads.</p>

    <p id="b172-8" data-blocks='[["BL_172.13",172,[258,1589,1168,796]]]'>■ It is not denied that this case was tried in the court below on the theory that the defendant on the 1st of April, 1887, converted to his own use $1,000 of the bank’s money. The statement of claim was prepared in accordance with this theory, and the declaration of the plaintiff’s counsel when interrogated by the court in regard to the nature of their client’s contention harmonized with it. A claim of this nature, although made in á civil suit, necessarily involved a reflection upon the defendant’s character. It was tantamount to, if not in plain terms, a charge of embezzlement. That both parties to the suit so regarded it is further shown by the fact that the defendant was allowed without objection to introduce evidence of Ms character for honesty. If the issue had related to an alleged loss caused by an error of the defendant in adding the items in the depositors’ columns there would have been no occasion or room for evidence of this nature.</p>
    <p id="b173-4" data-blocks='[["BL_173.3",173,[180,368,1171,1426]]]'>
      <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>We have specifically ref erred to the matters above mentioned because they are proper for consideration in determining whether there is substantial cause for the complaint made by the plaintiff in respect to the charge. In view of the issue presented by them we cannot regard the instruction concerning the burden of proof as prejudicial to the interests of the bank, or in any sense misleading. There was no warrant in the evidence for a conclusion that the bank sustained a loss by reason of an error in adding the items in the depositors’ column. It was not claimed that there was any error in any item of the column, or that the bank in consequence of the error in adding the items paid to any depositor more than he was entitled to receive. It required something more than the error complained of to sustain the claim that the defendant had appropriated the bank’s money. The learned judge therefore made no mistake in sayring “ a mere incorrect entry would not of itself impose an obligation on the defendant; it would be necessary to show that a money loss accrued to the bank.” If the bank received and had the benefit of all the deposits made on the 1st of April, 1887, it was not injured by the error in footing them. The only ground on which a recovery was possible with due regard to the claim of the plaintiff and the evidence in the case, was that the defendant withheld or abstracted from the bank for his own purposes $1,000 belonging to it. Whether he did so was a question for the jury upon all the evidence in the case. It was submitted to them in an adequate and impartial charge, and their decision of it was in accord with a fair preponderance of the testimony.</p>
