Who was that? A. Young Mr. Lett. Of course I in a hurry signed that paper, and I didn’t read it, and he didn’t read it over, and I just signed it in the confusion. Q. What had he with him ? He had a bottle of ink and pen. . . . Q. Describe the place. A. Well, it is aplace that is very dark; that is down between decks where they loaden horses, and I signed that paper the best I could; I took it to be a receipt. Q. From what he said what did you take it to be ? A. I took it to be a receipt for the delivery of the horses. Q. What did Lett say to you at that time about that paper? A. Well, he said he wanted something to show to his uncle. Q. Well, if anything else in addition to that I wish you to please state it? A. Well, I don’t mind of him saying anything. Q. What, if anything did he say about his wanting you to sign it so quickly, arid down there? A. Well, he said it was his train time and he hadn’t much time. Q. Now, when you signed it where did you lay it? A. Well, I don’t just exactly know; I think I just laid in on a feed trough. Q. Well, you had signed it before Mr. Wilson came up ? A. Just as he started away Mr. Wilson came up to me and asked me what I had signed; I told him I had signed a receipt that the horses were delivered. Q. What did he say? A. He said I ought to be careful what I signed. Q. Well, what became of Lett then ? A. Well, he left the boat at the time in a hurry; that’s the last I’ve saw him. Q. State whether or not there was any conversation there about a note, or payment of interest, or anything of that kind? A. No, sir; there wasn’t anything of the ldnd mentioned at any time. ”</p>
