At the point where the accident occurred there were two tracks seven feet apart, and the deceased was directed to work on track No. 1. The deceased was killed by a delayed express train on track No. 2. The uncontradicted evidence of the superintendent was that owing to the stormy character of the day extra men were employed to keep the tracks clear of the snow; that he had at least one hundred gangs scattered along the road, engaged in this work, and that it would . have been impracticable to give the engineer of the delayed express train information that would have been of any use as to the gang in which deceased was employed, because the train which it was sent to release might have moved one hundred feet or a mile in ten minutes. <em>Held, </em>(1) That there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the railroad company sufficient to submit to the jury; (2) that the deceased had taken the risk of his employment; (8) that if, owing to the weather, the danger was greater than usual the railroad company was entitled to rely on the presumption that the deceased would not unnecessarily incur the danger.</p>

An unusual snowstorm had occurred early that morning, in consequence of which the railroad tracks were so badly obstructed as to be almost impassable, and a number of gangs of workmen had been sent out to clean the tracks. Between Lucknow and Harrisburg there were two passenger tracks known as “ No. 1 ” and “ No. 2,” near together. No. 1 was used for running east, and No. 2 for trains running west. By 11 o’clock the snowstorm and. drifts had become so severe as to make it impossible to longer operate track No. 1. At the point where the accident occurred a gravel train had - been snow bound, and the gang of workmen in which the deceased was employed was engaged in shoveling it out. While they were at work Nye went upon the west bound track, and was struck and killed by the Pacific express which was about twelve hours late, owing to the snowstorm.</p>

As a matter of evidence the superintendent testified that owing to the stormy character of the day extra men were employed to keep the tracks clear of snow, that he had at least a hundred gangs scattered along the road, engaged in this work, and that it would have been impracticable to give the engineer of the west bound train any notice that would have been of any use, because as to this particular gang it was sent to move a train, and it might have moved a hundred feet or a mile in ten minutes.'

The uncontradicted testimony is that the next track No. 2, on which the accident occurred, was only kept open by constantly running a locomotive backwards and forwards on it at this point. The decedent’s work was not on this track, but on No. 1, and <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>there was a clear space of seven feet between them. The íepresentatives of the railroad company had no reason to,suppose that he would voluntarily put himself into unnecessary danger by getting on track No. 2 or so near it as to be struck by one of its trains. It is a fair presumption not only that men take the risks of their employment, but that they are competent to keep themselves out of manifest and unnecessary exposure to danger. It is argued that the storm made the situation one of unprecedented peril to Nye and his fellows, and the court therefore could not say as matter of law that the railroad owed no unusual duty for the protection of its employees. But the situation was no more unprecedented for one -than for the other, and the danger though greater in degree was no different in kind from that under ordinary circumstances, and the more manifest the danger the more the employer was entitled to rely on the presumption that the employee, would not unnecessarily incur it. It has not been shown that the defendant omitted any reasonable precaution which it could have taken against this unfortunate accident, and the jury should not have been allowed to find negligence without some evidence of a definite basis on which to rest it. .</p>
