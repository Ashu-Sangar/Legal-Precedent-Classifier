In 1886 G. deposited with the bank a large sum of money, and received a certificate of deposit therefor. He died intestate in 1887. In 1890 a partial payment was made upon the certificate and G.’s administrators accepted a new certificate for the balance. In 1893, after the death of D., another partial payment was made, and G.’s adminitrators accepted a new certificate for the balance. In an action by G.’s administrators against D.’s executors on the certificate, the evidence showed that D. was a prominent citizen of the city in which G.’s administrators lived, and was well known to them, and from 1887 until 1893, G.’s administrators had constant dealing with the partnership. Held, (1) that if G.’s administrators knew that D. was a member of the co-partnership, they were liable to G.’s estate for a loss occasioned by the substitution of the certificate of 1893 for that of 1890, and they were therefore interested in the result of the suit; (2) that from the nature of their transactions with the partnership and their position as trustees, it might reasonably be inferred that they were not without knowledge respecting the membership of it, and therefore incompetent to testify to their want of knowledge; (3) that it was proper to admit evidence of transfers of stock of the bank, of the introduction of new members and the part they took in the management of partnership affair's; (I) that the evidence was sufficient to submit to the jury to determine whether G.’s administrators knew that D. was a member of the firm.</p>

The defendants allege that these certificates were surrendered to the bank for cancelation; and it appears, I believe, by the face of the certificates that they were canceled or stamped paid. That by the surrender and cancelation on October 10, 1898, of the certificate dated December 11, 1890, and the part payment thereof and the issue by the bank, as it then existed, with a new or changed membership, of a new certificate for the balance, and the acceptance of such new certificate by the plaintiffs, ended the liability of the defendants on the old certificate of December 11, 1890; that thereby such old certificate was paid and that thereafter the plaintiffs held, and held only, those bound by the new certificate, that is the partnership as it existed at that time, October 10, 1893.

That is, that you have a right to infer such knowledge. There is no direct proof of the fact of such knowledge or want of such knowledge by any witness competent to testify to the fact. Gibson was long since dead, and his administrators, as we have ruled, are incompetent to testify to anything occurring or any fact existing prior to the death of Derickson, for the reason that Mr. Derickson’s lips being closed by death the law closes the lips of the plaintiffs, the other parties to this transaction as to anything which occurred or any fact which existed prior to the death of Mr. Derickson.] [19]</p>

If you find that they had such knowledge then we say to you as a conclusion of law that they were bound to take notice of Mr. Derickson’s death,] [18] and that by his death the partnership as it existed at the time of his death became dissolved, and that if the business was thereafter carried on they were bound to know that it was being conducted not by the old but by a new partnership operating under the old name, of which Mr. Derickson’s estate was not a member. So far as the death of Mr. Derick-son is concerned the law imputes to the plaintiffs knowledge of that fact without any proof.

You have also the testimony, as I remember, of the plaintiffs that between the time of the death of Mr. Derickson and the time when they surrendered the old certificate — that is between July 21, 1891, and October 10, 1893 — they did not learn that Mr. Derickson in his lifetime had been a shareholder in the bank.

    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.7",649,[165,781,1177,968]]]'>It is not necessary to determine now whether Cyrus Kitchen was a competent witness to matters occurring in the lifetime of D. Y. Derickson, deceased. The court below held that he was not. The plaintiffs were not injured by this ruling because the specific matters proposed to be shown by him were established by admittedly competent testimony and were not disputed. That the certificate of October 10,1893, represented the balance of a deposit made prior to the death of Derickson and while he was a member of the firm, was conceded. For a similar reason it is not necessary to consider the specifications which relate to the admission of evidence tending to show the plaintiffs had knowledge of Derickson’s death before their acceptance of the certificate of October 10, 1893 in lieu of the certificate of December 11, 1890. The plaintiffs admitted that they heard of his death at or about the time of its occurrence, but did not xecall having seen the announcement of it in the papers. We ■do not decide that the rulings referred to were erroneous, but that if they were they were not prejudicial to the plaintiffs’ case. We do not reverse a judgment for harmless error.</p>

This was the crucial point in the case. If, with knowledge of his membership they surrendered the certificate of the old firm and accepted the certificate of October 10,1893, in satisfaction of it, they would be, prima facie, liable to the estate they represented for a loss occasioned by the substitution of the latter for the former. They were parties to the suit having an interest, seemingly at least, adverse to the right of the estate represented by the defendants. The cases cited to sustain their claim of competency to testify as above stated are not applicable to their contention. The witnesses allowed to testify in these cases were not parties to the suit and had no apparent <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>interest in the result of it. For six years or more the certificates representing the Gibson deposit, or the balance of it, were in the names of the plaintiffs as administrators of the Gibson estate, and during that time there were important changes in the membership of the firm, affecting the liability of the retiring and incoming partners. The certificates so held by the plaintiffs represented deposits with the partnership issuing them, and the assets of the partnership and the personal liability of its members constituted the depositor’s security. Some of the certificates were payable on presentment duly indorsed, and others upon ten days’ notice. The last certificate held by the plaintiffs was issued on the 10th of October, 1893, the bank closed its doors on the 13th of January, 1894, and on the 20th of that month made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors. No explanation was made by the plaintiffs of their delay in collecting the deposit, or of the financial repute of the partnership during the year preceding the assignment. We think that under the circumstances shown there was no error in the rejection of the offer to prove by the plaintiffs that they did not know that Derickson was at any time a member of the firm known as the Mead-ville Savings Bank. We discover no error in the admission of evidence of transfers of stock, of the introduction of new members, and the part they took in the management of partnership affairs, and of the action of the partnership in reference to the transfers. These transactions were in accord with the articles of association, and had some relevancy to the question whether parties dealing with the partnership had notice of changes in the membership of it.</p>

Neither a recital nor a summary of the evidence bearing upon these questions is deemed necessary. There was no direct or positive testimony affecting the first question. But the circumstances disclosed by the testimony were sufficient to fairly authorize an inference that the plaintiffs knew Derickson was a member of the partnership. He was a prominent citizen of Meadville, and well known to them; he became a member of <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>the partnership in 1877, and continued to be a member of it until his death in July, 1891. From September, 1887, to October 10, 1893, the plaintiffs, as administrators of Gibson’s estate, had dealings with the partnership, and from the nature of their transactions with it and their position as trustees, it may reasonably be inferred that they were not without knowledge respecting the membership of it.</p>
