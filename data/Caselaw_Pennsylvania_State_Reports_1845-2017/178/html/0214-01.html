The controlling questions have been fully discussed and correctly decided by the learned trial judge. It would serve no useful purpose to add anything to what has been said by him in the opinion referred to in the record, Com. v. Morgan, supra, 198. The judgment is therefore affirmed on that opinion.</p>
