Been fortunate in getting gas? A. Some we got gas and some-Q. What experience have you had in marketing the gas? A. Never had any experience in marketing at all, we just drill the wells for other companies. Q. Do you know the pressure contained in those wells you drill? A. Some we do, and some I suppose we have forgotten. Q. Those wells you drilled, were they piped to market? A.

Q. What are these gauges ? A. They look like an ordinary steam gauge, only they will. gauge one thousand pounds, and some of them five hundred, and as low <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>as one hundred and sixty. Q. What is the lowest pressure that these gauges will take? A. Well, about five pounds, you have got to have five pounds to make it show at all. Q.

There is a small hole tapped in the side of the casing and a thread tapped in it, and then a short nipple in it and put the gauge in that. [1]</p>

Q. Was the gas of many of these wells taken to market ? A. Some were and some not. Q. What was the lowest pressure that you can recall now that was taken to market? A.

    <p class="summary" id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[196,778,1170,1415]]]'>Now, this action is brought by the plaintiffs to recover what they allege is due them by the agreement entered into between them and the defendants in reference to this leased property. The plaintiffs contend that they by the terms of this agreement are entitled to one dollar per acre for the leases that they transferred to these defendants by the assignment. They contend that the well drilled on the Colwell property by the defendants was such a well as was described in this assignment; that is, it was a well containing sufficient gas to pipe to market. R. S. Martin, one of the plaintiffs, testifies that after the well had been finished they had a meeting at Mr. Brown’s office, one of the defendants, where Mr. Brown, Mr. Smith, Mr. Reese and Mr. Dull of Harrisburg, were present. Mr. Aye, one of the plaintiffs, was also present. He says they had some conversation there in reference to the development of this territory; and it was proposed by Mr. Brown, one of the defendants, that they enter into a corporation, get a charter and develop this property; that plaintiffs would not accede to it, but offered to sell to them the remaining one eighth which they still held and reserved in the agreement entered into between them and the defendants. He also states that at that time there was nothing said by any of the defendants that the well thus driiled upon the property was not a good well; there was nothing said that it did not contain a sufficient amount of gas to pipe to market. I believe he also stated that there was something said by him or Mr. Aye in reference to the payment to them; they wanted the money which was due them under the agreement between them and the defendants.</p>

[Mr. Rodgers is called in behalf of the plaintiffs and testifies before you as to his experience in gas wells, and he testifies as to the pressure of a well that would warrant the piping to market, but also states the conditions under which it could be. piped, speaking about where the market was, and whether there was not a pipe fine in the vicinity, it would not be so far •to pipe, etc;] [6]</p>

Mr. Brown comes upon the witness stand and testifies that he was out there the Monday following, and there was a test made, that it was made with a steam gauge, and I believe was made before the tubing was put in; it was when it was in the casing yet; he states that it was not sufficient to warrant the piping to market; he states that when any person asked him in reference to it he supposed he would state to them it was a fair well, or a pretty fair well; he said he would not have any idea of depreciating his property. Mr. Reese and Mr. Brown are called and testify as to their experience in the gas business. Mr. Reese testifies that the well was not of sufficient capacity to pipe to market. Mr. Piper also testifies to that fact. And the evidence of Mr. Pitcairn is read in your-hearing, who is also a practical gas man; he gives in his evidence what he considers a well that would pay to pipe to market. And in considering this evidence on the part of the plaintiffs and on the part of the defendants, it will be for you to take into consideration, in arriving at a conclusion whether this well was. of sufficient capacity to pipe to market, the situation of the well and the distance from the market. It is understood that a contract of this kind is to have a construction such as would bring about that which is reasonable on the part of either of these parties. In the article-of agreement it states that they are to pay the sum of $1.00 per acre- for each acre contained in the said leases, provided said test well contains sufficient gas to pipe to market. If you find from the evidence <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>before you that this gas well contained sufficient gas, or gas in sufficient quantity, to pipe it to market, the defendants would have to pay to the plaintiffs $1.00 per acre for the number of acres contained in these leases, that is the number of acres which they got by the assignment. But if it did not contain gas in sufficient quantity to pipe to market, then these defendants are not liable. [That is about the whole thing in this case, and that you will ascertain from the evidence, whether or not it was situated as it was, the distance it was from the market, whether the well as drilled there put forth sufficient gas to warrant the piping of it to market by these defendants.] [7] Now you will recollect the testimony in this case as given by both the plaintiffs and the defendants, and it will be for you from that evidence to say whether or not there was sufficient gas in this well to warrant these defendants in piping it to market. That is about all the question you have to decide in this case.</p>
