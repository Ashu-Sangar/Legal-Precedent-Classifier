The contract contained the following clause: “ Provided, that if we are obliged to suspend manufacturing, or are in any way prevented from delivering any portion of said goods by reason of fire or accident in our factory, or any strike, we shall not be liable to you in damages for nondelivery of such portion of the goods ordered.” On May 1, a coal strike began throughout the whole coal region from which the defendant could procure coal, and continued until the last of June. During this period defendant was “ obliged to suspend manufacturing.” A correspondence arose between the parties, and on May 10 defendant wrote “We will fill all orders just as soon as we can get fuel to start up with which we hope wall be sometime next week.” On May 12, plaintiffs replied,“ Although your letter of the 10th. is not a direct reply to ours of the 9th, yet we are glad to see that it is your intention to fill all orders as soon as you can get fuel to start up with. We will be glad to have prompt advice of your ability to make shipment.” On July 2, defendant wrote plaintiffs that it thought it best to cancel plaintiffs’ order. Bold, (1) that the strike of the coal miners was such a strike as under the terms of the contract would excuse performance on the part of the defendant; (2) that the correspondence between the parties did not modify the agreement and extend the time of performance.</p>

It is contended by defendant that the occurrence of any strike in any place which prevented it from operating its works was sufficient to excuse performance under the contract.

Fire and accident, not at the factory, could not prevent the operation of it, whereas strikes might easily do so in various ways. The parties have used the most apt words they could find to express the agreement that fire or accident in the factory or a strike in or out of it, anywhere, if it prevented operations, should excuse performance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-4" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[268,883,1168,196]]]'>2. It is contended by the plaintiffs that the defendant’s letter of May 10 and the answer of May 12 modified the agreement and extended the time for fulfilment of the contract, and waived any right plaintiffs had to cancel the contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[264,1087,1169,913]]]'>This letter was written before the time for delivery had passed, and under the expectation that the cause of delay, the strike, would be over before that time had passed. The defendant would then at least be bound to make up the weekly shipments in arrears when the strike began and to continue for the time after the strike ended till June 1. “We will fill all orders just as soon as we can get fuel to start up,” might be so interpreted. It is more likely, however, that defendant thereby meant to say it would make the balance of the glucose ordered and not delivered at the price agreed on as fast as it could make it. It is contended by plaintiffs? counsel that the letter of May 12 amounted to an acceptance of an offer, and that these two letters constitute a new agreement as to time of delivery. It does not seem, however, that such was the intention of the parties, nor that plaintiffs would have considered themselves bound to take glucose after the time for delivery was passed unless they wished to. It is a mere expression of satisfaction that their customers as brokers are going to be supplied.</p>

The contract was for future delivery of glucose during April and May at a fixed price, and in equal weekly shipments. It does not appear necessary to determine whether under the contract a strike of two weeks, for example, would excuse the delivery of two eighths of the one thousand (1,000) barrels, if the strike ended before the period of delivery. A similar contract 'was construed in Rowland v. Lehigh Coal Co., <a href="/pa/28/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="28 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="981606" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0215-01">28 Pa. 215</a>. From the reasoning in that case it may be inferred that <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>they would be bound to make up during the time for delivery the amount not delivered, but in this case the strike lasted till after the time for delivery had fully passed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b495-3" data-blocks='[["BL_495.4",495,[146,516,1173,660]]]'>4. The referee’s conclusion therefore is that the defendant is bound to make good any damages sustained by plaintiffs by reason of nondelivery of the one hundred and fifty (150) barrels not delivered in April, and that the measure of damages under the circumstances is the difference in price at the end of May, and that it is not bound to answer in damages for the nondelivery of the remaining five hundred (500) barrels,' the delivery of which was prevented by the coal strike. The price of glucose having risen 27^ cents per hundred pounds, at the end of May the difference in price on one hundred and fifty barrels is $255.75. This bears interest from June, 1894. The referee therefore finds and awards against the defendant and in favor of the plaintiffs in the sum of $286.04, with costs of suit.</p>
