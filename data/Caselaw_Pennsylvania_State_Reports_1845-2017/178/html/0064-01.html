A construction of the privilege which makes it operate as an absolute gift to the wife of the residue of the estate would defeat the plain purpose of the testator and take from the children and grandson named in the will that which he intended they should have at her decease. There is no warrant in the language of the testator for such a construction. The Avords “ she to have full control of said money the same as I would have if I was living ” are properly applicable, and should be limited to that which the testator had already devoted to the maintenance of his Avife, and cannot be justly considered as enlarging the preceding gift. The mere fact that the securities which represent the balance of the estate were taken in her name has no particular significance. It was not within her power to defeat his intention respecting the remainder of the estate by any such act. It being conceded that the securities in question constitute such remainder, the right of the children and grandson to it is as clear as it would be if <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>the securities had been taken in the name of the life tenant as executrix.</p>
