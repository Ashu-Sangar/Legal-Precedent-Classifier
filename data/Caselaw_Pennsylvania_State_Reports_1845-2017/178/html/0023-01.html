    <p class="summary" id="b45-10" data-blocks='[["BL_45.9",45,[180,1419,1174,813]]]'>While there is some conflict between the bill and answer and in the testimony, it does not seriously affect the material questions upon which, as it seems to us, the case must be determined. In stock gambling transactions, like these, it is not strange the participants should differ as to the terms on which they dealt. From Campbell and Kirk down to the last customer they did not pretend to own a dollar’s worth of the commodities in which they assumed to be dealing. Nothing was actually bought or sold in Bedford or elsewhere, but it was a mere matter of wagers, of bookkeeping and the adjustment of .balances. The master finds in answer to the plaintiffs’ request, that Campbell “ acknowledges that he took the trades himself and did nothing towards investing the funds he received in the articles which were supposed to be bought and sold.” The business was, therefore, all confined to the little circle made up of Campbell, Kirk and their customers at Bedford.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b45-11" data-blocks='[["BL_45.10",45,[187,2240,1167,197]],["BL_46.1",46,[265,395,1166,654]]]'>The profit of one was the loss of another of their number. Each party negotiated with reference to keeping its grasp on the fund, against the inevitable day of reckoning, which was sure to come under such a state of business. Distrusting each <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>other, they each sought to so frame the papers and arrange for the security of the deposits as to guard against the other controlling them. It was a scramble for advantage, in which they could not be expected to agree as to the precise terms of contract. Upon one thing, however, all are agreed; namely, that so far as the fund now in dispute is concerned, it represents the pure, unmixed margins arising on their stock gambling transactions. This is asserted as to the nature of the business in the bill and answers; is sworn to by all the witnesses, contended for in the requests and points submitted to the master on both sides, found by him and again bitterly insisted upon on the final argument. It is denied by no one, and may be accepted as a settled fact.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b46-5" data-blocks='[["BL_46.4",46,[264,1059,1166,494]]]'>Another matter which is clear of controversy is the fact that the fund is not in the hands or control of either of the contending parties, but in the banking house of J. Gf. Hartley &amp; Co., a third party, which however has no interest in the results of the ventures or the fund itself. The plaintiffs placed it there in the form of stakes or margins, and now seek to recover it. Campbell concedes this, but resists a recovery on the ground that it belongs to him as the result of his winnings and because the greater portion of it was credited to his name on the books of the bank.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b46-6" data-blocks='[["BL_46.5",46,[260,1571,1167,705]]]'>The main contention of the counsel for defendants is that the claim of the plaintiffs rests on an illegal foundation, on transactions which are against the policy of the law, and that the presentation of their case involves a disclosure of this fact, and hence a court will not lend itself to aid them, but will leave them where it finds them. This would clearly be so if there had been a final execution of the wagers by payment to the winner. It is not necessary to refer to the multitude of authorities sustaining this well recognized doctrine. But we think it is as well settled that so long as the money remains in the possession of a third party, who confessedly has no right to retain it, the party placing it there may recover it. This is especially true when notice of the desire to do so is given before the event occurs upon which it is staked.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b46-7" data-blocks='[["BL_46.6",46,[260,2285,1164,146]],["BL_47.1",47,[174,376,1169,402]]]'>It has not, of course, been usual in operations on margins, to place the wager with a stakeholder, and hence no precedent is found in the books of an effort to recover margins from such a <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>depositary. But here the parties selected one, who now has the fund in litigation. The master expressly finds in answer to the defendants’ 11th point that the bank was a “stakeholder,” and in this we think he was fully sustained. Kirk testified that the money was to be held in the bank for the use of the people who put it in, and the plaintiffs and bank officer all say that the bank was designated to perform that office between the parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b47-5" data-blocks='[["BL_47.4",47,[170,787,1171,607]]]'>A “ stakeholder ” is defined in the Century Dictionary to be “ in law, one holding a fund which two or more claim adversely to each other.” In Rapalje and Lawrence’s. law dictionary, “ stakeholder primarily means a person with whom money is deposited pending the decision of a bet or wager (q. v.), but it is more often used to mean a person who holds money or property which is claimed by rival claimants, but in which he himself has no interest.” In the 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 18, “ a stakeholder is a depositary for both parties of money advanced by them, respectively, with a naked authority to deliver it over upon the proposed contingency. He is not regarded as a party to the illegal contract.”</p>

It has been repeatedly held that while the stake continues in the custody of the holder, it may be sued for. “ When the action is against the stakeholder before its payment and after notice not to pay it over, the money may be recovered back:” Cotton v. Thurland, 5 Term R. 406. In McAllister v. Hoffman, 16 S. &amp; R. 147, Gibson, C. J., said, “ The result of the authorities undoubtedly is, that the loser may withdraw his stake at any time before actual payment to the winner.” And this he asserts of wagers void only at common law and without reference to statutory enactments. In the case of Forscht v. Green, <a href="/pa/53/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="53 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1004698" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0138-01">53 Pa. 138</a>, a recovery from a stakeholder was had, though notice not to pay to the winner was given only after the event had taken place. It being an election bet, the court held he could then sue for his money, and that he could have done so prior to the act of 1839. The rule is thus stated in the elaborate note to Godsall v. Boldero, 2 Smith’s Leading Cases, part 1, 8th ed., page 319, “ But it is held in general, that so long as the money staked on the result of a wager, remains in the hands of a stakeholder, it belongs to the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>person from whom it came, and may be withdrawn by him, notwithstanding the loss of the bet, and without the consent of the other party to the contract. A notice not to pay will operate as a countermand of the authority implied by the original deposit, and a subsequent payment will be no defense to an action for money had and received.” It further states, “ the law was so held in Vischer v. Yates, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Johns.%20Ch.%2023" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Johns. Ch. 23">11 Johns. (N. Y.) 23</a>, and although this decision was overruled by Yates v.

J., in Ball v. Gilbert, 12 Met. (Mass.) 397. In Stacy v.

There is a remarkable approach to unanimity in the authorities in answering this question in the affirmative,” citing a large number of authorities. The case of Deaver v. Bennett, <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Am.%20St.%20Rep.%20415" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="26 Am. St. Rep. 415">26 Am. St. Rep. 415</a>, (29 Neb.

Under the English decisions, which have been followed in most of the United States, the contract is considered executory until the money depending upon the result of the wager has been actually paid to the winner. In accordance with this view, where the articles wagered are placed in the hands of a stakeholder, the determination of the event does not execute the contract, and an action on the part of the loser will lie to recover what he has deposited with the stakeholder.”</p>

Hartley &amp; Co., one of the defendants. The money in their possession is claimed by J. M. Campbell, another defendant who is the appellant, and it is also claimed by the plaintiffs. Hartley &amp; Co. make no claim to it whatever, and so far as the contending claimants are concerned they are mere stakeholders. This fact has been found by the master and the finding has been confirmed by the court and is in entire accord with the whole of the testimony. There are certain fundamental facts which are altogether without question, and which must be regarded as established facts in the case. One is that Campbell never placed a dollar of the money with Hartley &amp; Co. Another is that the present plaintiffs actually furnished the whole of the money in dispute and considerably more besides. In point of fact the money was deposited with Hartley &amp; Co. by George W. Kirk, but Kirk received the whole of it from the plaintiffs. It was deposited under an arrangement made between the plaintiffs and Kirk,, who was a broker in stocks and grain, but who <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>was totally irresponsible, and it was deposited in the name of Campbell, not because it was Campbell’s money, but in order that it might be used as margins upon transactions in the purchase and sale oE stocks and bonds, in a purely speculative manner, and not with any intention to make actual purchases and deliveries of the stocks and grain dealt in. It was expressly agreed that the money deposited to the credit of the account called “ J. M. Campbell’’ should not be drawn out on checks of J. M. Campbell without the consent of the plaintiffs. It was well said in the opinion of the learned court below that, ‘* From Campbell and Kirk, down to the last customer, they did not pretend to own a dollar’s worth of commodities in which they assumed to be dealing. Nothing was actually bought or sold in Bedford or elsewhere, but it was a mere matter of wagers, of bookkeeping and the adjustment of balances. The master finds in answer to the plaintiffs’ request, that Campbell ‘acknowledged that he took the trades himself and did nothing towards investing the funds he received in the articles which were supposed to be bought and sold.’ The business was therefore all confined to the little circle made up of Campbell, Kirk and their customers at Bedford.” Turning to Campbell’s testimony we find he said, “ I was receiving from different people; some would buy, some sell. Now all that I needed to go into the market to buy from any brother broker would be the difference between buying and selling. Q. You didn’t trouble your mind about any purchase ? A. I never bought anything directly in the exchange unless they wanted the stock. Q. You understood these transactions here were simply transactions on the differences ? A. I presume they were.”</p>

Under all our decisions these are mere wagering contracts and are illegitimate transactions, and the money being still in the hands of the stakeholder and not paid over to the person who made, or who claimed to have made, the transactions, the question is, can money deposited for such uses but not actually paid <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>over be recovered back. Upon that question the authorities cited in the report of the master, the opinion of the court below and the argument for the appellant, are most full and conclusive, and they are very numerous. In fact they are not controverted. A very brief reference only will be necessary.</p>
    <p id="b55-5" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[172,616,1169,505]]]'>In the note to Godsall v. Boldero, 2 Smith’s Leading Cases, 8th ed. part 1, p. 319, the doctrine is thus stated: “But it is held in general that so long as the money, staked on the result of a wager, remains in the hands of the stakeholder, it belongs to the person from whom it came, and may be withdrawn by him, notwithstanding the loss of the bet and without the consent of the other party to the contract. ... A notice not to pay will operate as a countermand of the authority implied by the original deposit, and a subsequent payment will be no defense to an action for money had and received.”</p>
    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.5",55,[170,1129,1178,705]]]'>In McAllister v. Hoffman, 16 S. &amp; R. 147, we held that-money bet upon an election and deposited with a stakeholder, who, after the event of the election is known, has notice not to pay it over to the winner, may be recovered back by the loser. Said Gxbson, C. J., “ The result of the authorities undoubtedly is that the loser may withdraw his stake at any time before actual payment to the winner.” In Conklin v. Conway, <a href="/pa/18/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="18 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="969087" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0329-01">18 Pa. 329</a>, we held the same doctrine. An action lies against a stakeholder for money deposited by plaintiff with him on a bet, and which the stakeholder has not paid over, or which he has paid to the other party after demand by plaintiff and notice of withdrawal of the bet, or that it had failed through a dispute as to the mode of its decision. To the same effect is the case of Forscht v. Green, <a href="/pa/53/0138-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="53 Pa. 138" data-case-ids="1004698" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0138-01">53 Pa. 138</a>.</p>

Young, <a href="/pa/112/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="112 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="546847" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0419-01">112 Pa. 419</a>, we applied the same principle to a case in which the defendant gave a note to pay money lost by another at play, although the note was in the hands of an innocent holder for value. A fraud was also practiced upon the defendant, to induce him to give the note, but we held that the gambling character of the transaction still remained, and avoided the note. In a per curiam opinion, we said, “ The undoubted evidence proves the note in contention was given in a gambling transaction. The fact that a fraudulent device was superadded to induce the giving of the note, did not destroy the gambling nature of the scheme. The note was made payable to the order <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>of the person who won the money in gambling, and in payment of the debt thereby incurred. . . . The foundation of the transaction and also the consideration of the note, both rested on the one gambling operation. Such being the case, and although the note is negotiable in form, it is void even in the hands of a good faith and innocent holder for value.”</p>
    <p id="b56-5" data-blocks='[["BL_56.4",56,[267,663,1169,1265]]]'>In Gaw v. Bennett, <a href="/pa/153/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="99" data-cite="153 Pa. 247" data-case-ids="840315" data-case-paths="/pa/153/0247-01">153 Pa. 247</a>, we went one step further, and applied the same rule to a note given to a stock broker by a customer, for whom he had bought and sold stocks at various times, resulting in a loss, for the amount of which the customer gave his promissory note. The present chief justice delivering the opinion after commenting upon the evidence and the function of the jury in connection therewith, said, “ On the contrary we think the testimony tended to prove that the intention of both parties was merely to wager upon the prospective price of said stocks, settle the difference and pay the gain or loss; in other words their transactions throughout, were in fact repeated acts of gambling in the stocks referred to in said accounts, and the jury were warranted by the evidence in so finding. ... In this state the law relating to gambling contracts has been finally settled in a long line of cases, among which are the following,” citing a large number of cases. No difference is made in these cases between those in which the wager was void under the statutes against horse racing and gaming, and those which resulted from wagering stock transactions. Fareira v. Gabell, <a href="/pa/89/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="100" data-cite="89 Pa. 89" data-case-ids="1063201" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0089-01">89 Pa. 89</a>, was one of the latter kind, and that case is thus referred to in the further course of the opinion above cited: “Also that notes given to a broker to cover losses in stock gambling operations are void; that money advanced by a broker to pay such losses cannot be recovered, nor can the broker’s commissions be recovered, because the whole transaction is unlawful.”</p>

If then, actual obligations founded upon the settlement of real transactions in the stock market, which have resulted in loss, where the dealing was upon the basis of margins for speculative operations, are void, how much stronger <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>is the present case where a mere deposit of money was made with a stakeholder, and it has not been paid over, and where, also, there never were any real transactions of purchase and sale, but only a dealing in differences.</p>

We have no doubt upon that subject. • The money deposited with Hartley, though coming from several different persons was entered in one joint account called “ J. M. Campbell.” A number of transactions were made and a considerable part of the money deposited was paid out. The contest is over the resulting balance, but in order that the balance could be ascertained the accounts would have to be adjusted, and the balance struck. But that could not be done in a separate common law action by each depositor. There could be no adequate remedy except by making all the persons interested parties to the proceeding, and having the accounts adjusted so that the rights of each one could be determined, and as to that each depositor would be entitled to be heard, not only as against Campbell and against Hartley &amp; Co., but as to each other. The accounts are also mutual, representing numerous items of deposit on the one side, and still more numerous transactions on the other. On the ground therefore of inadequacy of the legal remedy, and of mutual accounts, and community of interest in a joint fund which requires an ascertainment and division into several separate interests, and the prevention of a multiplicity of suits, the jurisdiction of equity is undoubted. The fourth head of equity jurisdiction under the act of 1836 is, “ The determination of rights to property or money claimed by two or more persons, in the hands or possession of a person claiming no right of property therein.” While this source of jurisdiction is generally exercised by a bill of interpleader that remedy is not exclusive, and we know of no reason why the jurisdiction undoubtedly conferred by the act should not be exercised under another bill which is more adapted <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>to all the facts of the case. Injunction and discovery were also needed for the purposes of an adequate remedy.</p>
