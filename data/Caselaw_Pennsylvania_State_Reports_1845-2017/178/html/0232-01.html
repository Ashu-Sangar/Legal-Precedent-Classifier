    <p class="summary" id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[267,858,1171,1062]]]'>In the spring of 1892, G. C. Kennedy, then a member of the bar practicing in these courts, procured from Reese L. Himes |2,000, to be loaned to B. F. Henry on a mortgage, an existing-lien of $1,000 on the property was to be paid out of this money; that Kennedy kept $1,000 of the money and failed to pay off the lien. In the fall of 1893 Kennedy procured from Himes $350, for which he gave to Himes an obligation .that purported to be an obligation of W. M. Tinsley, of Marietta, to him, Kennedy, and by him indorsed to Himes. Tinsley testified that the note was a forgery; that he never had any business relations of any kind with Kennedy; that he had not signed the Himes note or any other, and that the whole transaction was a fraud. On April 1,1892, the said Kennedy received from John B. Milleysack $840, principal and interest on a mortgage due. to Susan A. Himes, from whom he had procured a power of attorney to satisfy said mortgage; which money he has never paid over to his client. On April 1, 1892, Kennedy, as the at-' torney of Sarah Himes, received from John S. Dombach $2,000, for the transfer of a mortgage, which money was to be paid to his said client, and which he embezzled and retained, and never paid over to her.</p>

The defense made by his counsel is that of insanity. As we understood them to say when the case was submitted to us, it was made for the sole purpose of moving the conscience of the court towards a suspension instead of an expulsion from the bar. It must, therefore, be conceded that the conduct and the acts of the respondent, as an attorney and a member of the bar, if he was sane, justify severe censure and punishment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b255-3" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[202,826,1173,1578]],["BL_256.1",256,[253,370,1171,502]]]'>The relation of attorney and client is well understood by the legal profession. The measure of fidelity due the client is fully given by our Supreme Court. In re Samuel Davies, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20Pa.%20116" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="98 Pa. 116">98 Pa. 116</a>, Justice Mebcttb says: “ An attorney at law sustains an important relation in the administration of justice. He possesses certain powers and privileges from which others are excluded, and assumes important duties and obligations towards both court and client. He is an officer of the former and a representative of the latter. His position is so responsible, his opportunities for good and for evil are so many that both statute and common law have united in throwing all reasonable safeguards around his conduct. Before he can be admitted to the bar, the act of assembly requires him to take an oath or affirmation, inter alia, that he will behave himself in the office of attorney within the court, according to the best of his learning and ability, and with all good fidelity as well to the court as to the client.” And as to the authority of the court the justice says: “ The power of a court to admit as an attorney to its bar, a person possessing the requisite qualifications, and to remove him therefrom when found unworthy, has been recognized for ages and cannot now be questioned. In fact, the power for removal for just cause is as necessary as that of admission for a due administration of law. By admitting him the court presents him to the public as worthy of its confidence in all his professional duties and relations. If afterwards it comes to the knowledge of the court that he has become unworthy, it is its duty to withdraw that indorsement, and thereby cease to hold him out to the public as worthy of professional employment.” The same court in Dickens’ Case, <a href="/pa/67/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="67 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="1022551" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0169-01">67 Pa. 169</a>, comments upon the necessary qualifications of a member of the legal profession. Judge Agnew there says: “ Integrity, as well as' skill and <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>learning, is essential to the character -of the profession, and it becomes the duty of the bench as well as of the bar itself, to preserve that character in its highest state, as a means of usefulness, and of answering the true end of a profession so honorable and at the same time so needful. Notwithstanding the prejudices of some, the ignorance of others, and even the discredit occasionally brought upon the office by unworthy members, we are glad to know that the bar is filled with many worthy men, and that a trust and confidence almost unlimited is justly reposed in it by the public.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.4",256,[240,881,1179,1472]]]'>Was the respondent responsible for his acts? The defense of insanity is a novel one in a proceeding of this kind. If we were satisfied by the evidence that the respondent was of such unsoundness of mind as to be actually insane and to render him unable to have known the difference between right and wrong, we might feel inclined to follow the suggestions of his counsel in this matter, as a suspension, in such a case would serve the same purpose as an expulsion. The proof before us, however, on this question is, at best, of a weak and unsatisfactory nature. It would be insufficient, in our opinion, as an available defense for a defendant in any proceeding either in law or in equity. In the absence of corroborative evidence in behalf of the respondent, we would not be justified in holding that he was irresponsible for his acts, and especially, since there has been no testimony adduced in his behalf by his learned counsel from members of his own profession, with whom he had been actively engaged in practice up to the time of the disclosure of the wrongs committed. Mere eccentricity of manner or peculiarity of conduct would not be a sufficient explanation of or excuse for his conduct. . Under the evidence we are compelled to conclude that the respondent is guilty of all the charges preferred against him in this proceeding, and that the defense made in his behalf is insufficient. Therefore, exact justice in this case demands that the court, the bar and the public shall be protected from such gross misbehavior as this case clearly shows was practiced by the respondent. It is, therefore, ordered and decreed that the name of G. O. Kennedy be stricken from the roll of attorneys admitted to practice law in the several courts of Lancaster county.</p>
