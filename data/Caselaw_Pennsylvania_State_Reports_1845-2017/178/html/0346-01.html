Plaintiff was to furnish all of the hand money for the purchase, as well as the money to make the deferred payments and was to be repaid out of the first sales, and after such repayment she was to receive two thirds of the profits. Defendant negotiated the purchase of the property, and by a secret arrangement with the vendors received $500 out of the purchase money. Only a very small amount was realized from the sale of the lots, and plaintiff was obliged to pay the whole amount of the purchase money.

The provision in regard to one third of the profits was-based on the idea-that the!sales 0f lots would be sufficient to refund the money to pay her, and also meet all contingencies, so that Johnston would not, in that way, have to advance any money. Mrs. Katz having advanced the $2,500, and in that way secured the purchase under the arrangement, would receive two thirds of the profits.</p>
