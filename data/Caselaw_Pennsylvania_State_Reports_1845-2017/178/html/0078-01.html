The auditor separated as far as was practicable the matters involved in the personal and the real estate, and as to the latter reported that as they had not been adjusted, the orphans’ court was without jurisdiction to pass upon them. The auditor’s report was confirmed by the orphans’ court. <em>Held, </em>that as the parlies had never made any final settlement in their business, relations, the orphans’ court could not allow any items connected with the personal estate apart from those connected with the real estate.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b99-4" data-blocks='[["BL_99.5",99,[194,571,1168,916]]]'>The only contests in this estate are those arising out of the claims presented by Dr. J. S. Miller. Miller was the client of Fulton, who was an attorney at law, and Fulton was the patient of Miller, who was a physician. So that to begin with, we have the double confidential relation. In addition to this the evidence shows that Fulton and Miller were jointly interested in business transactions ; at least in two real estate deals or speculations, one of which is closed by a sale of the property but the proceeds not yet divided, and the other still open, a portion of the property remaining unsold. No books were kept of any of the transactions between them, excepting Dr. Miller’s books of his professional services, so far as the evidence discloses the fact, and as a logical result the auditor has been obliged to grope his way through the mass of checks, papers and memoranda and the testimony of many witnesses laid before him, with a view of approximating the truth ; and his able'report shows that he has accomplished the task better than might have been expected, notwithstanding his superior ability in this line.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[192,1496,1168,544]]]'>Dr. Miller presented to the auditor and insisted upon four claims, as follows : (1) For $1,550, with interest, being the proceeds of an interest in a slate quarry, purchased by Fulton with money furnished by Dr. Miller, and sold again, and for which Fulton received the money ; (2) for $350, and interest, being amount received by Fulton from the sale of real estate owned by him and Miller jointly; (3) for the sum of $3,000, with interest, being for money claimed to have been furnished by Miller for investment July 9, 1890 ; (4) for $2,551 for professional services rendered and medicines furnished the deceased in his lifetimé.</p>

Indeed, in view of the proved facts, tracing the money of Dr. Miller into the properties and back into the hands of the decedent, together with the declaration of trust as to the first signed by the decedent, was conclusive as to these two claims. Their allowance, however, was resisted upon the grounds that they were met by <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>a claim of set-off, as were also all the claims made by Dr. Miller.

    <p class="summary" id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[237,463,1170,1528]]]'>The third claim was rejected by the auditor for the reason that it was not sufficiently proved. The evidence is perfectly clear that Dr. Miller gave to Fulton on July 9, 1890, his check for $3,000, and that Fulton got the money on it. But this standing alone proves nothing in favor of Dr. Miller except that thereby he discharged a debt of some kind which he owed to that amount to Fulton on that day. This is the legal presumption and the only one which arises in his favor from the transaction. But this attempt is made to show that this check, instead of having its presumed effect, had exactly the contrary, and that instead of discharging a debt to Fulton, it created one against him; when he is no longer here to speak, the evidence to work such a transformation ought to be distinct and clear, since the presumption, as I view it, is strongly against the creation of a liability by the check and in favor of the discharge of a debt. The law presumes that the giver of the check either paid a debt with it or received the cash at the time from the payee: Flemming’s Exr. v. McClain, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Pa.%20176" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Pa. 176">13 Pa. 176</a>; Lancaster Bank v.

Is there evidence to accomplish such a purpose ? There is an entire absence of evidence showing or tending to show that this check was intended to transfer funds to Fulton for investment. There is no declaration of Fulton in reference to this check proved, nor is there any evidence, documentary or oral, offered for nor which could show such a purpose. The evidence relied upon for this purpose is that detailed by Wesley Klinedinst and his wife, and this has no reference to this check or this specific sum of money, but to the fact that Fulton had $3,000 of Dr. Miller’s for investment. This testimony is as follows:</p>

It seems to me that to ask the question is to deny the proposition. The mind is left altogether in uncertainty as to what this testimony establishes. It is vague and uncertain as to time. It does not show that Fulton made the declaration that he had $3,000 of Dr. Miller’s money about the time of its receipt, but that he still had it uninvested, any time from six months to one year after the first conversation. It is possible that Dr. Miller would have permitted that sum of <a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>money to lie idle in his counsel’s hands for that length of time uninvested, and yet a finding in his favor would establish the fact that he had done so, and that it continued in his hands still ■uninvested from July 9, 1890, to the time of Fulton’s death, in February, 1892. Such a proposition is altogether improbable, and therefore I am satisfied that the auditor properly rejected this claim.</p>

The auditor refused to consider the question of set-off raised by the accountants against Dr. Miller’s claims, on account of the multiplicity of the transactions shown to have taken place between them and which seemed to have some connection with or growing out of their real estate transactions. Was he correct in this ? As shown by the evidence there were money transactions between the decedent and claimant, covering a period of several years and involving the purchase, improvement, disposition of real estate and its profits, and virtually constituting partnership dealings. No final settlement is shown to have taken place between them; and on the contrary, what evidence there is on the subject shows there was not. Claims and counterclaims, set-off and counter offsets were introduced ad infinitum, and the introduction of checks or papers showing receipt of money by one from the other was immediately followed by the counter production of other liabilities to offset it until it is not surprising that the auditor should decline to undertake the adjustment of these accounts. It was shown that the decedent built houses on ground jointly purchased by claimant and decedent and paid for the same with his own checks, and that at the same time the claimant was transferring funds or making payments to the decedent. These matters have not been adjusted, and until they are the orphans’ court cannot entertain jurisdiction of them, since should it determine that Dr. Miller is indebted to the docedent on account of them it could not enforce payment thereof by him: Weigley v. Coffman, <a href="/pa/144/0489-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="144 Pa. 489" data-case-ids="823769" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0489-01">144 Pa. 489</a>.

The book pro•duced contained a large number of entries, beginning more than six years before the presentation of the claim. The auditor disallowed all that appeared to be barred by the statute of limitations, all lumping charges, a large number of items not self explanatory, and allowed the rest. The learned judge below sustained an exception by the claimant and allowed all the charges within six years, except those containing a lump sum for items not particularly specified. There were other questions raised both as to the claim itself and the mode of <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>proof, but in the view we take of the case it is not necessary to notice them.</p>

The earlier cases are full of expressions that such entries are evidence at all only from necessity, and that the custom to which such necessity gave rise extended only to goods sold and labor performed, and that it was exceptional and dangerous in character and would not be extended: Crouse v.

In Wilson v. Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20N.J.L.%2095" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="6 N.J.L. 95">6 N. J. Law, 95</a>, the disputed entries were for cash paid, advanced or lent, and some of them were written on one of the last leaves of the book with blank leaves between them and the other accounts. Ford, J., was of opinion that none of the cash entries was admissible, and Kirkpatrick, C. J., while not going so far, concurred in excluding the separate entries at the end of the book. In discussing the subject of book entries at some length, he said, “ A book of daily entries, containing accounts with different people touching matters in which a man is known to deal or be employed, and which according to the custom of the country are usually made matter of account, has been admitted as evidence for the jury under all the circumstances of the case, while a detached paper, which might have been made up for the occasion has been wholly rejected. . . .Now these last entries appear to me to be no part of the book, properly speaking, but to stand precisely in the situation of a detached paper, and to derive no credit at all from their being written within the cover of the book, seeing they are written upon pages wholly detached from the daily entries and accounts.” And in Swing v. Sparks, <a href="/njl/7/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="7 N.J.L. 59" data-case-ids="291172" data-case-paths="/njl/7/0071-01">7 N. J.

The decedent and Dr. Miller had very close and complicated business connections. The evidence shows real estate held in common, or in trust; many payments or advances of money on account of such real estate; transfer and satisfaction of judgments ; and very numerous checks passing from each of the parties to the other. Through this tangled mass the auditor has gone with great intelligence and exemplary industry, and we should not think of questioning or reviewing the results he arrived at, approved as they are by the court below, were it not entirely clear that the scope of his inquiries was too much restricted by considerations of jurisdiction to enable him to do full justice to the parties or terminate the litigation. He separated so far as was practicable the matters involving personal and real estate, and as to the latter, he-reported: “the matter of ascertaining the respective interests of the decedent and the claimant in said real estate, and the adjustment of the same, requires other proceedings, and to such proceedings the auditor is of opinion should be referred for adjudication and settlement all the checks, payments and other matters arising out of or pertaining to said real estate transactions.” The court reaching the same conclusion said, “ no final settlement is shown to have taken place between them; and on the contrary what evidence there is on the subject shows there was not. Claims and counterclaims, set-off and counter offsets were introduced ad infinitum, and the introduction of checks or papers showing receipt of money by one from the other was immediately followed by the counter productions of other liabilities to offset it. . . . It was shown that the decedent built houses on ground jointly purchased by claimant and decedent, and paid for the same with his own checks, and that afi the same time the claimant was transferring funds or making payments to the decedent. These matters have not been adjusted, and until they are the orphans’ court cannot en<a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>tertain jurisdiction of them. ... I decline therefore to allow the claims of set-off, without prejudice to the parties however to ascertain and adjudicate the same in the proper forum.” The difficulty with this proposed separation of the claims and the offsets is that it is not practicable. The parties made no such separation and the court cannot do it now. The appellee’s own evidence shows that apart from the item of medical attendance his claims are for items in a long, complicated and unsettled account. The auditor, with great ability, showed that two items, the slate quarry claim and the Klinedinst claim, were capable of separate statement and settlement, but he could not show that the parties had ever so stated or settled them. On the contrary the evidence is that they never did so, and there is nothing to enable the court to say that when the whole account is stated the balance due by decedent on these two items may not be offset by a balance due to him on others. The effect of the adjudication is to allow appellee to enforce payment of part of an admittedly unsettled account, and to turn over the other side to another suit for what may be due to him. This cannot be done. The matters are closely interwoven, and were never separated by the parties ; they must go together to a common settlement now. The orphans’ court could not deal adequately with the whole account, nor can we in this proceeding. None of the items therefore can be allowed separately.</p>
    <p id="b110-4" data-blocks='[["BL_110.4",110,[251,1590,1171,747]]]'>This is a regrettable controversy. The decedent and the claimant stood not only in the double professional relations of counsel and physician to each other but in close business and personal association. For this reason probably their business matters were confined to their own knowledge, and conducted without regard to business formality or prudence, and the sudden death of Mr. Fulton left them so mixed that no tribunal now is likely to be able to say with confidence that it has reached a solution certainly correct. It is a case for amicable adjustment by reference to one or more arbitrators to take up the whole account in the same capable manner that the learned auditor took up the part that he thought within his jurisdiction and reach as .equitable a result as is now possible. Failing to agree on this however the parties must be left to their remedies on the matters as a whole.</p>
