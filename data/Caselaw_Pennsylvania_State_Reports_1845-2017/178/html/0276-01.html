The evidence on behalf of the plaintiff tended to show that the gutter on the west side of the avenue at the end of the alley was obstructed by ice and snow, which caused the water flowing down the gutter to run over the crossing at the mouth of the alley, causing a bed of sloping ice which would not have accumulated if the city had kept the gutter opened.</p>

Pearl avenue and Washington avenue are parallel streets leading from near where the plaintiff boarded down Cottage Hill to Harriott avenue, near the foot of the hill. Both streets were quite steep an d were icy at the time of the accident. The plaintiff testified that she had been over Pearl avenue quite often <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>some time before the accident, but that she had not been over Washington avenue for about three weeks prior to the accident. She testified that she had no knowledge that there was anything wrong with Washington avenue, and that she knew no difference in the condition of the two streets, and that she considered it a little more convenient to go to church down Washington avenue. There was no evidence that she had any knowledge or notice of the accumulation of ice at the mouth of Polk alley, or that she was not using ordinary care when the accident happened.</p>
