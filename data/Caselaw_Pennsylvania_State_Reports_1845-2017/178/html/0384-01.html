Keely, Jr., M. D., one of the plaintiffs, from his trip toward the North Pole with Lieutenant Peary, he wrote a book in conjunction with G. G. Davis, M. D., the other plaintiff. This book, which they entitled “ In Arctic Seas ” described the voyage of the ship “ Kite ” to the winter quarters chosen by Peary, the farewell between those who remained in Greenland with that intrepid explorer and those who came back with the Kite, and the return of the latter, among whom was Dr. Keely, to Philadelphia in September, 1891. It was printed for the plaintiffs by Edward Stern &amp; Co., of <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>Philadelphia, on the best paper obtainable by the plaintiffs, the book being an octavo volume of two hundred and fifteen pages. Of this edition, the plaintiffs disposed of four hundred copies and had remaining six hundred copies of the work in printed, unbound sheets. This was the status of affairs when news reached Philadelphia that Lieutenant Peary, who had been left in Greenland, had survived the winter of 1891-1892. After that event there was no sale of plaintiffs’ book as it did not narrate occurrences to date. On the 4th of July, 1892, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia sent out a relief expedition that was to find Peary and learn if he had made the intended dash overland toward the North Pole and to bring him home. This relief expedition brought Peary back to Philadelphia in September, 1892, and it was this return of the explorer, with the tale of his sojourn in the North and the results of his expedition, that the plaintiffs were compelled to incorporate in their book, if they wished to make its sale profitable. This necessity of bringing out an edition to date being recognized by the plaintiffs, they looked around them for a publisher, and finally made on September 29, 1892, the contract with Rufus G. Hartranft, the defendant, which is set out in plaintiffs’ bill, and which provided among other things that the six hundred copies of plaintiffs’ book should be used in the compilation of the new book. This contract is silent as to the nature of the book that was to be published, but Dr. Keely says: “ The arrangement with Mr. Hartranft was to be of as high a character as possible.” Dr. Davis testified, “we discussed the manner of publication, the defendant, myself and Dr. Keely, and it was mutually decided to issue the book in the same good style as had characterized the book published by Stern.” The reason plaintiffs had gone to Stern for the printing of their book was that “ Stern was one of the best printers in the city, and they wanted to have as finely finished a book as possible,” and the reason that Stern did not print their second book was, as Dr. Keeley testified, because Mr. Hartranft told them the book had not been properly managed, and he made favorable inducements to plaintiffs. Dr. Davis testified that the defendant represented to plaintiffs that he could handle the book to a much better advantage, and that profits were to be made by publishing it and handling it in a different manner than theretofore. “ It was proposed to enlarge the book, and <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>to charge an increased price, and to handle it in, so to speak, a professional manner, in professional and legitimate avenues of trade, such as a book publisher is supposed to have at his convenience.” Although the new book was to go from the printer, Stern, to a publisher, still Stern’s quality of paper and style of book were to be adhered to. The cost of this quality of paper and style of book entered into the calculations of plaintiffs and defendant, as an element of the total cost of the work, and hence must have been agreed on. The defendant avers that as to two editions of the book he used such grade of paper and issued such style of book, and does not deny that such was the agreement, although he did once deny it; indeed, as to the six hundred copies of unbound printed sheets delivered to defendant, he would have been compelled to use similar paper and style of book for the incomplete parts in order to make up a uniform whole. The master therefore finds that the paper and style of the books that defendant published were to have been of the same quality as that of the book of the plaintiffs published by Stern, and that the defendant failed to keep this contract in this respect, so far as the third edition of the book was concerned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[268,1429,1166,452]]]'>An important point in the publication of the book was the cost per volume at which it should be sold, for, as averred by plaintiffs in their bill, and not denied by defendant in his answer, and as was the actual fact, inasmuch as the plaintiffs, as parties to the said contract, were to receive thereunder a specified share of the net profits of the publication and sale of the said book, the fixing and maintaining of the minimum price at which the same should be sold retail and to the trade was and is an essential feature, and part of the said contract.</p>

The book was to be sold at such a price that the average income was to be #2.00 per volume.” Defendant Hartranft advertised in pamphlets and newspapers and by correspondence that the book was to sell at #3.50, and testified that “the price of publication agreed upon by both <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>parties was to be $3.00 to $3.50 a copy,” adding that this applied only to tbe first edition of the work. He elsewhere said that their “ agreement applied to only one edition; it was not known that more than one edition would be sold;” and he said again “ The arrangement for all subsequent editions was left an open matter. I never arranged for any edition but the one the contract shows.” It is to be noted that the contract does not call for any edition at all, and is silent as to any way of publishing the book except as to volume by volume. Dr. Keely testified that the wholesale price of not less than $2.00 per volume and retail price of not less than $3.00 to $3.50 per volume applied to all books that Mr. Hartranft should publish, and that nothing was said about editions. Dr. Davis said that there were no provisions made for any other edition, and no arrangements were made about one.</p>

In his testimony the defendant showed a curious ignorance concerning the price at which the book had been sold. He was unable to state positively that none had been sold by him at less than 75 cents per volume, and stated positively that some of the first edition, as to which he admits being bound to sell wholesale at not less than $2.00 per volume, were sold by him at $1.93 per volume. One of the plaintiffs bought the book at the North American office, where it is on sale at $1.24, and by an exhibit offered in evidence showed that it could be had at wholesale at 90 cents per volume, although they did not trace the sale at that rate to defendant, except by inference. The defendant’s <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>own testimony convicts him of a disregard of the rights of the plaintiffs, both in disposing of the book at cheap prices and in publishing inferior books without notice to plaintiffs or consultation with them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-4" data-blocks='[["BL_410.4",410,[284,580,1170,1829]],["BL_411.1",411,[175,370,1169,1021]]]'>The next points in dispute that come naturally to be discussed are the number of books sold, the prices obtained, and the ascertainment of expenses of the publication and the consequent loss or profit. Although the defendant stated that he was a publisher, and that “ In Arctic Seas ” was the twentieth book he had published, and although he knew that he was bound to account to the plaintiffs at some time for their share in the book’s profits, he did not keep a set of books. The bills for expenditures upon the book were his only evidence of such expenditures, and they were not kept in a ledger. In order to ascertain the cost of any portion of the work done, as, for instance, the binding or the printing of any one of the several editions, the defendant, upon inquiry of plaintiffs in regard thereto, simply stated that he had all bills, and offered them for the inspection of the plaintiffs, and further stated that he was unable to intelligently separate the various items of the bills produced, so as to give the exact cost of any one portion of the work done, as instanced above. Some of these bills were not receipted, others had been paid by the promissory notes of the defendant, some of which had been repeatedly renewed. In addition to this collection of bills, the defendant produced a scrapbook into which had been pasted from time to time the orders defendant had received for the books he was publishing for plaintiffs. This book professed to show the number of “ In Arctic Seas ” the defendant had received from the printer, the number he had parted with, and the number still in his possession. In connection with the scrapbook referred to, the defendant produced two other books which were supposed to throw light on and exemplify the scrapbook itself. One of these books marked “ A,” and called a trade sales book, contained the entries of sales made to book dealers, and of sales by the defendant directly to individuals; the other marked “ B, Agents,” contained the entries of sales made for defendant by agents. The contents of these two books in this respect, it was said, were in the scrapbook. But the master finds that they do not completely tally with the scrapbook, and they are extremely unsatisfactory in their evidences of careful <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>and veracious bookkeeping. They undoubtedly show that in many instances their respective entries were not made contemporaneously with the entries in the scrapbook, and that both of them, in part at least, were compiled long after the date of the entries they contain, and that both of them are exceedingly unreliable. They frequently show on the face of their pages an entry of a sale, prior in time, following in space on the page a sale of much later date. There is no systematic entry in the books of defendant to show to which edition any particular sale belonged, except one judge by the date of the sale, but as it nowhere appears just when the respective editions were exhausted, the date at which a copy was sold was hardly a criterion as to which edition it belonged, nor was its price, for defendant did hot adhere to any conformity in that regard. These were the resources offered the plaintiffs and master and, according to the defendant, the only ones at command upon which to find an account stated in this case. . . . The master finds that the defendant disposed of at least four thousand one hundred and forty-three copies of the book in dispute, and holds him liable therefor except as hereinafter stated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b411-5" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[178,1400,1167,1013]]]'>Of this number the master finds that defendant has five bound in “ levant ” on hand, for which he must subsequently account to plaintiffs, has disposed of fifty-nine copies to libraries, has disposed of two thousand eight hundred and ninety copies by trade sales, has sold by agents eight hundred and eighty-eight copies; one hundred and fifty-seven for cash and by mail; has given away to newspapers one hundred and forty-one copies, thus making a total of four thousand one hundred and forty copies, leaving three copies unaccounted for. This finding, except as to the five copies on hand, is a result of the master’s search through all the books. As to the sums for which defendant should be charged on account thereof, in view of what the master finds to have been agreed upon as the selling price, the master finds that as to the two thousand eight hundred and ninety copies disposed of by trade sales, the defendant should have accounted to the plaintiffs at the rate of not less than $2.00 per volume, or a total of $5,780; that as to the eight hundred and eighty-eight copies sold by agents, the defendant should have accounted to the plaintiffs at the rate of not less than $2.00 each or $1,776.</p>

    <p class="author" id="AUhP" data-blocks='[["BL_415.9",415,[465,1656,484,40]]]'>Mr. Justice McCollum,</p>
    <p id="b415-8" data-blocks='[["BL_415.10",415,[178,1708,1171,593]]]'>The learned master found there was an oral agreement prescribing the form and quality of the book and fixing the price at which it should be sold. He said in his report that this agreement did not modify the written contract, but that it simply regulated matters as to which the latter was silent. He interpreted it however as fixing the selling price of every book published by the defendant under the written contract and as guaranteeing the sale of it at that price. ■ He accordingly charged the defendant at least $2.00 for every book sold directly to the trade and for every book sold by agents, and at least $3.00 for every book “sold for cash and through the mail.”</p>
    <p id="b415-9" data-blocks='[["BL_415.11",415,[183,2320,1165,97]],["BL_416.1",416,[265,381,1167,1420]]]'>We think the learned master erred in his conclusion that the oral agreement was applicable to all the books the defendant <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>might publish and dispose of under the written contract, and that the latter was not modified by the former. It seems to us that the oral agreement materially modified the written contract and was applicable only to the first edition. The evidence fairly warranted the finding of an oral agreement applicable and limited to the first edition but it did not authorize the finding of an agreement applicable to all boohs the defendant might publish and sell under the written contract. We may therefore construe the agreement found by the master as limited to the first edition, and, with this modification of the written contract, determine the rights of the parties thereunder. By the terms of the contract so modified the plaintiffs were entitled to an account of the publication and sale of the first edition, on the basis adopted by the master. But the oral agreement furnished no basis for an account of the publication and sale of the second and third editions. As to these the contract as written furnished the basis for an adjustment. On the basis thus furnished the plaintiffs are entitled to receive, first, $240 from the net profits arising from the publication and sale of the work, and after that to have one fourth of the net profits realized from the handling of the work by the defendant. All the expenditures connected with the publication and sale of the book must be borne by the defendant, and after the payment of $240, as above stated, three fourths of the net profits of the enterprise belong to him. In the absence of net profits the plaintiffs are not entitled to anything more than a cancellation and surrender of the contract, together with a conveyance to them of the defendant’s rights in the copyright.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[266,1810,1166,400]]]'>The written contract did not prescribe the form, style or quality of the work or fix the selling price of it. These matters were left to the discretion of the publisher, whose interest in it would naturally impel him to use his best judgment and skill to make the venture a success. He was not required to continue the publication and sale of the book at a loss, but it was his duty to do all that lie reasonably could to promote the success of the enterprise.</p>

In fact the learned counsel for the appellant mates no objection to them.</p>
