Later in the same month the grantor defaulted in payment of two notes aggregating $3,800, which the grantee then paid, and in December, 1892, new notes were made, which the evidence tended to show were renewals of the notes paid in July. When these notes matured, they were renewed by one note for $4,000. <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>Subsequently various judgments were entered against the grantor. On December 4, 1895, the grantee filed a bill in equity for a decree permitting him to sell the real estate. The court in its findings included the $4,000 as a renewal of notes which formed part of the $7,000 named in the deed. The judgment creditors objected that this note was not an extension of the notes which the grantee had paid in July, 1892. The court entered a decree in accordance with its findings. <em>Held, </em>that the decree should be affirmed.</p>

Second, that if the court should not hold this view to be correct, but should hold the payment of an overdue note by the indorser to be a satisfaction and extinguishment of the debt, it will not affect our right to recover the amount because, if Aufderheide paid the $1,300 and the $2,500 notes after they became due, as the uncontradicted testimony shows he did, the event had then happened which gave Mm a right to sell the property; and having a right to sell it he had a right to retain the amount of all notes then extant and indorsed by him, as well as the amount of the ones paid by him, out of the proceeds of the sale, amounting admittedly to a larger sum than the $7,000 named in the deed, viz : to the sum of $8,800.</p>
