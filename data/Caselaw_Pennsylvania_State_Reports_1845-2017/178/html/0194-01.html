Greenfield, was injured by one of defendant’s cars on October 18, 1894, and died from his injuries on October 24. The accident occurred at the intersection of Derry street and 19 1/2 street. The defendant operated a single track electric railway upon Derry street. At the southeast corner of the intersection of the two streets was a stable fronting on Derry street and extending back along 19 1/2 street about twenty feet. To the east of the stable on the south side of Derry street about two hundred feet was an ice house with a frontage of about sixty feet on Derry street and a depth of about seventy or eighty feet. 19 1/2 street descended by a very steep grade from Derry street until it reached the rear end of the stable. From the crossing eastward Derry street is substantially level for a distance of about two hundred and fifty feet to a point near the ice house. From this point it rises by a long steep grade. To the west, beginning at 19 1/2 street, Derry street rose by a heavy grade. There was evidence that on the day of the accident a large covered wagon was standing at the crossing in <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>such a position as to obstruct the view of the track to the east. Greenfield approached the crossing from the south driving along 19 1/2 street. He had a two horse team attached to a large heavy wagon which was uncovered, except that it had a large umbrella over the driver’s seat. As he went upon the tracks he was struck by a car coming from the east, and received the injuries from which he died. The evidence for the plaintiff was that the car was running at a high rate of speed, and that no signal was given. This, however, was contradicted by the defendant’s witnesses. The evidence also showed that the deceased stopped at a point below the stable, from which point the track could be seen for a distance of about fifty feet between the stable and the ice house. From the time that Greenfield, after having stopped, started up the grade until he was thrown from his wagon, almost every fact relating to .his conduct as well as- to the conduct of the defendant’s employees was the subject of conflicting testimony.</p>

Whether defendant company’s employees, in charge of the car in question, were guilty of negligence which occasioned the death of plaintiff’s husband; and 2d. Whether any negligent act of the latter contributed to his injury and consequent death. These <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>and all other questions of fact arising out of the testimony were fairly and fully submitted to the jury by the learned president of the common pleas in a clear and adequate charge to which no exception appears to have been taken. Without referring to the charge in detail, it is sufficient to say that it embraces and correctly disposes of every legal question involved in the case. After fully explaining what constitutes negligence, contributory negligence, etc., and calling attention to the testimony relating thereto, the jury were instructed to determine, in the first place, whether the plaintiff had satisfied them “by the weight of the evidence that there was negligence on the part of the persons running the car. ... If they were not negligent, there could be no recovery.” If on the other hand the jury came to the conclusion that defendant’s servants were negligent, their next duty was to determine whether plaintiff’s husband was also guilty of negligence. After referring to the testimony relating to that question the learned judge proceeded to further instruct the jury as follows: “All these matters you will have to take into consideration, and endeavor to ascertain what the facts really were, reconciling the testimony of the different witnesses, if you can, and determining which are entitled to credit, and what the facts really are; and, having ascertained that, determine whether the facts, as they are, show that the deceased acted as a person of ordinary care and prudence would act, or ought to act .... under the circumstances. If he did, he was not negligent. If he did not, he was negligent and .... the plaintiff cannot recover.”</p>

In the concluding' clause of the third, it is assumed as a fact that “ he (the deceased) did not as he was legally bound to do, use his eyes or ears or senses as to the approach<a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>ing car.” No súcb. fact was either admitted or conclusively-proved. Whether it was so or not was a question of fact for the jury. As has been remarked, the testimony was more or less conflicting and unsatisfactory in relation to that, as well as other matters that are improperly assumed in the first three points. The case was carefully tried, and the judgment should not be disturbed.</p>
