The prerequisite to the payment on any gas well was that gas should be found in sufficient quantities to utilize. This one well was drilled and it was utilized. No others were drilled, and it is only with this well which you have to do. The rental for this well was paid down to November, 1891, and in November, 1891, a payment of $500 was made, being the payment in advance for the year terminating in November, 1892. Down until that time there is no question. The rent was paid to November, 1892. Was this well utilized after that time ? The defendant has undertaken to show you that the gas ceased to be used from that well in June or July, 1892, and that its connection with the pipe lines, that is, the means by which it was carried to the market, had been severed, and the connecting pipe taken out, which led over to another farm, some time in July, 1892. They say that at that time they ceased to use it and that it was their intention permanently to do so. The severance of the connection and the taking up of the line leading to the other farm ended its use as a gas well permanently. That in December the tubing was directed to be <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>drawn and that in the following spring some time the derrick was taken down and the tubing removed from the premises, and there is no evidence that anything has been done on the farm since. If you believe the testimony of the witnesses in the case, the well had no gas in it whatever that was discernible when the tubing was drawn. [Now, gentlemen, if these defendants, or those acting under the lease because of any assignment, in July, permanently ceased to use this as a gas well, then there can be no recovery in this action.] [3] If they simply suspended the use of it, intending to resume, and continued to hold it thus until December, experimenting with it in the hope or expectation that the gas would return in sufficient quantities, and so continued down until December,, when they found that the gas had departed altogether, then they would be liable for the rental of f500 coming due November 21,1892, with interest from that date down to the present time. [But in case they had permanently ceased its use before the 20th of November, and were not at that time holding it with the intention of holding it as a gas well, then there could be no recovery in this action.] -[4] The defendants would have the right within a reasonable time afterwards, under this lease, to remove their casing and such other machinery as they had, in a reasonable manner. They would have a right to a reasonable time in which to get the property away, considering the nature of the property and the difficulty of taking it away.</p>
