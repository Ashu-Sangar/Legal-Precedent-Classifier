Being located in the “ McDonald Field,” wells drilled in this field had to be drilled through the coal measure. In this case, as in the majority of the farms in this particular field, the coal measures had been sold by the owners of the farm, and had become vested in other parties, who were working the same. Owing to the fact that there was at this time a pending and undetermined conflict between the owners of the coal and the operators, as to the rights of the owners of the surface and the underlying strata below the coal and the oil operators as to their right to drill through the coal, the oil operators, in drilling their wells in this district, commenced the “ spudding ” of a well of a diameter of thirteen (18) inches, and drilled it this size to below the coal, so that a ten (10) inch casing could be put in the well to some point sufficiently far enough below the coal, so as to protect, in so far as they could, the coal workings from injury by leakings of oil into the same, or escape of gas into the mines, and jeopardizing the lives and limbs of the miners working therein, as well as the mine itself. After drilling through the coal, the diameter of the well was reduced to ten inches, and was drilled of this diameter to the depth of about seven hundred feet, or what is known by those engaged in drilling wells in this district as the “ hurry up sand.”</p>

From the bottom of the “hurry up sand,” the diameter of the well was reduced to eight inches, and this well “ Number Six ” was drilled that diameter to the distance of one thousand two hundred and eighty feet from the surface. Having gone this distance it became necessary to put in the six and a quarter inch casing, for the purpose of casing off the water, etc. Having reached this point in drilling the well, and it being necessary to case the well, plaintiffs called upon defendant to furnish the necessary casing. This was early in August, 1892. Casing was placed by defendant near the well, and plaintiffs commenced lowering it into the well, and continued to do so until all the casing furnished by defendant had been used, when it was found that there was lacking from one hundred and seventy to two hundred feet of casing. Plaintiffs swung the casing already lowered, and whilst waiting for additional casing, that portion of the well became fastened, and being unable to either raise or lower it, the well had to be and was abandoned.</p>

That for the want of sufficient supply of said casing at the said well when needed, the said well was lost or destroyed, and an abandonment thereof became unavoidable; that, in consequence of such abandonment, the plaintiffs were compelled to pay, and did pay, the sum of $2,449.40.” It is evident from the testimony that a sufficient supply of six and one quarter inch casing had not been supplied by the defendant to plaintiffs to permit them to case off the salt water draining into well No. 6. As the fact whether the well was lost or destroyed and an abandonment thereof became unavoidable, does not depend entirely upon tins one act, but a question of contributory negligence (if I may so call it) on the part of the plaintiffs, arises from the fact that, when they found that a sufficient amount of casing had not. been furnished by defendant, whether they were justified in permitting the one thousand one hundred feet of casing to swing in the well knowing the well to be in what is known as caving territory. In the judgment of the master, the defendant under its contract, knowing the depth at which oil was obtained in this (the McDonald) field, and the known sands through which the wells had to be drilled, and this being the sixth well drilled on this lease by plaintiffs for defendant, it was a duty incumbent upon defendant through its officers to furnish six and one quarter inch casing, after notice of the need of same, and in sufficient quantities to case off the salt water-encountered. Plaintiffs having proceeded under the usual mode to string and lower the casing furnished them, when they found' there was a deficiency in the number of feet of casing for the" purpose of casing the well to the depth required, and having given notice to the farm boss of defendant of such deficiency, I find as a fact that plaintiffs’ swinging the one thousand one-<a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>hundred feet of casing already lowered in this well upon the elevators, awaiting the arrival of additional casing, was not negligence on their part; the testimony shows the caving in thi's field to be in or near what is known as the salts, and by reason of plaintiffs being compelled to wait for this additional casing, said well No. 6 was lost or destroyed, and an abandonment thereof became unavoidable, but the loss or cost of the drilling of said well should not be charged wholly upon the plaintiffs. As to the amount of such loss, my finding in relation thereto is made in another part of my report.</p>

The evidence shows that plaintiffs, after discovering that a sufficient amount of casing had not been furnished, gave notice without delay to the farm boss of such deficiency, and then did that which, in their judgment as drillers of oil wells, was the best for the parties in interest; the bottom of the string of casing lowered by them into this well being above the caving place, no fault can be attributed to them for the sticking of the casing.</p>

Had this objection been taken to the bill on demurrer before it was answered, it might have been sustained; but the defendant having denied the material allegations of the plaintiffs’ bill, and having had a full hearing on the merits, and heavy expense and cost having been incurred, it seems to the master too late to sustain this objection now.” Exceptions (inter alia) were filed by the defendants to this ruling that he had erred in not dismissing the bill.

This being the law, the act of October 13, 1840, sec. 19, P. L. 7 (Purd. Dig. 1885, p. 692), comes into play, and the plaintiffs may “proceed either by bill in chancery or the common law action of account render.” And hence it has been repeatedly decided that courts of equity have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of law in all cases where account render would be an appropriate remedy: Reeside v.
