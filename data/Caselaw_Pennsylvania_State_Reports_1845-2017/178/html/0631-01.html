The learned court below so instructed the jury, and the correctness of that instruction is practically conceded by the appellee. The only question left in the case was the question of waiver of the defenses which the company clearly had, by acts done after the fire. The question of waiver depends almost, perhaps quite, exclusively upon the character of the company’s act in offering to pay the $800 damages assessed by the committee appointed by the company. If it was an offer of compromise it would not prejudice their right to insist upon their defenses. The court so instructed the jury, but left to them the question whether upon all the facts in evidence, including the offer to pay, there was a waiver by the defendant of the defenses growing out of the breaches of condition on the part of the plaintiff. By the sixth section of the conditions annexed to the policy it is provided that, “ Any member sustaining loss or damage by fire shall give immediate notice, in writing, to the president who shall appoint a committee of three from the board of managers to appraise said loss. They shall estimate the actual cash value of the property at the time it was destroyed; but in no case shall the award be more than three fourths the amount it will cost to replace or rebuild the same,” etc. In point of fact the plaintiff gave the proper notice of his loss within the proper time, and the president thereupon appointed the proper committee from the board of managers to appraise the loss. The committee promptly met on the property where the loss occurred; they called the plaintiff before them and examined him under oath as to the particulars of the fire and the extent of the loss, had him to sign the statement, and then made out a written report to the company, fixing the amount of the loss sustained by the plaintiff at $800. The fire occurred on September 19, 1894, the committee met on the premises and examined the plaintiff and also the property on September 26, 1894, and made their report to the company on November 5, 1894. On December 15, 1894, the company through its secretary sent to the plaintiff the following communication, to wit:</p>

We do not see how it can be so regarded. It purported to be, and it literally was, a part of a proceeding directly in the line of the policy and its conditions, and in regular compliance with the terms of the contract. It was a distinct proposition to do what the policy called for, to wit, to pay the amount of the damages ascertained and reported by the committee appointed by the president. It was consistent only with the theory that the company regarded the policy as in full operative force, that they had no objection or defense to make against payment of the loss, and that they were perfectly willing to pay according to its strict terms. After this proposition was made Mr. Earley was not satisfied to accept such an amount, and it was suggested by Earley, according to the testimony of Nissley, that the matter should be submitted to arbitrators or appraisers under the 8th article of the conditions. Then, on January 5, 1895, Nissley as secretary wrote a letter to Earley saying the company had decided to appoint David E. Miller as appraiser in place of J. J. Nissley and enclosed a written agreement signed by the company, and requested Earley to sign also, submitting the whole question to two appraisers who were to choose a third, and the three were to finally decide what the amount of the loss and damage was. Earley had named D. L. Saylor as his appraiser, and the company named Miller. This paper was not signed by Earley, but Nissley, the secretary, met Saylor and discussed with him the question of the loss and made an effort to induce Saylor to agree to the $800 appraisement. No agreement as to the amount however was arrived at, and while the the negotiations were still proceeding, Earley <a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>brought the present suit by advice of counsel whom he had retained. The writ was issued on January 30,1895, about four and a half months after the fire. During all this time nothing had been said by the company, or Nissley, or any one on behalf of the company, about any defense being made against the policy, although the company knew on September 26,1894, by the sworn statement of the plaintiff, that the conditions had been violated by the plaintiff. The whole discussion proceeded upon the basis of the liability of the company, and the only question to be decided was the amount which the company'was to pay. We think in this state of the testimony it was the clear duty of the court below to submit the question of waiver to the jury. This is in accordance with several of our recent decisions.</p>
