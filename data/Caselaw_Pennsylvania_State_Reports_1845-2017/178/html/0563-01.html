The tellers declared the Stevens ticket elected, and the candidates named on it, with the exception perhaps of Messrs. A. G. and Charles A. Morris, entered upon the duties of their respective offices, and continued to act as officers of said corporation until May 30, 1895, when they were ousted from office by a decision of the Supreme Court (see Commonwealth v.

At that date there were eighteen hundred and sixty-nine (1869) shares outstanding. The respective then holdings of stock, material to this case, were: A. G. Morris 949, G. W.

At said meeting Mr. Stevens at once subscribed for 350 shares and in a short time paid $3,500 into the corporation treasury; <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>tbe subscription price of such new issue being fixed at $10.00 per share.

Mr. Reddig is the other defendant, in addition to the candidates on said Stevens ticket, in the present suit. At the time he purchased said stock he had no knowledge of the illegality of the board of directors which authorized the issue of said stock. He paid for same by giving his note to Mr. Stevens. Said note was renewed from time to time by Mr. Stevens. The last renewal, in the spring of 1895, was in due course of business discounted by the First National Bank of Tyrone, and was paid off by Mr. Reddig a few days before the trial of this case. Mr. Reddig obtained the money for payment of said note by pledging the stock to a Carlisle bank which had no knowledge of any irregularity in the issue of stock.</p>

Reddig is a purchaser for value of part of said stock without actual notice that said persons issuing it, and sanctioning its transfer to him, were but officers de facto. Can he hold the stock ? In Dovey’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=97%20Pa.%20162" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="97 Pa. 162">97 Pa. 162</a>, our Supreme Court declined to decide whether the doctrine of lis pendens is applicable to a transfer of stock, but the general trend of recent decisions is that said doctrine is not applicable if such transfer be made before final decree and while the litigation is still pending. In Cook on Stock, section 362, the rule is so laid down and the tendency seems to be to liken the transfer of stock to that of negotiable paper. .The issue and transfer, or consenting to transfer, of stock is within the sphere of the official acts of officers of a corporation. In Cook on Stock, section 713, it is said: “ The contracts of an officer, acting within the sphere of his office, are binding on the corporation.” More especially is this true where the rights of third parties have intervened, <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>I conclude therefore that Mr. Reddig is entitled to hold his one hundred shares of stock.</p>

The research of counsel has produced no case precisely analogous to the present one, and the answer to the last interrogation is not entirely free from doubt. An officer de facto in general is not allowed to profit by the opportunity afforded him by reason of his illegal occupation of the office, but, on the other hand, his acts are often held to be binding on the company on the principle of estoppel. In Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. v. Pennsylvania Coal Company, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Pa.%20146" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Pa. 146">21 Pa. 146</a>, the acts of a de facto board of directors were sustained in part at least because of money expended and no offer to refund or repay the same.</p>

This being so I think it would he inequitable to compel the cancelation of his stock and the loss to him of his' $3,500, and so long as Mr. Stevens is not allowed to obtain an unfair advantage by reason of the issue of the stock, plaintiffs, it seems to me, have no equitable ground of complaint. [But Mr.- Stevens should not be allowed to use tiffs stock to control elections. To add said stock to the eight hundred and eighty shares already owned by him, and to allow him to vote such aggregate number of shares would be to give Mm control of any election held at present. TMs in effect would be permitting him to profit by his own wrong in issuing the stock wMle he was illegally acting as president and an illegally elected board of directors were in power. The result, so far as plaintiffs are concerned, would be the same, whether the intention of Mr. Stevens in subscribing for the stock was to obtain control of the corporation or not,] [7] hence we deem it unnecessary to decide whether he had such intention. But there is another cogent reason for restraining the voting of this stock. “Where the capital stock of a corporation is increased by the issue of new shares, each holder of the original stock has a right to offer to subscribe for and demand from the corporation such a pro<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>portion of the new stock as the number of shares already owned by him bears to the whole number of shares before the increase. This pre-emptive right of the share holders in respect of new stock is well recognized. The rule applies' to such part of the original stock as is issued long after business has been commenced by the company. Especially is this the rule where the directors issue new stock to themselves or to their friends in order to control an election or make a profit: ” Cook on Stock, section 286.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[271,802,1175,1577]]]'>Counsel for defendants cite Curry v. Scott, <a href="/pa/54/0277-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="54 Pa. 277" data-case-ids="1006309" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0277-01">54 Pa. 277</a>, as holding that the above rule is not law in Pennsylvania. Some •of the remarks of Strong, J., in his opinion, might seem to sustain said contention, but a closer examination of the case shows that he puts his decision on the ground that “ the bill does not allege that plaintiffs or any. of the old stockholders offered or that they were willing to take ” the additional stock. On the other hand, Reese v. The Bank of Montgomery Co., <a href="/pa/31/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="31 Pa. 78" data-case-ids="985008" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0078-01">31 Pa. 78</a>, recognizes the existence of the foregoing legal rule laid down by Cook on Stock. Nor does it seem just and equitable to restrict the remedy of plaintiffs to a suit against the corporation, such as was brought in said case of Reese v. The Bank of Montgomery Co. Such a remedy is inadequate and partially inequitable, as-plaintiffs in effect would be taking part of the damages recovered out of their own pockets, because their own stock would be diminished in value by reason of the amount paid out of the corporation treasury in the form of damages : Dousman v. Wisconsin &amp; Lake Superior Mining Co., 40 Wisconsin, 418. Mr. Stevens should therefore be restrained from voting the stock in question until plaintiffs have an opportunity to restore the equilibrium of the respective holdings of stock as it existed on July 4, 1892, by subscribing for additional stock. As he has parted with one hundred shares of his new stock a like number of shares of his old stock should be held within the grasp of the law, otherwise he might be able, by voting the one hundred shares of his friend, C. J. Reddig, to control the elections of the corporation. If Mr. Stevens desires to sell all his stock, the decree requiring him to hold at least one hundred shares could easily be moulded so as to require the purchaser to hold the one hundred shares under the same restriction as when they were held by Mr. Stevens.</p>

The stockholders themselves certainly may determine otherwise and order a sale to the public, and payment of-the proceeds into the treasury. But this is exceptional and the exercise of a reserve power which should not be permitted unless' there is a clear intent of the stockholders to do so.</p>
    <p id="b599-3" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[146,654,1170,659]]]'>The issue of stock in the present case was not within this power. It was made by a de facto board on the heels of a disputed election followed by quo warranto proceedings which resulted in ousting them. No opportunity was given the other party or the public to subscribe until after Stevens had taken three hundred and fifty shares which was not only a majority of the new issue but gave him a majority of the whole. The effect was to enable him to control future elections, and thus by his own act, while his party were wrongfully filling office, to change the balance of power and the control of the corporation. There can be no reasonable doubt that this was the intent, though the court did not specifically find that fact, being of opinion that as such was the effect the intent was not material.</p>

No one was present but the de facto officers themselves, who knew their acts were objected to. The other stockholders were absent-in consequence of an injunction issued by the court against holding the election which was.the chief ■ purpose of the meeting.' It is true the injunction did not in terms prohibit the meeting for other purposes, but as every stockholder knew that' the main business was the election which would terminate the long standing contest for control, they had fair justification for supposing that when the election was enjoined there remained nothing to do at the meeting but the formal routine to which no one attached any importance, and therefore for staying away. In view of the circumstances, a court of equity should not hold them bound-by action sprung upon them, without notice, by the opposition who were thus accidentally in control of the meeting.</p>

    <p id="b600-8" data-blocks='[["BL_600.9",600,[289,1321,1169,809]]]'>I most respectfully dissent from the opinion of the chief justice in this case. It assumes the decree is not final, but only has the effect of continuing the preliminary injunction, and deferring final judgment to be entered after further proceedings in the court below. This is a mistake; dismissing defendants’ appeal now has, so far as concerns them, all the force of a final decree; ousts them from any control of the corporate property in which they have invested their money and hold a majority of stock, and places practically the whole in possession of plaintiffs, without the rights of stockholders on part of defendants. And so both parties in the oral argument before us admitted, and both assumed our decree would be in its effect, the end of the contention. Therefore, it seems to me, our duty now clearly is, to end the strife by reviewing the case on its merits, and passing on the questions which determine the parties’ rights.</p>

The evidenceo clearly indicates, the property was wisely and economically managed to. the best interests of all the stockholders, including <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>plaintiffs; they refunded the debt of the corporation by the issue and sale of 350 additional shares of stock. Assuming defendants were but managers de facto, plaintiffs had full information of the proposed corporate action on the 27th of September, 1892. I do not see how they could have had more particular or fuller information than that contained in the affidavit of A. A. Stevens, which it is admitted was read to A. G. Morris that day. Yet the first legal proceedings begun by plaintiffs after the notice were on the 27th of July, 1893, and the second, the filing of this bill, June 28, 1894, and this last is the only one which questions the legality of the additional issue of stock. It appears from the record, that plaintiffs waited more than twenty-one months after notice of the action of the de facto managers before they invoked the restraining power of the court. By that time, all the plans for refunding the corporate debt had been fully carried out; the corporation not only had received defendants’ money for the new stock, but had spent it for the benefit of the corporation and these complaining stockholders. Plaintiffs now claim the issue of the stock and expenditure of the money were illegal, and ask a court of equity to restore the status. In my opinion the bill cannot be maintained, and this court ought, without hesitation, to so say. To do other than this, it seems to me, is to disregard well settled equitable principles. Ashhurst’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/60/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="60 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1014412" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0290-01">60 Pa. 290</a>, and Watt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/78/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="78 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1040425" data-case-paths="/pa/78/0370-01">78 Pa. 370</a>, as well as numerous other cases, hold that as to an act of corporate directors, done with a bona fide intent of benefiting the corporation, the assent of the shareholders who knew of the act will be presumed if they do not gainsay it within a reasonable time; further, when the act involves a large expenditure of money the complaining shareholder must not only dissent, but is bound to promptly follow that up with active preventive measures. He must invoke the power of the courts; he cannot wait until the corporation has reaped the benefit of the alleged illegal act, and then call the officers of the corporation to account, for it is against good conscience that one having power to prevent, should stand by and see corporate managers spend money which may result to his benefit, and afterwards charge them with it. His neglect to act at the proper time effectually bars his right.</p>

Morris, one of these plaintiffs, a director, was present <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>at several meetings of tbe board and dissented, but that was all; the others did not even dissent. After the stock is issued the money paid, and the corporation largely benefited, the plaintiffs ask that the holders of the stock be restrained from exercising under it the rights of bona fide stockholders, and our decree, in its effect, grants their prayer. In my opinion the only just decree we can make is to say they are too late, and direct the dismissal of their bill.</p>
