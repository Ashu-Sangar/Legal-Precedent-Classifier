T., 1896, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Westmoreland Co , November Term, 1893, No. 559, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit upon a promissory note. Before Rayburn, P. J., of the 33d judicial district, especially presiding.\nThe note in suit was as follows:\n[seal] \u201c \u00bf6405\n\u201cI promise to pay to John Lett on demand the sum of four hundred and five pounds sterling, for value received at five per cent.\n\u201cKunkle & Wilson.\n\u201c Sept. 5,1890. Irwin, Pennsylvania, U. S. A.\u201d\nLett was a breeder of horses living in Yorkshire, England. Kunkle & Wilson were importers and dealers in heavy draft horses. The note was executed in England at the time when both Kunkle & Wilson were in Yorkshire for the purpose of buying horses. The defendants testified that Lett was anxious to sell them Cleveland bay horses; that they had refused to buy them, but had agreed to take some of the horses and sell them upon commission. Kunkle, who signed the note, testified to the circumstances under which it was executed as follows:\n\u201c Q. Give us the circumstances under which this paper was signed. A. Why, Mr. Lett came down where we was loading horses, a big lot of horses coming down, one right after the other, and we was placing them, and young Lett came down and says, \u2018 I want you to sign a paper that I have delivered these horses.\u2019 Q. Who was that? A. Young Mr. Lett. Of course I in a hurry signed that paper, and I didn\u2019t read it, and he didn\u2019t read it over, and I just signed it in the confusion. Q. What had he with him ? He had a bottle of ink and pen. . . . Q. Describe the place. A. Well, it is aplace that is very dark; that is down between decks where they loaden horses, and I signed that paper the best I could; I took it to be a receipt. Q. From what he said what did you take it to be ? A. I took it to be a receipt for the delivery of the horses. Q. What did Lett say to you at that time about that paper? A. Well, he said he wanted something to show to his uncle. Q. Well, if anything else in addition to that I wish you to please state it? A. Well, I don\u2019t mind of him saying anything. Q. What, if anything did he say about his wanting you to sign it so quickly, arid down there? A. Well, he said it was his train time and he hadn\u2019t much time. Q. Now, when you signed it where did you lay it? A. Well, I don\u2019t just exactly know; I think I just laid in on a feed trough. Q. Well, you had signed it before Mr. Wilson came up ? A. Just as he started away Mr. Wilson came up to me and asked me what I had signed; I told him I had signed a receipt that the horses were delivered. Q. What did he say? A. He said I ought to be careful what I signed. Q. Well, what became of Lett then ? A. Well, he left the boat at the time in a hurry; that\u2019s the last I\u2019ve saw him. Q. State whether or not there was any conversation there about a note, or payment of interest, or anything of that kind? A. No, sir; there wasn\u2019t anything of the ldnd mentioned at any time. \u201d\nThe court gave binding instructions for plaintiff. Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $2,429.25. Defendants appealed.\nError assigned among others was binding instructions for plaintiff.\nPaul II. Gaither, with him II. P. Laird, John B. Keenan, O. II. Gregg, S. J. Potts, J. A. Marehand and Gyrus E. Woods, for appellants.\nWe contend that the agreement with plaintiff, having been shown by the evidence of Kunkle and Wilson, they had the right at the trial to avail themselves of whatever defense is fairly deducible therefrom: Peter v.
