This Court suspended him from the practice of law on December 30, 1987, and referred the matter to the Disciplinary Board pursuant to Rule 214(f), Pa.R.D.E. Because the Board\u2019s original recommended sanction of a four-year suspension has already been served, I see no reason to disagree with Mr. Driggs\u2019 reinstatement to the practice of law in this Commonwealth at this time.",
