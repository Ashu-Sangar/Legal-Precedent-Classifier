        "text": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThese are consolidated appeals from orders of the Commonwealth Court. We begin by briefly recounting the facts and procedural history of the separate cases.\nNo. 86 W.D. Appeal Docket 1990\nOn July 12, 1984, the vehicle that Frederick Schramm was driving was struck from behind by a vehicle driven by an employee of the Allegheny County Sanitation Authority (ALCOSAN). As the accident occurred while Schramm was in the course of his employment, he received worker\u2019s compensation payments from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the carrier for Carson-Pirie-Scott, his employer. Schramm and his wife filed a complaint against ALCOSAN in December of 1985, alleging the negligence of ALCOSAN\u2019s employee and asserting loss of earnings, pain and suffering, medical expenses, and loss of consortium. At a pre-trial conference in January of 1988, the Schramms agreed to settle the claims for $45,000. Carson-Pirie-Scott and Liberty Mutual claimed a right of subrogation against the proceeds of the settlement under Section 319 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 671. Acting on a Petition to Distribute Proceeds of Settlement, common pleas court ordered that the proceeds be distributed to Liberty Mutual, and Commonwealth Court affirmed. 131 Pa.Cmwlth. 126, 569 A.2d 994.\nNo. 190 E.D. Appeal Docket 1990\nOn September 2, 1983, Richard Hankee, a pipe fitter employed by Honeywell, Inc., was injured while working at the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, a municipal authority formed by Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties. Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, Honeywell\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, paid Hankee benefits pursuant to the Act. In November of 1984, Hankee and his wife filed a complaint against the Airport alleging the negligence of the Airport as a cause of his injuries and asserting loss of earnings and earning capacity, medical expenses, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of consortium. Aetna, asserting Honeywell\u2019s right of subrogation to Hankee\u2019s rights against the Airport to the extent of compensation paid, filed a Petition to Intervene, which the common pleas court denied. Commonwealth Court reversed, 131 Pa.Cmwlth. 668, 571 A.2d 13, on the authority of that court\u2019s en banc decision in Schramm.\nThe controlling question common to these appeals is whether compensation paid pursuant to the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act constitutes \u201cbenefits under a policy of insurance\u201d in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8553(d). That section of the Governmental Immunity Subchapter of the Judicial Code provides\nIf a claimant receives or is entitled to receive benefits under a policy of insurance other than a life insurance policy as a result of losses for which damages are recoverable under subsection (c), the amount of such benefits shall be deducted from the amount of damages which would otherwise be recoverable by such claimant.\nThe Schramms and the Hankees argue that worker\u2019s compensation does constitute \u201cbenefits under a policy of insurance.\u201d From this, they further argue that Section 8553(d) would bar recovery of these amounts in their actions against the government agencies, and thus such amounts would not constitute any part of their settlements or judgments. Accordingly, the Schramms conclude that Liberty Mutual has no right of subrogation against the proceeds of their settlement with ALCOSAN, and the Hankees conclude that Aetna had no right to intervene in their action against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport.\nBoth appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding ignores the rules of statutory construction. According to the appellants, the plain language of Section 8553(d) requires that worker\u2019s compensation benefits be deducted from any award against a municipal government. This argument is supplemented by reference to the rule that the express statement of exceptions in a statute shall be construed to exclude any other exceptions, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1924, thus the conclusion that the exception for life insurance policy benefits precludes the finding of an exception for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The appellants also note the rules that the legislature is presumed to favor the public interest as against any private interest, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(5), and that Section 8553, being the statute latest in date of final enactment, should prevail, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1936.\nThese arguments are inadequate, for they rest on the facile premise, which almost amounts to begging the question, that Section 8553(d) applies whenever the plaintiff can be compensated with funds that cover the type of loss that occurred. Yet it is quite apparent that Section 8553(d) makes no reference whatsoever to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act or benefits payable thereunder, and there are many plausible distinctions between insurance policy benefits and worker\u2019s compensation benefits received by an employee, even where the latter payments are made by an insurance carrier pursuant to a policy with an employer.\nAs the appellees note, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act does not define the compensation received by injured employees as insurance, and several cases have observed, in broad context, that the Act does not render employers insurers of the life and health of their employees. See, e.g., Monahan v. Seeds & Durham, 336 Pa. 67, 6 A.2d 889 (1939). Rather, it has been recognized from the outset that the Act is remedial social legislation, which substitutes a relatively quick and inexpensive scheme to provide certain compensation for lost earnings, in place of the common law process under which any damages would be recoverable only after a suit against the appropriate parties, subject to available defenses and, of course, any expenses and delays inherent in the system. Under this scheme, employees are able to obtain compensation without regard to fault \u2014 either their own, that of a third party, or even the lack of fault on the part of the employer\u2014 while employers are subject to payment of benefits at a set rate, receive immunity from being otherwise subjected to liability for damages, and have a right of subrogation to the extent of compensation paid in the event a third party is held responsible for the injury. Although an employer may secure its obligation to pay compensation by contracting with an insurer, and an injured employee may receive payments directly from the insurance carrier, in determining the nature of the benefits it cannot be ignored that the employer is obligated to provide the compensation without regard to the obtaining of insurance, and if insurance is obtained it is the employer, not the employee, that is the insured.\nThe appellants also argue that allowing the workers\u2019 compensation carriers to be subrogated to their rights against the municipalities would be inconsistent with the nature of subrogation. The Schramms rely on the fact that a subrogee\u2019s claim is no greater than that of the party to whose rights he is subrogated. Since Schramm is barred by Section 8553(d) from recovering as damages any amount received as workers\u2019 compensation benefits, the subrogee can assert no interest in the money paid in settlement of the claim. The Hankees argue in a similar vein that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding produces the absurd result that any verdict against a municipality would be reduced by the amount of compensation received, yet the plaintiff would still be subject to the workers\u2019 compensation subrogation, thus having his recovery reduced a second time.\nThe flaw in these arguments is that, again, they beg the question. They assume that workers\u2019 compensation payments are \u201cbenefits under a policy of insurance\u201d for purposes of Section 8553(d). The Schramms\u2019 argument is correct as far as it goes, but it does nothing to establish why a judgment against a municipality should be reduced by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation payments received. The Hankees\u2019 argument is further flawed in that it fails to follow the assumption through to its logical conclusion. If a plaintiff does not recover these damages from the third party tortfeasor/municipality, the employer (or its insurance carrier) has nothing to be subrogated to. Thus there is no second reduction of the recovery and no absurd result as argued. Conversely, if a plaintiff can recover these damages from the municipality, there is no reason why the employer (or its insurance carrier) should be denied the subrogation right provided in Section 319 of the Act.\nFinally, the appellants argue that Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation is contrary to the purpose of Section 8553(d). That purpose, they assert, is to limit municipalities\u2019 exposure to liability, placing the interest in preserving tax-generated, public funds over any individual\u2019s interest in the total amount of compensation received for any loss and, more particularly, over the interests of insurance companies, which receive premiums to protect against such losses. Under the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis, the municipality would be required to pay damages to the plaintiff, who would then be required to relinquish to the employer (or its insurance carrier) the amount received by way of workers\u2019 compensation, thus shifting the burden for these damages from the employer (or its insurance earner) to the municipality. The appellants argue that it would be more consistent with the purpose of Section 8553(d) to hold that since the damages were covered by payments from a collateral source, they cannot be recovered from the municipality.\nThe appellants offer an additional reason why this interpretation of Section 8553(d) runs contrary to the purpose of protecting municipal funds, asserting that it will increase both the damages claimable against municipalities and the amounts awarded as damages, with a corresponding decrease in the incentive for plaintiffs to settle their cases. The appellees respond by noting that the appellants in fact did claim damages for loss of earnings and earning capacity in their complaints. They also point out that this argument is pure speculation made in a vacuum, with no evidence to suggest the untoward consequences argued by the appellants. Finally, they observe that the municipal authorities, which one would think would have a greater interest in making this argument, did not assert in their Answers that Section 8553(d) barred recovery of those sums that had been paid by workers\u2019 compensation.\nAlthough it must be conceded that Section 8553(d) demonstrates an intention on the part of the legislature to relieve municipalities of the obligation to pay for damages where certain other compensation is available, upon review we are convinced that this intention does not extend to workers\u2019 compensation payments. As the Commonwealth Court stated, the payments an injured employee receives are not themselves insurance benefits, they are an obligation imposed by statute on the employer. When an employer obtains insurance to secure the risk that it will have to make such payments, it guarantees a source for the payment of such benefits, but this does not change the nature of the payments due the employee.\nNeither can the fact that the employer\u2019s obligation is, pursuant to contract, fulfilled by an insurance company be determinative of whether the payments are \u201cbenefits under a policy of insurance.\u201d Otherwise, we would be sanctioning a distinction between employers that are able to and choose to remain self-insured and those who insure their obligation under the Act. In the former case, an employee would be able to recover damages from the municipality and the employer would be able to exercise its subrogation right. In the latter case, the employee would not be able to recover from the municipality, and the employer (and its insurer) would have no right of subrogation. In Brown v. Travelers Insurance Company, 434 Pa. 507, 514, 254 A.2d 27, 29 (1969), a case decided before the Act was amended to specifically so provide, we held that an employer\u2019s insurance carrier is immune from suit as is the employer, a holding we found necessary to avoid \u201ca regrettable discrimination ... between employers who are insured by the state Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund or are self-insuring employers and those who carry private insurance.\u201d\nOne of the trade-offs that makes imposition of the obligation to pay compensation without regard to fault more equitable is the right granted to the employer to recoup payments where the employee is later able to obtain compensation from a third party. Even if it could do so without violating constitutional requirements of equal protection, a point on which we express no opinion, we believe that if the legislature had intended to deprive certain employers (those that insure their obligations) of this important statutory right in cases where the third party was a local government agency, shifting the burden of such losses from the municipality to the employer, it would have used specific language addressing the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Given that there exists a simpler, reasoned explanation under which both Section 8553(d) of the Judicial Code and Section 319 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act can be read without doing violence to either, the construction urged by the appellants must be rejected.\nThe orders of the Commonwealth Court are affirmed.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the decision of of these cases.\n. The total of the compensation paid was $70,449.96. Reduced by a no-fault insurance credit of $15,000, the employer/carrier asserted subrogation rights in the amount of $55,449.96.\n. Section 319 provides in relevant part\nWhere the compensable injury is caused in whole or in part by the act or omission of a third party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe ... against such third party to the extent of the compensation payable under this article by the employer....\n. The compensation paid totalled $78,463.73, consisting of $58,446.00 in wage loss benefits and $20,117.73 in medical benefits.\n. Subsection (c) reads\n(c) Types of losses recognized. \u2014 Damages shall be recoverable only for:\n(1) Past and future earnings and earning capacity.\n(2) Pain and suffering in the following instances:\n(i) death; or\n(ii) only in cases of permanent loss of a bodily function, permanent disfigurement or permanent dismemberment where the medical expenses referred to in paragraph (3) are in excess of $1,500.\n(3) Medical and dental expenses including the reasonable value of reasonable and necessary medical and dental services, prosthetic devices and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing, and physical therapy expenses accrued and anticipated in the diagnosis, care and recovery of the claimant.\n(4) Loss of consortium.\n(5) Loss of support.\n(6) Property losses.\n. It should be noted that this rule of construction by its terms applies only where two statutes are \"irreconcilable,\" making its application out of place with the remainder of the appellants\u2019 argument that the statutes may be read together.\n. Indeed, the unique nature of the system of workers\u2019 compensation is evidenced by the fact that it was necessary to amend the Constitution of the Commonwealth to give the General Assembly authority to enact it. See Pa. Const., Art. Ill, Sec. 18.\n. The appellees also note that the Act does not require an employer to insure its liability, and in fact many employers are self-insured with respect to their obligations under the Act. If benefits received pursuant to the Act were deemed \"benefits under a policy of insurance\" simply because they were traceable to an insurance policy, a discrimination would develop between employers that insure their obligations and those that are self-insured. According to the appellants\u2019 literal analysis, benefits paid directly by the employer would not fall under the exclusion of Section 8553(d), would not be deductible from any award or settlement against a municipality, and would be subject to the employer\u2019s statutory right of subrogation.\n. In fact, ALCOSAN specifically asserted in Paragraph 10 of its Answer that the Schramms could recover certain damages under the then extant No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, and that they were either not entitled to recover this amount from ALCOSAN or that ALCOSAN was entitled to a set-off of this amount from any verdict. It did not, however, make the same argument with respect to any workers\u2019 compensation benefits received.",
