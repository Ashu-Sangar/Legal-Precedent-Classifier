The School District of the Borough of Wilkinsburg refused to collect the tax on amounts collected at local football games. The borough brought an <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>action in mandamus against the school district to compel its compliance with the ordinance. While the legality of the tax was unquestioned, the enabling legislation granting authority to the borough to levy the tax did not grant it the power to compel another agency of the Commonwealth to collect the taxes. We held that a municipality cannot impose the duty of collecting a tax levied by the municipality upon any other political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth without express statutory consent.</p>

The resolution adopted by the school district imposed the responsibility for collection of the tax and the filing of monthly returns upon the operators of the lots.</p>
    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.6",673,[157,1331,1156,528]]]'>We concluded that the school district did not have the authority to impose the duty to collect the parking tax on the county itself. We then examined whether the corporation that operated the parking facilities on behalf of the county under a written management agreement was also exempt from the duty to collect the parking tax. We held that the exemption for political subdivisions or agencies of the Commonwealth extends to individuals or entities performing a government activity as a governmental servant or agent. In holding that the managing operator was exempt, we stated:</p>

It would be easy to adopt the simple test that any governmental activity carried out by anyone (or any entity) at governmental behest or under governmental regulation is insulated under <em>Borough of Wilkinsburg </em>(or some other such immunity) and that such a person or entity be construed as an employee, servant, or, <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>at least, as an agent, of the Commonwealth or one of its political subdivisions for such purposes.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b674-4" data-blocks='[["BL_674.5",674,[276,434,1121,905]]]'>In modern times, however, that would be going too far. In the Nineteenth Century, state action and private action were concepts clearly distinct and separate. But today, “the growth and proliferation of public works and controls have increasingly reduced ‘state’ and ‘private’ action to the conceptual end points on a broad and lengthy bond of government and private joint ventures.” Abernathy, <em>Civil Rights </em>(West.Publ.Co.1980), p. 66. Who, one hundred years ago, for example, could have envisioned that a county government would participate in the private sector to the extent that it would establish a vast parking lot system next to a large international airport? Since many private sector activities today are touched by government involvement, investment, participation or regulation, we think that a more careful analysis is necessary to determine whether a person or entity is acting as a governmental agent or employee for purposes of <em>Borough of Wilkinsburg.</em>
