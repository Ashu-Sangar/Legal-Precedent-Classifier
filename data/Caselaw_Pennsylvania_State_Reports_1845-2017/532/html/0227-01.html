As a result of that evaluation, he was diagnosed as suffering from a paranoid personality disorder. On May 7, 1987, Appellee was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one to five years. Subsequently, Appellee filed a motion <em>nunc pro tunc </em>for reconsideration of his right to raise post-verdict motions. The basis asserted was that as a result of his condition, he was not responsible for his conduct which resulted in his flight. This motion was denied on October 19, 1987. On appeal to the Superior Court, a three judge panel, in addressing the trial court’s denial of reconsideration of post verdict motions <em>nunc pro tunc </em>and the Order forfeiting bail, found these rulings to be error and remanded the matter to the trial court. The Order remanded by the three judge panel directed that: a) the judgment of sentence be vacated; b) the <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>Order of the trial court of October 14,1987 be reversed; c) the post-trial motions be reinstated; and d) the Order of the Court of Common Pleas dated November 27, 1987 be reversed. The two issues instantly raised on appeal for our resolution are: 1) Whether the Superior Court properly reversed the decision of the trial court denying reconsideration of Appellee’s post-verdict motions <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>and 2) Whether the Superior Court properly determined that the trial court committed error by first revoking Appellee’s bail, then subsequent to his capture, amending the Order to require a partial forfeiture of his posted bail. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

While we approve of the rationale and result of <em>McDonald </em>in that case, we believe its facts are sufficiently distinguishable from the instant matter, to find that it is not controlling. While the defendant in <em>McDonald </em>breached his condition of bail by failing to appear, he was technically not a fugitive. Rather than being an escaped prisoner, he was in the custody of federal prison authorities in Indiana. Thus, the Commonwealth filed a detainer with the federal authorities which allowed McDonald to be removed to a prison in the Commonwealth pending his new trial on the Pennsylvania charges.

The Superior Court in substituting its own judgment for that of the trial court stated: “We fail to see that the <em>interests of justice </em>require enforcement of a bail forfeiture....” <em>Commonwealth v. Chopak, </em>No. 706 Harrisburg, 1987, slip op. at 11 (Pa.Superior Court, November 1, 1988) [<a href="/citations/?q=385%20Pa.%20Super.%20646" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="385 Pa.

That statement implicitly recognizes that to promote “the interests of justice,” bail forfeiture would be an available remedy pursuant to an amended order, given the right reasons. The Superior Court erred, however, in rejecting the reasons given by the trial court and by substituting its own opinion that Appellee’s alleged mental impairment was sufficient to shield him from suffering the consequences of his action. We expressly rejected that rationale in resolving the first issue presented herein.</p>

Once captured and returned, the trial court in its capacity as fact finder, thoroughly considered Appellee’s proffered excuse of mental illness and promptly rejected its consideration as a mitigating factor. In reversing the trial court, the Superior Court failed to give the trial court’s determination of credibility due deference and improperly substituted its judgment for that of the trial court. Accordingly, the Order of the Superior Court is reversed.</p>

That case primarily concerns a defendant’s fitness to proceed to trial after he made what was referred to as a "bona fide” suicide attempt. Instantly, however, there has never been a formal challenge raised regarding Appellee’s competence to stand trial or to be sentenced. Drope, therefore is inapplicable as the issue presently before us is whether Appellee's "mental status” was a sufficiently compelling reason <em>to excuse his flight. </em>Furthermore, the trial court rejected Appellees’ excuse of mental illness after thoroughly considering the evidence presented. Accordingly, such a finding may not be disturbed unless the record fails to support such a conclusion. <em>Commonwealth v.

Another matter for consideration, although not briefed or raised by the parties, concerns the Superior Court's comments regarding Appellee’s (Appellant below), alleged failure to provide a complete record to the Superior Court. In reversing the trial court the Superior Court went on to add "[w]here as here, there is no complete record to review, we are constrained by the deficiencies of the record to vacate the judgment of sentence." Superior Court slip op. at 7-8. This is an incorrect and inappropriate standard of review.

Revocation of bail simply denies an individual defendant the opportunity to remain outside of custody pending the outcome of his judicial process. Bail forfeiture is a process whereby an individual defendant surrenders part or all of his bond and is appropriate when he breaches a condition of his bail. <em>See </em>Pa. R.Crim.P.Rule 4016(A)(1)(a). Appellee, by fleeing the jurisdiction prior to sentencing, rendered himself subject to the forfeiture consequence. To suggest that by virtue of issuing a preliminary order requiring bail "revocation" the trial court is somehow precluded from subsequently issuing an order of partial forfeiture is to fail to recognize the broad powers available to a court in order to promote justice. This position would effectively negate the option of bail revocation anytime a court seeks to regain custody of a defendant and would force a bail forfeiture on every occasion.</p>
