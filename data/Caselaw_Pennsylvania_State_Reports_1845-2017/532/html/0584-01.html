The natural water course of the stream, retained since 1890, runs through the appellees land. The former owner of appellees’ land, a railroad company, built a culvert to contain and transport the flow of water in the old natural water course as it passed through its land. This culvert has since been sealed off. If the dam were to be breached and the culvert not reopened, the water would have to cut a new channel on its way downstream to the Little Sewickley Creek.</p>

In the alternative, appellants sought a declaration that they were “upper riparians” so that appellees would have the burden of providing a course for the stream and appellants would not be responsible for any resulting damage.</p>

The court, however, did not directly address appellants’ easement argument based on riparian rights. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, concluding that any claim of easement or prescriptive easement must fail because the evidence established that no water had flowed past the dam since 1945. <a href="/citations/?q=385%20Pa.%20Super.%20660" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="385 Pa.

First, as upper riparians, they possess an inalienable right to breach the dam situated on their property whenever it is no longer beneficial “to the upper riparian as well as to the public in general.” Appellants’ Brief at p. 8. Second, appellants raise an argument based on the deeds by which appellees, or their predecessors in title, took their land. They contend that all parties involved took title to their properties <em>after </em>construction of the dam. Thus, they argue, there was “constructive, if not actual, notice as to the possibility of the re-establishment of the old natural water course should the dam become breached.” Appellants’ Brief at p. 9. Additional evidence of notice, they allege, is found within the deeds by which the lower land owners and their predecessors in title took their parcels. Appellants also stress that they are seek<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>ing relief not merely for their own benefit but to alleviate a serious health threat caused by the pollution of the neighboring water sources.</p>

Evidence had been introduced at trial of the increase in flowage as well as the sources and uses of the increased water. No facts such as those are before this Court; therefore, we cannot make a determination of the respective rights of the parties. In this case, the water is not from a foreign source but instead is water that has accumulated on appellants’ property and now perhaps creates a grave health risk.</p>

The complaint refers to a spillway. The nature of this spillway is not fully explained. These and other questions must be answered in an adversarial fact finding trial, not on appeal with only an inadequate record. The appellant must be given the opportunity to present the evidence available and the appropriate place is in the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
