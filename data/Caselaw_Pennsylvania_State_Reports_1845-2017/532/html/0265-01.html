At approximately 5:30 p.m. on this day Gordon Russell was walking south on North Lambert Street towards Norris Street <a id="p273" href="#p273" data-label="273" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*273</a>on his way home from a store located on Diamond Street. As Gordon Russell crossed North Lambert Street, the appellant came running down North Lambert Street from behind Gordon Russell and began shooting a .38 calibre revolver at Erica Riggins who had stopped her blue Cadillac in the middle of North Lambert Street just south of Gordon Russell. Gordon Russell suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the back as he passed between appellant and the blue Cadillac. Immediately after Gordon Russell was shot, Erica Riggins fled the scene in her Cadillac with the appellant in pursuit on foot. A warrant was issued for appellant’s arrest on April 12, 1987. After appellant could not be located, this matter was assigned to the Philadelphia Police Fugitive Squad, which arrested him on April 24, 1987 in a different neighborhood.</p>
    <p id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[199,1055,1154,463]]]'>The Commonwealth presented the testimony of Kevin Harrell, who stated that appellant was at the scene on North Lambert Street and was holding a gun as he moved south towards Gordon Russell, Erica Riggins and the blue Cadillac. Kevin Harrell further testified that after he heard gunshots he saw Gordon Russell fall to the ground to the right of the blue Cadillac and in front of and to the right of appellant. Kevin Harrell noticed no gunshots being fired by the occupants of the blue Cadillac.</p>
    <p id="b439-6" data-blocks='[["BL_439.6",439,[198,1545,1153,633]]]'>The Commonwealth also presented the testimony of Catherine Rivers, who stated that she watched the homicide take place while she was looking out a second floor window of her residence in search of her children who had gone to the store. Catherine Rivers stated that a young boy had come running around the corner shooting at a blue car parked in the street. Catherine Rivers further testified that no gunshots were fired by the occupants of the blue car and that Gordon Russell had crumpled over a vehicle adjacent to the blue car when the shots were fired. While Catherine Rivers did not see the face of the shooter, appellant matched the physical description that she gave to the police.</p>

Furthermore, the jury could infer motive for this shooting from the evidence presented, as Erica Riggins had harassed and severely injured appellant’s girlfriend, Jean Hargrove, two days before the murder. Jean Hargrove was seven months pregnant with appellant’s child at that time.</p>
    <p id="b440-5" data-blocks='[["BL_440.5",440,[245,714,1164,789]]]'>The appellant did not testify on his behalf, but presented four witnesses who claimed to have been eyewitnesses to the shooting. These witnesses all testified that Erica Riggins had fired several shots at appellant and had killed Gordon Russell. However, these witnesses each described different scenarios for the shooting, none of them saw appellant with a gun, and none of them came forward with information regarding the shooting until less than a week before trial. Clearly, it was up to the jury to evaluate the credibility of these witnesses and determine whether to believe all, part, or none of their testimony. <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em><a href="/pa/521/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="521 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1817452" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0134-01">521 Pa. 134</a>, <a href="/pa/521/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="521 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="1817452" data-case-paths="/pa/521/0134-01">555 A.2d 818</a> (1989).

The jury found that appellant <em>did </em>intend to kill and <em>did </em>kill, and he has no basis to compare himself with those who did not. One who intentionally kills, but whose fatal blow falls on a mistaken victim, is if anything <em>more </em>culpable than murderers who do not carelessly kill innocent bystanders. This type of murder, is unquestionably not merely “fortuitous” as thoughtlessly labeled by counsel. It is not the product of chance or accident. Nor is it unforeseeable, unexpected or without known cause, but rather, it is the product of a heart turned not only against the intended victim but also against all those anonymous but within range of the murder weapon.</p>

The penalty of death has been imposed in this Commonwealth on numerous occasions under similar circumstances. It is a penalty which has also been imposed on those who do not kill, but aid or direct others in so doing. <em>Commonwealth v.

In this ease, the threshold inquiry is whether the argument that the attorney has failed to raise and the argument he did raise were of arguable merit. There is no question that there was no merit to the attorney’s arguing to the jury that the defendant was innocent, particularly because it detracted from the argument that the defendant was under extreme emotional duress at the time of the killing. By making two mutually <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>exclusive arguments — that he did not commit the murder and that he did commit it while under extreme duress — defense counsel created the real possibility that the jury would accept neither argument. Additionally, the limited argument by counsel regarding the “extreme duress” mitigating factor prejudiced the defendant. The trial court found, in its opinion in support of its denial of post-trial motions, that Erica Higgins had cut Jean Hargrove (who was seven months pregnant with the defendant’s child) with a knife and that the defendant was aware that Ms. Hargrove was in danger of suffering a miscarriage as a result of the fight. <em>Commonwealth v.

The argument of defense counsel was ineffective and lacking any merit, there was no reasonable basis for it, and it prejudiced the defendant. Therefore, I would vacate the sentence imposed and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing pursuant to the Death Penalty Statute, 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(h)(4).</p>
