At the time of the support hearing in this matter in January of 1989, a divorce action was pending. Prior to separation, Reginald had attended three semesters of college at Pennsylvania State University. However, the emotional trauma of his parents’ separation caused him to take a leave of absence during his second year at Penn State.</p>

Reginald’s mother is also employed by the college, as a secretary, with an annual gross income of approximately $12,000.00. Prior to separation, while Reginald was attending Penn State, all college expenses were paid for by Reginald’s parents from their joint incomes. Reginald’s parents did not require him to seek any financial assistance for his college education. Although in his brief Reginald disputes any plan to fund his college education, if necessary, through lifetime investments made by his parents, his father presented uncontradicted testimony that he and Reginald’s mother had saved funds through stock purchases and individual retirement accounts to pay for Reginald’s college education as well as any post graduate education.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

His father seemed to argue that Reginald would have realized approximately $4,000.00 if he had not spent much of his money on his girlfriend, while Reginald testified that he only saved $2,200.00 after paying his car payment, automobile insurance and food expenses incurred while working 12-hour shifts at Dorney Park.</p>

The father then left his son and the marital residence and moved into his new home with his girlfriend and her two minor children where the father pays all the monthly living expenses except for the girlfriend’s car payment and her medical expenses.

In reversing both the Superior Court and the trial court, which had dismissed the mother’s claim for educational expenses, we were persuaded by the fact that the father had entered into an agreement to pay educational expenses. We did not unequivocally adopt a legal principle that a parent has a legal obligation to provide college expenses but rather permitted recovery of college expenses if a parent had the financial ability to do so, because the parties’ agreement had required that result.

Although several states have imposed a statutory duty upon a parent to provide college educational support for a child no longer considered a minor, (see i.e. Ind.Code Ann. 31-1-11.5-12 and 40 Ill.Rev.Stat. Section 513) our General Assembly has not. Accordingly, since no legal duty has been imposed by our legislature, nor have we developed such a duty by our case law, we decline to do so. Since our legislature has taken an active role in domestic matters through amendments and reenactment of the Divorce Code and the Domestic Relations Act, we feel the more prudent course is to await guidance from that body rather than creating duties and obligations by judicial pronouncement.</p>

In many instances, high school students reach their 18th birthday prior to graduation from high school. It would make no sense to terminate a support order while a child is attending high school. The rigors of high school are difficult enough without worrying about how a child is going to support himself for the remaining days of his high school education. Therefore, notwithstanding a child reaching majority at age 18, a parental duty of support is owed until a child reaches 18 or graduates from high school, whichever event occurs later. <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>This will ensure that children have a minimum education in order to prepare them for the challenges of life.</p>
