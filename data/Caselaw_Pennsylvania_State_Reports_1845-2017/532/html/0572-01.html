Given the effectiveness of group <em>voir dire </em>in this case, there was no “gross and palpable” abuse here. Thus, the refusal of the trial court to allow individual <em>voir dire, </em>under the circumstances presented in this case, was not an abuse of its discretion in selecting between alternative methods of <em>voir dire.</em>

In effect, the majority holds that, if group <em>voir dire </em>is effective in achieving its goal of ferreting out racial biases or inclinations, then group <em>voir dire </em>is not appropriate and the alternative method, individual <em>voir dire, </em>must be utilized. Whereas, if there is no evidence that group <em>voir dire </em>was effective (e.g., if none of the prospective jurors admitted racial bias), then group <em>voir dire </em>is proper.</p>

If the desired result is to remove that discretion from the trial judge and abolish group <em>voir dire, </em>the proper method to reach that result is to amend the Rules of Criminal Procedure — not to manipulate the facts in order to create situations, such as this, in which the trial court really has no choice. Because the <a id="p582" href="#p582" data-label="582" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*582</a>Rules specifically provide for either group or individual <em>voir dire </em>at the trial court’s discretion and because I believe that group <em>voir dire </em>was sufficient to expose racial biases and inclinations in this case, I would affirm.</p>
