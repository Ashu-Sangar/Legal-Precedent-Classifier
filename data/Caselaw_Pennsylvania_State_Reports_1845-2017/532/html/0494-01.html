Accordingly, the Schramms conclude that Liberty Mutual has no right of subrogation against the proceeds of their settlement with ALCOSAN, and the Hankees conclude that Aetna had no right to intervene in their action against the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport.</p>
    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.5",665,[175,648,1154,795]]]'>Both appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court’s holding ignores the rules of statutory construction. According to the appellants, the plain language of Section 8553(d) requires that worker’s compensation benefits be deducted from any award against a municipal government. This argument is supplemented by reference to the rule that the express statement of exceptions in a statute shall be construed to exclude any other exceptions, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1924, thus the conclusion that the exception for life insurance policy benefits precludes the finding of an exception for worker’s compensation benefits. The appellants also note the rules that the legislature is presumed to favor the public interest as against any private interest, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(5), and that Section 8553, being the statute latest in date of final enactment, should prevail, see 1 Pa.C.S. § 1936.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.6",665,[174,1465,1156,586]]]'>These arguments are inadequate, for they rest on the facile premise, which almost amounts to begging the question, that Section 8553(d) applies whenever the plaintiff can be compensated with funds that cover the type of loss that occurred. Yet it is quite apparent that Section 8553(d) makes no reference whatsoever to the Workmen’s Compensation Act or benefits payable thereunder, and there are many plausible distinctions between insurance policy benefits and worker’s compensation benefits received by an employee, even where the latter payments are made by an insurance carrier pursuant to a policy with an employer.</p>

See, e.g., <em>Monahan v. Seeds &amp; Durham, </em><a href="/pa/336/0067-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="336 Pa. 67" data-case-ids="1195583" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0067-01">336 Pa. 67</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20A.2d%20889" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 A.2d 889">6 A.2d 889</a> (1939). Rather, it has been recognized from the outset that the Act is remedial social legislation, which substitutes a relatively quick and inexpensive scheme to provide certain compensation for lost earnings, in place of the common law process under which any damages would be recoverable only after a suit against the appropriate parties, subject to available defenses and, of course, any expenses and delays inherent in the system.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Under this scheme, employees are able to obtain compensation without regard to fault — either their own, that of a third party, or even the lack of fault on the part of the employer— while employers are subject to payment of benefits at a set rate, receive immunity from being otherwise subjected to liability for damages, and have a right of subrogation to the extent of compensation paid in the event a third party is held responsible for the injury. Although an employer may secure its obligation to pay compensation by contracting with an insurer, and an injured employee may receive payments directly from the insurance carrier, in determining the nature of the benefits it cannot be ignored that the employer is obligated to provide the compensation without regard to the obtaining of insurance, and if insurance is obtained it is the employer, not the employee, that is the insured.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

      <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>The appellants also argue that allowing the workers’ compensation carriers to be subrogated to their rights against the municipalities would be inconsistent with the nature of subrogation. The Schramms rely on the fact that a subrogee’s claim is no greater than that of the party to whose rights he is subrogated. Since Schramm is barred by Section 8553(d) from recovering as damages any amount received as workers’ compensation benefits, the subrogee can assert no interest in the money paid in settlement of the claim. The Hankees argue in a similar vein that the Commonwealth Court’s holding produces the absurd result that any verdict against a municipality would be reduced by the amount of compensation received, yet the plaintiff would still be subject to the workers’ compensation subrogation, thus having his recovery reduced a second time.</p>
    <p id="b667-4" data-blocks='[["BL_667.5",667,[163,1120,1160,893]]]'>The flaw in these arguments is that, again, they beg the question. They assume that workers’ compensation payments are “benefits under a policy of insurance” for purposes of Section 8553(d). The Schramms’ argument is correct as far as it goes, but it does nothing to establish why a judgment against a municipality should be reduced by the amount of workers’ compensation payments received. The Hankees’ argument is further flawed in that it fails to follow the assumption through to its logical conclusion. If a plaintiff does not recover these damages from the third party tortfeasor/municipality, the employer (or its insurance carrier) has nothing to be subrogated to. Thus there is no second reduction of the recovery and no absurd result as argued. Conversely, if a plaintiff can recover these damages from the municipality, there is no reason why the employer (or its insurance carrier) should be denied the subrogation right provided in Section 319 of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b667-5" data-blocks='[["BL_667.6",667,[164,2039,1155,316]],["BL_668.1",668,[225,311,1162,633]]]'>Finally, the appellants argue that Commonwealth Court’s interpretation is contrary to the purpose of Section 8553(d). That purpose, they assert, is to limit municipalities’ exposure to liability, placing the interest in preserving tax-generated, public funds over any individual’s interest in the total amount of compensation received for any loss and, more particularly, <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>over the interests of insurance companies, which receive premiums to protect against such losses. Under the Commonwealth Court’s analysis, the municipality would be required to pay damages to the plaintiff, who would then be required to relinquish to the employer (or its insurance carrier) the amount received by way of workers’ compensation, thus shifting the burden for these damages from the employer (or its insurance earner) to the municipality. The appellants argue that it would be more consistent with the purpose of Section 8553(d) to hold that since the damages were covered by payments from a collateral source, they cannot be recovered from the municipality.</p>
    <p id="b668-4" data-blocks='[["BL_668.5",668,[221,964,1165,851]]]'>The appellants offer an additional reason why this interpretation of Section 8553(d) runs contrary to the purpose of protecting municipal funds, asserting that it will increase both the damages claimable against municipalities and the amounts awarded as damages, with a corresponding decrease in the incentive for plaintiffs to settle their cases. The appellees respond by noting that the appellants in fact did claim damages for loss of earnings and earning capacity in their complaints. They also point out that this argument is pure speculation made in a vacuum, with no evidence to suggest the untoward consequences argued by the appellants. Finally, they observe that the municipal authorities, which one would think would have a greater interest in making this argument, did not assert in their Answers that Section 8553(d) barred recovery of those sums that had been paid by workers’ compensation.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a>

As the Commonwealth Court stated, the payments an injured employee receives are not themselves insurance benefits, they are an obligation imposed by statute on the employer. When an employer obtains insurance to secure the risk that it will have to make such payments, it guarantees a source for the payment of such benefits, but this does not change the nature of the payments due the employee.</p>

In the former case, an employee would be able to recover damages from the municipality and the employer would be able to exercise its subrogation right. In the latter case, the employee would not be able to recover from the municipality, and the employer (and its insurer) would have no right of subrogation. In <em>Brown v. Travelers Insurance Company, </em><a href="/pa/434/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="434 Pa. 507" data-case-ids="1922617" data-case-paths="/pa/434/0507-01">434 Pa. 507</a>, 514, <a href="/citations/?q=254%20A.2d%2027" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="254 A.2d 27">254 A.2d 27</a>, 29 (1969), a case decided before the Act was amended to specifically so provide, we held that an employer’s insurance carrier is immune from suit as is the employer, a holding we found necessary to avoid “a regrettable discrimination ... between employers who are insured by the state Workmen’s Insurance Fund or are self-insuring employers and those who carry private insurance.”</p>

Even if it could do so without violating constitutional requirements of equal protection, a point on which we express no opinion, we believe that if the legislature had intended to deprive certain employers (those that insure their obligations) of this important statutory right in cases where the third party was a local government agency, shifting the burden of such losses from the municipality to the employer, it would <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>have used specific language addressing the Workmen’s Compensation Act.
