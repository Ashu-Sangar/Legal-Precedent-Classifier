A preliminary hearing was scheduled for September 22, 1988. Prior to the preliminary hearing, Mr. Hess retained William C.

The Commonwealth alleged that it was common knowledge that the law firm required the payment of a retainer prior to representation of any criminal defendant. The Commonwealth further alleged that its investigation disclosed that Mr. Hess did not have any visible means of amassing the amount of money necessary for payment of the required retainer other than funds derived from drug trafficking, and that the monies paid to the law firm were thereby forfeitable to the Commonwealth under 42 Pa. C.S.A. § 6801(a)(6)(i)(A).</p>

The law firm was directed to preserve any such assets in its escrow account pending further order of court. The order was served on Mr. Hess and his counsel at the conclusion of the preliminary hearing on September 22, 1988. The temporary restraining order was to remain in effect until September 29, 1988, the date scheduled for a hearing on the Commonwealth’s motion. The hearing date was continued to September 30, 1988, by the court with the agreement of the parties.</p>

In the motion to strike, Mr. Hess raised various constitutional and statutory challenges to the Commonwealth’s motion and the temporary restraining order. The motion to strike included an allegation, that is not in dispute, that the law firm had complied with the order dated September 22, 1988. With the court’s permission, the Pennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers intervened as amicus curiae and also filed a motion to vacate the <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>temporary restraining order, challenging the constitutionality of the statutory forfeiture provision and its applicability to Mr. Hess.</p>

The trial judge inquired whether counsel for Mr. Hess wished to brief and argue the constitutional challenges as a threshold issue in the case. Mr. Hess’s counsel requested an opportunity to do so before proceeding with any evidentiary matters regarding the payment of attorney’s fees. The Commonwealth agreed as long as the temporary restraining order remained in effect. The trial court entered an order establishing a briefing schedule and argument date, and directed that the temporary restraining order would remain in effect pending a decision by the court. The trial court informed the parties that an additional hearing would be scheduled for the purpose of taking evidence if the court’s consideration of the threshold legal issues did not ultimately resolve the matter.</p>

For purposes of analyzing the statutory and constitutional claims raised by Mr. Hess, the parties and the trial court had proceeded on the assumption that the money paid by Mr. Hess as a retainer to the law firm for legal representation was obtained by him through illegal drug transactions. Noting that the Commonwealth did not allege or suggest that the retainer paid by Mr. Hess to the law firm was a sham or complicitous transaction, the trial court held that the retainer received by the law firm for legitimate criminal defense representation on the pending charges was not subject to forfeiture under 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 6801(a)(6)(i)(A).</p>

The trial court did not reach the second issue relating to the constitutional challenges, however, because of its disposition of the first issue. In construing the forfeiture statute, the trial court reasoned that the phrase “all proceeds traceable to such an exchange” used in the statute does not encompass monies derived from illegal drug transactions which are used by a defendant to pay a retainer for legitimate criminal defense representation. The trial court held that the legislative purpose of the forfeiture provision was to prevent those persons who have secured money or property through an illegal drug transaction from benefitting from such an exchange. The trial court concluded that the phrase was not used in the statute for the purposes of subjecting the assets of bona fide innocent third persons to forfeiture, including attorney’s fees paid for legal representation.</p>

Payment of money for legitimate legal services under these circumstances, even though there is a possibility that it was obtained from an illegal source, does not constitute a sham transaction, or the “parking” of money with an attorney, and does not change the status of the attorney from a bona fide innocent person any more than it would change the status of the doctor, the business person <a id="p613" href="#p613" data-label="613" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*613</a>or the department store. The money received for the payment of legal services comes from a client who is presumed innocent. Contracting for the services of an attorney for legitimate criminal defense representation does not put the attorney in a position of complicity with the client and does not require that the attorney act as an investigator for the government.</blockquote>

In the Superior Court’s view, this could only be accomplished by the holding of an evidentiary hearing into the source of the proceeds.
