    <p id="b766-11" data-blocks='[["BL_766.11",766,[225,1060,1164,798]]]'>The appellant, Manuel Polanco, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts of delivery of a controlled substance as a result of having delivered cocaine to an undercover police officer on two occasions in September of 1988. The deliveries consisted of 0.96 grams of cocaine on September 15, 1988 and 5.65 grams of cocaine on September 29, 1988. On June 1, 1989, a sentence of three to six years imprisonment was imposed for conspiracy, and a concurrent term of one to two years imprisonment was imposed for the September 15, 1988 offense. A concurrent term of three to six years imprisonment and fine of $5,000.00 were imposed for the September 29, 1988 offense. An appeal challenging the latter portion of the sentence was taken to the Superior Court, whereupon the judgment of sentence was affirmed. <a href="/pa-super/395/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="395 Pa.

The trial court reasoned that this was appellant’s second offense, in that the first offense was that which occurred on September 15,1988. Hence, it imposed the three year sentence mandated for recidivist offenders under § 7508(a)(3)®. Appellant contends that the mandatory sen-<a id="p601" href="#p601" data-label="601" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*601</a>fencing provision for recidivist offenders should be applied only where the first offense involved at least 2 grams of controlled substance. Accordingly, inasmuch as the trial court treated the September 15,1988 delivery of less than 1 gram of cocaine as a first offense under the sentencing statute, appellant contends that he has been improperly sentenced. We agree and remand for resentencing.</p>

Accordingly, it construed the statute as not requiring a previous conviction subject to sentencing under § 7508 as a prerequisite for application of the recidivist sentencing provision. It held that the recidivist provision was <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>applicable whenever there had been a previous conviction for delivery of a controlled substance under Section 13(a)(30) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. § 780-113(a)(30), without regard to whether the amount of the substance involved in the previous offense was at least 2 grams. Such a construction ignores, however, the plain language of § 7508. As stated in 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b), “When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.”</p>
    <p id="b768-5" data-blocks='[["BL_768.5",768,[235,842,1164,735]]]'>A plain reading of the statute makes it clear that the mandatory sentence of three years imprisonment and fine of $10,000.00 are to be applied only where there is a second offense subject to the mandatory sentencing provision of § 7508, and not where the first offense was for a smaller quantity of controlled substance than is addressed by that section.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The language of the statute is unambiguous. In express terms, it sets forth a mandatory sentence to be imposed “upon conviction for another offense subject to sentencing under this section.” Clearly, there must be a first conviction subject to sentencing under “this section,” to wit, § 7508, which deals only with quantities greater than 2 grams, before there can be a second, i.e., “another,” conviction subject to sentencing under “this section.”</p>
    <p id="b768-6" data-blocks='[["BL_768.6",768,[234,1598,1157,256]]]'>Examination of other portions of § 7508 confirms that by the term, “this section,” the legislature was referring to the sentencing provision, § 7508, rather than to Section (13)(a)(30) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act. The following excerpts from § 7508 are illustrative:</p>
    <blockquote id="b768-7" data-blocks='[["BL_768.7",768,[272,1870,1122,363]],["BL_769.1",769,[201,315,1111,206]]]'>(b) Proof of sentencing. — Provisions of <em>this section </em>shall not be an element of the crime.

The court <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>shall consider evidence presented at trial, shall afford the Commonwealth and the defendant an opportunity to present necessary additional evidence and shall determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, if <em>this section </em>is applicable.</blockquote>

Hence, to no extent can the mandatory sentencing provision’s requirement that there have been a prior offense “subject to sentencing under this section” be construed as referring to any section other than § 7508.</p>
    <p id="b769-7" data-blocks='[["BL_769.7",769,[155,1227,1156,475]]]'>Inasmuch as appellant’s conviction for delivery of 0.96 grams of cocaine did not meet the 2 gram threshold for imposition of a mandatory sentence under § 7508, it was not a conviction subject to sentencing under that section. Appellant’s conviction for delivery of 5.65 grams of cocaine was not, therefore, a second conviction subject to sentencing under § 7508, but rather was the first conviction subject to sentencing thereunder, and the courts below erred in holding to the contrary. Accordingly, resentencing is required.</p>
