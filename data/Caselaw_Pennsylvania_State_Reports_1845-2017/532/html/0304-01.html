On October 11, 1957, Cecilia and Florence Burkley [“the Burkleys”] entered into an oil and gas lease (No. 58019) with Appellant, the Peoples Natural Gas Company [“Peoples”], for a period of ten (10) years and so long thereafter as the land was operated in the search for or production of oil or gas. The lease was duly recorded and covered a tract of land consisting of 126.905 acres. The Burkleys owned 65 acres of land subject to the lease. The lease provided in relevant part for a payment of a flat rate royalty of $75.00 each three months in advance for shallow gas wells and a royalty equal to one-eighth (Jé) of the value of all gas produced, saved and marketed from deep gas wells. Pursuant to the lease, Peoples drilled a shallow gas well [No. 5282, “Peoples well”]. Although drilling was completed in May of 1978, gas production from this well did not commence until February 12, 1979, at which time a pipeline was installed to transport production.</p>

      <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>In 1971, the Burkleys conveyed 25 acres of their land to appellees Mr. and Mrs. Glenn C. Kepple. The Kepples believed that the Burkleys had conveyed gas drilling rights with the land. Unaware of the prior conveyance of those rights to Appellant Peoples, the Kepples, entered into an oil and gas lease with Fairman Drilling Company [“Fairman”] on August 7, 1978. Fairman, while preparing to drill two shallow gas wells on the Kepple property, learned of the Peoples/Burkley lease. Thereafter, Peoples and Fairman entered into negotiations which resulted in a “farm-out” arrangement whereby Fairman was permitted to drill two wells and Peoples agreed to purchase the gas produced from these two wells [OS 39267 and OS 39268, “Fairman wells”]; Fairman was responsible for royalty payments to the appropriate lessors. The Fairman wells were drilled on the Kepple property in April of 1979, and production commenced on August 4, 1980.</p>
    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[164,1174,1157,455]]]'>In 1981, the Kepples instituted suit (Docket No. 5220 of 1981) against Fairman claiming they were owed a one-eighth royalty on the production from the Fairman wells; the Kepples also asserted a royalty claim against Peoples for production from the Peoples well No. 5282. In December of 1982, Bricmont, on behalf of Florence Burkley, commenced an action in equity (Docket No. 7520 of 1982) against Peoples, Fairman, and the Kepples for an accounting.

Loughran of the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County rendered his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and a <em>decree nisi </em>was entered. In the action docketed at 5220 of 1981, a verdict was entered in favor of Fairman and against the Kepples. Judge Loughran found that the Kepples had received gas royalty rights to the 25 acre tract conveyed by the Burkleys and thus were entitled to a portion of the royalties paid by Peoples for production from Well No. 5282. In the action docketed at 7520 of 1982, the court determined that Bricmont, on behalf of Florence <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>Burkley, was entitled to a one-eighth royalty as opposed to a flat rate, as applied by Peoples; the court ordered an accounting to determine the percentages of interest owned by the parties, and the quantities of gas and any payments due from the various wells.</p>

    <p id="b479-4" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[161,1139,1159,797]]]'>Appellant Peoples further challenges the application of Act No. 60 to the well at issue. Appellant argues that the lower courts incorrectly construed and therefore misapplied Act No. 60 to the Lease involved in these cases. Generally, Act No. 60 provides that royalties from oil or natural gas wells or gas leases are subject to escalation within 90 days after the effective date of the Act, or by December 17, 1979, when certain “increased production” procedures — such as artificial stimulation and hydraulic fracturing — have been completed prior to the effective date of the Act. <em>See </em>58 P.S. §§ 33-35 (Supp.1990). Peoples Well No. 5282 was drilled in May, 8, 1978 and was hydrofractured or stimulated on May 15, 1978. Thus, the trial court states that at worst, a one-eighth (iéth) royalty would be payable on Well No. 5282 from and after December 17, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b479-5" data-blocks='[["BL_479.6",479,[159,1959,1159,97]],["BL_480.1",480,[250,313,1160,361]]]'>Appellant Peoples argues that Well No. 5282 was a new well — drilled in May 1978. At the time it was drilled, a time <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>when there was no production, it was stimulated. Production of gas from Well No. 5282 first occurred in February 1979, some eight months after it was stimulated. Thus, Peoples argues that there was no stimulation of an existing well for the purpose of increasing the production that had occurred previously from that well and the terms of Sections 2 and 3 of Act No. 60 are inapplicable in this case.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[245,694,1162,630]]]'>We find the trial court’s reliance on Sections 2 and 3 of Act 60 to be correct. Under Act No. 60 it is immaterial whether the procedures for increasing production occur days, months or years after the drilling of the well. Act No. 60 does not set any temporal limitations. It would not be logical to conclude that the legislature only intended to escalate royalties for wells that were stimulated after a period of time. Likewise, it would not be logical to conclude that a well stimulated immediately upon drilling would not be subject to escalation whereas a well stimulated 6 months later would be subject to escalation. Therefore, we find that Appellant Peoples must pay one-eighth (]éth) royalties at least from December 17, 1979.</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.6",480,[238,1348,1165,1006]]]'>As to Peoples second issue, Peoples argues that the court abused its discretion in unilaterally modifying the terms of the 1957 lease from a flat fee to one-eighth ($th) royalty. The trial court based its decision on the fact that Peoples offered to modify the lease with the Burkleys to one-eighth (/6th) royalty by letter dated August 3, 1978, at a time when one of the Burkleys had passed away and Peoples knew, or should have known that the surviving Burkley was of advanced years. The court stated that the Kepples were never requested to execute a lease modification and, accordingly, their failure to do so cannot be held against them. Further, the trial court stated, without the benefit of citing existing case law, that a unilateral contract change does not require an acceptance where the change is in the nature of payments in excess for those called for in the contract. Appellant Peoples argues that an equity court does not have the power to ignore established principles of law and unilaterally modify a valid legal agreement when it believes that the “equities of the case” justify such a modification.</p>

Appellant Pomposini argues that because there were no “operations” for gas as required by the 1946 lease, the lease terminated at the expiration of the original twenty (20) year term in 1966 and thus, the Superior Court erred in choosing a rate consistent with the terms of the <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>lease and the Superior Court should have applied a one-eighth (}éth) royalty rate as prescribed by statute (Act No. 60, 58 P.S. §§ 33-35) and case law.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
