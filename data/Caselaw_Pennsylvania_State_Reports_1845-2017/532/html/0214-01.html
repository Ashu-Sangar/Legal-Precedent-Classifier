Appellant’s double jeopardy claim was based on both Article 1 Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

In other words, there must be a compelling reason serious enough to outweigh the interest of the defendant in obtaining a final resolution of the case against him. That is not the case here. By holding that a manifest necessity existed in this case, the majority grossly deviates from established case law.</p>

It is not at all clear from the record that an actual or even potential conflict of interest existed. Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.9(a) provides that a conflict of interest exists <em>only </em>where the present proceeding involves “the same or a <em>substantially </em>related matter” as the previous matter (emphasis added). The criminal matter at issue in this case is not even remotely related, let alone <em>substantially </em>related, to the attorney’s prior representation of appellant in the custody matter four years earlier. Even if there were a conflict of interest, there is no evidence that appellant was or would have been prejudiced by the purported conflict of interest on the part of the district attorney. Neither appellant nor the district attorney requested the mistrial. In fact, it was appellant’s express desire to continue with the trial. <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>Appellant was willing to consent to any conflict of interest that potentially existed.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> In this case, appellant made a counseled decision to waive any potential conflict and not to seek a mistrial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> The interests of justice could have only been protected in this case by allowing the defendant to have his trial completed by the tribunal in which it was initiated and to have his fate determined by the jury first impaneled. Since that is now impossible, the only remedy is to bar retrial.</p>

In this case, it is beyond <em>any doubt </em>that the <em>sua sponte </em>declaration of a mistrial was not warranted, needed or proper.

I agree with Mr. Justice Cappy that a defendant can consent to possible or actual prejudice by placing a waiver on the record. I disagree, however, with his conclusion that the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>do not give rise to a complete and competent waiver. The defendant's objection to the declaration of a mistrial and his express desire and readiness to proceed with the trial were clearly a sufficient waiver. We have held that waiver has occurred as a matter of law on the basis of much less assertive behavior. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Brown, </em><a href="/pa/497/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="89" data-cite="497 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1775308" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0007-01">497 Pa. 7</a>, <a href="/pa/497/0007-01" class="citation" data-index="90" data-cite="497 Pa. 7" data-case-ids="1775308" data-case-paths="/pa/497/0007-01">438 A.2d 592</a> (1981) (defendant’s silence constituted waiver of Rule 1100 rights).</p>
