It appears that he began accepting an average of over 100 cases per week. All of these cases were filed in Allegheny County regardless of the client’s residence. Because of the large number of non-resident cases filed there, court officials insisted on strict enforcement of venue requirements. Respondent then began filing non-resident cases in Cameron County which charged the lowest filing fee for nonresidents. On April 23, 1982, we ordered all president judges to observe the requirements of Pa.R.C.P. 1920.3 which provides that divorce actions must be brought only in the county where either the plaintiff or defendant resides.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">3</a>

    <p id="b191-8" data-blocks='[["BL_191.10",191,[170,1525,1156,420]],["BL_192.1",192,[234,309,1162,586]]]'>Respondent had undertaken representation of Mrs. Dietrich prior to our order of 1982 and planned to file in Cameron County. Following the order, however, he indicated to his client that he could not file in Cameron County. Mrs. Dietrich, whose permanent address was really Montgomery County, then told Respondent that she lived in Philadelphia with her aunt and that Montgomery County, which address appeared on correspondence with Respondent, was a temporary <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>college address. Mrs. Dietrich filed the divorce complaint in Philadelphia. The court there, however, requested an affidavit for the Philadelphia address, and Respondent sent her the affidavit which she signed and which was presented in support of the Philadelphia domicile. At the scheduled hearing, which Mrs. Dietrich attended alone because she refused to pay additional attorney fees, the court confronted her with records from the Department of Welfare indicating that her permanent address was Montgomery County. Mrs. Dietrich then admitted that she lived in Montgomery County to where the divorce action was transferred for disposition.</p>
    <p id="b192-4" data-blocks='[["BL_192.5",192,[231,925,1162,257]]]'>The issue for our review is whether Respondent knew that Mrs. Dietrich lived in Montgomery County but counseled her to file in Philadelphia where fees were lower and sent a supporting affidavit which she signed affirming her status as a resident of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b192-5" data-blocks='[["BL_192.6",192,[229,1213,1161,581]]]'>The following relevant considerations also are taken into account in evaluating this issue. First, Respondent was aware that Mrs. Dietrich, and almost simultaneously Mrs. Westcott for that matter, was seeking to file her action in a county with the lowest costs. Secondly, once Mrs. Dietrich learned from Respondent that Philadelphia’s fees were lower, she told him that she, in fact, lived in Philadelphia, and Respondent acted on this designation of her address by having her file a complaint and affidavit with the court in Philadelphia even though he had corresponded with her at the Montgomery County address.</p>
    <p id="b192-6" data-blocks='[["BL_192.7",192,[224,1826,1163,528]],["BL_193.1",193,[166,315,1154,98]]]'>As to the charges involving Mrs. Dietrich, Respondent has steadfastly denied that he ever counseled her to use the fictitious Philadelphia address in filing her complaint there. He insists that he inadvertently believed that the Montgomery County address was being used by his client as a mere convenience for receiving mail while he accepted her statement that she. was a resident of Philadelphia. Any discrepancies on this matter were due to poor office management brought about by inexperience, failure to supervise his office staff properly, and most importantly the crush of a burgeoning <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>caseload which forced him to work long hours for seven days per week.</p>
    <p id="b193-4" data-blocks='[["BL_193.5",193,[165,440,1159,367]]]'>These factors, he argues, led to specific filings which were not intentional on his part. The file jacket for Mrs. Dietrich’s case, for example, lacked any notation that her Montgomery address “was merely a school address,” as he testified in his defense (H.C.T., p. 54), while failures to investigate further were traceable to sloppy business procedure and secretarial mismanagement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">4</a>

Respondent also could not be believed because he should “have examined Dietrich very closely” when the Philadelphia court requested an affidavit for residency. Furthermore, “such conduct was a pattern and not simply an isolated error of judgment.” The Committee took special note of the fact that Mrs. Dietrich’s file jacket had a Montgomery County address without any notation that it was merely a college address.</p>
    <p id="b194-4" data-blocks='[["BL_194.5",194,[233,929,1165,803]]]'>The Disciplinary Board, on the other hand, arrived at somewhat different conclusions. Although Mrs. Dietrich appeared unsophisticated, “we are convinced that she was astute enough to understand that if she lived in Philadelphia, the divorce ... would be cheaper” (D.B.Rpt., p. 19). On the issue of whether Respondent knew that the Philadelphia address was fictitious, the Board’s report appears contradictory. The report (at p. 9) first concludes: “Given the circumstances surrounding this case, Respondent knew or should have known that Mrs. Dietrich did not live in Philadelphia and that the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County did not have proper venue in this matter.” At p. 19, however, the report states: “We believe that the Respondent filed the divorce complaint without knowing or having reason to know that Mrs. Dietrich’s Philadelphia address was false.”</p>
    <p id="b194-5" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[230,1764,1166,587]]]'>The Board went on to conclude that Respondent is guilty of ignoring “warning signals,” such as two addresses and the request for an affidavit. These, however, in the Board’s view were due to Respondent’s inexperience and practice of law “like a mail order business.” The Board, nevertheless, found that in Mrs. Dietrich’s case, Respondent did violate DR 7-102(A)(6), participating in the creation of evidence (the affidavit) and DR 1-102(A)(6), conduct adversely reflecting on fitness to practice (the affidavit). The Board held, nevertheless, that it was “not convinced that his misconduct rises to the level of an intentional act” (D.B.Rpt., p. 20).</p>

      <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>A critical piece of evidence before the Hearing Committee and the Disciplinary Board was the testimony of Mrs. Dietrich that Respondent knew of and advised her to use the fictitious Philadelphia address. Mrs. Dietrich did not appear personally before the Hearing Committee; the Office of Disciplinary Counsel offered a stipulation that “Michael Davis told me to use my aunt’s address in Philadelphia.” Respondent stipulated as to how she would testify without stipulating that the unsworn statement was true but accepted its admissibility without the right of cross-examination.</p>
    <p id="b195-4" data-blocks='[["BL_195.5",195,[168,848,1157,309]]]'>The Hearing Committee report does not address the issue, but the Disciplinary Board concluded that “the stipulation is not credible” (at p. 18). Additionally, the Board found that Mrs. Dietrich lied about her address before the court in Philadelphia, a falsity which, in the Board’s view, casts suspicion on all of her testimony.</p>

    <p id="b195-6" data-blocks='[["BL_195.7",195,[167,1272,1158,960]]]'>Similar to the prior case and almost parallel in time, Mrs. Westcott, a resident of Montgomery County, retained Respondent to represent her in a divorce action. Respondent informed her that he was barred from filing in Cameron County. A great deal of confusion followed. Mrs. Wescott fired Respondent, then rehired him; correspondence was missing, and her file could not be located; and there was a refund and repayment of fees. Except that they reveal once again poor office management, these factors are not pertinent to the issue at hand. The issue arises from the two facts that Mrs. Wescott told him that she lived at an address in Bucks County where he should file the complaint, and that she accused Respondent in the same stipulation of the Dietrich hearing of knowledge that the Bucks County address was false, but he still counseled her to use the fictitious address. We note that Respondent did not file a complaint in divorce for Mrs. Westcott in Bucks County or anywhere else prior to terminating his representation of this client.</p>

During this period, Lancaster County required such plaintiffs to pay a master fee of $50.00, refundable if the master was not employed in the case. Upon praecipe by Respondent, the fees paid by these clients were returned because a master was not used. The problem in this case arises because Respondent deposited them in the account of his partner, marked “Howard R. Singer Special Account” and failed to notify the clients that the money had been returned after he had closed representation. In September, 1986, after receiving an inquiry from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel regarding the fees, Respondent checked personally with Lancaster County officials to determine whether the fees had been returned and then refunded the proper amount to each client.</p>

Respondent had admitted in testimony that he was not aware of a rule against commingling of funds. (D.B. Rpt., p. 22; Respondent’s admission of “ignorance” of the commingling rule appeared in the Board’s report at p. 13). The Board concluded further that all aspects of the problem of the master fees again was attributable to the fact that Respondent “did not seem to understand that practicing law is different than (sic) running other businesses.” <em>(Id., </em>p. 23).</p>

Although he has complied with all sanctions previously imposed, he has remained on suspension status since May 21, 1984. While I am not compelled to address the intricacies of those prior proceedings and sanctions, it is apparent that nearly all of his prior violations were directly related to poor practice management.

Westcott, and had intended to file their divorce actions in Cameron County, which offered the lowest costs. Davis notified both of these women that he would no longer be able to file their actions in Cameron County, and that the costs associated with their actions would be higher in the counties in which they or their husbands resided. It is the events that transpired thereafter in these two cases that resulted in the charges by ODC through its Petition for Discipline dated October 5, 1987 and docketed 74 DB 87.</p>

Based upon this information, Davis prepared and filed a verified complaint providing that Mrs. Dietrich resided in Philadelphia County. Thereafter, the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County requested a sworn affidavit from Mrs. Dietrich providing the dates she resided in Philadelphia County. Davis prepared an affidavit using the Philadelphia address, which Mrs. Dietrich executed. In response to this affidavit, the court scheduled a hearing for the purpose of establishing the residence of the parties and the proper venue for the divorce action. Mrs. Dietrich appeared at this hearing alone in order to reduce costs. At the hearing, Mrs. Dietrich falsely testified under oath that she resided in Philadelphia County, but recanted her testimony when the court confronted her with a communication from the Department of Public Welfare that indicated that her permanent residence was in Montgomery County.

In support of this position ODC offers a stipulation as to what Mrs. Dietrich’s testimony would have been had she appeared at the hearing in this matter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> I find this stipulation incredible, as it was prepared upon the uncorroborated and unsworn allegations of a client who: expressly informed Davis that her permanent residence was in Philadelphia County; verified the address set forth in the complaint; and admits that while under oath, she misrepresented her place of residence to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County on two separate occasions. I choose to believe the testimony of Davis that at all times he believed that Mrs. Dietrich’s <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>permanent residence was in Philadelphia County, and that he did not counsel her to utilize a fictitious address. Accordingly, I find insufficient evidence to conclude that Davis either counseled Mrs. Dietrich to utilize a fictitious address, or knew up until the time he filed the complaint that Mrs. Dietrich did not have a permanent residence in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[186,640,1158,953]]]'>However, the record does reveal that Davis’s contact with Mrs. Dietrich and the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County after the filing of the complaint should have alerted him to a problem regarding her residence. Davis clearly ignored many warning signs: Mrs. Dietrich’s goal of obtaining the least expensive divorce possible; her convenient story about a temporary college address once she learned that it was cheaper to file in Philadelphia County rather than Montgomery County; her desire to continue to receive mail at the Montgomery County address; and the questions being posed by the court concerning her residency. The combination of all of these signs should have prompted Davis to make further inquiry prior to filing the affidavit of residency and demonstrates insufficient attention to detail. While this failure was obviously exacerbated by the deluge of other obligations inherent in the high-volume practice Davis undertook, had he been more diligent, it would have been obvious to him that Mrs. Dietrich did not live in Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[185,1612,1159,580]]]'>I am not convinced that his ignorance of these warning signs rises to the level of an intentional act, but once they appeared Davis should not have prepared the affidavit of residency until conducting an investigation. Therefore, I find that on these facts, Davis had an affirmative duty to act on that which should have been obvious. His failure to act under these circumstances amounts to a violation of Disciplinary Rule 7 — 102(A)(6) (participation in the creation or preservation of evidence when it is obvious that the evidence is false), and Disciplinary Rule 1-102(A)(6) (conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law).</p>

Davis prepared a complaint using the Bucks County address, which was never filed. Mrs. Westcott eventually terminated Davis’ representation, and Davis refunded all monies paid by Mrs. Westcott. Davis handled the Westcott case for approximately six months.</p>

He stated that he prepared the complaint using the Bucks County address, but that he did not file it because he was not convinced that her husband resided in Bucks County. I choose to believe Davis rather than Mrs. Westcott whose unsworn allegations were offered by ODC through the same stipulation discussed in connection with the Dietrich matter. In addition, I believe that Mrs. Westcott is responsible for much of the delay in this matter, and that Davis’ poor management only compounded the problem.</p>

She terminated Davis as counsel and demanded a refund when she learned of the additional costs; subsequently reinstated Davis; provided Davis with a fictitious address; and ultimately terminated Davis again when he did not file the complaint because he was not convinced that her husband resided in Bucks County. As <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>further evidence of her own lack of diligence in pursuing a divorce, I note that as of the first hearing in 1988 she still had not obtained a divorce.

His filing system was complicated, disorganized and sloppy. Many functions were performed automatically by secretarial staff, and resulted in delay, missing correspondence and files. Clearly, Davis should have kept abreast of the status of his representation of Mrs. Westcott, and been more diligent in investigating the residency question. However, while Davis’ conduct demonstrates poor management of a law office and in some ways falls below the standard I believe should be maintained by members of the profession, I am not convinced that Davis counseled Mrs. Westcott to utilize a fictitious address or excessively neglected this matter.</p>

    <p id="b207-6" data-blocks='[["BL_207.7",207,[206,1536,1157,691]]]'>At the time these actions were filed, Lancaster County required the payment of master’s fees regardless of whether they were necessary. Once a divorce decree was issued in cases where a master was not required, the master’s fees would be refunded upon praecipe by counsel. At the time the complained of conduct occurred, Davis was involved in many divorce actions in Lancaster county. When a Lancaster County divorce decree was issued, Davis would praecipe the court for the return of master’s fees advanced. When the fees were returned, Davis would instruct a secretary to deposit the funds and prepare a check for the client. This system provided no procedure for ensuring that unused funds requested from Lancaster County were actually returned.</p>

However, for one reason or another Lancaster County did not refund the fees, and Davis did not inquire as to the status of the fee refunds. Ultimately, once Davis learned of the problem, he immediately refunded these fees to his clients. Clearly, Davis did not attempt to cover-up or conceal the receipt of funds or seek to convert client funds to his own use. Thus, while Davis’ conduct again leaves much to be desired, it simply does not support a finding that Davis sought to intentionally deprive his clients of these funds.</p>

While there is no excuse for such commingling of funds, I believe it is a manifestation of inexperience compounded by a high volume practice.</p>

As Davis learned, simple legal matters are relatively rare, and become non-existent when one attempts to handle these “simple” matters in high volume. Thus, in a high volume setting, competent and ethical representation becomes nearly impossible by any practitioner, absent supreme business acumen. This is a gift that few possess, and unfortunately for Davis, one that he certainly did not possess at the time of the conduct that gave rise to the matter <em>sub judice.</em>

However, I believe, as did the Board, that these failures do not warrant the severe sanction of disbarment, as they are not the type of conduct for which disbarment is appropriate.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[216,599,1154,647]]]'>ODC would have this Court believe that it is precluded from disregarding the findings of the Hearing Committee that Davis intentionally violated the disciplinary rules, as only the Hearing Committee can weigh the credibility of Davis. However, this Court is not bound by these findings. <em>Shorall, Id. </em>at 416, <a href="/pa/527/0413-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="592 A.2d 1285" data-case-ids="1827695,1827744" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0413-01,/pa/527/0412-01">592 A.2d at 1287</a>. There is no credible evidence that Davis acted intentionally in any of these matters, and his actions did not result in the loss of any of his clients’ funds or abilities to exercise their rights.

    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[213,1287,1157,699]]]'>Initially, I am somewhat concerned with Davis’ lengthy disciplinary record. However, as Davis’ shortcomings in the matter <em>sub judice </em>were the result of poor business management and not a conscious effort to violate the disciplinary rules, I conclude that Davis’ conduct does not reflect negatively upon his honesty, integrity, knowledge of the law or fitness to practice law. It is the lack of these characteristics that may warrant the extreme sanction of disbarment in order to protect the public, maintain the integrity of the bar, and preserve our ability to police ourselves. <em>See Office of Disciplinary Counsel v.

During his ongoing period of suspension, Davis has acted to correct his prior deficiencies and acquire an ability to properly manage a law practice.

I agree that the defense of laches is not applicable as Davis contributed to the delay and has not demonstrated the requisite prejudice arising from such delay.
