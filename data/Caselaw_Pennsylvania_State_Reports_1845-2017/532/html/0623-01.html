The trial court granted the motion to suppress evidence filed by Appellee, Francis E. Luddy, a/k/a Francis E. Luddy, Jr., of his alleged sexual contact with the victim, Samuel C. Hutchison, in 1980, and with the victim’s older brother Mark Hutchison, in the 1970’s and early 1980’s, unless additional evidence was offered. In suppressing the evidence, the court of common pleas held that the proposed testimony proffered by the Commonwealth of the appellee’s prior acts of criminal sexual misconduct was not admissible as an exception to the rule that evidence of other crimes is not admissible against a defendant solely to show his bad character or propensity for committing criminal acts.

The matter <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>was transferred to the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County and scheduled for the March Term of Court which commenced March 13, 1989. At the pre-trial conference, the trial court was asked to rule upon the admissibility of evidence the Commonwealth proposed to offer at trial concerning alleged sexual misconduct with Samuel, and also with Mark, a number of years prior to the questioned occurrence in the case <em>sub judice. </em>The Commonwealth averred that Mark would testify that the appellee engaged in sexual relations with him on numerous occasions from 1977 to 1981. The testimony would establish that these relations began when Mark was twelve years of age and continued until he was sixteen. The Commonwealth further submitted that it would offer testimony from Samuel concerning a 1980 incident where appellee forced Samuel to perform oral sex on him. No charges resulted from these other alleged occurrences.</p>

The Commonwealth averred that the alleged conduct occurred during a period of several years and was interrupted only by the parents moving the family to Akron, Ohio between 1980 and 1982. Furthermore, the alleged incident, which gave rise to the charges herein, occurred when Samuel drove from Ohio to Somerset County, where he contacted appellee. Appellee and Samuel then met at the rectory where appellee allegedly engaged in sexual relations with Samuel. The trial court ruled the evidence of prior sexual misconduct inadmissible. It concluded that the remoteness in time between the alleged prior criminal activity and the occurrence in the case <em>sub judice </em>precluded a rational inference of a common scheme, plan or design to commit a crime. As previously stated, the trial court ruled the testimony inadmissible, and the Superior Court quashed the Commonwealth’s appeal.</p>

Pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, the Court of Common Pleas entered an order requiring the Commonwealth to file a statement of matters complained of on appeal. Although untimely, the Commonwealth complied with the order. This Court is unable to discern whether untimely compliance was the basis for the Superior Court's order granting the motion to quash the appeal since an opinion was not written. Nevertheless, based on the Superior Court's own balancing test, it would be inappropriate to determine the objections herein waived and thus quash the appeal. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mueller, </em><a href="/pa-super/341/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="341 Pa.

Today, we do not even require a certification, but merely an adverse ruling with the filing of a petition that simply declares that the Commonwealth’s case is “seriously handicapped.” No longer shall our overtaxed trial judges entertain such evidentiary rulings, it shall now be the burden of the overtaxed appellate jurists of both the Supreme Court and the Superior Court to make such decisions.</p>

Now it appears that this sense of fairness has not only dissipated but has become perverted. A defendant is left to the task of running the entire gauntlet of trial, conviction and appeal in order to cure an evidentiary ruling, whereas the Commonwealth can immediately seek redress without any appreciable delay.</p>
