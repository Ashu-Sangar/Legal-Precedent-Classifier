As in this case, the vast majority of cases are commenced by Notice of Compensation Payable issued by the employer and without the employee having the assistance of counsel. Because benefits are available pursuant to the Act <em>only </em>for injuries “arising in the course of his employment,” it would appear logical to conclude, as did the trial court, that once an employee accepts benefits in any manner, he has necessarily precluded himself from subsequently arguing that his injury is not work-related and falls within the personal animus exception. However, as the mere acceptance of benefits does not rise to the level of a <em>formal adjudication </em>of compensability, we believe it cannot control the determination of whether an injury is work-related for purposes of the personal animus exception.</p>
    <p id="b305-4" data-blocks='[["BL_305.5",305,[222,1073,1156,631]]]'>There is a significant difference between the situation where an injured employee requests and is awarded benefits by a referee and where he simply accepts benefits through Notice of Compensation Payable and/or agreement.

Clearly, absent a final adjudication on the question of compensability, an injured employee must be free to pursue damages through a traditional negligence action. Any benefits received in the absence of, or prior to, a final adjudication of compensability can simply be repaid out of damages obtained through the negligence action. To hold otherwise would permit employers to limit their potential liability for unsafe workplaces by simply offering benefits to an employee while he is injured and unaware that his proper remedy is <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>through a negligence action.

The record in this case does not reveal the extent to which Kohler was involved in the initiation of his benefits pursuant to the Act. However, while it might appear that Kohler may have been instrumental in initiating the compensation process by presenting a "claim” of work-related injury to McCrory Stores, in actuality it is the employer who has a duty to promptly investigate, record, and report work-related injuries to its insurer and the Department of Labor and Industry. See 77 P.S. §§ 717.1, 994, 995. Moreover, the employer and insurer should commence or deny the payment of compensation within 21 days after the employer has notice or knowledge of the employee’s disability. 77 P.S. § 717.1. The only responsibility of the employee is that he give notice of his injury to his employer <em>unless </em>the employer already has knowledge of the occurrence. Thus, while the employer may require the employee to furnish information in furtherance of its obligations to <em>its </em>insurer and the Department of Labor and Industry, this does not amount to a "claim” for benefits by the employee, as any further steps by the employee serve the employer’s obligation to investigate, record, report, and present a claim to <em>its </em>insurer. Only after an amicable payment of benefits has not been achieved does the employee formally file a “claim” through a Claim Petition and initiate the administrative apparatus of the Department of Labor and Industry. 77 P.S. § 751.</p>

The referee adjudicating this Petition for Termination, Suspension or Modification of Compensation, filed by McCrory Stores, specifically found that Kohler had been overpaid compensation for a <em>work-related. </em>injury from December 4, 1987, through October 25, 1988, when benefits had ceased pursuant to a supersedeas decision issued by another referee. Accordingly, the referee ordered Kohler’s compensation terminated effective October 25, 1988, and further ordered that McCrory Stores is entitled to a credit for any future compensation owed to Kohler as a result of the overpayment of compensation.</p>
