The Bank did not respond to either request. On December 22, 1986, a second complaint in mortgage foreclosure was filed by the Bank against the Apgars/defendants and the Marras/terre tenants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> This second complaint was not preceded by Act 6 notice of intention to foreclose to the Apgars or the Marras.</p>

The Marras alleged that the sheriff sale was null and void because they did not receive a notice of intention to foreclose prior to the commencement of the foreclosure proceedings as required by Act 6. Following a non-jury trial, the court upheld the sheriff sale despite having determined that the Marras were “residential mortgage debtors” under Act 6, and, thus, were entitled to notice. The trial court reasoned that because the property was transferred in violation of the due-on-sale clause of the mortgage,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the Marras could not cure the default and thus, “technical compliance” with the notice provisions of Act 6 was not required. In addition, the court determined that since the Marras received actual notice of the foreclosure proceedings by service of the mortgage foreclosure complaint, they were not prejudiced by the lack of “technical compliance” with Act 6. Finally, the court determined that to require “technical compliance” would be unjust to the purchaser at the sheriff sale. The Superior Court affirmed on the same grounds, <a href="/pa-super/389/0005-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="389 Pa.

A residential mortgage debtor is defined in Act 6 as “a non-corporate borrower who is obligated to a residential mortgage lender to repay in whole or in part a residential mortgage <em>and a successor record owner of the property, if any, who gives notice thereof to the residential mortgage lender. ” </em>41 P.S. § .101 (emphasis added). In this case the Marras were successor record owners of the property on December 16, 1985, when the property was deeded to them and recorded by the tax claim bureau.

Contrary to the Superior Court’s interpretation, it is clear that Act 6 notice applies to all defaults, not just monetary; hence, the <em>“nature </em>of the default claimed” and “exactly what performance including what sum of money, <em>if any, </em>must be tendered to cure the default” must be stated in the notice of intention to foreclose. 41 P.S. § 403(c)(2) and (3) (emphasis added).

Prejudice to the Marras is evident in the interest, court and sheriff costs, attorneys fees, etc., which attached upon the commencement of the mortgage foreclosure action. (For example, the Act provides that the residential mortgage lender may contract for or receive a maximum of $50 on attorney’s fees from the residential mortgage debtor prior to the commencement of foreclosure; upon commencement, however, all attorney’s fees which are reasonable and actually incurred may be charged to the residential mortgage debtor. [41 P.S. § 406]). The Marras, as purchasers of property at a tax upset sale, received fee simple title to the property subject to any recorded mortgage. 72 Pa.C.S. § 5860.608 and § 5860.609. The Bank’s sole interest in the property was as <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>security for the payment of the mortgage and compliance with the law (notice provisions of Act 6) in no way adversely affects that security interest.

The general acceleration clause (paragraph 18) provides for the lender’s option to declare all of the sums secured by the mortgage to be immediately due and payable upon the borrower’s breach of any covenant or agreement in the mortgage i.e., the failure to make monthly mortgage payments. The due-on-sale clause (paragraph 17) provides for the lender’s option to declare all of the sums secured by the mortgage to be immediately due and payable if, all, or any part of the property or any interest therein is sold or transferred by the borrower without the lender's prior written consent.</p>

The foreclosure pro<a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>ceedings resulted in a judgment against the Apgars, and the sheriffs sale was ordered as a means of executing on the judgment.

The Marras were clearly "residential mortgage debtors” as defined in the Act, being successor record owners who had given notice to the lender. Thus, they were entided to notice of the lender’s intention to foreclose at least thirty days in advance of the commencement of the foreclosure proceedings. Even if there was nothing the Marras could do to cure the default, by the terms of the Act they were entitled to notice.</p>

In that case, the mortgagor sought to set aside a sheriff’s sale on grounds that the mortgagee had violated the local rule by sending notice of the entry of judgment and impending sheriff's sale to the mortgaged premises and not to the mortgagor's home. This Court affirmed the lower court’s refusal to set aside the sale. We noted that the mortgagor had visited the premises and seen that the locks had been changed and improvements had been made, yet did not file suit until approximately three months after the sale.
