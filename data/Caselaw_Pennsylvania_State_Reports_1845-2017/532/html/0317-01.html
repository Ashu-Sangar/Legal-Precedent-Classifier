The sole issue before this Court is whether the lower courts erred in holding that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to withdraw the guilty plea because appellant, although informed as to the maximum sentence imposable for each count, was not informed that the sentences could be imposed consecutively. Appellant contends that counsel’s failure caused him to enter a guilty plea which was not knowing and intelligent as required by law. He maintains that he thought his sentences would run concurrently, thus resulting in a possible maximum sentence of only two (2) to five (5) years, rather than seven and one-half (7/6) to fifteen (15) years imprisonment. The Commonwealth responds that appellant was adequately informed of the permissible range of sentences for each of the offenses charged which is all that is required by law and that no showing Of manifest injustice has been made.</p>

We note that if counsel had objected to the inadequate colloquy, the correct maximum sentence would have been explained and the defect corrected.
