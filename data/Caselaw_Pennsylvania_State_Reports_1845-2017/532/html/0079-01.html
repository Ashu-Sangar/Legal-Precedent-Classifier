At approximately 9:00 P.M. appellant asked another friend, Karen Hanna, to drive him to Sandy Nace’s house. The friend obliged and after briefly speaking with Nace, appellant and Nace returned to the bar to meet again with Ault. An hour later appellant left the bar with Nace to visit Marcellus Barnett, at Barnett’s apartment.</p>

Barnett drew a diagram for <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>appellant and Nace to help them familiarize themselves with the layout of the apartment. Thereafter, appellant and the others walked downtown. At this time appellant indicated that the job would not require masks since there was a good possibility that the victims would have to be killed.</p>
    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[243,587,1162,351]]]'>Later that evening Barnett discovered from a friend that the proposed victim, Mr. Conrad, did not have a substantial amount of money or weapons at the apartment, and thus he sought to inform appellant that the job was not worth the risk. Unfortunately for the victims this information was never delivered. It was not until the next day that Barnett learned of the murders.</p>

Appellant told Barnett that it had been an easy job and gave details of the murders. He also told Barnett that he would be staying at a local motel under the assumed name of James Long. Barnett informed the police of appellant’s crimes and his plans, and further told the police that appellant was probably armed. The police set up a surveillance of the motel. Police arrived at the motel at approximately 3:00 A.M. and were instructed not to act unless appellant appeared to be leaving the scene.</p>

At approximately 6:25 A.M. on the following day, appellant left his room and walked toward an outside vending machine. The police officers moved in and placed him under arrest. At the time of this arrest appellant had a knife on his belt, a handgun in his boot, and two rings and necklace later identified as belonging to Paul Conrad.</p>

Police found the victims bound at the hands and feet with tape. Duct tape completely covered their eyes, nose and mouth. Knotted pieces of clothing were discovered in each victims’ mouth. Electrical cords were wrapped tightly around their necks. The cause of death for each was strangulation <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>coupled with multiple stab wounds. In addition, Walck testified that appellant told him that he had anally penetrated Ms. Wiker prior to her death.</p>

In this case, both the appellant and the victims were Caucasian.</p>

He was questioned at the police station over a period of several hours. Mr. Barnett informed the police of his involvement in providing appellant with a layout diagram of Paul Conrad’s apartment and other information possibly linking appellant to the murders. Barnett additionally stated that he believed that appellant was staying at the Parkside Motel under the assumed name of James Long and that he was probably armed. Following this interview the police attempted to corroborate as much of the given information as possible.</p>

Moreover, even if Barnett is not considered as an accomplice there was evidence to establish his reliability. First, he was a named informant and not an anonymous source. Second, these statements were made against his penal interest in that he admitted to the conspiracy to commit burglary/robbery. <em>Commonwealth v.

Thus, these items were properly admitted at trial. In addition, all the items taken from appellant at the time of his booking at the police station, in particular a zodiac charm necklace and two rings later identified as belonging to Mr. Conrad, and an address book, were properly seized as part of an inventory search; thus, they were admissible at trial.</p>

Moreover, the witness’ answer was unresponsive to the question since the Commonwealth sought to establish how the witness met appellant at his apartment on the night of the murder.

This witness, in testifying about the statements he received from appellant, stated that appellant denied knowing the victims. Following this testimony, the Commonwealth sought to introduce into evidence the address book and the folded loose sheet of paper found in the book. They were relevant, the Commonwealth argues, because the address book contained the name and address of one of the victims, Ms. Wiker, and the sheet of paper had the address and phone number of appellant’s co-defendant Sandy Nace written on it. Accordingly, Detective Dennis Arnold testified that he took possession of appellant’s <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>personal belongings at the time of his booking, which included the address book and paper.</p>

Since the evidence presented at the guilt phase is incorporated into the penalty phase of the trial, the credibility of Barnett was still at issue and would be relevant to the jury should it have to balance the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

The General Assembly obviously deemed it unnecessary to include accomplice participation in a killing as a specific mitigating factor.
