Following preliminary investigation under JIRB Rule 1, notice of formal charges was issued to Justice Larsen setting forth two allegations of misconduct. The first charge asserted violations of Pa. Const. Art V, sec. 17(b), and Canons 1, 2, and 3(A) of the Pa.Code of Judicial Conduct with regard to an allegedly improper <em>ex parte </em>communication by Justice Larsen to Judge Eunice Ross relating to a case pending before Judge Ross at the time of the alleged communication. The second charge asserted violations of Pa. Const. Art. V. sec. 17(b), and Canons 1 and 2 of the Pa.Code of Judicial Conduct with regard to his alleged pursuit of an appeal from the grant of variances to a developer for the purpose of coercing an inordinate settlement from the developer, and not with the purpose of enforcing the zoning laws.

Charge IV alleged an identical violation with respect to a separate <em>ex parte </em>communication by Justice Larsen to Judge Narick concerning a different case pending before Judge Narick when the alleged communication occurred. The last added charge, Charge V, alleged violation of Pa. Const. Art. V, sec. 17(b) and Canons 1, 2, and 3A(4) by attempting to influence Judge Narick’s assignment of then pending cases to particular judges.</p>

Disagreement over price and Mr. Ray’s commission impeded the deal.We do not consider this arguable potential for bias to be material to our analysis.

He also indicated that <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>despite his improved prospects in late January and early February after the first non-binding option agreement on the landfill sale was made, he did not want to go back on the gentlemen’s agreement reached in December when prospects were gloomier; he simply did not want to go back on his word. Finally, even after it became apparent that the liens would be paid off, Mr. Zdrale indicated that he still considered the $5,000 price fair, because of the high cost he expected to be necessary to repair the dams on the property.

Attorney Lampl discussed several concerns and rumors he was aware of, which were generally circulating among attorneys regarding Judge Ross’ personal and judicial conduct.

Judge Ross indicated that Justice Larsen eventually stated, “listen, I met two guys on the street and they said to tell Judge Ross in the Homer Douglas Francis case that John Botula took all the money and used it to buy a condominium in Florida.” She indicated that she had <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>responded that she knew about the condominium, and then told Justice Larsen that he was wrong about who got all the money and listed for Justice Larsen who got what, including the $17,000 which went to Attorney Lampl, but that Justice Larsen replied, “you are doing a good job, but Jon Botula is the one, you go after Jon Botula.” She indicated that Justice Larsen then got up and left pleasantly.

On Thursday, June 5, 1986, six days after her meeting with Justice Larsen, Judge Ross contacted former United States Attorney Peter Vaira.

In his testimony on August 31, 1988, Attorney Vaira indicated that he did not take notes of his discussion with Judge Ross on June 5, 1986, and that his memory of the precise content of their conversation was not clear; but, Judge Ross had indicated in general and “circumspect” terms that Justice Larsen had given her a tip about possible bankruptcy fraud in an estate case based upon information he had received from someone on the street. Attorney Vaira indicated that she had given him no reason to suspect that Justice Larsen had acted from anything but the purest motives in providing her with the “tip” concerning her case. Attorney Vaira conceded that he had no first-hand knowledge of the meeting between Judge Ross and Justice Larsen, and no recollection of any further information from Judge Ross. We note that Attorney Vaira also testified that he had “handled matters involving sensitive political matters like this” before, and that “I know a lot of hearsay, and some people have called me,” but that he had no further first-hand information to relate to the Board. (TR at 1026-27). Attorney Vaira recommended that she discuss the tip with Western District of Pennsylvania United States Attorney Alan Johnson; and he also suggested that she make a written record of the tip, which she indicated was “a good idea.” She did not indicate that she had already begun such a record in her diary.

According to the Board interviewers’ report contained in EX R-23, when interviewed by Board investigators on November 9,1987, Attorney Vaira indicated that Judge Ross had informed him that Justice Larsen had suggested that mob figures or narcotics were involved, and that it was the narcotics aspect which led him to suggest to Judge Ross that she contact U.S. Attorney Alan Johnson. At the hearing in this matter on August 31,1988, Attorney Vaira reviewed EX R-23 and specifically affirmed its accuracy. (TR at 1047). However, following direct and cross-examination, on supplemental inquiry by Board Member Hoyle, Attorney Vaira indicated that Judge Ross had made no mention of “narcotics” or “mob figures” and that those references were merely inaccurate interpolations he had made, the source of which he did not know. (TR at 1048-49). Thus, his reference to the “mob figures” or “narcotics” appears to be a classic “interpolation” type innocent fallacy of testimony, as there is no other indication that Judge Ross or Justice Larsen ever made such a reference. This underscores the effects of the passage of time on the recollections of even the most forthright and disinterested witnesses in this matter. (Vaira, TR at 1047-50; EX R-23).</p>

However, when specifically asked by Board Member Higgins, whether Judge Ross’ concern, as Attorney Vaira recalled perceiving it, was inconsistent with his perception that Justice Larsen had been acting from the best of motives, Attorney Vaira explained that it was not inconsistent, and that the discomfort which he was describing was that which would naturally arise from the fact of the <em>ex parte </em>contact, regardless of whether Justice Larsen had the best of motives for giving Judge Ross the tip.

Arguably, neither the error nor the inaccuracy were mistakes likely to be made in <em>contemporaneous </em>accounts of events, though they were of a type likely to occur in an attempt to reconstruct events later from a more distant past. It is possible that Judge Ross may have been mistaken as to when the diary entries had been made. (Vaira, TR at 1024, 1035-07; Ross, TR at 988-99; EX R-21; EX R-22).</p>

By the time of the August 31,1988 hearing before this Board, U.S. Attorney Johnson had no independent recollection of his conversation with Judge Ross more than two years earlier, a fact he freely and forthrightly conceded. He did authenticate a brief hand written note he had made át the time of the call, and a brief typed memo made shortly after the call. Both indicated that Judge Ross had informed him that Justice Larsen had passed on a tip to Judge Ross that he had received from two men on the street that Jon Botula had received the money in the <em>Estate of Francis </em>case, and that Judge Ross was reporting it to him as a tip on a possible bankruptcy fraud. He indicated that his <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>notes did not reflect an attempt to make a verbatim record of his conversation with Judge Ross. The notes and memorandum do not reflect, nor did U.S. Attorney Johnson recall, that Judge Ross had in any way intimated that Justice Larsen had attempted to influence Judge Ross improperly, or that Justice Larsen had done anything more than pass on a tip based on hearsay regarding her case. There is no mention of mob figures or narcotics in U.S. Attorney Johnson’s notes or memo; thus, confirming that Attorney Vaira’s reference to mob figures or narcotics was merely an inadvertent interpolation on his part, and an example of an innocent fallacy of testimony.

Justice Larsen sat by Judge Ross and had a friendly conversation with her. Judge Ross asked Justice Larsen if he could arrange to have her included on the dais, rather than merely in the audience, for the upcoming AFNA Dinner at which Mrs. Anwar Sadat was to be the featured speaker. Justice Larsen told her he would look into it, and in fact arranged for Judge Ross to be moved onto the dais. (Larsen, TR at 2550-01; Ross, TR at 901, 979).</p>

The article was continued on page A-10 with a large picture of Justice Larsen who was by then campaigning for his retention election in the fall. The article suggested possible impropriety with respect to the sale of Mr. Zdrale’s Fairfield Township property to Justice Larsen. The story noted that Attorney Ashton and Attorney Lampl represented Mr. Zdrale. <em>See </em>Grochet &amp; Gazarick, “Land Sale Scrutinized: FBI Looking Into Zdrale Bankruptcy,” <em>Sunday Tribune </em>— Review, at A-l, A-10 (Greensburg, Pa. 4/19/87).</p>

On cross-examination, Judge Ross’ testimony on this point at the August 30, 1988 hearing before this Board was somewhat confused.

In the same testimony, however, she indicated that she felt from the beginning that Justice Larsen was suggesting that she go after Jon Botula and not the others, despite her knowledge from bank records that others had also received money, and that he was telling her, in effect, to find a fact in a case before her regardless of what the evidence proved. (Ross, TR at 828, 831-33, 835-36, 862). Upon further examination, however, Judge Ross conceded that she had not interpreted Justice Larsen’s words to her as anything but a tip about possible bankruptcy fraud in the <em>Estate of Francis </em>case until after she read about the Zdrale land deal in the April 19, 1987 article, and that only then did she reinterpret his meaning and intent, and decide that the conversation should be reported.

This Board takes official notice of the fact that Judge Ross participated in a teleconference meeting of the JIRB on May 18, 1987, a full month after the appearance of the April 19, 1987 newspaper article, but that Judge Ross made no report of the fact, content, or presumed import of her May 30, 1986 conversation with Justice Larsen as Canon 1 and Canon 3B(3) would require if she had been of the opinion then that Justice Larsen had attempted to influence her improperly. We take further notice of the fact that she remained silent on this point despite the fact that the April 19, 1987 article was itself discussed by the Board during that meeting and despite the fact that she voted with the Board to issue a letter of inquiry to Justice Larsen regarding the content of that article.

Judge Rowley testified, however, that while Judge Ross had mentioned the article and that Justice Larsen had been to see her, Judge Ross had not indicated that Justice Larsen had attempted to influence Judge Ross, and that if she had indicated that, it would have struck him “like bolt of lightening,” and that he would certainly have remembered it. (Rowley, TR at 1130). We find Judge Rowley’s denial, rather than Judge Ross’ assertion, to be credible. Moreover, we note that not only did she not report the incident to Judge Rowley as alleged, but she failed to report the incident subsequently at any of the numerous Board meetings or one-on-one contacts she had with Judge Rowley prior to her actual first report of the incident to Board Counsel Robert Keuch in September 1987.

On or about, October 16, 1987, Justice William Hutchinson formally resigned his position as Justice of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in order to assume the post of Judge of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. His nomination to the Third Circuit post was rumored in the legal press as <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>early as May 4, 1987. Between June 6, 1987, and June 26, 1987, reports of confirmation of the pending nomination by aides to Senators John Heinz and Arlen Specter were published in major newspapers. The nomination was formally submitted on June 26, 1987, and was formally confirmed by the United States Senate on August 7,1987. We note that during this time many presidential nominations were not acted upon, and so until confirmation, the likelihood of a vacancy occurring on our Supreme Court as the result of a resignation by Justice Hutchinson was a matter of prognostication and speculation rather than certainty. These dates coincide with the timing of <em>Judge Ross’ reinterpretation of her May 30, 1986 conversation </em>with Justice Larsen. <em>See Sprague v.

The article suggested that Justice Larsen had specifically intervened with Judge Ross on behalf of Attorney Lampl and Attorney Ashton in the <em>Estate of Francis </em>case, and that Attorney Ashton and Attorney Lampl had been involved in Justice Larsen’s “questionable” and “very favorable” land purchase from Mr. Zdrale at about the same time. The article indicated that Justice Larsen was suspected of impropriety, and that Judge Ross had reported the matter to the Justice Department and to “at least one official of state government.” The source of the disclosures was not revealed. <em>(See </em>Moushey, “Larsen asked relief for lawyers,” <em>Pittsburgh Post Gazette, </em>at 1 (October 8, 1987)).</p>

We note that the FBI report also indicates that Judge Ross had stated, then, that her first report to the JIRB was through Mr. Keuch and not Judge Rowley as she later testified before the Board. Interestingly, in a letter to Board Counsel Keuch regarding the FBI report, she noted that the only error in the report was its reference to the person to whom she reported the incident, but she made no mention of the errors discussed <em>supra </em>at numbers C-15, C-17, and C-20.

      <em>Estate of Francis </em>matter. First, she did not consider communications between Judge Cosetti, Judge Markovitz, or Justice Larsen and herself to be <em>“ex parte,” </em>because she understands (or at least understood) that term to apply only to conversations between a Judge and a party or a party’s counsel. (Ross, TR at 861; <em>see also </em>EX R-3 at 3-22; EX B-10 at 4-20. She noted further that she did not feel she had to report Justice Larsen’s contact with her because that part of the case was no longer before her. (Ross, TR at 861).

Although Judge Ross had indicated her satisfaction with Attorney Lampl’s accounting at a hearing on July 7, 1987, the opinion she filed in February 29, 1988, severely criticized Attorney Lampl, stating that Attorney Lampl was guilty of unethical neglect of the bankruptcy matter, contributing to the “hemorrhaging” of assets from the estate, but nonetheless made no formal findings of misconduct by Attorney Lampl.

Judge Ross’ notes do not purport to relate her conversation with Justice Larsen on May 30,1986 in its entirety. They contain no reference to the unrelated matters she testified that she recalled she and Justice Larsen discussing, and omit reference to the follow-up call. The notation regarding her call to Attorney Vaira is squeezed in as an interlineation and incorrectly notes that she spoke with him at Cindrich’s (law firm), when in fact she had not. Both the notations regarding her calls to Attorney Vaira and U.S. Attorney Johnson merely noted the contact and neither indicated the specific content of the calls other than that they related to her conversation with Justice Larsen. The brief characterizations of those calls in her notes are also inaccurate. The notes contain no entries for her alleged contacts with Judge Cosetti or Judge Rowley. After a June 9, 1986 entry a long space is left blank with the date 11/10/86 written on the bottom of the following page with the beginning of a new entry, scribbled out. Significantly, the notes do not contain reference to the critical alleged statements, “Botula is the one” or “Go after Botula,” which she testified that she recalled.

Second, if the remark was made to Judge Ross as merely a “tip” (as we find), then Justice Larsen would have had little or no reason to have been attentive to that detail during or immediately after the May 30, 1986 meeting. Hence, Justice Larsen would have no reason to recall the tip by the time accusations were raised concerning that conversation a year and one half later. Third, when the accusations were first made, the corroborated remark was lumped together with the uncorroborated and far more accusatory remarks, “Botula’s the one,” “you go after Botula.” Having forgotten the first remark, and knowing that he had never made the other far more culpable remarks, it is not unlikely that Justice Larsen would have convinced himself that the entire allegation was patently false, though part of it was true.</p>

Finally, it is further rebutted by the fact that her original characterization of the May 30, 1986 comments by Justice Larsen as a “tip” was not recharacterized as an attempt to influence her improperly until after she read the April 19,1987 article suggesting misconduct by Justice Larsen regarding the Fairfield Township Land purchase, almost a full year after the May 30, 1986 meeting.</p>

We reject this suggested motivation for four reasons. First, the record reveals that Attorney Ashton, Attorney Lampl, and Judge Ross, all agree that at the time of the Fairfield Township Land deal and the May 30, 1986 meeting there was no reason to believe that there was any need for Justice Larsen, or anyone else, to intervene on Attorney Lampl’s behalf.

Third, Attorney Ashton initiated discussions regarding the potential sale prior to the issuance of a rule to show cause in the <em>Estate of Francis </em>case, and eventually, actively opposed the favorable land deal, specifically advising Mr. Zdrale not to go through with it. Finally, the assertion is wholly inconsistent with Justice Larsen’s excellent reputation as an ethical jurist.

On December 5,1980, Justice Larsen purchased a luxury condominium in the Marmont development at the apex of Mount Washington in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for $385,000. The condominium was an excellent purchase for Justice Larsen in that it provided him with a luxurious home with a unique scenic view; he was able to purchase it at a discount as the first buyer, and it was expected to appreciate in value at a rate greater than that of the general housing market. The investment potential was a special value to Justice Larsen because judges’ investment opportunities are limited by the ethical obligations of Pa.C.J.C.

While Attorney Grove conducted limited cross-examination and presented no evidence as to the specific effect of the development on Justice Larsen’s condominium, various other objectors raised concerns regarding obstruction of views, removal of foliage, and the deleterious effects of excessive development in the area. We note particularly, the testimony of Ms. Evans who represented 311 neighborhood residents in opposition to the project (Ex B-24(a) at 62-64), Mrs. Parry (Justice Larsen’s next-door neighbor) who objected that about one-third of her scenic view would be obstructed (Ex B-24(a) at 64-65), and Mr. Grealish, the son of the owner of the property abutting the Highpointe site, who also raised objections concerning obstruction of view, overdevelopment, and increased traffic (Ex B-24(a) at 66-67). We also note the generally accommodating posture of the Zoning Board toward Highpointe witnesses and the rather hostile and curt demeanor of the Zoning Board toward the objectors who were cut-off, sped up, and hurried out in a less than impartial manner.

No settlement offers were made by Highpointe to the Parrys despite the fact that Highpointe conceded that their property was more immediately and substantially affected by the proposed project than was Justice Larsen’s property for which they were negotiating compensation for damages. Instead, Highpointe elected to take advantage of the legitimate strategic advantage the Parry’s delay in asserting their rights had created in Highpointe’s favor.

Mr. Parry was chairman of the Alcoa Corporation and his presence in the appeal might substantially lessen any adverse political consequence, as well as divide the costs of appeal. When Highpointe made no steps to finalize settlement, Attorney Mendelson wrote to Judge McCormick and formally withdrew Justice Larsen’s opposition to the Parrys’ intervention motion.

Attorney Mendelson passed this message on to Justice Larsen. Justice Larsen indicated he had also spoken with the Mayor and that he would try to get things moving again. Attorney Mendelson interpreted that as an indication of a <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>change of heart by Justice Larsen, though Justice Larsen had not indicate to him (or presumably the Mayor) that his cooperation would include a modification of his offers as to the amount or timing of settlement.

In June, while the Parry appeal was still pending, Justice Larsen met with Attorney Kelly regarding a possible extension of the final closing date in the Church’s agreement with Highpointe. Justice Larsen explained that because of the Parrys’ appeal, the settlement date could not be met, and that an extension was necessary. When Attorney Kelly suggested that there were other possible buyers, Justice Larsen responded that they would face similar zoning problems, likely delays, and that it would not make sense to go back to square one. Attorney Kelly did not think Justice Larsen was being helpful, and concluded that he was only trying to preserve his own settlement. Nonetheless, an extension was granted by the Church.

While acknowledging this early offer had since mushroomed to over $120,000, Justice Larsen indicated that he intended this as a high offer from which to begin to negotiate down. Attorney Zagari rejected that offer outright, and suggested that Justice Larsen accept the $350,-000 settlement at closing without any compensation for the delay in payment, despite prior delay payment offers by Highpointe. Attorney Cafardi noted that while Attorney Aaronson had sought settlement actively, Attorney Zagari did not. (Zagari, TR at 336-40; Cafardi, TR at 763-68, 782; Larsen, TR at 2777-83).</p>

The negotiations reached an impasse, and the Church indicated that it was not inclined to further extend its option agreement with Highpointe. At Mayor Caliguiri’s request, Justice Larsen agreed to acquire the plans for review by Mr. Scigliano, a real estate developer and close friend of the Mayor, whom the Mayor hoped might be able to salvage the project. Mr. Scigliano had been given plans to review previously by Mr. DiPlacido, but had thrown them away. Justice Larsen told the Mayor that he felt the development was an <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>unwise investment, but nonetheless acquired the plans for Mr. Scigliano to review.

Attorney Zagari was of the opinion that Justice Larsen’s conduct was calculated, nonetheless, to salvage the project and thereby aid Highpointe, the Church, Mayor Caliguiri, and to preserve his own $350,000 settlement as well.

Judge McCormick, however, indicated that he could not recall if he or if Attorney Aaronson had used the phrase, and indicated that if he had said it, he would have meant it “facetiously.” In either case, the oxymoronic figure of speech is of little if any relevance. Judge McCormick testified further that he had no reason to think Justice Larsen had not been acting in good faith, and that he did not believe Justice Larsen had done anything improper. Although Judge McCormick indicated that he did not share Justice Larsen’s view of the anticipated damages, we note the significant fact that neither Justice Larsen nor Highpointe had presented any evidence expert or otherwise to Judge McCormick on the issue of damages, which in fact was not an issue in the proceedings then pending before Judge McCormick, but was relevant only to the parties as an informal guide in settlement negotiations. When asked directly whether he had been informed of the basis for Justice Larsen’s anticipated damages, Judge McCormick responded, “Not very much in detail, but I was aware of what had been done before the hearing board ... we didn’t go into great detail, no.” (Aaronson, TR at 681, 709; McCormick, TR at 1011, 1015-16).</p>

We then apply the law of zoning to the facts of this case and conclude that Justice Larsen’s appeal was highly likely to succeed, and therefore any suggestion of malicious prosecution by Justice Larsen was unfounded. Finally, we find that the law of permanent nuisance rather than eminent domain is the appropriate gauge for determining the reasonableness of Justice Larsen’s settlement demands, and. that given the subjective nature of the damages Justice Larsen was entitled to consider, we cannot say that his settlement offers, which could be inflated for negotiation purposes, were plainly excessive.

      <em>The major drawback of an award of damages for the involuntary sale is the subjectiveness of the plaintiffs injury, and the resulting difficulty in determining the appropriate amount. </em>The injury that results from the trespassory invasion of dispositional rights is the difference between the price at which plaintiff would have voluntarily sold the easement, and the price at which the plaintiff was forced to sell the easement, that is, the market value. For the plaintiff to receive more than nominal damages for his injury, he would have to provide evidence regarding this price difference. <em>The problem here is that the voluntary price is inherently subjective since it is based in part on the subjective valuó that the plaintiff attaches to the property. </em>The court cannot rely solely on the plaintiffs estimation of his own voluntary price, since the temptation would be great to overstate the price he would accept for the easement. <em>The difficulty of determining the exact damages done by a wrongdoer, or of creating a precise formula for computing damages is not, however, cause for denying redress.</em>

The difference between this market value and the voluntary price represents the pecuniary loss due to the infringement of the plaintiffs dispositional rights. Therefore, the award of the voluntary sale price would compensate the plaintiff for both the loss of the easement and the loss of the dispositional rights.

We note that Highpointe’s waiver of the standing issue may have been the result of a simple but significant legal error on Attorney Aaronson’s part. Review of the exhibits submitted reveals that, immediately after the time had passed to submit additional evidence, Attorney Aaronson (who had apparently been lying-in-wait), sent a letter to the Zoning Board Chairman raising the standing issue and insisting that no new evidence be accepted on that issue. (Ex R-10). Attorney Aaronson apparently felt no scruple against pressing what he erroneously perceived to be a technical (albeit lawful and legitimate) strategic advantage.

    <p id="b655-9" data-blocks='[["BL_655.11",655,[193,1282,1154,308]]]'>I most reluctantly dissent from the action taken by my colleagues in adopting the recommendation of the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board. I do not reach the merits, as my colleagues have, and I do not question the correctness of the decision on the merits as may appear in the record filed with us by the Judicial Inquiry and Review Board.</p>
    <p id="b655-10" data-blocks='[["BL_655.12",655,[192,1607,1153,203]]]'>Rather, my deep concern arises from the fact that I believe that the entire proceedings have been tainted with procedural infractions of the rules and the substitution of members of the Board participating in successive hearings.</p>
    <p id="b655-11" data-blocks='[["BL_655.13",655,[191,1827,1155,310]]]'>I believe that it was error for the Board to file with us a record on charges they found to be unsubstantiated and for which the Board made no recommendation. I believe this to be a violation of the constitutional mandate of confidentiality for all matters in which no recommendation of sanction is made to the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p id="b655-12" data-blocks='[["BL_655.14",655,[191,2154,1154,197]]]'>The record should have been filed with us which included only the charge which the Board found to have been substantiated and for which the recommendation of public censure was made.</p>

      <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>My objections to the composition of the Board which concluded the proceedings against Mr. Justice Larsen and my views as to the proper procedures to have been followed have been fully articulated in my Dissenting Opinion entered in <em>Larsen v. Kaufinann, et al., </em><a href="/pa/525/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="314" data-cite="525 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1823721" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0278-01">525 Pa. 278</a>, <a href="/pa/525/0278-01" class="citation" data-index="315" data-cite="525 Pa. 278" data-case-ids="1823721" data-case-paths="/pa/525/0278-01">579 A.2d 1302</a> (1990), and need not be restated here.</p>
    <p id="b656-5" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[241,638,1160,626]]]'>However, in response to my colleagues’ assertion that the participation of the challenged members did not change the outcome, I must point out that this conclusion lies in the realm of conjecture. The recommendation presented to us is surely the product of a compromise between four who would have opted for a more severe sanction and four who settled for much less. Had the four who settled for much less not met the serious opposition of the other four, would they have carried the day for complete exoneration? Either the image of the judiciary is being severely damaged or the rights of the Respondent have been trampled upon. Under the present circumstances, we cannot know.</p>
    <p id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.6",656,[235,1284,1164,520]]]'>Suffice it to say that, in my view, the adding of new charges to proceedings under way, the participation in new hearings by Board members whose terms had expired, and the refusal of this Court to resolve the constitutional issues raised by Mr. Justice Larsen, all of which were held as interlocutory by a divided court on the premise that we can cure any defect upon the filing of a record and recommendation, call for a remand to a properly constituted Judicial Inquiry and Review Board which has jurisdiction to hear and resolve the charge underlying the recommendation of public censure.</p>
    <p id="b656-7" data-blocks='[["BL_656.7",656,[234,1823,1160,363]]]'>The errors alleged by Mr. Justice Larsen and the violations of constitutional rights which he claims in his various petitions to this Court which were held to be interlocutory by a divided Court remain unresolved. The Board cannot resolve these issues as a trial court may. Its only duty is to make a recommendation to our Court as to a proper sanction that may be imposed. Only this Court can now answer those issues.</p>
    <p id="b656-8" data-blocks='[["BL_656.8",656,[233,2205,1161,149]],["BL_657.1",657,[189,310,1155,316]]]'>I realize that this has been a long and trying experience for all parties involved, including this Court which has been put to the unenvious task of judging one of its own on charges of <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>judicial misconduct. The resolution wrought by my colleagues may bring to a close, once and for all, this sad episode and it may be the wise thing to do. However, I feel that the constitutional infirmities I find to have been committed by the Board can only be exonerated by remanding for new hearings on the charge submitted to us.</p>
