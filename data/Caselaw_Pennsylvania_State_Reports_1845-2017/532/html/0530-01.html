    <p id="b698-10" data-blocks='[["BL_698.11",698,[210,1572,1164,797]]]'>The specific facts surrounding the immediate controversy are as follows. Appellant, Midland Education Association, is the exclusive bargaining representative for purposes of collective bargaining on behalf of a bargaining unit comprised of the professional employees of Midland Borough School District, appellee herein. Appellant and appellee were parties to a two year collective bargaining agreement effective September 1, 1984, through August 31, 1986. On April 9, 1986, Appellee School District announced that it had entered into an agreement with the Beaver Area School District to send its seventh through twelfth grade students to the Beaver Area School District on a tuition basis. This agreement eliminated all teaching positions in grades seven through twelve in the Midland School District and transferred the students in those grades to the Beaver Area School District.</p>

While the grievance was pending, the District implemented its decision to tuition out grades seven through twelve beginning August 26, 1986.</p>

The lower court vacated the arbitrator’s rescission of the subcontracting agreement, the requirement that the appellee resume bargaining in good faith, and the order that appellee rehire and make whole the affected teachers no later than the 1987-88 school year. The Commonwealth Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas and concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his authority in ordering post-expiration relief. <em>Midland Education Assoc, v.

Once such a determination has been favorably made, appellant argues, judicial scrutiny of the resulting award must cease. Maintaining that this principle fosters the well-established policy favoring the resolution of labor disputes and questions of arbitrability by the arbitration process itself, appellant argues that deference must be given to the conclusions and awards of arbitrators in observance of the restrictions upon judicial scrutiny.</p>

This is especially true when it comes to formulating remedies. There the need is for flexibility in meeting a wide variety of situations.

Nevertheless, an arbitrator is confined to interpretation and application of the collective bargaining agreement; he does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources, yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its <em>essence </em>from the collective bargaining agreement.

Although traditionally a great deal of deference is to be given to decisions of arbitrators, courts nonetheless have the obligation to review those decisions when properly called upon to do so. In this case the challenge raised is to the fundamental jurisdiction of the arbitrator and his power to implement a remedy which is to extend beyond the expiration of the controlling collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the question of jurisdiction presents an issue separate from, and not controlled by, the fundamental axiom that awards of arbitrators are of no concern for the courts. Specifically, it is claimed that the jurisdictional power of the arbitrator to issue the award in question became void as his powers automatically terminated upon the expiration of the very agreement from which his powers derived. Consequently, it is maintained, any remedy designed to remain in effect beyond the August 31, 1986 expiration of the collective bargaining agreement is necessarily a nullity, lacking any force or effect.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

The presence of this authority, which has allowed for differing forms of remedies to remain in effect beyond the expiration of the related agreements, is argued to demonstrate the viability of the concept allowing contractual rights to survive beyond contract expiration. Appellant further asserts, on policy grounds, that the employer’s statutory duty to bargain in good faith must be enforced before an employer unilaterally terminates its employees or the protections provided through a collective bargaining agreement are rendered illusory.</p>

Enforcement of the award issued by this arbitrator would require Appellee to reopen an already closed facility and resume teaching grades seven through twelve again. Additionally, it is argued that since the arbitrator derives his authority from the agreement itself, such authority necessarily expires with the agreement. An arbitrator may not, therefore, mandate compliance with a remedy awarded which exceeds the life of the contract, nor may he issue an award which requires exceeding the boundaries of authority granted him under the collective bargaining agreement as such an award cannot be deemed to represent a reasonable interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>See County of Centre v.
