    <p id="b296-4" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[248,543,1161,743]]]'>At the suppression hearing, Appellant was able to establish only that the informant may have had a motive for cooperating with the police, not that he did not purchase the drugs from Baker, which would have been difficult to demonstrate especially in light of Agent Way’s allegations that he supplied the informant with money with which to purchase the drugs on four occasions and that the informant gave the drugs to the Agent each time. In short, we conclude that the evidence offered at the suppression hearing was insufficient to establish a corrupting influence on the part of the police or that such information was improperly withheld from the magistrate. The trial court was correct in concluding that the warrant was issued upon probable cause and in rejecting Appellant’s motion to suppress the cocaine seized during the search.</p>
