Appellant was sentenced to pay <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>a fine of $100.00 and costs of prosecution. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court, whereupon, in a memorandum decision, the conviction was affirmed, <a href="/citations/?q=413%20Pa.%20Super.%20645" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="413 Pa.

We reverse.</p>
    <p id="b736-5" data-blocks='[["BL_736.5",736,[232,605,1161,844]]]'>The factual background of the case is as follows. On June 7, 1988, a police officer received a report that there was an underage drinking party in progress near Bear Creek in Elk County. Driving a marked police vehicle, the officer went to the scene, and, upon arriving there at approximately 11:30 a.m., he observed a number of individuals fleeing from the area. Appellant and another individual were not among those who fled. Rather, they remained standing next to a vehicle owned by appellant. Located on the hood of the vehicle was an open can of a commonly known brand of beer. There were also some kegs of malt beverage in the vicinity. The officer did not observe anyone drinking, but smelled what he believed to be beer on appellant’s breath. Accordingly appellant, a minor, was issued a citation. No citation was issued to the individual who had been standing with appellant, as no odor of beer was detected on his breath.</p>
    <p id="b736-6" data-blocks='[["BL_736.6",736,[231,1484,1163,305]]]'>At trial, appellant testified that he had not consumed any alcoholic beverages. He testified that he had arrived at the Bear Creek area just shortly before the police officer arrived and that he did not flee from the scene because he had no reason to run away. The trial court found that this testimony was not credible.</p>
    <p id="b736-7" data-blocks='[["BL_736.7",736,[232,1825,1161,205]]]'>At issue is whether the Commonwealth produced sufficient evidence to prove that appellant had been drinking a malt or brewed beverage in violation of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. § 6308. The applicable standard of review is</p>
    <blockquote id="A06" data-blocks='[["BL_736.8",736,[272,2049,1120,314]]]'>whether, viewing all the evidence admitted at trial, together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could have found that each element of the offenses charged was supported by evidence and inferences sufficient in law to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

Nor does the record contain any scientific evidence establishing the alcohol content of any beverage that appellant might have consumed. See generally <em>Commonwealth v.
