It is axiomatic that within constitutional limits, the General Assembly is empowered to pass legislation, define the terms of its legislation, and amend its definitions as it sees fit, and the fact that Harristown does not meet the original definition of agen<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>cy as that term appears in the Sunshine Act and the Right to Know Law is of no consequence, for Act 153 changes the definition of agency in those acts. With respect to the <em>Mooney </em>case, there is no application, for Temple University, unlike Harristown, was never defined in legislation as an agency.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> And finally, it is simply inaccurate, without qualification, to say that the General Assembly may not define an entity as an agency merely because it does business with the state, or that the entity’s charter is of any significance in deciding whether the entity is an agency for the purposes of Act 153. In short, Commonwealth Court’s determination that Harristown is not subject to the requirements of the Sunshine Act and the Right to Know Law because it is not an agency is in error. Harris-town, which leases property to the Commonwealth far in excess of $1,500,000, is plainly an agency as that term is defined by Act 153.</p>

Assuming, as Harristown argues, that Act 153 abrogates some of the provisions of the Nonprofit Corporation Law and that there is an irreconcilable conflict between the two statutes, the special provisions of Act 153 clearly take precedence over the Nonprofit Corporation Law. Further,» even if the Nonprofit Corporation Law were more recently enacted, in order for it to control, Harristown would have to show that the General Assembly <em>manifestly </em>intended for the general provisions of the Nonprofit Corporation Law to control the particular provisions of Act 153, a showing that is conspicuously absent on this record. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1933, above.

Although Harristown has taken pains to point out that there is no legislative statement of purpose, it overlooks the fact that the burden is on it, not on the Commonwealth, to demonstrate that there is no rational basis for the classification. Further, if a reviewing court detects a rational basis, "from whatever source,” the statute must be upheld. <em>Pa. Liq. Cont. Bd. v.

A concrete example of the difficulties anticipated by Tilghman is his observation that Harristown is a tax exempt organization which finances its buildings with tax exempt bonds. The bonds pay tax exempt interest, however, only so long as Harristown operates in such a way as to satisfy federal regulations. Should Harristown’s tax exempt status be revoked, Tilghman notes the possibility that there would be a default on bond payments, that Harristown may be sued by its bondholders, and/or that the Commonwealth may be forced to pay increased rent. When the volume of rental payments is so high, the possibility of significant disruption to the Commonwealth is a legitimate concern.</p>

Harristown also asserts that Act 153 violates Article III, Section 32 of the Pennsylvania Constitution in that it creates a class having only one member.
