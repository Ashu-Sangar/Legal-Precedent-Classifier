Fuller, however, notes that these materials, which consisted of a copy of the EEOC charge form and counsel’s cover letter, contained no new allegations of discriminatory conduct. The EEOC charge form, being a copy, obviously contained nothing more than the allegations that had been made when it was filed in 1983. As previously indicated, this form identified December 2, 1982, the date of the layoff, as being the “[djate most recent or continuing discrimination took place.” Counsel’s cover letter stated: “On December 3, 1984, Mr. Vincent’s ‘layoff became a permanent termination. Therefore, for purposes of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, December 3, 1984, is the date the most recent discriminatory action took place.” We cannot agree with counsel’s conclusory assertion that Fuller’s failure to recall Vincent during the two year period following his layoff, and thus the automatic termination of his employment at the end of that period, constituted an action separate from the layoff itself for purposes of a claim of discrimination.</p>

According to Vincent, the EEOC document alleged “that other job openings existed after December 3, 1982 for which Vincent was qualified but was not considered, resulting on his discriminatory termination on December 3, 1984.

In this context, the only fair inference that can be drawn from the third and fourth paragraphs is an allegation that at a time when there were positions open that Vincent was qualified for, Fuller hired younger people to fill them and put Vincent on layoff rather than transferring Vincent to one of the open positions. We do not agree that the EEOC complaint contains the “implicit notion” that Fuller refused to consider Vincent for “the many job openings existing during his temporary layoff period.” It was not until the amended complaint was filed with the Commission on May 11,1985, that Vincent made any allegations that Fuller had refused to consider him for positions it filled during the recall period.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Vincent argues that many of the cases cited by Fuller recognize claims of "continuing discrimination" during periods when laid-off employees are eligible for recall. This mischaracterizes the holdings of those cases. To the extent that causes of action were recognized, they were for specific allegations of discriminatory acts occurring during that period. Moreover they did not extend the limitation period from the date of the layoff to the end of the recall period, but rather recognized distinct actionable conduct to which a separate filing period applied.</p>

Superior Court affirmed this holding and Vincent did not raise it in his Petition for Allowance of Appeal, thus rendering it the law of the case.</p>
