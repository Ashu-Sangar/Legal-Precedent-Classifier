First, whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury about the reporting requirements of the <em>Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, </em><a href="/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2011101" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="42 U.S.C. § 11101">42 U.S.C. § 11101</a> <em>et seq. </em>(hereinafter “the Health Care Act”).

Mrs. Levine testified that she had been a patient of Dr. Rosen for approximately nineteen years, when she went to visit his office on July 25, 1980, due to her complaint that the right nipple had become discolored and inverted. According to Mrs. Levine’s testimony, Dr. Rosen assured her that she was fine and did not order any diagnostic tests such as mammography or a biopsy.</p>
    <p id="b681-8" data-blocks='[["BL_681.8",681,[148,1279,1158,746]]]'>Mrs. Levine testified that on October 20,1981, she returned to Dr. Rosen, who examined her and again reported that she was fine, despite her continuing complaints about the right nipple. Dr. Rosen did not order any diagnostic tests during that visit. On December 30, 1981, Mrs. Levine took it upon herself to have a mammogram performed, which revealed a mass in her right breast indicative of adenocarcinoma. A biopsy performed a week later revealed a diagnosis of infiltrating and moderately to poorly differentiated duct carcinoma of the right breast. It was also determined that four out of twenty-four lymph nodes were involved. On January 15,1982, Mrs. Levine underwent a right modified radical mastectomy and was treated with chemotherapy for approximately one year.</p>

He further testified that had she received an earlier mammogram, there was an increased chance that <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>her four lymph nodes would not have been involved. The involvement of the lymph nodes increased the risk that cancer would recur. Mrs. Levine’s expert testified further that Dr. Rosen was negligent for not ordering a mammogram every year after Mrs. Levine reached her 50th birthday, according to the American Cancer Society recommendations.</p>

We held that there must be a considerable number of physicians, recognized and respected in their field, sufficient to create another “school of thought”.
