    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[175,485,1160,1432]]]'>After appellant’s direct appeal from his first trial, he acquired evidence that the Commonwealth had obtained his conviction by overreaching in two respects. Specifically, he learned that the prosecution’s chief witness, Mr. Martray, who denied the existence of any bargain in exchange for his testimony against appellant, was in fact awaiting sentencing for unrelated crimes and did in fact receive favorable treatment by the Commonwealth at his sentencing. Appellant was thereby precluded from impeaching Mr. Martray’s veracity by exposing his motivation to testify falsely against appellant in order to minimize his own punishment. Secondly, appellant learned that the Commonwealth knowingly withheld physical evidence by hiding the fact that grains of sand were discovered between the toes of the murder victim at her autopsy, failing to present this evidence at appellant’s trial and failing to apprise appellant of the evidence in compliance with <em>Brady, supra. </em>The significance of the sand lay in the fact that the scene of Susan Reinert’s murder was unresolved; it was possible that the murder did not take place where the body was discovered but somewhere else and that the body was afterwards moved to the place of discovery. The prosecution theory was that the murder took place in Pennsylvania, whereas the defense theory was that the murder occurred in Cape May, New Jersey, where Bradfield had been and appellant had not. Thus the existence of the sand was potentially exculpatory to appellant, and the Commonwealth deliberately concealed the evidence for more than two years after the trial.</p>
    <p id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[176,1938,1156,410]],["BL_348.1",348,[230,315,1164,735]]]'>Due to the fact that appellant learned of these incidents of misconduct long after his trial, they were not part of the record at the time of his direct appeal. Upon remand to the trial court, appellant moved for discharge on the basis of the after-discovered evidence. Hearings were held, and the trial court found as fact that both incidents of misconduct were committed by the Commonwealth. The adhesive “lifters” used to remove and retain the sand from between the victim’s <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>toes were discovered by the Commonwealth during appellant’s trial but were not disclosed to appellant despite the prosecutor’s awareness of their importance. This is established by a mid-trial memorandum from the assistant attorney general who prosecuted appellant to his superior, the executive deputy attorney general, stating: “It is obvious from [defense counsel’s] tactics thus far that he will attempt to establish that Mrs. Reinert was killed at the shore in Cape May, New Jersey by William Bradfield, Chris Pappas, and Susan Myers. The sand, therefore, is extremely material to the defense case.” Similarly, the Commonwealth deliberately denied the existence of the agreement pursuant to which its witness, Mr. Martray, received extremely lenient treatment at his sentencing in return for his testimony against appellant.</p>
    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[229,1070,1162,255]]]'>Such misconduct, standing alone, would suffice to implicate the protection of the double jeopardy clause.

He testified on cross-examination that he had used adhesive lifters to remove granular particles which looked like sand from between the victim’s toes. The Commonwealth excoriated Corporal Balshy, implying that he had fabricated his testimony about the adhesive lifters. The Commonwealth then presented the testimony of other state police officers who had attended the autopsy and did not remember the sand or the adhesive lifters, attempting to prove that Balshy’s testimony was false. The prosecutor even recommended to the deputy executive attorney general that he investigate the feasibility of prosecuting Balshy for perjury. A few days later, <em>while appellant’s trial was still in progress, </em>the Pennsylvania state police discovered the missing adhesive lifters in their evidence locker at the state police barracks. Despite their significant relation to the facts at issue in the trial, the Commonwealth suppressed the discovery. Then for <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>more than two years, while appellant’s case was on direct appeal to this court, the Commonwealth continued to suppress the fact that it had in its possession the disputed exculpatory evidence, vigorously arguing all the while that this court should affirm appellant’s death sentence.</p>
    <p id="b349-4" data-blocks='[["BL_349.5",349,[176,577,1155,672]]]'>Meanwhile, Corporal Balshy was made the scapegoat for the misconduct on the theory that he had fabricated and “planted” the evidence after the autopsy. It was even argued by the Commonwealth at appellant’s trial that the defense had paid Balshy to concoct his testimony about the sand and the lifters. Investigations conducted after trial by the state police and by the attorney general’s office concluded that there was no evidence of perjury or falsification of evidence by Balshy. Finally, on July 12, 1988, the attorney general’s office informed defense counsel that the missing lifters had been discovered, though <em>even then, </em>there seemed to be some hesitancy concerning the prosecutor’s duty to disclose the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b349-5" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[172,1277,1158,739]]]'>It is a gross understatement to conclude, as stated by the trial court and Superior Court that “neither the Attorney General’s Office nor the Pennsylvania State Police can take any great pride in the manner in which this case was handled during the trial and on appeal.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Deliberate failure to disclose material exculpatory physical evidence during a capital trial, intentional suppression of the evidence while arguing in favor of the death sentence on direct appeal, and the investigation of Corporal Balshy’s role in the production of the evidence rather than its own role in the suppression of evidence constitute prosecutorial misconduct such as violates all. principles of justice and fairness embodied in the Pennsylvania Constitution’s double jeopardy clause.</p>

But we do hold that the circumstances under which such a defendant may invoke <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.</blockquote>

In <em>Simons, </em>the defendant made a “doubtful” claim that the prosecutor failed to make full disclosure of a plea agreement with a Commonwealth witness, but the prosecutor’s conduct clearly was not intended to provoke a mistrial nor to prejudice the defendant.
