Boilers to be used for making steam to roll, draw, twist and cut wire and to pump water for the works.” The wire company agreed to pay a certain price per ton “ for all iron or steel made from billets into wire,” and another price per ton “ for all iron or steel made from billets into wire rods, which is not made into wire.” <em>Held, </em>that the tonnage upon the basis of which the gas was to be paid for was the tonnage of the finished product, and not of the steel billets from which the finished product was made.</p>

It seems that the company started to make wire rods alone in 1885 or 1886, the Peoples Natural Gas Company furnishing them gas. In November, 1887, a contract was made between the two for the year 1888, in which it is plainly contemplated that the product is to be not only rods but wire. That contract, so far as I recall it, and everything relative to this matter, is in the same words as the <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>contract for the eighteen months beginning at the first of January, 1889. They operated first under a contract prior to that, and then under what, in the evidence, has been called the second contract, for the year 1888, and then under the third contract for the eighteen months ending July, 1890. They established a course of dealing with each other. The defendant company and its officers were intelligent men, and understood the business of the gas company, at least in a general way. The officers, some of the leading ones of the gas company, were very intelligent men. They were on the stand before you, and if you do not conclude that the president of the company especially, and one or two of the others, are very intelligent men, thoroughly well posted on the subject-matter, and understand machinery and mills, you will come to a different conclusion from what I anticipate you will. The evidence shows that, before and at the time of making this contract, the officers of the gas company were familiar with this mill and the manner of operating it. Some of the principal officers were there very frequently, and they knew it so well that they undertook to advise at different times in regard to the manner it should be run. They knew the boilers and engines, and knew the arrangement of the mill, and how it was run. I do not think there is any dispute or can be any doubt that that is the fact.] ” [7]</p>

    <p id="b46-9" data-blocks='[["BL_46.10",46,[247,2071,1170,351]]]'>The principal contention in this ease was, whether, under the contract of 1889 the tonnage on which the gas bills were based was upon the steel billets that were used, that is, the raw material, or the product of it. The learned judge below instructed the jury that the tonnage was to be based upon the product. The able argument of appellant’s counsel has failed to satisfy us that this instruction was erroneous.</p>

      <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>There were a number of other items in plaintiff’s claim, which it is alleged were not included in the contract, and for which the defendant company should pay. Some of these claims were sustained in part by the learned judge of the court below and others were submitted to the jury under fair instructions. We do not think it is necessary to discuss them in detail. The appellant complains of that portion of the charge of the learned judge, embodied in the seventh specification, in which he refers to the course of dealing between these parties. We do not think this reference objectionable. It was used to illustrate the construction placed upon this contract by the parties themselves ; when we are asked to say what the parties meant or intended by their contract, it is entirely safe to point to their own construction of it, as evidenced by their course of dealing under it.</p>
