Vernon street by a culvert. In 1883 or 1884, Joseph Strickler, whose lands adjoined Mt. Vernon street, continued the culvert across his lot up to the line of defendant’s land. Defendants then continued the culvert across their property up to a point near plaintiff’s land. There was evidence that in 1887 a natural gas company laid its pipe along Mt. Vernon street and through the upper part of the culvert, diminishing its carrying capacity nearly one third. During the years 1887 and 1888, the injuries complained of were caused by the waters backing up on plaintiff’s land. Defendants’ evidence showed that during these years there were extraordinarily heavy freshets.</p>

But they say that since that time, 1885, prior to which time, a few years, the defendants obtained a lot of land adjoining the plaintiffs’ property, that they have been troubled by the water running on to their land from the defendants.</p>

Yerno u avenue and finds its way into the creek: and they say that this has been caused by obstructions placed by the defendants in that stream, and they have spoken particularly about two kinds of obstructions. They say, in the first place, that the defendants placed boards there in the line fence, or in the opening of the sewer that he had constructed there, in such a way as to dam up the water and throw it off of their premises on to the premises of the plaintiffs, and that they had constructed a sewer over the defendants’ lot which was insufficient to carry off the volume of <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>water in that stream in the ordinary and usual stages. And when I speak of ordinary and usual stages, you will remember that I mean, not only in dry seasons, hut the ordinary and usual freshets to which that stream is subject. They say that by reason of this they have been damaged ; that their sod has been washed and that they have been unable to have the use of the pasture that they would otherwise have, because of its being covered with this water; and further that at one time their fence was washed away, and for that, also, they ask jmu to give them damages.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[258,1210,1171,960]]]'>“ If the water was thrown upon their land by reason of the obstructions placed there by the defendants, the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover at least nominal damages ; and if they have proven any actual damages done to their land by reason of the overflow, they would be entitled to compensation for that damage, whatever it would be, and Mr. Bierer says the fence cost ten dollars once when it was washed away, and that at another time it required two hands half a day to repair it; that they lost the use of the pasture on that land which occasioned them loss in addition to the fence matter. Now he places an estimate on that of from three to five hundred dollars, I believe. Another witness, Mr. Duer, although not seeing the water, perhaps, at the time it was flowing over the land, says that he visited the place and saw where the water had been, and that it came from Hurst on to the plaintiffs’ land, and then off on to Thompson’s and away; and he says, if that had occurred frequently, he would think the damage would be from two to three hundred dollars, I believe, but he didn’t know how often it had occurred or what the damage was.</p>

Vernon avenue. He has also called your attention to a barrel which has been placed along his sewer somewhere about the middle of it as I recall it—perhaps not so far down as the middle of his lot—right on top of the sewer, and in which he and other witnesses have testified that they have seen the water rise to within six or eight inches of the top of the barrel, fully as high as the water was at the point where it entered the sewer at the Bierer line; and from the testimony in regard to the size of the sewer on his property and others below him, and the height of the water in this barrel, [they ask you to find that the obstruction isn’t upon his property, but below, and that the damage if any is not occasioned by any obstruction placed by him in that stream, but by somebody below him obstructing the stream to such an extent that it backed the water up, not only upon him, but upon Mr. Bierer as well.] [3]</p>
