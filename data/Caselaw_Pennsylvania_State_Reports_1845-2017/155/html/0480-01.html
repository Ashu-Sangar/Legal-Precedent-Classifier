      <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>At the trial, before Gunnison, P. J., it appeared that on Aug. 20,1877, Win. McDougal executed an oil lease to Charles A. Arndt and James W. Gray. By the terms of the lease the lessor was to receive “one fourth of the oil obtained on the lease, to be delivered in any good pipe-line that may be connected with this well or wells on this lease, and to be credited to first party on the books of said line at their office.” On Oct. 19, 1877, the lessees assigned the lease to defendant. The latter did not sign the lease nor the assignment of the same. On June 25,1879, defendant wrote to the pipe-line and directed them to run all of the oil to his credit. This was done and no oil was placed to MeDougal’s credit until over a year afterwards. Defendant claimed that the transfer of the oil to his account was made under an order from McDougal, but there was no direct evidence to establish this. A former employee of the pipe-line company testified that transfers of interests were made only upon orders in writing.</p>

When the best evidence is a written instrument of some kind, that is the best evidence and must be either furnished or its absence accounted for. Sometimes the best evidence that the nature of the case admits of is hearsay evidence, and in that case hearsay evidence is admissible. If the man who runs the oil and gauges it throughout the year does not keep a record of it, he could not testify as to it. He could not remember every day’s run. Unless he keeps a record of it that would be no evidence at all. I do not know how that is, it is not shown so far.</p>

    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.11",505,[148,1156,1169,505]]]'>The plaintiff was legally competent to bring this suit. He had settled an account, but he had not been discharged from the trust which his appointment imposed. It sufficiently appeared that Short was the assignee of the lease, and received the production from the wells upon the leasehold. It was his duty to account for the royalty reserved. This he had not done. The case appears to have been carefully tried by the learned judge of the court below, and the result reached is fully justified by the evidenee. We see no error that requires us to dis turb the judgment and it is accordingly affirmed.</p>
