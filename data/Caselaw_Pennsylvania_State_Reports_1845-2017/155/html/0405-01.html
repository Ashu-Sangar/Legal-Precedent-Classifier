That he offered said plaintiff to return his policy for cancellation, and pay for the risk while it had existed, but plaintiff made no answer.</p>
    <p id="b430-5" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[269,802,1169,809]]]'>It will be noticed that this suit is between the original parties to the note; the affidavit, of course, would be insufficient to maintain a defence against a third party, a holder for value. But whatever agreement was made by plaintiff’s agent, Kemble, when he solicited the risk, took the note payable to plaintiff, and delivered the policy, must be treated as made by the company itself, so far as is disclosed by the record at this stage of the proceedings. Further, on an appeal from this decree, we must take the affidavit of defence as stating the exact truth. The parties then are in this attitude: Says the plaintiff, “ True, I positively promised and agreed with you when you delivered me this note for $371.70 that I would rebate from that amount, or credit at its maturity, with $111.51, and on this promise you took a policy from me of $10,000 on your life. But this agreement was not in writing, and as it contradicts the note I will not stand to it; you must pay the full amount.”</p>

Such an agreement between the parties does not contradict the writing, We have the right to assume from the promise made by plaintiff that 30 per cent rebate would be allowed; they meant defendant would be honestly entitled to receive this sum on his <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>110,000 policy. If, when they so assured him, they told him what was not true, that to allow it would now be a fraud on the other policy holders, then they should have an opportunity of showing on a trial their mistake ; if it was true, if the business of the company did warrant the payment of this amount to him, he is entitled to what was promised, and ought to have a credit with that amount. None of the authorities cited by the learned counsel for appellant touch the question raised by this affidavit of defence between this insurance company and the policy holder. He does not deny that the note is just what it purports to be; admits he signed and delivered it; that he promised to pay the sum specified in it at the time specified; but he alleges plaintiff, in the peculiar transaction of which it formed a part, was, at maturity, to enter a credit of 30 per cent when it became due.</p>
    <p id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[195,1151,1169,506]]]'>The case relied on by counsel for appellant, Zeigler v.

The defence there was, that the note was given on the representation of plaintiff that it was a mere matter of form, and not an obligation to pay the money specified in it. That was a direct contradiction of the instrument, and if enforced made it worthless. Here there is no contradiction, but only the claim of a credit which, by the parol contract, was to be given at maturity. This case ought to go to a jury. The decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at costs of appellant.</p>
