L. 507.</p>
    <p id="b306-6" data-blocks='[["BL_306.5",306,[259,691,1167,452]]]'>After providing for payment of debts and funeral expenses said testator bequeathed to his sons William, George and James and his daughters Elavena and Amanda, five of his children by his first wife, each the sum of one dollar. The residue of his estate, real and personal, he gave in equal shares to his sons Sylvester and Andrew, the two remaining children by said first wife, and appointed his said son Andrew executor of his will. The two children by his second wife are not in any manner recognized in the will..</p>
    <p id="b306-7" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[259,1150,1169,288]]]'>The will having been duly admitted to probate, the five children, to each of whom only one dollar was given, appealed from the decision of the register, assigning as the grounds thereof want of testamentary capacity and fraud, misrepresentation and exercise of undue influence in procuring the execution of the instrument.</p>
    <p id="b306-8" data-blocks='[["BL_306.7",306,[260,1456,1167,702]]]'>Before the contention reached a hearing, the parties thereto, contestants and contestees, consisting only of the beneficiaries named in the will—testator’s seven children by his first wife, —came together and jointly executed the agreement of November 16,1888, the main purpose of which was to substitute, for and in lieu of testator’s scheme of distribution, one of their own, whereby the net proceeds of the estate, real, personal and mixed, “ shall be distributed, parted and divided equally, share and share alike” among the said seven children, viz.: Andrew, Sylvester, William, George, James, Elavena and Amanda. They further provided in said agreement that their brother Andrew, by virtue of his appointment as executor and letters testamentary granted to him, should proceed with the settlement and administration of the personal estate, etc.</p>

There is not the slightest indication of an intention to enlarge the class of beneficiaries so as to let in children not recognized by the testator in the distribution of his estate.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[182,849,1162,748]]]'>In view of the facts found by the auditor, appellants might have applied to become parties to the proceedings to contest the validity of the will, or they themselves, as children of the testator, might have inaugurated such proceedings; but they did neither, and the will not having been set aside, they have no right to participate in the fund for distribution, because they take nothing under the will. It needs neither argument nor citation of authority to sustain that proposition. The agreement affected only the distribution. It did not substitute a distribution under the intestate law, but merely an equal distribution among all the beneficiaries named in the will. Appellants were not of that class, and therefore they were not entitled to participate. If the agreement had been for a distribution generally under the intestate law it would have been otherwise.</p>
