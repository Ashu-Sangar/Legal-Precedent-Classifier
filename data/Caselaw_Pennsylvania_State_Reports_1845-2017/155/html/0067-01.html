The wholesale dress-goods department was divided into three sections under the general management of a person other than the buyer in defendant’s old establishment. Plaintiff was directed to take charge of one of these sections, in which the goods were of the same general character as plaintiff had previously handled. Plaintiff refused to take charge of the section of the dress-goods department to which he was assigned, or to perform any duties in relation thereto, and, without authority from anyone, left the dress-goods department and went to another department, where an entirely distinct class of goods were kept, and performed the duties of an ordinary salesman.

I was to be the assistant buyer to Mr. Josiah Bunting, and to move and manage the store ; that is, to move and manage the department at a salary of $6,000 the first year, $6,500 the second year, and $7,500 the third year. I was to be right next to Mr. Bunting he said, for Mr. Bunting was right up to him, and I was to be right next to Mr. Bunting.’ That is what the contract was. He was asked this question : ‘ What part of the dress-goods department of the wholesale department did the conversation relate to ? A. It was the whole. All of the department.’ [He does not say that the contract was that he was to have the privilege of buying all the goods of that department. His understanding was that the conversation related to the whole or all of the goods of that department.] [8] In pursuance of that contract he said he took charge. . . .</p>

[When they got down there, instead of Mr. Bunting being the head of the department, Mr. Andrew C. Sinn was the head of the department, and the department there, being very large, was divided into three parts, one being tendered to Mr. Crawford, one to Mr. Sinn, Jr., and the other to Mr. Elliott, the plaintiff.] [6]</p>

We took our seats, and Mr. Wanamaker said to my brother, “ Robert, you can have the flannels,” and my brother said, “ That is perfectly satisfactory, Mr. Wanamaker; all I ask.” Q. That was the position he filled ? A. Yes, sir. Colonel Hood was sitting in the office, and, as I have said, Mr. Wanamaker told Robert he could have the flannel department, and Robert said, “ That is satisfactory.” He said to me, “James, you can have some of the dress goods.” I said, “ What does that mean ? I would like to see- it more clearly defined.” He said, “ I will call Mr. Sinn; ” and Mr. Sinn was right outside the door, and he called him and he came in, and he said to Mr. Sinn, “ You tell James what ho can have.” Mr. Sinn sat down and said, “ James, you <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>can have the tricots, and sackings, and ladies’ dress goods that are in Parker’s department; they are the same character of goods that you used to keep yourselves when you were in the business.” I said to Mr. Wanamaker, “ Am I to bny these goods and manage the department ? ” Mr. Wanamaker said, “ Not a piece.” I said, “ I can tell you here and now that I will not take any such position.” ’</p>

That is rather a strange word to be used between superior and inferior; but still, he paid it under protest. He said that he protested against Mr. Elliott staying in the department he was not employed to be in. Finally, by letter dated May 25th, Mr. Wanamaker called attention to the fact that Mr. Elliott was still working in the department he was not employed to work in. He said he was willing to continue him in the employment if he would do what the contract called for, enumerating, to wit, manage, sell, and buy in the wholesale dress-goods department. This was a letter calling attention to the fact that the plaintiff was not doing what the defendants desired him to do, that is to say, to serve in the wholesale dress-goods department, but that he was serving in the flannel department, under his brother, selling goods; saying to him that the firm was willing to continue him at his salary, provided he would resume the duties of his employment in the wholesale dress-goods de<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>partment.

Suppose you say to a man: ‘I will give you so much money if you will walk from here down to the navy yard and back,’ and the man says: 4 Yes, I will do it; ’ and suppose he does not do it. He is not entitled to the money. He has not earned it. His willingness amounts to nothing unless he does what he agrees to do.] [10] ....</p>

It is nothing for a man to say, 4 Yes, I will do a thing,’ unless he does it. It appears by plaintilf’s own testimony that he did not. His excuse is that he was not told to do so, to which the answer is, yes, and you were not told to go into the flannel department. You have been there for months and months without anybody telling you to be there. You were asked to go to your proper department. It is true you said you would go there, but you did not, and therefore we discharge you.] [11]</p>

If he has, you will give him a verdict for the amount of the back pay which accrued during the last three months and twelve days he was there.] [12]</p>

If he was insubordinate, if he still persisted, although he said he would go into the proper department, in keeping out of it and keeping in another department to which he was not assigned, Mr. Wanamaker had a right to discharge him, and that ends his salary, and you ought to say so without any fear or favor in the matter.] [13] You ought to decide the question fairly and honestly upon the testimony without any prejudice or svmpatliy. On the other hand, if ho was not insubordinate. <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>and he was wrongfully discharged without any reason whatever, then he is .entitled to pay for the balance of the year less any amount which he may have earned during that time.</p>

First, is he entitled to the wages during the last three months and twelve days he was there. If so, say so by your verdict. Second, is he entitled to the whole or any part of the balance claimed for the remainder of the year ?] [14] He would be if he were improperly discharged, and he would not be if he was properly discharged. If he was insubordinate, if he refused to do what he was asked to do, persisted in doing what he was told not to do, and was insubordinate, then he was properly discharged. Mr. Wanamaker was justified in discharging him if he was insubordinate. There must be some head, some government, some rule of law between employers and employees, and it is the employer’s right to say what the employee shall do within the scope of the contract. Of course, the employer shall not direct the man to go out and clean the streets or do any menial or inferior work. So long as the employer is willing to pay him his wages and furnish him the character of work for which he was employed, it makes no difference whether it is all of the employee’s work that the man is asked to do or only a part. Mr. Elliott had no right to tell Mr. Wanamaker whether he should expand his business or not. Mr. Wanamaker was the sole judge of that. So long as Mr. Elliott was given employment in the line in which he was employed and contracted to work, although it may not have been the whole of it, he was bound to take it and had no right to complain. It is for the employer to say what was to be done and not for the employee. [It appears from the testimony that Mr. Elliott was fidgety and dissatisfied with the change to Eleventh street, and he did for a number of months what he ought not to have done; and if he had been discharged when he said he would not do what he was told to do, to wit, on April. 12th, he was properly discharged, and might have been even afterwards, unless Mr. Wanamaker forgave him what he had done. Whether or not he had been forgiven is for you to determine on this testimony.] [15] If Mr. Wanamaker had forgiven him, by keeping him in his employment without ol&gt; jection, or by calling his attention to what the employment <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>was and asking him to do it and the plaintiff actually did it. [If he did not do what he was asked to do, he was still disobedient, and Air. Wanamaker’s firm had a right to discharge him.] [16] . . .</p>

If in addition to that it is your intention to give him anything for a subsequent time you can add that to it, but if it is not your verdict to give him anything for subsequent time you will render your verdict for this amount. Those are the correct figures, if that be the principle on which your verdict is to be rendered.
