Unable to specify the exact boundaries of the land wanted, this was left to be ascertained in the construction of the road.

Then what did equity require the defendant below to do in order that he might be protected in the possession of it? Certainly to pay the money (the consideration). By the terms of the contract he had no right to demand a deed of conveyance until he paid the purchase money, and not having offered to pay it, he was neither in law, nor yet in equity, entitled to demand a deed of conveyance. And not being entitled to demand it, equity would not interpose to keep him in possession of the laud. A vendee, under an executory contract for the purchase of the land, who has obtained the possession of it under his agreement, can only defend himself in that possession in Pennsylvania, where we have no court of chancery, upon such ground as would entitle him to a decree of injunction by a court of equity against his vendor, who was proceeding by action of ejectment at law to turn him out of possession.’</p>

That there was therefore no contract relation existing to prevent proceedings in the legal title.’ That in the present agreement no time is fixed, that payment of the $ 174 is to be made ‘ upon the execution and delivery of the deed,’ and that the deed is to be delivered ‘ whenever requested.’ It is boldly contended that, as defendant has never requested, and need never request, time for payment was not yet arrived and need never arrive, and ‘ this contract relation existing,’ no right of action exists. If <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>this were a just contention, the plaintiff is right in designating it, ‘ a clumsy fraud unworthy of a great corporation, devising a cunning trap to acquire the land of ignorant farmers for building a railroad' without compensation.’ But it seems to us an equitable ruling to say that, taking the whole agreement in view, the delivery of deed and time of payment was when the construction of the railroad was completed. Then the protection of the spring, the completion of the road, parts of the consideration, were obviously to be furnished, and the exact boundaries of the land to be ascertained so that the necessary deed might be written, tendered, and the delivery of the entire consideration be made.</p>

In view of the clause in the agreement, the first section of the twelfth section of act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 84, Purdon, 1425, pi. 51, requiring the company where there is an established road or way existing, to construct the road across such way so as not to impede the passage or transportation of persons along the same, and the fact that there was such an established way there, the verdict designating the road would seem proper. This established way they have buried. The plaintiff was not to be deprived of access to the outer world. The act surely never contemplated this, the shutting in of the owner ‘ from crossing or passing over the land with wagons, carts, and implements of husbandry as occasion may require,’ either in leaving his farm or bringing to it such wagons, carts, and implements of husbandry as he might choose to bring there.

    <p id="b208-4" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[257,437,1169,499]]]'>In response to plaintiff’s testimony in chief, the defendant gave in evidence the agreement of January 30, 1885, between plaintiff and the Reading &amp; Pottsville Railroad Co., in connection with agreement of consolidation and merger, October 7, 1885, between that company and the Pennsylvania Schuylkill Valley Railroad Co., and also lease of last named company, December 1,1885, to the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., defendant, for all said lessor’s railroads, etc., in the counties of Philadelphia, Montgomery, Chester, Berks and Schuylkill, duly recorded, etc., and then rested.</p>
    <p id="b208-5" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[256,947,1170,297]]]'>It was claimed by defendant that said first mentioned agreement was in effect “ a present grant to the railroad company, its successors or assigns, of the privilege of surveying, locating, constructing and using their railroad upon the plaintiff’s land,” etc., and, in its 8th and 9th points, it requested the learned president of the common pleas to charge:</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.7",208,[256,1253,1166,146]]]'>“ 8. An action of ejectment will not lie for the violation of any of the covenants made and to be performed by the railroad company under the agreement of January 30,1885.”</p>
    <p id="b208-7" data-blocks='[["BL_208.8",208,[256,1407,1168,85]]]'>“ 9. Under all the testimony in this case, the verdict must be for the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b208-8" data-blocks='[["BL_208.9",208,[255,1510,1170,758]]]'>He rightly held that the agreement was merely a contract to convey and not a conveyance ; that the legal title was still in the plaintiff; and he virtually instructed the jury, pro forma, that under our system of administering equitable principles in common law actions, plaintiff hada right to maintain ejectment upon his legal title for the purpose of enforcing payment, by means of a conditional verdict, of the purchase money due him, etc : Cook v. Trimble, <a href="/watts/9/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="9 Watts 15" data-case-ids="1850015" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0015-01">9 Watts, 15</a> ; Krebs v. Stroub, <a href="/pa/116/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="116 Pa. 405" data-case-ids="554333" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0405-01">116 Pa. 405</a>. He accordingly negatived the 9th point and reserved the question of law raised by the 8th point. That question he afterwards rightly ruled in favor of plaintiff, and thereupon judgment was entered in his favor on the conditional verdict returned by the jury, and subsequently so molded by the court as to require the deed, when delivered, to “ be accompanied with the release from all claims and damages, as per agreement.”</p>
    <p id="b208-9" data-blocks='[["BL_208.10",208,[255,2276,1171,144]],["BL_209.1",209,[138,383,1162,491]]]'>The conditional verdict, as thus molded by the court, preserves all the equities of the defendant company as terre tenant under the Reading &amp; Pottsville Railroad Co. The conditions <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>attached to the verdict are for its protection and the preservation of its rights, if it chooses to avail itself of them. Nothing, save compliance with the terms of the contract, is required. Less than that would be unjust and inequitable to the plaintiff. He is entitled, upon compliance with his part of the contract, to receive the purchase money, and to the performance, by the railroad company, of its covenants; and the court below will see that no injustice is done to either party. The defence in this case has, at least, the appearance of being obstructive rather than meritorious.</p>
    <p id="b209-3" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[139,893,1165,403]]]'>It is a mistake to say that the court gave binding instructions to the jury. There was practically no conflict of testimony ; and, as the learned judge said in his charge, “ There seems to be no material dispute as to the facts.” He accordingly said to the jury that if they believed the facts testified to, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. There was no error in this ; nor do we find any error in the record that calls for a reversal or modification of the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b209-4" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[142,1304,1161,144]]]'>The sixty days within which defendant is required, by the verdict, to comply with the conditions thereto annexed, are to be computed from this date.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[188,1457,355,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
