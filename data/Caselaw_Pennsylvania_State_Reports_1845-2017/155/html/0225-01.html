It is not necessarily contributory negligence to go on premises where a sign of warning is displayed.</p>

J., it appeared that plaintiff, a real estate broker, had charge of the land which defendant occupied as tenant at will. The property having been sold, plaintiff went to the farm in 1890 to notify defendant of the sale, and to secure the signs “ for sale ” which had been placed upon the fences. Defendant owned two dogs, a setter and a spitz, and had placed on a post in the lane leading to the house a sign, “ Beware of the dogs.” Plaintiff went to the front of the house, and knocked at the front door. Receiving no reply, he was about to leave, when he heard people talking towards the back of the house. He stepped from the porch into the roadway leading along the side of the house to the barn, and after going a short distance was attacked by the dogs, and severely bitten. There was evidence that the dogs had previously attacked people without provocation, and that defendant had knowledge of these facts.</p>
