I went down and seen Mr. Wells, told him I was going away and that I had an opportunity to rent the house and possibly a tenant for him for the future; wanted to know whether he would allow me for to do it. He said if I would become responsible for the rent up to the expiration of my lease. I told him I certainly would, as I was responsible, anyhow, will have to pay it, anyhow. So I became responsible. Then he said it was all satisfactory, that I should rent the place to him. Then I told him, I says : ‘ Now, I am going away and will be away, and if this man has my furniture five or six months, as I am not here and don’t know anything about it, I want to know how it will be in case he don’t pay his rent, as he has nothing in the house. He said there would be nothing done.’ ‘ I could not and I would not do anything, anyhow.’ Q. With what? A. With my furniture. Then I told him, I says, ‘ Then it is all satisfactory.
