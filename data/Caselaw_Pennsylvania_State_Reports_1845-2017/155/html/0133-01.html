Noble, 30 Beav. 39. Certainly to support such a gift or voluntary assignment, if it could be supported, it would have to be shown by evidence of the clearest, most unequivocal character, not only that the cestui que trust fully understood his rights but that he intended to transfer them to the trustee for his individual benefit. In this respect the proof falls short of the requirement. The parties were not dealing on equal terms. The cestui que trust was a young man, having no knowledge of law, informed of his rights—so far as he was informed of them at all—for the first time, acting under the impulse of bitterness of feeling towards his wife and all the members of her family, and shrinking with natural loathing from anything like participation in moneys earned by her infidelity. He was dealing with an experienced lawyer, who had formed his plans in advance, and who called in another lawyer to represent him in the transaction. Captain Cornwell undoubtedly acted with entire fairness, and explained, as he believed, fully and aceuratel}r, what the rights of the cestui que trust were, and expressed the opinion that they were not taken away by the act which was read to him. But why was the act read, and why were the assignments made by his wife in her lifetime exhibited to him? Evi<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>dently, notwithstanding what was said, he was not satisfied in his own mind that be had any claim and that his case did not fall within the act, the terms of which, taken literally and as a layman would understand them, appeared to be so directly applicable. He had gone to the trustee’s office upon an entirely different errand, and there was no time for deliberation. An important topic, if not the chief topic of the conversation and discussion was as to his right to administer upon the estate of his wife and thus to receive the $500, which the trustee owed her under her last assignment to him. Even this, while he was unwilling to receive it for his own benefit, he desired, insignificant as it was, to have devoted to charitable purposes ; that he wished the $5,000 legacy to go in a different direction, and that he deliberately gave it to the trustee—-an utter stranger whose acquaintance he had made upon that very day—knowing that he had the right to dispose of it, is incredible, apart from the positive assertion which he now makes that he did not know or believe that he had any such right.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-5" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[131,1308,1171,797]]]'>“ But the trustee does not contend that the assignment to him was by way of gift; on the contrary he asserts that though the consideration expressed was nominal, the actual consideration was the desire of the cestui que trust to keep the legacy from his wife’s family, and the fact that the trustee had paid $2,000 for her interest in her lifetime, not to speak of the consideration imposed by the sealing of the instrument. Two thousand dollars for a legacy of five thousand, even if it had not been a past consideration and paid to a stranger to the assignment, certainly will not support the claim of the trustee against the cestui que trust. The desire to exclude the family of the wife is equally inefficacious, and neither it nor the seal is sufficient to prevent the cestui que trust or those claiming under him, if he should, as he did, afterwards change his mind and transfer his right to the very persons towards whom he had before been so hostile.</p>

It refers to the sale by the wife of ‘certain interests’ ‘had and possessed’ by her, which she had sold and assigned to the trustee, but not to any belonging to the husband as ‘ heir ’ and then assigned. It shows, more<a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>over, that the assignment was not in accordance with what both trustee and his counsel testified was the desire of the cestui que trust as to $500, owing by the trustee to the estate of Ellen V. Bleloeh, under her last assignment, viz.: that it should be devoted to charitable purposes. The assignment is of all interest of the assignor in the estate of his wife, including, of course, this debt, to the trustee, absolutely and in his own right.</p>
