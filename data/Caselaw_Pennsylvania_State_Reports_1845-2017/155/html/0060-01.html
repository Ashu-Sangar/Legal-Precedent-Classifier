Plaintiff alleged that it was agreed at the time the note was given that, if his real estate should be sold, it would be bought in by Washington Butcher’s Sons, and reconveyed to him when his indebtedness was paid in full. The property was sold at sheriff’s sale on Jan. 18, 1881, and bought in by Washington Butcher’s Sons, who held title for several years, and then conveyed it to defendant, who was alleged to have full knowledge of plaintiff’s agreement with his creditors. After the conveyance of the property to defendant, plaintiff had a settlement with Washington Butcher’s Sons, wherein he was credited with the proceeds of the sale of the property, and paid the balance shown by the settlement. On Aug. 6, 1890, plaintiff made a tender to Washington Butcher’s Sons which he described as follows:</p>
