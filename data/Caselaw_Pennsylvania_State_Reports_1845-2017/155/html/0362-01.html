    <p class="syllabus" id="Akk" data-blocks='[["BL_384.8",384,[255,1348,1176,808]]]'>In an action to recover damages for a breach of contract, there was evidence that the contract, which was in parol, was for the sale of timber to plaintiff, including the use of defendant’s sawmill with which to manufacture the timber into lumber. The consideration to be paid for the timber was a certain sum per thousand feet for each kind of wood, and fifty cents per thousand feet of lumber manufactured from the timber for the use of the mill. Plaintiff was given possession as far as practicable of the mill and timber. Subsequently, however, through the agency of his brother and by artifice or trick, defendant obtained possession of the mill and refused to surrender it to plaintiff, and otherwise interfered with plaintiff’s prosecution of the work under the contract. Plaintiff exercised forbearance for a time, and continued to stock the mill and receive lumber from it while it was being operated by defendant’s brother. There was some evidence that plaintiff, relying on his control of the mill, had undertaken to fill orders for lumber. There was also evidence of a considerable advance in the price of timber very soon after the contract was made. <em>Hold, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury, not only on the question of contract, but also as to breach thereof, and consequent damages.</p>

Not the other hard woods. Q. Hemlock 75 cents? A. Yes sir. Q. Pine and oak $4.00, and cherry how much? A. $10.00, on the stump. Q. What about the mill, the repairs on it ? A.

That he did so, claiming that he could do the sawing as cheaply as anyone for the plaintiff, is proved, but the plaintiff’s evidence on cross-examination proved, also, that he acquiesced in this and went on with the job, leaving Samuel to do his sawing. There was no complaint of the manner in which the sawing was done, nor any evidence that any positive and imperative demand for possession of the mill was ever made and persisted in. The plaintiff’s own testimony shows that the job was abandoned for other causes. These causes, namely, the interference of Samuel Davidson with the operations of the plaintiff’s jobbers, were wholly insufficient to establish an eviction from the property, and amount to no more than this, that Samuel assumed to give orders to the men, over whose conduct he had no authority whatever. They were under no necessity of obeying, and cannot justify an abandonment of the job by showing that such directions were given.</p>

But the cross-examination dispelled even this spark, for it clearly appeared that the fact was that part of the lumber had been shipped by the plaintiff to customers from whom the defendant had procured orders at plaintiff’s request, and as the plaintiff had not received the pay he assumed, without knowledge, that Davidson had. It may be the case, and the plaintiff may have a good cause of action upon this account, but it did not appear in the evidence on thjs trial. Rule discharged.”</p>

      <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>The evidence shows that the parol contract, for sale of the timber, included the use of defendant’s sawmill, then on the premises, with which to manufacture' the timber into lumber. The consideration to be paid for the timber, as it was manufactured and marketed by defendant, was a certain sum per thousand feet board measure, for each kind of wood,—hemlock, oak, cherry, etc.,—and fifty cents per thousand feet of lumber, manufactured from the timber, for the use of the mill. The different provisions of the agreement are so connected with and mutually dependent on each other as to constitute an entire contract. It also shows that, so far as the defendant was concerned, the contract was executed by giving plaintiff possession, as far as practicable, of the mill and timber; but it also tends to show that, through the agency of his brother Samuel, defendant shortly afterwards obtained possession of the mill, by a sort of artifice or trick, and refused to surrender the possession and control of the same again to plaintiff, and otherwise interfered with his prosecution of the work under the contract. That—if found to be the fact—would be a breach of the contract, and plaintiff would be entitled to recover at least nominal damages. It is true, he appears to have continued for some time to stock the mill operated by defendant’s brother and receive lumber from the same; but all that may be satisfactorily accounted for on the theory that it was the best he could do, in the circumstances. There was some evidence that, relying on having possession and control of the mill, he had undertaken to fill orders for lumber, etc. Assuming that plaintiff did exercise considerable forbearance and submit for a time to defendant’s unreasonable refusal to surrender possession of the mill, that indulgence should not deprive him of his right of action for breach of the contract.</p>
