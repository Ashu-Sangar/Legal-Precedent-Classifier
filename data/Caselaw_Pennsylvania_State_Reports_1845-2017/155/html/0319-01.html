J., it appeared that the plaintiff sold to John Price a leasehold interest in a dairy farm and also a herd of twenty-four cows, one bull, two horses and various farm implements. Price gave his notes in payment, but it was subsequently found that he could not pay the notes, and he accordingly surrendered them to plaintiff, and a bill of sale was executed. Plaintiff then executed a lease of the farm, cattle, etc., to Price. Price was a practical dairyman, and <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>plaintiff bad originally employed Mm to manage the farm. After the lease was executed be remained on the farm in possession of the cattle and dairy implements. Subsequently executions were issued on judgments against Price and twenty cows were sold by the sheriff as property of Price.</p>

With this we are entirely satisfied, and indeed it was not alleged, at any time, that there was fraud in fact attempted. The whole contention arises over the question whether or not there was such taking possession of the property as saved it from being a fraud in law as to the other creditors of the vendor and defendant in the execution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b342-8" data-blocks='[["BL_342.8",342,[281,1560,1168,747]]]'>“ It is quite true that a more formal delivery might have been made. The vendor might have been dismissed and a new man hired to drive the milk wagon and run the dairy. The cows might have been driven to another farm. But was this necessary ? A new man would not know the patrons or the route. The farm on which the cows were kept was leased for that very purpose for a fixed term. We do not think under the facts in this case the court could declaro the possession taken as insufficient as a matter of law. It seems to us to be a mixed question of law and fact, and that if the jury were satisfied that the transaction was honest and for a valuable consideration, followed by acts intended to transfer the possession as well as the title, and that the vendee assumed such control of the property as reasonably indicated a change of ownership, the transaction must stand.</p>
