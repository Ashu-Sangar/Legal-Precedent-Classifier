Collins, 37 Pa., p. 387, an authority never questioned, so far as I have seen, and which is relied upon by the defendant as sustaining the defence, while it holds that the case as therein presented was not within the jurisdiction of the justice, and exceeded the sum of $100, it yet says this: ‘True it is that plaintiff may sue before a justice for less than $100, although his claim originally exceeded that amount. Where there have been mutual dealings or partial payments on account, and the balance is under $100 (now $300), the jurisdiction lias <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>been often sustained. . . . The result of the authorities seems to be that where the plaintiff’s claim, however large, has been reduced to or below $100 (now $300) by direct payments or by dealings that amount to or are admitted to be actual payments, the justice has jurisdiction.

And I see no reason why an account rendered therefor cannot be accepted and admitted as a payment by the party against whom the same is rendered. A credit of the character allowed in reduction of plaintiff’s claim is certainly not fictitious or made without the assent of the defendant, or for the mere purpose of gaining jurisdiction. By rendering a bill of items for his claim where mutual dealings exist, the defendant has practically said to the plaintiff: I demand credit for the several items as per bill rendered ; and if the plaintiff accepts or admits as correct any or all of the items of the bill so rendered, I see nothing in the law which forbids the plaintiff from accepting as payments on his claim the items of claim so presented and admitted by both parties to be correct, and to that extent reduce his claim. I can see no objection to his so doing before suit brought, any more than there could be to the allowance of the credits after suit brought and upon trial. The course thus pursued could not be said to be a ‘ device ’ resorted to for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction before the justice. It was simply a recognition by the plaintiff of a lawful counterclaim by defendant in their dealings with one another, which amounted to and was admitted to be an actual partial payment of plaintiff’s claim against the defendant.</p>
