Upon default in payment of the interest in 1878 he sued out the mortgages and issued execution upon the judgments obtained thereon, and also entered judgment upon the collateral bond. Prior to the sheriff’s sale he entered into an agreement with a third party, a stranger to the original transaction, that such third parly should buy the properties, pay all the costs, and upon obtaining title should execute two new mortgages upon the premises purchased to plaintiff, he agreeing not to bid at the sale and assigning to the purchaser the judgment obtained upon the bond held as collateral. <em>Held, </em>that the order of the court in 1892, opening the judgment entered upon the collateral bond and directing a jury trial, was within the discretion of the court below and would not be reversed.</p>

Afterwards on June 1,1878, plaintiffs entered judgment against defendant upon his personal bond. On June 3,1878, the two mortgaged properties were sold by the sheriff in the foreclosure proceedings, and each brought $45.18 above the costs of suit, taxes, etc. The legal plaintiffs, who were trustees, had not sufficient funds to buy in the property at the sheriff’s sale. They therefore entered into an agreement with Dundas T. Pratt, by which Pratt was to buy in the properties, pay all the costs, and upon obtaining title should execute two new mortgages upon the premises purchased to plaintiff, who agreed not to bid at the sale. Plaintiffs also agreed to assign to Pratt the judgment obtained against Addicks upon the bond held as collateral. This arrangement was carried out and the transaction was completed on July 1, 1878.</p>
