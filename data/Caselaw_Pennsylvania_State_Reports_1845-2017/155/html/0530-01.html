Schoch did not object to it, did not complain that it was too large, but started to fill the order, shipped one car on account thereof and billed it to Stemton, the place he was directed to by Eckert, and said, ‘ I will ship one more on Monday.’ If Schoch did not ship the one car and promise to ship another on Monday following on Eckert’s five car order, we are a' loss to know by what authority he billed any wheat to Stemton at 831 c. per bushel and charged Eckert therefor.] [4]</p>

A verdict for $134.40 was accordingly rendered by the jury, subject to the opinion of the court on said questions of law reserved. The damages having been ascertained by the verdict, these were the only other material questions in the case; and, if ruled in favor of plaintiff, he was entitled to judgment for the amount found by the jury.</p>
    <p id="b559-7" data-blocks='[["BL_559.7",559,[160,1606,1167,745]]]'>The only testimony in the case was that introduced by the plaintiff; and, so far at least as it was material to the issue, it was undisputed. The evidence, as to the alleged contract, consisted of the letters and telegrams that passed between the parties. The construction of that correspondence was, of course, for the court, and the learned president of the common pleas rightly held that it constituted a contract for delivery of five car loads of wheat on the track at Selinsgrove, at 83| cents per bushel, as claimed by plaintiff. His opinion on the reserved questions is an ample vindication of his rulings on that and the remaining question. The only order given by the plaintiff was for five car loads of wheat at 831 cents per bushel, and that order was accepted and partially filled by defendant. The correspondence between the parties is not susceptible of any other reasonable construction.</p>
