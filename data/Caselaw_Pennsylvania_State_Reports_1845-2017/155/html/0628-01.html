Nes, and notissue indefinitely, and these circumstances, with other matters apparent on the face of :the will, show the intention of the testator to devise the property over upon a definite and not an indefinite failure of issue of William J. Nes. This position is sustained in the language of Green, J., in delivering the opinion of the court in Hackney v. Tracy, <a href="/pa/137/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="137 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="821465" data-case-paths="/pa/137/0053-01">137 Pa. 53</a>, on page 59, as follows: ‘It was contended for the appellant, that such reasons ’ (that the testator intended a definite failure of issue) ‘ exists in the present case, in the fact that the limitation is over to his sister Mary, by name; and that she being a living person, at the death of the testator, a definite failure of issue must have been intended; and that such limitation was not too remote to sustain an executory devise. There are cases in which such facts are held important, in connection with other considerations, but standing alone it is clearly not sufficient as has been held in many cases.’ Besides, the case of Porter v. Bradley, 3 Term R.' 143, is stated to be authority in this commonwealth as we have seen. The will in that case is as follows: ‘ I give and devise unto my son Philip Dobin, his heirs and assigns for ever, all that messuage and tenement wherein I now live ; and my will is that in case my said son Philip Dobin shall happen to die leaving no issue behind him then the land so devised to Philip, as aforesaid I give and devise the same for want of issue as aforesaid, unto my son James Doman, his heirs and assigns for ever.’</p>

But here the words are “ but in case he shall happen to die leaving no issue behind him,” which make a very material difference and brings it within the case of Pells v. Brown, which is the foundation, and as it were, the <em>magna charla </em>of this branch of the law. . . . And there are even additional words in the case “ leaving no issue behind him ” which necessarily import that the testator meant at the time of his son’s death. The subsequent parts of the will also, convey the same idea; for that the devisor mentions this event as likely to happen in the lifetime of his widow, or of his younger son or daughters.’</p>

We think that the "devise over to persons living at the time of the making the devise and a direction to the executor to sell, in the event of no issue surviving William J. Nes, evidently refers to a period in the lifetime of the executor—to a definite and not indefinite time. These are mentioned as being evidence of the intent of the testator in Taylor v. Taylor, supra, and the other earlier cases. In the later cases they are not regarded, by themselves, as important factors in the construction of wills of the character of this, for some reason we do not understand, but they may, as we have seen, be properly considered with other circumstances, in ascertaining the intent of the testator.</p>
