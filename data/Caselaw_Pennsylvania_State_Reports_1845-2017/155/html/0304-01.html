Searfoss leased the premises in dispute, and used them as a store and residence. Searfoss’s goods in the store were sold at sheriff’s sale to Sherred. Subsequently his leasehold interest was sold to plaintiff. Sherred took and kept possession of the store for about two weeks, Searfoss continuing to occupy the rest of the premises. A few days after the sheriff’s sale of the leasehold, Ecker bought from Sherred the stock of goods and gave him a judgment note for the purchase money, agreeing not to sell the goods in any manner other than in connection with the mercantile business conducted in his own name. Sherred then withdrew from possession, and thereafter Searfoss conducted the business as an “ agent.” As a matter of fact the purchase was exclusively for the benefit of Searfoss, who paid the purchase money, and Ecker merely acted as his agent in securing the transfer. <em>Held, </em>that in an action of ejectment, (1) Ecker was not estopped from showing that he had no interest in the goods, and that Searfoss was not his agent; and (2) that Ecker was entitled to judgment in his favor.</p>

Whether or not the defendant was in actual possession is a question of fact; and where, upon com<a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>petent evidence, a referee or jury specially finds that the defendant was not in actual possession, a judgment cannot be entered against him, but he is entitled to judgment for his costs, even though he did not file a disclaimer with his plea.</p>

The lower story of the main building was used by him as a store in which he carried on a mercantile business, and the upper story was occupied by him as a residence. His leasehold interest in the land was levied upon and sold to the plaintiff in this action.</p>

Thereupon Sherred, who had possession of the store in which the goods were, withdrew from the possession, and thereafter Searfoss conducted the business as ‘ agent.’ In fact, this purchase was exclusively for the benefit of Searfoss, and he paid the purchase money. It is not stated when he paid it, but if ho did so, according to the terms of the contract—and there is no evidence to the contrary—it was all paid before this suit was brought. At all events Searfoss was the <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>real purchaser, and was not in fact the agent of Ecker and Behrens, but ‘ on the contrary,’ quoting the language of the referee, ‘ Ecker and Behrens were agents of Searfoss in securing the transfer of a stock of goods from William Ii. Sherred to themselves for the benefit of John Searfoss.’ So far as appears, Searfoss conducted the business solely for his own benefit. Ecker and Behrens never set up any claim to the land in controversy, and never exercised any dominion over it, but Searfoss continued in the sole and exclusive occupancy of it as before. In answer to points the referee specially finds: ‘ That Herman Ecker was not in the actual personal possession or occupancy of any building upon the premises described in the writ; also, that he had no interest of any kind in, or ownership of, the goods, or any part of them at any time contained in any of those buildings.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[257,1149,1178,1264]],["BL_329.1",329,[188,409,1172,1054]]]'>“If Ecker did notown the goods and had no interest in them, or in the business, and if he never claimed any interest in or title to the land, and exercised no dominion over it, and if Searfoss was not his tenant or agent, it would seem that Ecker has successfully rebutted the presumption arising from the sheriff’s return, and is entitled to judgment in his favor. Notwithstanding these facts the referee holds that Ecker is a. proper party defendant, because he and Behrens were the ostensible owners of the goods, the real title to which, as between them and Searfoss, was in the latter, and permitted him to hold himself out to the world as their agent at a time when, in the .ordinary conduct of the business, Searfoss acquired and held tortious possession of the plaintiff’s property. This proposition presents the serious question in the case, and in disposing of it we shall not stop to inquire whether the evidence shows that Searfoss held himself out to the world as the agent of Ecker and Behrens, or simply as an agent for an undisclosed principal. We assume the former to be true, and concede that if this were an action on a contract made in the ordinary course of business, Ecker and Behrens would be estopped from denying Searfoss’s authority. But liability on contract, based on the principles of estoppel, does not necessarily imply liability to be sued in an action of ejectment in which the defendants’ actual possession of the premises must be proved. If I permit another to do business in my name, upon the premises occu<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>pied by him, it is competent, in any dispute between us, to show that the goods and the profits arising from the same belong to him and not to me. But, as between me and third persons who have dealt with him on the faith of my ostensible agency, I am estopped from showing the true relations between us in order to escape the consequences of his acts done in the ordinary course of the business. ‘Those clothing an agent with apparent authority are, as to parties dealing on the faith of such authority, conclusively estopped from denying it: ’ Hubbard v. Tenbrook, <a href="/pa/124/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="124 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="563070" data-case-paths="/pa/124/0291-01">124 Pa. 291</a>. But as a general rule the representation must have been acted upon in order to create an estoppel; and where the question is whether I was in possession of certain real estate actually occupied by another, and the only evidence of fact is that the goods on the premises were bought in my name, and the business is conducted by the occupier as agent, it is competent for me to show that I have no interest whatever in the goods or the business, and that the actual occupant of the premises is not my agent, and is not holding for me, unless it appears that the plaintiff did, or omitted to do. something which he would not have done or omitted if he had known the truth.</p>
