J., it appeared that plaintiff, a married woman, was visiting friends in Reading in August, 1889, and that it was the first time she had been in that city. On the evening of her arrival, August 19th, she went to call upon friends on North Sixth street, and found them seated upon their front doorstep. She sat down upon the lower step on a cushion. When she arose to go home it was after dark. She took the cushion, stepped around the side of the steps so as to put the cushion upon the top step, and in doing so fell into an open, unguarded area-way at the side of the steps. She testified: “ I got <em>up; </em>I stepped around the side of the step, as I thought, to put the cushion up, and I knew nothing until I felt myself going down. That is all I remember.” The area-way into which plaintiff fell was four feet, five and one half inches long, extending north and south along the street; two feet, six inches wide; and four feet, two and one half inches deep below the level of the pavement, and from the top step six feet, nine inches, without railing or guard either about the hole on the pavement or about the stoop leading up and into the house.</p>

As to the defendant’s negligence in permitting the dangerous area within the lines of the sidewalk, to remain open and unguarded, the evidence was so clear and emphatic that the jury could have no hesitation in finding for the plaintiff on that question. There was scarcely more than a mere scintilla of evidence, as to the alleged contributory negligence of the plaintiff, and that question has been rightly settled in her favor by the verdict. The truth of plaintiff’s testimony' as to her physical condition, and sufferings resulting from the injuries she sustained by falling into the unguarded area, was evidently found by the jury; and they assessed the damages at a sum that was not only warranted by the evidence, but entirely satisfactory to the learned trial judge.</p>
