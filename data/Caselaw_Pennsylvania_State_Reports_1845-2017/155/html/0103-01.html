He further finds as a fact that prior to the purchase of the three hundred tons of rods from Walbaum, through E. R.

The referee fails to see the evidence upon which the defendants can rightfully claim that they believed they were dealing with Henry Enthoven exclusively. Mr. Walbaum was the plaintiffs’ broker. He asked E. R. Mann to assist him in the sale. Mann, therefore, had no right to make any representation as to the ownership of the rods through this mere agency to sell for Walbaum; nor is it at all clear that he made any such representation. It is true that he says he thought the rods were Enthoven’s, as, indeed, in one aspect they were ; but the referee finds that nothing was said or done which authorized the defendants to come to the conclusion that Cahn &amp; Co. were not selling these rods as the pledgees thereof.

Harper, of Louisville, Kentucky, had been shipping car loads of live stock to Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co. of Pittsburgh, to be sold on commission, and making drafts on them as soon as shipped, based on the bills of lading which accompanied the drafts. These drafts were usually discounted by the German Security Bank, and were always promptly paid, until the draft for a certain car load of hogs shipped on August 9, 1877, by Harper to Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co., came due. On the day of shipment Harper drew his draft on the latter firm for $1,300, and the said draft was discounted by the German Security Bank on the faith of the bill of lading which was handed over to it. The draft, with the bill of lading attached, was sent to the German National Bank of Pittsburgh for collection, and was presented to Holmes, Lafferty &amp; Co. on August the 11th, and payment refused. The hogs arrived on the 13th, were received by the defendants below, and by them sold. At that time Harper was indebted to defendant on overdrafts on previous shipments to a larger amount than the proceeds of this last lot. The proceeds of the shipment after deducting freight, shipment charges, etc., amounted to $1,299, which is the amount the bank claimed in their suit. The defendants claimed to retain it on account of the indebtedness of Harper to them. Verdict and judgment for the bank, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. This decision, in the opinion of the referee, conforms to the general commercial law laid down by the highest courts of various states, and the general principles of which are well stated in the case of Dows v.
