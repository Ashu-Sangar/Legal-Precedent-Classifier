He did not keep proper accounts. He did not account in this court for seven years after the death of the testator, and then only under the pressure of a citation. He mixed the trust funds with his own. He has not paid over to the cestui que trust, money in his hands belonging to her. He has refused to satisfy a mortgage that had been paid off, and because of this and other acts has involved the estate in a number of lawsuits. He has made improper investments, etc., etc. His conduct shows ignorance and incompetency and a stubborness which cannot be justified or excused.</p>
