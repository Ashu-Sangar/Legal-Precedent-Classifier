He would not have given the same had he known at the time the wrongful use that was made of it, or so intended. Neither were the notes of the said parties taken up as agreed upon.

The fourth objection, that demand of payment, protest and notice to defendant, etc., are not shown or averred, is equally destitute of merit.

He does not state that he and the Leahans were the only parties to the original draft which he thus took up, by paying part cash and giving the draft in suit for the residue; nor does he aver that plaintiff bank was not the bona fide holder, for value before maturity, of said original draft, nor does he distinctly state any fact or facts that warrant any such inference; nor does he deny, expressly or by necessary implication, the averment in plaintiff’s statement to the effect that it became the holder of the draft in suit “ before maturity, for value given,” and continued to be such holder and owner until suit was brought.</p>
