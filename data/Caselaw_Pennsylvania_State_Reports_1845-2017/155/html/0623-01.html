The ordinance was not attacked in the way required by law. While the passage of the ordinance upon an agreement like this is most reprehensible, and while the ordinance should have been held void as against public policy, if it had been properly attacked, we cannot see that it can be so declared, or affected in this proceeding. . . .</p>

Some depositions were taken to establish this proposition. The description in the draft agrees substantially with the description of the street or improvement in the ordinance which was made a part of the petition for the appointment of the damage viewers. We do not think the depositions are admissible, as the report and draft must speak for themselves, and be self-sustaining; but conceding that the draft shows what the counsel for the exceptant claims, how- does that become a question here ? What if the street cannot be correctly located ? How can that injuriously affect the exceptant in anything but the question of damages ?
