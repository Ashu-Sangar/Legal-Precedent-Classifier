The bank then brought suit against the makers by direction of the president of the corporation payee. <em>Held </em>that the evidence was not sufficient to let in a defence between the original parties to the note.</p>

Hayes. At the time the note was discounted, I did not know that said Hayes was president of said company. I did not know anything about the company. Mr. Hayes keeps a personal account with us. The note was discounted for Mr. Hayes personally. The note was returned to us unpaid, after having been sent to Easton for collection. Q. What was done by you on the return of the note with the indorsement ‘ payment refused ? ’ A. A clerk of the bank, without instructions, following our usual course, made an entry charging Mr. Hayes’s account with amount of note and fees. <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>Being notified by Mr. Hayes that he did not wish the note charged, the amount was credited on the same day to his account. At the time the note was charged, Mr. Hayes’ balance was sufficient to pay the note. I received instructions from Mr. Hayes that he did not wish the note charged to his account. Q. Did Mr. Hayes ask you to collect the note for him ? A. Yes. This was at the same time that he asked us not to charge him with the note. Q. Did he give you any reason for it, either at that or any subsequent time ? A. My recollection is that he said the makers were good, and that they could be made to pay, and that he wanted to use his individual money. I am aware that there is some dispute between the makers and first indorsers of the note. I couldn’t tell just when I learned that. I presume it was about the time suit was brought. It might have been talked over at that time and it might not. What we did was for the accommodation of Mr. Hayes.”</p>

We received this note in the regular course of business, before maturity, and knew nothing of any of the relations existing between the makers and the payees. The Ice Company have no account with the bank. Mr. Hayes’ balance at the time the note was charged to him by the clerk was an individual balance. We sent no notice to Mr. Hayes that the note was charged to his account. The instructions came from him voluntarily. In answer to Mr. Walter’s question where it was stated that Mr. Hayes asked us to collect the note for him I desired to say that he requested us to sue the makers. The proceeds of the note are for the bank. Mr. Hayes didn’t leave a deposit in the bank for the purpose of protecting the note.”</p>

From our business dealings with Mr. Hayes we were satisfied of his honesty and ability to protect us in case of failure to collect from Seitz Brothers.”</p>
