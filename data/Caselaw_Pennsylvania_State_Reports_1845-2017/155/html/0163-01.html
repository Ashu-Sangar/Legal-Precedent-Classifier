If the sale of two hundred and thirty acres was after the assessment for 1891 the taxes cannot be apportioned: Shaw v. Quinn, 12 S. &amp; R. 299. Taxes in Delaware county are collected under the special act of April 1, 1873, P. L. 511, § 5, which provides as follows: “ That it shall be the duty of each and every collector, or ¿supervisor, or officer authorized to collect the taxes, rates and levies aforesaid, mentioned in the first section of this act, to collect the same from any personal property that may be on the real estate, and property on which the said taxes, rates and levies shall have as aforesaid imposed or assessed,” etc. This law provides that the taxes shall bo a lien for one year, and this court decided in Anspaeh and Stanton’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=112%20Pa.%2028" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="112 Pa. 28">112 Pa. 28</a>, that the lien is lost unless a formal lien is entered in the prothonotary’s office. As no lien can be .entered while there is personal property on the premises out of which the taxes can be made, it becomes the duty of the collector to proceed by levy and sale. There is no question raised as to defendant being without authority, or that he is not the proper officer, nor is it alleged that defendant was endeavoring to collect the tax without allowing credit for the $75, nor that he Avas exercising the power of his office in an oppressive manner.</p>
