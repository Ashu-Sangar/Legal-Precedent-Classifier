Plaintiff complied with the request and presented a bid, which was found to be the lowest bid. Plaintiff testified that when the bids were opened defendant said to him: “ You are the lucky man. . . . you have won, and fairly so.” The architect requested plaintiff to bring his subcontractor down so that they could go over the matter of extra work. Plaintiff further testified in effect that he was to begin work as soon as the contract was signed, but that the time for the completion of the <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>building and the payments as the work progressed had not been fixed.

It does not follow, however, that because he was the lowest bidder the defendant was bound to award him the contract. The fact that, upon the opening of the bids, either the architect or the defendant may have said to the plaintiff, “ You are the lucky man,” amounts to nothing more than a recognition of the fact that he was the lowest bidder. After the bids had been opened, it was the right of the defendant to inquire into the fitness and ability of the respective bidders to fulfil the contract. He was not bound to award it to a bidder who lacked either the skill, experience, or ability to properly perform the contract. In this case the contract never was awarded to the plaintiff. There were a number of questions to be settled when the defendant and the bidder were brought together, before their minds could be said to have agreed upon anything.</p>
