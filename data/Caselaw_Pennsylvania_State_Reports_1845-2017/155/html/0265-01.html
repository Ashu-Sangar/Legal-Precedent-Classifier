We judge from the terms of payment that the sum of one thousand nine hundred and twenty dollars represented the interest at twelve per cent on the principal sum of four thousand dollars from August 1, 1876, the date of the mortgage, until August 1, 1880, when the mortgage debt was to become due. According to the parol testimony, this mortgage was given in the place of the former one—as a ‘ renewal ’ of it upon the same agreement as to interest—and not for any new or additional loan. The testimony of the two witnesses upon the subject is corroborated by the circumstance that on the same day the defendant paid eight hundred dollars on account of the mortgage.</p>

The amount of the judgment, as liquidated by the prothonotary, was 86,593.32. It was not alleged in the affidavit that the mortgage was usurious.

The purchaser was a lien creditor and claimed the right to apply his judgments on his bid. The sheriff made a return accordingly, exceptions were filed and an auditor was appointed. Pending the distribution a question arose as to whether the Reap mortgage was a first' lien or was divested by the sale, and it was suggested, as a speedy mode of getting a decision of the question, that the defendant should raise it by an affidavit of defence, to which the plaintiffs would except. Mr. Lenahan says : ‘ He (Mr. Jenkins, the plaintiffs’ attorney,) came to me ,and suggested that I would file an affidavit of defence, setting forth the circumstances of this previous judgment, and that then we could get a speedy <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>opinion from the court on exceptions filed by him to my affidavit of defence, as to whether the lien of this mortgage was divested or not. I told him that Mr. Battle intended making a defence on the ground that he had paid usurious interest. He then said I should let the usurious defence go, because, if I did not, it would prevent a speedy determination of that question as to whether the lien of the mortgage was divested or not. I told him I was afraid that Mr. Battle’s rights in this usurious interest matter might be possibly interfered with by his not setting it forth in the affidavit of defence. He said, “ y°u go on and there won’t be any injury suffered by him on account of that.” ’ The report of the case shows that the only question raised and decided was the one above suggested. We held that the lien of the mortgage was not divested. Reap v. Battle, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Kulp%20458" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Kulp 458">4 Kulp, 458</a>.

The principle established in Campbell v. Sloan, <a href="/pa/62/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="1017227" data-case-paths="/pa/62/0481-01">62 Pa. 481</a>, and recognized in many subsequent cases is, that ‘any security given in payment or discharge of an usurious contract is equally void with that.

But in view of the circumstances under which the affidavit of defence was filed we do not think the defendant is estopped by his failure to set up the defence at that time. It did not mislead the plaintiffs and cause them to chang’e their conduct and condition ; on the contrary he postponed the defence at the request of their attorney, for a purpose in which they, and not he, were particularly interested, and upon the understanding that his right to set up the defence in the future would not be affected. This is quite a different case from the one cited. The judgment was of course conclusive until reversed or opened, but if he had confessed it at the request of the plaintiffs the court would have opened it upon his petition and proof that it was usurious; and, a fortiori, his mere omission, at the request of the plaintiffs and for their purposes, to set up the defence at that time ought not to estop him from asking the interposition of the equitable powers of the court, if it is necessary for his protection.</p>

A sci. fa. on a mortgage is purely a proceeding in rem. It is in no sense in personam, for no other writ can issue but one to sell the land, etc.: Wilson v. McCullough, <a href="/pa/19/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="19 Pa. 77" data-case-ids="970552" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0077-01">19 Pa. 77</a>. But while this is true, the only person who can defend a sci. fa. because of usury included in a mortgage is the mortgagor. A terre tenant, whether he became such by private or judicial sale, cannot, as a general rule, make the defence : Miners’ Trust Co. v. Roseberry, <a href="/pa/81/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="81 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="1044138" data-case-paths="/pa/81/0309-01">81 Pa. 309</a>; Bonnell’s Appeal, 5 Cent.

The reason given for permitting the mortgagor to set up the defence, even though the property has been sold subject to the mortgage, and therefore the judgment on the sci. fa. cannot be enforced against him personally, is, that he is liable on the bond. ‘ How could he defend for usury in a suit on the bond after an adjudication that its whole amount was due upon the mortgage ?: ’ Huckenstein v. Love, <a href="/pa/98/0518-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="98 Pa. 518" data-case-ids="496973" data-case-paths="/pa/98/0518-01">98 Pa. 518</a> ; Parker v.

A mortgage, unless it contains an ex<a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>press covenant to pay, does not of itself import any personal liability for the money it secures: Scott v.

If then the judgment is purely in rem, and if the defendant is released and discharged from any personal liability on the bond, how will he be harmed by permitting the judgment to stand?

It is true that when land is sold subject to the lien of a mortgage, and the mortgagor subsequently pays it, he is entitled to subrogation, because, as between him and the terre tenant, the land is the primary fund : Hansell v. Lutz, <a href="/pa/20/0284-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="20 Pa. 284" data-case-ids="972356" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0284-01">20 Pa. 284</a>; Dollar Savings Bank v. Burns, <a href="/pa/87/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="87 Pa. 491" data-case-ids="1057820" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0491-01">87 Pa. 491</a>. But that is not this case. The terre tenant bought subject to the lien of the unpaid balance on the mortgage, whatever that might be. If the judgment should be opened and the defendant be permitted to defend as to the usury included in the mortgage or paid on it before the terre tenant purchased, the judgment would be very considerably reduced in amount. But how would that benefit him ? If he paid it and then collected the amount from the terre tenant he would be no better off in the end. This, however, is not what the defendant means. He claims that if the judgment should be opened and he should then pay to the plaintiffs the balance on the amount actually loaned with legal interest he would be entitled to subrogation, and would have a right to enforce collection of the mortgage as it stood at the time of the purchase by the terre tenant, without any deduction for usury. He would be subrogated, it is true, to the right of the plaintiffs to collect from the land the balance due on the mortgage, but we cannot agree that he would have a right to recover a larger amount than the mortgagee. ‘ The right of subrogation is an auxiliary equity, called into existence for the purpose of enabling a party secondarily liable, but who has paid the debt, to reap the benefit of any securities which the creditor may hold against the principal debtor, and by the use of which the party paying may thus be made whole: ’ Bisph. Eq. 42. If then the mortgagor elects not to pay the usury included in the mortgage, and to apply the pay-<a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>merits of usury as payments on the principal, the balance would be the measure of the mortgagee’s right of recovery, and consequently of the mortgagor’s, if he pays it and is subrogated, for that would make him whole. There is no doubt that a mortgage may be kept alive, even after payment in full, if such was tire intention of the parties, and even though there be no actual assignment to a trustee: Wilson v. Murphy, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20203" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Phila. 203">1 Phila. 203</a>. Though actual payment discharges a judgment or other incumbrance at law, it does not discharge it in equity if there are interests which require it to be kept alive for their protection : Loverin v. Humboldt Safe Dep. Co., <a href="/pa/113/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="113 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="457635" data-case-paths="/pa/113/0006-01">113 Pa. 6</a>. But this equitable right of the mortgagor or judgment debtor to have the security kept in life after payment, and to be subrogated to the rights of the mortgagee or judgment plaintiff, is subject to the general qualification by which the exercise of all purely equitable rights is controlled, viz., ‘ That they must not be asserted in such a way, or under such circumstances, as to do violence to the rights and equities of other parties : ’ Bisph. Eq. 42. While it is not a fraud upon subsequent creditors for a debtor to contract for or pay usurious interest on a loan, and while his refusal to make the defence is not of itself evidence of any intent to defraud them, yet where a debtor incumbers his land for more than he is bound to pay, and this operates to the prejudice of subsequent lien creditors who might otherwise be reached by a sale of the laud, we do not think, that, after a judicial sale, subject to the lien of the incumbrance, for a price presumably so much less than otherwise would have been bid, he can claim the assistance of a court of equity in an effort to collect more than he was bound to pay to protect himself.</p>
