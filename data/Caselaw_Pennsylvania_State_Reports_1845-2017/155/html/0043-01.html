Holthouse says that that position <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>is incorrect. He says that Rynd gave that notice of July 25, 1885, and that then afterwards practically withdrew it, or indicated that he did not intend to go back upon his contract. In proof of this, he undertakes to show to you in the first place that the notice was given, to some extent, under a misapprehension ; that he had instructed his attorney that there was nothing but a verbal agreement between the parties, and he asks you to believe that upon the discovery by his attorney that there was some writing that then they, to a certain extent at least, receded from the position they took there. He shows you, and as far as I recollect the testimony it is conceded in this case, that the position that the written contract was not legally binding was not taken until the next year, until some time after this house was <em>completed; </em>and he also testifies to you that Mr. Rynd, after this notice was given, went upon the premises, and dealt with him upon the basis of this contract; that he had dealings with regard to the extra foot; that he himself marked out the lines at which the masons should build, and fixed the line, and that in his presence they upon that line laid the corner stone at the lower corner of the lot.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b67-5" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[183,1404,1166,1008]],["BL_68.1",68,[260,390,1170,1871]]]'>“ As I have said to you, this notice upon its face was sufficient to have made Holthouse incur any expenses that he did incur, after that, at his own risk. But it is proper to submit to you the testimony which is given with respect to the conduct of Rynd after that, in support of the averment that he did not insist upon that notice, but that he either withdrew it or caused Holthouse to believe that it was withdrawn, and that he would not insist upon it, by his conduct, his actions and his words. In further support of this position, Mr. Holthouse sa}rs that when they met at the office of Messrs. Burleigh &amp; Harbinson, that Rynd was willing to complete the contract, and that the only difference between them was as to the amount that he should pay for attorneys’ fees for the examination of the title. He said those fees were $25.00, that they were too high, and that was the only difference between them, and that by concession of that the contract would have been fulfilled at that time, and that he thus showed a recognition of the existence of this contract at that time, and either a withdrawal of this notice, or an abandonment of the position that he took under it. On the other hand Mr. Rynd con<a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>tends that this proceeding at Burleigh &amp; Harbison’s office was only in the way of a compromise, that he was still standing to his position that he was not bound to convey, and that it was only with a view of avoiding litigation that they made the offer to complete the contract at Burleigh &amp; Harbison’s office. If that is the true state of affairs, then the notice still holds good. If, on the other hand, they stood to that notice up <em>until that time, </em>and simply by way of compromise were willing to complete the transaction upon a meeting at Burleigh <em>&amp; </em>Harbison’s office, then, although the difference may have been only about that $25.00, if the compromise failed on that account, the defendant had the right to fall back upon his notice and say to Holthouse that he had no right to recover beyond this 25th of July. Even if Rynd had refused, had manifested his unwillingness to make this conveyance, if he had put it specifically upon some particular ground, some particular violation of the contract which he alleged, and had still admitted the existence of the contract, had still encouraged Holthouse to believe that he was willing to carry into effect the contract that he had made, Holthouse might still, upon the faith of the contract, proceed to incur expenses, taking then only risk of establishing the contract as he maintained it was. What I mean by that, is this: That if, after that notice of July 25th, the defendant Rynd had given Holthouse to understand, either in express terms or by his actions, that all he objected to was the putting of that old house on there, in the alleged violation of a contract to build a new house, and that outside of that he was willing to comply with his contract, that would not amount to a notice which would forbid Holthouse to proceed under this contract, because Rynd was not legally bound to comply with it. A notice not to go on because of a certain failure, or a certain objection, might really be an affirmance of the general contract, as you will readily see and understand, and instead of putting upon the plaintiff the responsibility of proceeding, might encourage him to believe, so far as the contract was generally concerned, that the party was willing he should proceed, that he intended to be bound by it.”] [8]</p>
