There was ample testimony to support the allegation, and although the defendants denied having such knowledge a question of veracity only was raised by such denial, and that was a matter exclusively for the jury. The ultimate question which then arises is whether the distress was lawful or not. If not, the defendants were trespassers, and were liable as such. In Kerr v. Sharp, 14 S. &amp; R. 399, we held that, “ any irregularity in taking a distress makes the landlord, at common law, <em>a trespasser ab initio,” </em>and we decided that an omission to appraise and advertise the sale of the goods dis-<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>trained agreeably to the act of March 21, 1872, was such an irregularity, and that trespass was the proper remedy. To the same effect is Brisben v. Wilson, <a href="/pa/60/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="60 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="1014532" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0452-01">60 Pa. 452</a>, in which we said, “ as no legal right or title can grow out of a trespass, the sale is invalid, and trover can be maintained against the purchaser of the goods.”</p>

That being the case trespass was an available remedy to the owner as upon any unlawful taking. In the case of Esterly Machine Co. v. Spencer, <a href="/pa/147/0466-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="147 Pa. 466" data-case-ids="829807" data-case-paths="/pa/147/0466-01">147 Pa. 466</a>, the landlord had no knowledge of the title of the owner when the distress was levied, and as soon as he was notified of the owner’s title he requested the owner to replevy the goods, and adjourned the sale to give him time to do so, but the owner did not replevy them and waited till after the sale, and then brought trespass. He had distinct actual notice of the distress before the sale, and had the opportunity to pursue the statutory remedy of replevin within the statutory time of five days, but he declined to do so and permitted the sale to proceed. We held he was bound to bring replevin. But here the distress was levied in Lancaster city, Pennsylvania, and the owners lived in Boston, Massachusetts, and had no notice of the distress, and consequently no opportunity to replevy the goods within the five days.</p>
