The trustee rented the premises to defendant for one year from Oct. 1,1890, with a privilege of renewal upon the same terms for a further period of one year. Prior to Oct. 1, 1891, the trustee renewed the lease. On Sept. 29, 1891, plaintiff by writing revoked the appointment of the trustee and notified defendant to pay plaintiff’s share of the rent to plaintiff herself. Defendant filed an affidavit of defence in which she averred that she had no notice that the trustee was not to lease and collect the rents prior to her renewal of the lease, that no notice had been given to her as provided in the lease, and that she had continued to pay the rent to the trustee. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit was sufficient to prevent judgment.</p>

Barrett gave no consideration whatever for said appointment. On or about Sept. 22, 1890, the said Simmons H. Barrett, acting as trustee, rented said premises to the defendant for the term of one year from Oct. 1,1890, at the rate of $660 per annum, to be paid in equal monthly portions in advance. The lease for the said term, a copy of which is hereto attached, also provided that if the defendant held over at the end of said term the lease should continue ‘ upon the same terms and conditions .... for a further period of one year.’ On or about Oct. 1,1891, the defendant leased the same premises for seven months from Oct. 1,1891, at the rate of $55 per month, payable in advance.

On the same day plaintiff notified said Simmons H. Barrett that she revoked the authority given him to act as her agent or trustee in the management of her interest in said premises.
