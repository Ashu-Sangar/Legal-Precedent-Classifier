While Mrs. Stahl’s house will be made less comfortable for occupancy and her whole property depreciated in value, it does not appear that there will be either an actual or constructive passing through the house, any more than would be the case, if a railway were laid on Monroe street, the same distance from the side of the building that the defendant’s new track will be from its rear. Indeed, a track on Monroe street, placed as suggested, would injure the house, as a place of residence, much more than will the cutting off the rear of the lot, and yet it can hardly be contended that a track so situated would constructively pass through the dwelling.</p>

To hold otherwise, would, in very populous communities, make the exception in the statute the rule, and make the rights of way for new railways so costly and hard to obtain as to prevent them, in most cases, from being built at all. In Lyle v. 11. R. Co., <a href="/pa/181/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="181 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="891432" data-case-paths="/pa/181/0437-01">181 Pa. 437</a>, the last case on the subject under consideration decided by our Supreme Court, an evident desire is apparent to get nearer to the literal and popular sense of the statutory words, ‘passing through any dwelling house,’ than was shown perhaps in the earlier decisions. In Maine, the word ‘ dwelling,’ used in a statute similar to ours, has been held to mean the house proper and to include no curtilage whatever: Wells v. S. &amp; K. R. R. Co., 47 Maine, 845.</p>

Considering the size, character and use of the building, and the fact that it is in a borough where residence lots are ordinarily quite limited in area, it would seem that there is left a sufficient curtilage. As to the discomforts and dangers from smoke, sparks and noise, which are necessary incidents of the operations of every railway and are experienced in common by all who live near it, whether the tracks are on their own lands or those of others, they would not constitute a constructive passing through the house, and cannot be looked at in deciding the question now before the court.
