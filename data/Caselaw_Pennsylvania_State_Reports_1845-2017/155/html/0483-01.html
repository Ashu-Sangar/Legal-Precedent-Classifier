    <p class="summary" id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.10",506,[236,840,1175,553]]]'>At the trial, before Gunnison, P. J., it appeared that plaintiff was a step-daughter of Fannie Vance, but not a member of her family. Fannie Vance became a member of the Equitable Aid Union in 1880, the beneficiary named in her certificate being her son. On the death of her son in January, 1885, a new benefit certificate was issued in which plaintiff was named as beneficiary. During the lifetime of Mrs. Vance, plaintiff paid to her various sums of money out of which the premiums were paid to the beneficial association. The evidence was conflicting as to whether the money was furnished for the express purpose of paying the premiums, or as a mere general loan or gift.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-7" data-blocks='[["BL_506.11",506,[280,1401,701,44]]]'>The court charged in part as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b506-8" data-blocks='[["BL_506.12",506,[231,1453,1175,961]],["BL_507.1",507,[157,386,1173,2037]],["BL_508.1",508,[236,375,1175,1014]]]'>“ The only question then is, what was the nature of this transaction by which this certificate was issued in which Mrs. Chidester or Mrs. Durban was named as beneficiary? The testimony is clear and uncontradicted that Mrs. Durban did furnish the money which paid the assessments upon the benefit certificate; that she furnished that money for a long period before the death of Mr. Vance, and after his death until the death of Mrs. Vance. The question for you to determine then is whether she paid these assessments or whether Mrs. Vance paid them. If this money was merely given to Mrs. Vance in order that Mrs. Vance might be able to pay them, and not for the purpose of paying them herself (Mrs. Durban), but merely for the purpose of assisting Mrs. Vance, with no promise to repay the money to Mrs. Durban, and no promise that she might derive benefit from this insurance that was payable in case of Mrs. Vance’s death—in other words, if this money which Mrs. Durban furnished to pay the assessments was a gift to Mrs. Vance, for Mrs. Vance’s benefit and not for Mrs. Chidester’s benefit, then you might be justified in finding that Mrs. Vance <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>paid the assessment and not Mrs. Chidester. If, however, this money was paid by Mrs. Chidester, if she gave the money to Mrs. Vance for the purpose of evading the provision of the law, that would make this a wagering policy, and if she advanced the money to Mrs. Vance for the purpose of deriving benefit herself from this policy, then the fact that it passed through Mrs. Vance’s hands and was paid by Mrs. Waidler to the society would not change the nature of the case at all; it would still be a payment by Mrs. Durban. [That is really the only question for you to determine; whether this money was paid by Mrs. Vance or by Mrs. Durban. Not the money that was paid before January, 1885, when the policy was changed and Mrs. Durban named as the beneficiary, but immediately after that. The assessments following that change in the certificate, were they paid by Mrs. Durban or by Mrs. Vance ? The payments that were made before are only evidence for you to consider in determining who made the assessments afterwards. The evidence of Mrs. Fargo I think is, that there was no change in the manner in which the assessments were paid until the delivery of the certificate to Mrs. Durban, which she testifies was in May of 1885. The secretary of the subordinate union, Mr. Wright, has told you that there were assessments made every month, so that there must have been assessments made in February and March and April following the issuing of the certificate in which Mrs. Durban was named as beneficiary, and there was no change made in the manner of paying the assessments. The money was taken to Mrs. Vance’s house and paid to her or Mrs. Waidler, and Mrs. Waidler then took the money to the accountant of the union and paid it, and that was the way it was done until May, 1885, so that, if that evidence is true, that is the way it was done through February and March and April. Mrs. Fargo and her daughter, one or both of them, tell you that this money was given to Mrs. Vance to do what she liked with; to pay these assessments if she desired to, or to do whatever else she pleased with it; that there was sometimes more given than what was necessary to pay the assessments. Mrs. Waidler tells you that this money with which she paid these assessments was the money of Mrs. Durban, and that she paid them for Mrs. Durban ; so that there is a conflict in the testimony, one testifying that the money was <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>given to Mrs. Vance and became her money, from which you might conclude that Mrs. Vance paid these assessments, and the other testifying that the money went through that channel merely, but was still Mrs. Chidester’s money, and that Mrs. Chidester paid the assessments. That Mrs. Waidler paid them for her, and not for Mrs. Vance.] [12] It is not for the court to determine a question of fact of that kind; it is the peculiar province of the jury, and I only call your attention to the testimony of the witnesses which it is important for you to consider in coming to a conclusion upon that point. And if you find that this money, these assessments and dues that were paid after the designation of Mrs. Durban as the beneficiary up to the time when the certificate was delivered to her and came into her possession, that these payments were made by Mrs. Vance, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff. If these payments were made by Mrs. Chidester, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the amount of those payments and the interest upon them down to date, and for the defendant Mr. Yard, who is the executor of Mrs. Vance, for the balance of the money which is in court.”</p>
