    <p class="syllabus" id="b255-4" data-blocks='[["BL_255.5",255,[220,612,1169,597]]]'>Defendants had two contracts with the United States government, one to remove Smith’s and Windmill islands in the Delaware river, and the other for dredging at League island in the same river. Plaintiffs agreed by written contract to place a dredge at defendants’ “ Philadelphia work,” and to do the dredging for a certain sum per cubic yard. In the same writing they agreed to permit defendants to use a particular dredge at League island for which plaintiffs were to pay a certain sum per day. No work was done by plaintiffs at Smith’s and Windmill islands, but their dredge was used at League island. Defendants claimed that they should be charged with only the actual amount of the material removed at the rates per cubic yard mentioned in the contract, claiming that the words “ Philadelphia work ” applied to all three of the islands. The court left it to the jury to say what was the understanding of the parties as to the words “ Philadelphia work.” <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</p>

Objected to by Mr. Peace. By Judge Bkégy: Q. Have you fully answered the question which was put to you? A. No, sir. Q. Well, go on and answer it. Objected to by Mr. Peace. A. When they were digging in scows they had to be paid six cents and a half a yard and seven dollars an hour for lost time, for waiting for scows at Smith’s island. By Mr. Walton: Q. Did you tell Mr. Mundy what you had done? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did he say ? A. He objected to paying seven dollars an hour for lost time, and he would not pay the bill. Q. Were you present when the written contract was made subsequently? A. No, sir. Q. Had you a conversation with Mr. Mundy in regard to it? A. After I made the contract with Mr. Barker, when Mr. Mundy refused to pay seven dollars an hour, I telegraphed Mr. Barker to come, and then we met Mr. Barker at eleven o’clock, and the same agreement I had made with Mr. <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>Barker before was again made when Mr. Mundy was present.

The ‘ Ajax ’ at that time was lying at Smith’s island, and Mr. Mundy and I agreed to tow her to Wilmington to get her long-boom, and the time was to commence when she left Wilmington. The time of the ‘Alva’ was to commence when she left the mouth of Duck creek.” [1]</p>

You have heard the evidence on the subject. There is nothing mysterious about it. It alludes to the Philadelphia work. Now one side contends that the words ‘Philadelphia work’ mean the work at' Smith’s island and Windmill island, while the other side contends that the words ‘ Philadelphia work ’ apply to all the work including League island. You will remember what the testimony is on the subject. It was admitted that the work was loading on or off scows, and it was that kind of work which, if done at Smith’s island or Windmill island, was to be paid for at $.06-¿ per cubic yard. If the defendant’s contention that the words ‘ Philadelphia work,’—if there was an agreement between the parties or an understanding between them at the time the contract was made, that those words were meant to apply to the League island work, then the plaintiff should charge the defendant only for 4400 yards at $.06-!,- a yard, which would make $286, instead of charging for the eight days. But if the contention of the plaintiff is correct, that the understanding was that the words ‘ Philadelphia work ’ in the contract were inserted and intended to apply,—if the understanding was that they should apply only to Windmill island and Smith’s island, then so far as the $.06|- a cubic yard is concerned the plaintiff had a right to charge so much a day for the use of that boat. So it will depend upon what you think is the fact from the 'testimony, how you will apply it. If you think the plaintiff is right in his contention, then he has the right to charge that amount of money, but if you believe the defendant’s contention, then the plaintiff should only charge $286 instead of $800, making a difference of $514. That is about the only contention that applies to the wording of the contract, so far as I understand it.”] [14]</p>
