The public have a right to use these tracks in common with the railway companies, and, therefore, while the rights of the latter are in some respects superior to those of the former, it is not negligence per se for a citizen to be anywhere upon such tracks. So long as the right of a common user of the tracks exists in the public, it is the duty of passenger railway companies to exercise such watchful care as will prevent accidents or injuries to persons who, without negligence on their own part, may not at the moment be able to get out of the way of a passing ear. The degree of care to be exercised must necessarily vary with the circumstances, and therefore no unbending rule can be laid down.</p>

The south side of the street was obstructed by building material.
