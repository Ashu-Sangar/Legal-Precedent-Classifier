    <p class="syllabus" id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[199,616,1159,632]]]'>On a bill in equity iiled by the oil inspector of Philadelphia county to restrain defendant from using alleged false marks upon barrels and packages of oil, it appeared, from the injunction affidavits, that defendant, a dealer in oil in Philadelphia, placed upon certain of the packages of oil sold by him the name of. the oil inspector of McKean county, and also upon certain other packages of oil sold by him the name and title of the oil inspector of Philadelphia county. All of the oil was inspected in Mc-Kean county, and the McKean county inspector had deputised a person in Philadelphia to place his brand upon defendant’s oil. None of the oil was inspected in Philadelphia. Plaintiff therefore claimed that he was deprived of the fees, provided by the act of May 15, 1874, P. L. 189. Held, that a preliminary injunction restraining defendant from selling oil not inspected by plaintiff, and from using the name of the McKean county inspector, was properly granted and would not be reversed by the Supreme Court.</p>
