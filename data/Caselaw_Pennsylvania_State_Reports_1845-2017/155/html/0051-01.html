The owner of the patents further agreed to give his services to defendant in the way of developing the motor covered by the patents for a period of five years, binding himself to give to defendant the benefit of all discoveries and inventions relating to electric railway equipment during said employment. Subsequently by another agreement in writing the option was extended for thirty days, and defendant agreed to furnish the necessary funds to construct four sample motors, and one dynamo. The original time at which payment was to be made for the patents was not extended. The owner of the patents gave an order to plaintiff for the construction of the four motors, and plaintiff charged them to his account. Subsequently plaintiff brought suit against defendant for the price of the motor. <em>Held, </em>that the agreements created no relation of principal- and agent between defendant and the owner of the patents, and that plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>
