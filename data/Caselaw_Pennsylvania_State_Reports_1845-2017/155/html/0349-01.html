Turner, under the following circumstances: In April, 1890, ■the bank—located and doing business at Newton, Kansas,— decided to increase its capital from $100,000 to $200,000, and for that purpose authorized its cashier, C.

T. Ives was chairman, to confer with the comptroller of the currency, and arrange details of reorganization. At a subsequent meeting held at Newton, May 20, 1891, it was further resolved to reduce the capital from $200,000 to $100,000, and on May 22d the prior proceedings of the stockholders were ratified, and the officers were authorized to issue new certificates of stock,—one share for every two shares of old stock,—to those who paid the $50.00 per share assessment on the old stock, and all stock on which said assessment was not <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>paid by June 1,1891, should be sold at public vendue on twelve days notice.

Turner has nine shares of Newton National Bank Stock.Should the bank be reorganized she will likely pay the assessment of fifty per cent. But, as she will have to borrow the money to do so, does not want to do that, unless it is a sure go. Kindly let me know how the bank stands at this time.” Mr. Ives replied to both of these communications. To the latter he says, under date of June 17th: “The letter received here from Mrs. L. E. Turner was answered, informing her that the subscriptions were all in for the $100,000, but hers and two others. One of the others is already remitted and the other is expected daily. In order to facilitate opening the bank and relieve suspense of stockholders I put in the difference required, expecting it returned to me soon enough not to afford much inconvenience.” Replying to the letter addressed to herself, Mrs. Turner, under date June 29 th, says: “On or about the day I received your letter, some two or three weeks ago, Mr. Howard, receiver for the Newton National Bank, brought suit against Mr. Turner and blocked matters for the present.”</p>

In other words, it is valid until rescinded, and it is for the defrauded party to elect whether he will be bound; but, if he affirm the contract, he must affirm it in all its terms. Pollock, Contracts, *536; Pearsoll v. Chapin, <a href="/pa/44/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="44 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="484287" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0009-01">44 Pa. 9</a>. When, however, the fraud is of such a character as to involve a crime, ratification thereof is contrary to public policy and cannot be permitted; but, where the transaction is merely contrary to good faith and fair dealing,—where it affects individual interests only—either ratification or rescission, at the election of the party defrauded, is permissible: Shisler v. Vandike, <a href="/pa/92/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="92 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="490937" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0447-01">92 Pa. 447</a>; Babcock v.

In the last case it is said if defendants were guilty of the alleged fraud, the plaintiffs, on discovering it, had an undoubted right to rescind the contract, and upon a tender of the stocks to demand back the price paid for them, but it was their duty to do so within a reasonable time. Omission to repudiate within a reasonable time is evidence, and may be conclusive evidence of an election to affirm the contract. Elec<a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>tion to rescind must be communicated to the other party. One way of doing that is to institute proceedings to have the contract judicially set aside; or, if the other party is the first to sue on the contract, the rescission, if not too late, may be set up as a defence. Where rescission is not declared in judicial proceedings, no further rule can be laid down than that there should be “ prompt repudiation and restitution as far as possible.”</p>

The undisputed evidence is that prior to the failure of the bank and institution of this suit by the receiver, neither the defendant nor his wife took any steps to rescind or repudiate the contract of subscription or to surrender the certificate of stock, as to which he testified, “ It was left on the table; I suppose I accepted it; ” nor did he deny his liability on the note. On the contrary, up to the time suit was brought, they, both indicated a willingness to join with other shareholders in their efforts to reorganize the bank. Mrs. Turner, as we have seen, wrote to the chairman of the reorganization committee : “ I want or expect to pay my 50 per cent towards reorganizing the bank; but do not wish to send the amount until I know positively that you are going to reorganize,” etc.. A few days thereafter defendant wrote to the same effect, saying his wife would likely pay the assessment “should the bank be reorganized,” but she did not want to borrow the money for that purpose “ unless it is a sure go.” At that time, as the chairman wrote them in reply, the whole amount of the assessment, $100,000, except Mrs. Turner’s and two others, was in, and one of those was on the way. Reorganization was then practically an accomplished fact. Everything, including the conduct of defendant and his wife, pointed <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>to that conclusion; and doubtless the remittance would have been made if the receiver had not brought suit in the meantime. That, as Mrs. Turner wrote, “ blocked matters for the present.” In nothing that was said or done, from the beginning up to that time, was there anything that could be tortured into election to rescind on the part of the defendant. At that time, or rather prior thereto, the rights of the bank’s creditors, to the extent of its assets, including the additional capital stock represented in part by defendant’s note, had attached; the stockholders, with the exception of Mrs. Turner and one or two others, relying on obtaining possession of all the assets, had contributed nearly 1100,000 for the purpose of reorganizing the bank, which of course included settlement and payment of all its liabilities. These facts were established by unconti'overted evidence. There was no testimony from which any jury could, or ought to be permitted to find a state of facts more favorable to the defendant.</p>
