    <p class="summary" id="b272-8" data-blocks='[["BL_272.13",272,[261,1302,1170,857]]]'>From the record it appeared that Jacob F. Schaifer, by his last will and testament, directed that, on the decease of his widow, his lands should be converted into money by his executors. Pie appointed Wilhelmina C. Henkel, Gertrude A. Tod and Thirza C. Brown, his daughters, who are also legatees, to execute the will. After the widow’s death, two of the executrixes, Mrs. Henkel and Mrs. Tod, sold at public sale to their respective husbands, John Henkel and George A. Tod, the lands in question. According to the weight of the evidence, the prices agreed to be paid were inadequate. On the day of the sale, and before the bidding commenced, Mrs. Brown caused notice to be given that she objected to any sale being then made, and would not join in making conveyance to the purchaser. When the deeds to Henkel and Tod were subsequently presented to her, she refused to execute them. Her cotrustees thereupon obtained a rule to show cause why she should not join in the conveyances, or be removed from the trust.</p>

Mrs. Brown then presented a petition, praying that her costs in the proceeding, consisting principally of witnesses’ fees, should be paid out of estate. The court made an order in- accordance with the prayer of her petition.</p>
