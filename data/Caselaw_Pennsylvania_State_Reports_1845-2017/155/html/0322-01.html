It also appeared that for certain goods which the co-defendant furnished he received the cheeks of the Tyrone Meat Company. The co-defendant denied that there was a partnership, and claimed that the other defendant had no authority to overdraw the account. The case was submitted to the jury who returned a verdict for plaintiff. <em>Meld, </em>that the judgment entered upon the verdict should be affirmed.</p>

The evidence tending to prove that defendants were partners, and that the account kept in plaintiff’s bank was connected with the business of the firm, was such that it would have been surprising if the jury had found otherwise than they did. Friedly, one of the defendants, testified in substance that he was a partner in the business conducted in the name of “ The Tyrone Meat Market,” and that he was to receive five dollars per week and half of the profits. As to the main fact of partnership, he was corroborated by facts and circumstances that were in evidence. The other defendant, Port, denied that there was any partnership between them.
