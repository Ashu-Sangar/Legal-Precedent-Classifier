It did not, however, do so, and the defendant is not now in a condition to object that the plaintiff did not state in his application in writing to the company the amount and character of the liens and incumbrances upon his property.] [2] .... The agent testified in your hearing, yesterday, very emphatically, that when Mr. Robinson asked for the policy, in the conversation between him and Mr. Robinson on the subject Mr. Robinson said, when he asked him if there were liens, judgments, mortgages or otherwise on the property, that there were none. Notwithstanding the fact that the defendant did not ask for a written application and for a statement in writing of the liens upon the property, yet, if Mr. Robinson, in making a verbal application for a policy, stated to the representative of the company that there were no liens, judgments or mortgages on the property, when in point of fact there were liens and judgments on the property, that would be a misrepresentation of the condition of the property such as would void the policy. It was an untrue statement with reference to the existing state of facts, of which you may fairly presume that both Mr. Curry and Mr. Robinson had knowledge, for the defendant offers evidence to show that at that time there were two judgments recorded in Yenango county, in which county this property is situated, both in favor of Mr. Robinson, who was then acting as agent in this respect for Mr. Curry, and both of them against Mr. Curry. The plaintiff says, however, that no such statements were made to Mr. Strouse, the agent; Mr. Robinson very positively denies that there was any inquiry made as to whether there were liens on the property at the time, and says no such question was asked him by Mr. Strouse.”</p>
