J., it appeared that on May 6, 1889, Mary Burke took out a policy of life insurance in defendant company, payable to her executors and administrators. After the policy was delivered to her, she gave it to her daughter-in-law, Bridget Burke, with instructions to pay the premiums on the policy, to pay the insured’s funeral expenses, and if anything was left to give it to her granddaughter. Another policy of the same kind was taken out in Aug. 5, 1889, and was delivered to Bridget Burke with the same instructions. Bridget Burke paid the premiums, and after the death of Mary Burke took out letters of administration upon her estate. The insurance company refused to pay the amount of the policies, and this suit was brought. The funeral expenses were $89.00. Defendant’s points were among others as follows:</p>

    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.11",320,[254,1600,1176,348]]]'>According to plaintiff’s testimony, her intestate, Mary Burke, took out the policies in suit, in her own name, and, after they were delivered to her, she handed them to the witness, her daughter-in-law, and, in the language of the latter, “ she told me to pay the premiums on them, to pay her funeral-expenses, and what would be left then, to go to my child, that was her granddaughter. ... I paid the premiums.”</p>

The premiums that matured during the lifetime of Mrs. Mary Burke, the insured, were all paid. After her death, which occurred in March, 1891, the necessary proofs were furnished to the company, but it declined to pay and suit was brought by the administratrix of the insured. On the trial, after the testimony was closed, defendant company submitted fifteen points for charge, the burden of which is that the policies in suit are what are called in law wagering policies, <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>and. therefore void as against the policy of the law; and also, because they are a fraud upon the defendant company. Of course the alleged fraud on the company was not discovered while the premiums were being regularly paid. It was only when the company was called upon to perform its part of the contract that the alleged fraud was unearthed. It does sometimes happen that a demand on certain kinds of insurance companies to pay losses will excite suspicion and arouse their virtuous indignation when everything else has failed.</p>

    <p id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[212,1101,1166,552]]]'>The first specification of error is more general than specific. It groups together the negative answers to each of the fifteen points and the instructions to the jury to find for plaintiff, etc., and may be dismissed with the remark that it is not according to rule. The remaining seven specifications are to the refusal of the court to affirm the several points therein recited. In view of the undisputed facts presented by the testimony, we are unable to discover any error in either of the specifications. Neither of the policies belongs to the class known as wagering policies, nor do we discover any evidence of fraud on the defendant company.</p>
