Subsequently an order was made upon plaintiffs to issue writs of scire facias. The attorney neglected to issue the writs, and <em>the </em>liens were lost. The question whether defendants were employed merely to file the claims or to collect them was disputed, and it was also disputed whether the attorney was employed by plaintiffs or by defendants. The whole case was submitted to the jury, with instructions that, if defendants were employed to collect the claim and if they employed the attorney to act under their instructions, they were liable. <em>Held, </em>not to be error.</p>

J., it appeared that defendants, who were collectors and conveyancers, filed for plaintiff certain mechanics’ lien claims, placing upon them the name of an attorney, whose name had been placed upon other liens previously filed by them for plaintiffs. Subsequently a rule was entered upon plaintiffs to issue a scire facias, and personal service of the notice of this rule was made upon the attorney of record for plaintiffs. The attorney, however, neglected to issue the writs, and the liens were lost. The contractor was insolvent, and plaintiffs never recovered their claims. Defendants averred that they had been employed only to file the claims, and not to collect them. They also alleged that the attorney was employed by the direction of plaintiffs.</p>

Whether the defendants were responsible for the neglect of the attorney to act, that is, to issue the writs of scire facias in pursuance of the order of the court or not, depends upon the facts which you shall find in this case. It depends, in other words, upon whether you shall find that the defendants were employed to <em>collect </em>this claim, whether they undertook to look after it and collect it and attend to it in all stages embraced in the meaning of the word ‘ collect,’ or whether they were only employed to file the claim. It is insisted by the defendants that they were not employed to collect the claim, but only to file the claim.</p>
