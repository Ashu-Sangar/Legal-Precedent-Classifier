The direction, to equally divide the money put out at interest for the use of the widow among his four children or the survivors or survivor of them after his wife’s death, seems clear to us to come within the rule that the only gift the testator made to said four children is in the direction to pay and distribute at a future time, and is not to be ranked with those cases in which the gift is first and the payment or distribution only is deferred. It is one in which time is of the essence of the gift. 2 Jarman on Wills, 5th Am. ed., p. 457.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-8" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[205,2123,1162,301]],["BL_338.1",338,[241,398,1175,1927]]]'>“In Bright v. Rowe, 3 Jarman on Wills, 5th Am. ed. 661, a case very much of the character of the case now in question, it was held that the shares of the deceased children had devolved to the survivors. The future time, ‘ after my wife’s death,’ was chiefly made and fixed by the testator as a condition absolutely necessary to arrive before any of his bounty could <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>attach to either of his four children, and without that condition he would not have made the bequest. Hence the time is annexed to the substance of the gift as a condition precedent and the vesting of the legacies was suspended. There is no antecedent, absolute or substantive gift to the four children, independent of the direction <em>‘ </em>to equally divide after my wife’s death.’ Clearly the bequest was to such children or child as should survive the death of the wife. The time for payment in this will is fixed and specified, namely, after his wife’s death, but if this were not so, it is held, in 3 Jarman on Wills, 5th Am. ed. 667, where no time is specified for payment, the word ‘ payable ’ refers to the period of distribution. So under a bequest to such children only as survive the tenant for life, a gift over in the event of the legatees dying before their shares become payable will take effect if none of the legatees survive the tenant for life, notwithstanding a time of payment be expressly mentioned in the will as at the age of twenty-one, and the legatees having attained that age; for no construction which may be put upon the word ‘ payable ’ can enlarge the class who are to take the prior bequest. But we cannot see any reason, and we have been shown no satisfactory authority, for injecting into this will any intermediate period of payment to the children of the testator between his death and the death of his wife, in order to give force and effect to the will as the testator intended. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty contained in it. Considering it as a whole, or even in parts, and attributing to the language used, as we must, its ordinary import, nothing can be collected, fairly, from it, or from the circumstances surrounding the testator at the time it was made, implying a contrary intention from what is plainly expressed. As said by Mr. Justice Williams in McClure’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=72%20Pa.%20417" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="72 Pa. 417">72 Pa. 417</a> and 418 : ‘ Where -there is no substantive gift, and it is only implied from the direction to pay, the legacy is contingent, unless, from particular circumstances, or the whole face of the will, a contraiy intention is to be collected.’ ‘ The point which determines the vesting of a legacy is not whether time is annexed to the gift, but whether it is annexed to the substance of the gift, as a condition precedent: ’ 2 Williams’ Exr. 1059.”-</p>
