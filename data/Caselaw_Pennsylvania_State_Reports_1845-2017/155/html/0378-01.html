The purpose seems to have been to re-enact all laws on the subject of collateral inheritance taxes in force at the time of its passage.

He demonstrates that the only new feature as to subjects of taxation in the act of 1887 is the provision that there shall be taxable ‘ all estates .... situated within this state,’ while the act of 1826, 9 Sm. L. 146, declares that ‘ all estates .... passing from any person who may die seized or possessed of such estate, being within this commonwealth, shall be taxable.’ The 3d section of the act of 1850, P. L. 170, provided that the words ‘being within this commonwealth ’ shall be so construed as to relate to all persons who have been at the time of their decease or now may be domiciled within this commonwealth, as well as to estates.

For so practical a purpose as taxation, [it must be regarded that Jesse Lines, not the trust company, owned the stocks and bonds. Beyond a doubt the situs of the property for purposes of taxation, including the imposition of collateral inheritance taxes, was in Pennsylvania.] [2] That this is so, and that the courts of this state recognize a distinction between tangible and intangible personal property, is shown by many cases. The following are a few of the authorities on this point referred to in the argument of counsel: Capital stock owned by a citizen of Pennsylvania in a corporation located in another state is taxable to him personally at the place of his residence for state and county purposes: McKeen v. Northampton Co., <a href="/pa/49/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="49 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="998432" data-case-paths="/pa/49/0519-01">49 Pa. 519</a>. In Orcutt’s Ap., <a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>, after stating the general rule to be that the situs of personal property follows the owner, but for particular purposes some species of personal property may have a situs distinct from the legal one, the court held that the said qualification of the rule did not apply to the property in question in that ease. It consisted of bonds of the United States held by a citizen of New Jersey, <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>who died and whose estate was administered there, the bonds being temporarily in Pennsylvania for safe keeping, the court remarking, per Justice Sterrett, that there was no reason why such property should for any purpose have a situs different from the domicile of the owner. It was further said that the act of 1849 (P. L. 572, relative to collateral taxes), which provided that, if a nonresident of the state should die leaving real or personal estate within this state, the same should be subject to collateral inheritance tax, was intended to embrace only personal property of a tangible nature actually situated or used for business purposes within this state, not mere certificates of indebtedness such as government bonds, whose situs necessarily followed the owner’s domicile. To the same effect are Kintzing v. Hutchinson, U. S. C. C. (per Justice Strong), 7 W. N. 226, and Allen v. Savings Fund, in the same court (per Judge Butler), same book, 231. In Kintzing v. Hutchinson it is intimated that the act of 1849 is repealed by the 9th section of the act of 1858, P. L. 470. It is still in force: Thayer v. Com., 12 W. N. 553. In Com’th’s Ap., (Harguindeguy’s Est.,) 11 W. N. 492, the testatrix was domiciled and died in Cuba, giving all her estate to collateral relatives also domiciled abroad. At the time of her death she owned United States loans registered in the name of her agents, who resided in this state, and also certain loans of municipal and private corporations within this state, the certificates of which were in the hands of said agents; ancillary letters c. t. a. were taken out in this state. It was held that the executor was not liable to this state for collateral inheritance tax. The Supreme Court disposed of the appeal by referring to the decision of Orcutt’s Appeal. In Thayer v. Com., supra, the decedent died domiciled in New York; at the time of his death ho was the ‘ owner of a hotel property and certain personal estate ’ in Pennsylvania, which passed to collateral relatives; the whole was declared to be liable to the collateral inheritance tax under said act of 1849. Evidently the personalty consisted of tangible property. In Small’s Estate, <a href="/pa/151/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="151 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="836645" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0001-01">151 Pa. 1</a>, the controversy was whether the interest of a nonresident decedent in a partnership, the property of which consisted principally of lands, merchandise, flour, grain and the like, in this state, was subject to collateral inheritance tax. It was held that it was because it was tangible property.</p>

Lines is an adjudication of this matter adverse to the commonwealth ? They insist that the statement in the opinion that the trust deed was a New York contract, the trustee a New York corporation, and that the court of common pleas of this county had not jurisdiction, was a decision that the property was owned and situated in New York. The reply is that said decision was a ruling of the questions presented by that case and nothing more. Concerning the property now in question, it was adjudged that the deed to the trust company was not in fraud of the rights of the plaintiff as widow, and that the objection that the instrument was testamentary could not be sustained because it was a New York contract and the court of common pleas had not jurisdiction.</p>

Therefore the decision of Lines v. Lines does not affect this case.

    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.7",413,[184,852,1168,1519]]]'>On July 22, 1890, Jesse Lines died in the city of Easton, Pennsylvania, where he had resided for over thirty years prior thereto. While on a visit to New York, in May, 1887, he executed and delivered to the Union Trust Company, a corporation organized under the laws of New York and doing business in that state, a deed of trust of one hundred and eighteen mortgage bonds, of $1,000 each, issued by a Missouri railroad corporation, and two hundred and eighty-one shares capital stock of the Taylor Iron Works, a New Jersey corporation, doing business therein. These securities were then delivered and, on the books of the respective corporations, transferred to "“The Union Trust Company of New York, in trust for Jesse Lines and others.” According to the provisions of the deed, said trustee was to hold the securities, collect the interest and income thereof and pay the same to the said Jesse Lines during his natural life, and, upon his decease, to divide said bonds and stock and transfer one half thereof to certain of his nephews and nieces and the residue to his putative son, as specified in said trust. The trust deed contains a clause in which the said Jesse Lines, as first party thereto, reserves to himself “ the right and power, by an instrument in writing to be delivered to the second party, to alter, change, modify or revoke all disposition and direction as to transfer and dispositions made and to be made of said property after the decease of first party.” But it does not appear that the right thus reserved was ever exercised. The trustee collected and paid over to Mr. Lines the income of the trust securities during his life, and after his decease divided and distributed the corpus of the trust, consisting of said securities, etc., to the beneficiaries entitled thereto, according to the provisions of the deed.</p>

During same time he had a wife who survived him and died. But neither then nor at the time of his decease had he any child or children born in lawful wedlock, nor any descendant of any such child or children, nor father or mother.</p>
    <p id="b414-4" data-blocks='[["BL_414.4",414,[258,690,1171,1208]]]'>This proceeding was instituted by the register of wills of Northampton county for the purpose of enforcing payment of collateral inheritance tax, under the law of this state, on the bonds aiid stock of which Mr. Lines was the beneficial owner up to the time of his death, and which, upon that event, passed to said beneficiaries by virtue of said trust, which, as to them, was intended to and did take effect, in enjoyment, immediately after his decease, and not before. It was admitted that none of the beneficiaries under said deed resided in the state of New York at the date of its execution, nor at any time since, except Jesse T. Lines, who, for a short time subsequent to the death of Jesse Lines, resided in Brooklyn, New York; all said beneficiaries lived in Pennsylvania, except Mary E. Perkins, Harriet Hill and Eva E. Lines, who, at the time said trust was created and at the date of Jesse Lines’s death, lived in the state of Minnesota. There were no debts owing by the decedent to any person in the state of New York, and no ancillary administration in that state; nor was there any collateral inheritance or succession tax paid upon the estate of Jesse Lines, or any part thereof, in that state, nor any such return charged against the same or paid to authorities of said state upon any property mentioned in or distributed under said trust deed. The securities which were distributed to the beneficiaries were appraised at over $130,000.</p>
    <p id="b414-5" data-blocks='[["BL_414.5",414,[263,1911,1168,397]]]'>The appeal from valuation fixed by the register’s appraiser was heard and disposed of by the learned president of the 31st district, who, after fully stating all the material facts, including those outlined above, and exhaustively considering the questions of law arising thereon, held that the securities referred to were subject to collateral inheritance tax in the hands of said beneficiaries; and he accordingly dismissed the appeal and entered the decree from which this appeal was taken.</p>
    <p id="b414-6" data-blocks='[["BL_414.6",414,[265,2318,1168,93]],["BL_415.1",415,[200,385,1178,2042]],["BL_416.1",416,[242,388,1173,503]]]'>In view of the undisputed facts, it is strange that any question should have been seriously raised, either as to the right of <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>the commonwealth to the tax on the securities, or the liability of the beneficiaries to pay their respective proportions thereof. Mr. Lines was not only the beneficial owner of the securities prior to and at the time of his decease, but under the reserved power of modification, revocation, etc., he had absolute control of the disposition to be made of the securities upon his decease. At any time prior thereto, he could have modified or revoked the trust in favor of the beneficiaries named in the deed. It is true the legal title to the securities was in the Trust Company, but aside from mere compensation for its services, as custodian of the property, the company had no beneficial interest therein. In any proper sense of the term, the securities were the personal property of Mr. Lines. They were his to enjoy during his lifetime, and his to dispose of, in any manner he saw fit, at any time prior to his decease. He chose to leave the trust in favor of the beneficiaries unaltered and unrevoked, and, as he intended, it took effect, in enjoyment, immediately after his decease. Moreover, the securities were that kind of personal property, the situs of which follows the owner. As was said in Orcutt’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>, the general rule is that the situs of personal property follows the owner, but for particular purposes some species of personalty may have a situs distinct from the legal one, but that in question is not within any of the recognized exceptions to the general rule. That was clearly shown by the learned judge who presided specially at the hearing in the court below, as may be seen by reference to his clear and convincing opinion. The manifest purpose of our collateral inheritance tax law is to subject property, limited by deed in the manner stated in the statute, to taxation, because it is still substantially the property of the grantor, and does not actually pass, nor is it intended to pass to the collateral beneficiaries until his death, and hence it is essentially similar in that respect to a devolution of property by testacy or intestacy upon the death of the owner. That is illustrated by several of our cases, among which are lieish v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/106/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="65" data-cite="106 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="455546" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0521-01">106 Pa. 521</a>; Seiberts’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/110/0329-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="110 Pa. 329" data-case-ids="543771" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0329-01">110 Pa. 329</a>; DuBois’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=121%20Pa.%20386" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="121 Pa. 386">121 Pa. 386</a>. In the former it was held that the right of the commonwealth to the tax was not defeated by a conveyance or transfer of title to the property during the lifetime of the owner, nor by possession taken under such conveyance, if the enjoyment of the' <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>property conveyed is not intended to take effect until the death of the grantor. In DuBois’s Appeal, supra, speaking of the deed made by the grantor and possession taken by the grantee thereunder, etc., it is said: “ The naked legal title acquired by the grantee was the merest shadow. The grantor held a firm grasp on the entire substance, and he retained it as long as he lived. In view of all this, it is idle to contend that, in any proper or statutory sense of the word ‘ enjoyment,’ the conveyance in question took effect or was intended to take effect in enjoyment prior to the death of John DuBois.”</p>
    <p id="b416-5" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[242,899,1172,188]]]'>It follows from what has been said that the conclusions reached by the court below on all the controlling questions in the case are correct, and the decree based upon the principles thus established should not be disturbed.</p>
    <p id="b416-6" data-blocks='[["BL_416.5",416,[242,1104,1173,452]]]'>The learned judge was clearly correct in saying, as recited in the second specification: “ It must be regarded that Jesse Lines, not the Trust Company, owned the stocks and bonds. Beyond a doubt, the situs of the property for the purpose of taxation, including the imposition of collateral inheritance tax, was in Pennsylvania.” There appears to be no error in either of the matters referred to in the remaining specifications. In view of what has been already said in the opinion of the court below and here, neither of them requires special consideration.</p>
    <p id="b416-7" data-blocks='[["BL_416.6",416,[242,1565,1171,95]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellants.</p>
