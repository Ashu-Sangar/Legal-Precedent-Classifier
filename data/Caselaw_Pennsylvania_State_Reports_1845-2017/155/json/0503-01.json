He gave by apt words to his daughter the sum of five hundred dollars, adding these directions, \u201c to be placed in the hands of James Calvin Baker my son for the use of her during her lifetime, and to act as her trustee.\u201d The contention of the appellant is that these words reduced her interest in the gift from an absolute to a life estate. But it is to be noticed that no separate use is created. No active duties are imposed upon the trustee. No gift over to take effect on her death is made. Without the words that create the trust the gift is absolute beyond all question; but the trust is dry, and in the absence of a gift over the effect of tbe gift to his daughter is to be determined as though the testator had made no direction about the custody of the fund during her life. The words of gift are \u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter Amanda F. Baker five hundred dollars.\u201d The effect of these words is clear. They gave an absolute estate. This estate was not reduced to one for life by the added direction creating a dry trust.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

T., 1892, by defendant, James Calvin Baker, trustee under will of David Baker, deceased, from judgment of C. P. Cumberland Co., in favor of E. J. McCune, executor of Amanda Baker, deceased, on case stated.\nBefore Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nCase stated to determine ownership of legacy under will of David R. Baker, deceased.\nFrom the case stated it appeared that David R. Baker died on March 15, 1883, leaving a will by which he made the following bequest: \u201c I give, devise and bequeath to my daughter, Amanda E. Baker, five hundred dollars, to be placed in the hands of James Calvin Baker, my son, for the use of her during her lifetime, and to act as trustee for her.\u201d\nJames Calvin Baker accepted the trust, received the $500 from the estate of David R. Baker, and acted as trustee until the death of Amanda E. Baker, Oct. 21, 1891. By her will, dated Aug. 29, 1891, she bequeathed said legacy to her daughter, Emma Eckert.\nThe case stated concluded as follows:\n\u201c If the court be of the opinion that the said Amanda E. Baker took an absolute estate in said bequest of $500 under the will of David It. Baker, aforesaid, then judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for the sum of $443.21, found in the hands of said trustee, by his account confirmed to March term, 1892, of the orphans\u2019 court. But if the court be of the opinion that she only took a life estate, and the said bequest at her death went to the residuary legatees under the will of the said David R. Baker, then judgment is to be entered for the defendant.\u201d\nJudgment for plaintiff on case stated. Defendant appealed.\nKrror assigned was entry of above judgment.\nJ. W. Wetzel, W. A.
