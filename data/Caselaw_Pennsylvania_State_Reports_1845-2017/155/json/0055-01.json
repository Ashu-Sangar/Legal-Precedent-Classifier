Fees, Appellant.\nOpening judgment\u2014Discretion of court.\nIn an application to open a judgment entered upon a warrant of attorney, a wide discretion must necessarily be exercised by the court below, and on appeal the Supreme Court will only reverse where this discretion has been abused.\nWhere, on such application, defendant testifies that the judgment was paid under an agreement by which he gave up his grocery business and went to plaintiff\u2019s saloon to act as a bartender, and the plaintiff denies the payment under the agreement, the Supreme Court will not reverse the decision of the lower court refusing to open the judgment.\nArgued Jan. 3,1893.\nAppeal, No. 237, Jan. T., 1892, by defendant, Plarry Fees, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., June T., 1891, No. 335, refusing to open judgment.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nRule to open judgment upon a warrant of attorney for $200.\nOn the hearing of the rule defendant testified that plaintiff, a licensed saloon keeper, asked him to take charge of her saloon and manage it for her, which he refused to do, on the ground that he could not dispose of his grocery business; that several times after this she made the same request, and said to him that \u201c whatever he would lose in the sale of his store, she would make good,\u201d and finally he was prevailed upon to sell out his store in consideration of her discharging his obligation to pay the judgment in question; that in pursuance of this agreement he sold out his grocery store, losing more than $200 in the sale, and went to work for plaintiff: that shortly afterwards plaintiff said to defendant\u2019s wife, showing her paper: \u201c Katie, this is the note that you gave me; I might as well tear it up, as it is no good now, because everything is made right.\u201d\nPlaintiff denied the terms of the agreement as stated by defendant, and averred that the note had never been paid.\nRule to open judgment discharged.\nError assigned was above order.\nM.
