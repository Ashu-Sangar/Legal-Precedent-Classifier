    "head_matter": "Brown, Appellant, v. Equitable Gas Co.\nEquity\u2014Preliminary injunction\u2014Contract\u2014Natural gas.\nA natural gas company entered into a contract to supply gas to plaintiffs, a firm, of which one of the directors of the company was senior partner. In consideration of plaintiffs guaranteeing the debts of the company they were charged a lower rate than was charged to the public. The contract contained the following clause: \u201c The Equitable Gas Company agrees to furnish the gas to the said consumers so long as with ordinary diligence and outlay it can procure gas, and under the contracts now ordb narily in use by gas companies.\u201d Some time after the date of the contract the supply of gas began to fail, and the evidence showed that it could only be obtained at a greatly increased cost to the company. The rates were accordingly raised. Other consumers who were also guarantors of the company\u2019s debts paid the increased rates, but the plaintiffs refused to pay them, and filed a bill in equity to restrain the company from cutting off their supply of gas. Held, that the refusal of the court to grant a preliminary injunction would not be reversed on appeal.\nArgued April 14, 1898.\nAppeal, No. 77, Oct. T., 1893, by plaintiffs, J. Stuart Brown et al., trading as Brown & Co., from decree of C. P. No. 1, Allegheny Co., March T., 1893, No. 471, refusing preliminary injunction.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Thompson, JJ.\nBill in equity for injunction.\nFrom the pleadings and affidavits it appeared that defendant company was organized under the act of May 29,1885, relating to natural gas companies. By an agreement, dated Jan. 28, 1889, plaintiffs, with other persons and firms, agreed to take stock in the company, and became guarantors of the debts. Subsequently on April 2, 1889, a new contract was entered into by which the capital stock was increased. Plaintiffs subscribed to additional stock, and increased the extent of their guaranty of the company\u2019s debts. It was provided by the contract that plaintiffs and other subscribers who consumed gas should be supplied at a rate less than was charged to the general public. The contract contained this clause: \u201c The Equitable Gas Company agrees to furnish the gas to said consumers so long as with ordinary diligence and outlay it can procure gas, and under the contracts now ordinarily in use by gas companies.\u201d The senior member of plaintiff\u2019s firm was a director of the company at the time the contract was executed.\nIn 1889, the supply of gas began to fail, and it could only be obtained at a greatly increased cost to the company. The company accordingly raised its rates. All the other subscribing consumers paid the increased rates, but plaintiffs refused to pay them, and filed this bill to prevent their supply of gas from being cut off.\nThe court refused a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff ap pealed.\nError assigned was the refusal of a preliminary injunction.\nJames H. Reed and Marcus A. Woodward, P. 0. Knox with them, for appellants, cited :\nWhiteman v.
