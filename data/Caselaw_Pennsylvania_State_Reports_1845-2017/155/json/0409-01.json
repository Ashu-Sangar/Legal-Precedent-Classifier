        "text": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Mitchell,\nThere are some formal objections to the bill, which should be briefly noticed. It joins separate respondents, acting in different capacities, upon different rights, and not chargeable with any joint liability or interest in the relief sought. Among these respondents are the sheriff and the assignee for the benefit of creditors, neither of whom is a proper party to a bill of this nature. The sheriff is not, because he is acting under the command of a writ, and accountable for his action, to the court from which it issued. This is not practically of any importance in the present case, because the writ and the bill are in tbe same court, but it is incorrect practice. An injunction to stay proceedings at law should go against the party, not against tbe sheriff or other officer who is already under the mandate of one court, and should not be put in peril of disobedience by discordant orders of conflicting jurisdictions. For the same reasons the assignee should not be made party. He is accountable to another court, which has tbe exclusive control over bis official action, and may perchance bold that he should have done the very thing this injunction prohibits.\nBut the substantial question is the right of complainants to invoke the aid of a court of equity to interfere with the due course of proceedings at law by a creditor to obtain satisfaction of bis judgment. It is conceded that this injunction is without precedent in Pennsylvania. The complainants are of two classes, one mere simple contract creditors with neither judgment nor lien, tbe other, also without judgment, but with sucb lien as they have obtained by attachment under the act of 1869. As to the former tlie overwhelming weight of authority is against tbe asserted right. It is enough for us to quote the deliberate opinion of Chancellor Kent in Wiggins v. Armstrong, 2 Johns. Ch. 144, where, after stating frankly that his first impression was in favor of the jurisdiction in equity, ho concludes after examination of the cases that it could not be sustained, and that there ought to be no interference until the creditor has established his title by judgment. \u201c On the strength of settled authorities \u201d he dismissed the bill. Tbe cases cited by appellant show that this view has \u201cbeen followed with great uniformity in nearly all the states where the question has arisen. The cases also show that the same general rule applies to the second class of the complainants, those who have issued attachments. Exceptional cases may arise in which creditors having a lieu, even though only by attachment on mesne process, ma}r have a standing for assistance in equity, but tiie presumption is against them and for the same reasons as in regard to the other class. As a general rule they are left to their rights and remedies at law.\nThe present is not such an exceptional case as would bring it within our authorities. As already said there is no precedent upon the same state of facts, but the general rule that equity will not interfere between debtor and creditor, but will leave each to his rights and his remedies at law, is settled beyond all question. The cases in which equity has been most frequently invoked, are where the creditor is alleged to be proceeding under forms of law, but in violation of other parties\u2019 rights. Of this class are Gilder v. Merwin, 6 Whart. 522; Riley v. Ellmaker, 6 Whart. 545; Reeser v. Johnson, 76 Pa. 313; Taylor\u2019s Appeal, 93 Pa. 21; Davis v. Michener, 106 Pa. 395 ; and Walker\u2019s Appeal, 112 Pa. 579. The only exception so far recognized is in the case of a levy upon a wife\u2019s separate property for a debt of the husband. It was held in Hunter\u2019s Appeal, 40 Pa. 194, that a bill would lie for an injunction in such case, but the decision was put upon the ground that the statute expressly prohibits such a levy, and the fact that the wife\u2019s title was undisputed. In the subsequent case of Thompson\u2019s Appeal, 107 Pa. 559, an injunction was awarded against repeated actions of ejectment brought by a sheriff\u2019s vendee of the husband\u2019s title, but it was again on the ground that such action was contrary to the statute, the wife\u2019s estate being undoubted, and the ejectments not brought in good faith. If there be any doubt or dispute on the facts the creditor is entitled to levy and sell, and proceed by ejectment on the sheriff\u2019s deed. Winch\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 424. In this case it is said by Ag-nbw, J., that the jurisdiction in equity \u201c was never intended to be used to obstruct the collection of debts.\u201d And in Taylor\u2019s Appeal, supra, the present Chief Justice, after stating the rule that equity will not intervene, but the creditor will be allowed to proceed with his execution, and test the title by ejectment, continues: \u201c It may happen that the bona fide owner of real estate is subjected to the inconvenience of having his property levied on for the debt of one who is not and has never been interested therein. . . . but such results cannot be wholly avoided. Relief must be sought when they so occur, in speeding the determination of the questions in dispute by such means as are provided by law for that purpose.\u201d\nThe only case at all analogous to the present, in which a creditor not having a judgment has been permitted to interfere with the debtor\u2019s disposition of his property, is Fowler v. Kingsley, 87 Pa. 449. In that case the bill averred that the debtor had conveyed land to his son-in-law, by collusion to defraud his creditors, and that the grantee was about to convey to bona fide purchasers. The debtor having died, the bill was sustained upon the ground that the creditor complainant, though without a judgment, had an express statutory lien, which gave him a standing.\nTo sustain the present injunction would be going a decided step farther than any case adjudicated, and in opposition to established principles. The subject is not without serious difficulties, in either aspect. That the present practice affords some opportunities for fraud must be conceded, and the case in hand, full as it is of suspicious circumstances, is an apt illustration. But on the other hand, the contrary practice would be susceptible of enormous abuse, if every suspicious or unscrupulous self-asserted creditor may, without any proof of his own claim, arrest the regular process of law and tie the hands of the debt- or and his bona fide creditors, by vague and general charges of fraud and collusion, including, as in the present case, with very slight if any evidence at all, the sheriff and the assignee for the benefit of creditors. \u201c A rule of procedure which allowed any prowling creditor, before his claim was definitely established by judgment, and without reference to the character of his demand, to file a bill .... to impeach transfers or to interfere with the business affairs of the alleged debtor, would manifestly be susceptible of the grossest abuse. A more powerful weapon of oppression could not be placed at the disposal of unscrupulous litigants.\u201d Wait on Fraudulent Conveyances, sect. 78.\nAs said by our brother Stereett, in Taylor\u2019s Appeal, already quoted, inconvenient results in individual cases cannot be wholly avoided, and the relief must be sought by the means provided by law. We think it better to stand on the established remedies. And these are not so inefficient and inadequate as appellees seem to think. The creditors who have attachments on the goods have of course a standing to rule the sheriff bo pay proceeds of sale into court, and there to question the validity of the confessed judgments, so as to increase the fund going to the assignee for their benefit. The assignee can be made to do his full duty, or be discharged by the court having jurisdiction over him. And it may be that if the assignment is shown clearly to be fraudulent and collusive, and meant to hinder and delay creditors, and that their hands are thereby tied as against the fraudulent judgments, and they are left without legal remedy, then not only can the assignee be removed, but the assignment itself may be vacated and declared void on a creditor\u2019s bill. This question however is not raised in the present case and we do not now decide it. It can only be raised on a direct attack by a bill for that purpose in the court having jurisdiction over the assignment. The present bill cannot be sustained.\nInjunction dissolved and bill dismissed.\nMe. Chief Justice Steeeett dissented.",

In this case the attaching creditors acquired no lien, because\u2019 title to the merchandise at the time of their attachments was vested in the assignee for the benefit of creditors.\nFor any dereliction of duty on the part of the sheriff or assignee the remedy was not in equity. There was no such dereliction., If the judgments complained of were fraudulent, even if the attaching creditors held a lien, the common law remedy of attacking such creditors should have been resorted to.\nThe common law affords a remedy which is sufficient and is exclusive.\nJohn Sparhawk, Jr., John Weaver and John M. (Jest with him, for sundry appellees.\nThis is an interlocutory decree with which the Supreme Court will not interfere: Sheaffer\u2019s Ap., 100 Pa. 380 ; Scranton Gas Co. v. Northern Coal Co., 145 Pa. 21; Penrose v. Nixon, 140 Pa. 45; Roaring Creek Water Co. v. Girton, 142 Pa. 92; Dodd v. Smith, 144 Pa. 340; Black Lick Co. v. Saltsburg Gas Co., 139 Pa. 448; Thompson Glass Co. v. Fayette Fuel-Gas Co., 137 Pa. 317; Penna. R. R. v. Freeport, 138 Pa. 91; Acheson v. Stevenson, 130 Pa. 633; Curwensville Borough\u2019s Ap., 129 Pa. 74 ; Patterson\u2019s Ap., 129 Pa. 109; Whiteman v. Fayette Fuel-Gas Co., 139 Pa. 492.\nThe goods are not perishable and should not be sacrificed at a sheriff\u2019s sale. Irreparable injury will be the result of the dissolution of this injunction. No preference is asked by the appellees, but only that the goods may not be sacrificed pending the determination of the rights of the judgment creditors to their alleged lien. The custody of a receiver or an assignee can protect all parties: Act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 632.\nThe facts in this case disclose not only a fraudulent judgment, but that the debts due the appellees were fraudulently contracted, and that the fraudulent contraction of the debts, the fraudulent confession of judgments, the lumping sheriff\u2019s sale, under the control of the debtors, conspirators, and the fraudulent assignment for the benefit of creditors formed, as a whole, a concerted scheme to defraud the appellees.\nThe appellants cited as the leading case, Wiggins v. Armstrong, 2 Johns. Ch. 144, where the plaintiffs had not obtained any lien whatever upon the property of the defendant, nor did the case show (as does this at bar) combination as well as fraud. As it was, Chancellor Kent rendered his decision, as it seems, reluctantly against his first impression.\nBigelow v. Andress, 31 Ills. 323, relied upon by the appellants, was decided purely, upon the ground that the plaintiffs seeking relief had no lien upon the defendant\u2019s effects.\nReference to the case of Brashear v. West, 7 Peters, 608, will show that the Supreme Court of the United States (opinion by Chief Justice Mabshall), in construing the act of Pennsylvania in regard to foreign attachments, held that the service of an attachment upon a garnishee placed the goods of the debtor in the garnishee\u2019s hands in custodia legis and gave the plaintiff a lien.\nIn Smith v. R. R., 99 U. S. 400, the complainant had no lien upon the fund.\nIn McDermott v. Blois, 1 R. M. C. (Ga.) 281, the demurrer to the bill was sustained because the complainant was not a lien creditor.\nIn Cohen v. Meyers, 42 Ga. 46, the bill charged insolvency of the debtor and that he had fraudulently transferred his goods to a third person, who was charged with complicity in the fraud, and that the debtor had bought the goods with intent to defraud the plaintiffs; the court allowed a receiver at the instance of a simple contract creditor who had not reduced his claim to judgment. See also to the same effect Heyneman v. Dannenberg, 6 Cal. 376 ; Field v. Holzman, 93 Ind. 205; Fowler\u2019s Ap., 87 Pa. 449; Cogburn v. Pollock, 54 Miss. 639; Blum v. Schram, 58 Texas, 524; High, Inj. \u00a7 1405; Manufacturing Co. v. Bradley, 105 U. S. 182.\nA creditor without having first obtained a judgment at law-may come into a court of equity to set aside fraudulent conveyances of his debtor made for the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors and to subject the property to the payment of the debt due: Thurmond v. Reese, 3 Ga. 449; Cornwell v. Radway, 22 Wis. 260 ; Sanderson v. Stockdale, 11 Ind. 563 ; Des Brisay v. Hogan, 58 Me. 554; Day v. Washburn, 24 Howard, 352; Tappan v. Evans, 11 N. H. 311; Holt v.

Hatch, 17 Ill. 281.\nIn the supervision of trustees, especially assignees for the benefit of creditors, the courts of common pleas are wisely-clothed with very large discretionary powers, and their orders and decrees should not be modified or reversed, except for manifest abuse of such discretion: Weiskettle\u2019s Ap., 103 Pa. 522; News v. Shackamaxon Bank, 16 W. N. 207; Union Banking Co. Case, 12 Phila. 214; Klapp\u2019s Assignee v. Shirk, 13 Pa. 589; Neal v. Bank, 11 Pa. 17; Irwin v. Keen, 3 Whart. 347 ; Zerbe v. Miller, 16 Pa. 495.\nThe right of a creditor is not taken away or postponed by the existence of a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors Bank v. Hopkins, 111 Pa. 329.\nWilliam S. Divine, Samuel B. Buey with him, for appellees.\n\u2014The judgments were fraudulent: United States v. Conyngham, Wallace C. C. R. 178; Eberle v. Mayer, 1 Rawle, 366; Com. v. Strembach, 3 Rawle, 341: McClure v. Ege, 7 Watts, 74; Mentz v. Hamman, 5 Whart. 150 ; Weir v. Hale, 3 W. & S. 285; Baum, Raiguel & Co. v. Ahl, 29 Pa. 387.\nThat a judgment fraudulently given by collusion between debtor and plaintiff in such judgment for the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors can be attacked collaterally is beyond question: Reed\u2019s Ap., 71 Pa. 380; Thompson\u2019s Ap., 57 Pa. 175; Clark v. Douglass, 62 Pa. 408; Sheetz v. Hambest, 81 Pa. 102; Second National Bank of Titusville\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 460.\nJulius O. Levi, for sundry appellees.\nAttaching creditors have a standing to attack the judgments: Wade on Attachments, ed. 1886, \u00a7 33, p. 77; Wait, Fraudulent Conveyances, ed. 1889, \u00a7 81, p. 127; Bates v.
