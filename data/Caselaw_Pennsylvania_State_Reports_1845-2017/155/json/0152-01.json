An amendment was allowed at bar which brings the principal specification within our rules. An examination of the case shows that it is without merit. The main ground of complaint was that the learned judge below admitted in evidence the interlined deed from Samuel Opp and wife to William Zimmerman. The ob jection to the deed was that no evidence had been offered to explain the interlineation. The learned judge below held, after an inspection of the deed, that the interlineation did not unfavorably affect the defendant. The interlineation appears to have been in the same handwriting as the body of the deed and made with the same ink and probably with the same pen. There was nothing to indicate fraud or attempted fraud in the interlineation, and as it was apparently prejudicial to the party offering the deed, we do not think its admission was error.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Zimmerman v. Camp, Appellant.\nPractice, Supreme Court\u2014Assignments of error\u2014Amendment.\nAn assignment of error to the admission of evidence which fails to set forth the full substance of the bill of exception violates rule xxrv. of the Supreme Court; but the court will in its discretion permit an amendment of the assignment at bar.\nPeed\u2014Interlineation\u2014Pmdence.\nA judgment will not be reversed because a deed with interlineation was admitted in evidence, where the interlineation appeal\u2019s to have been in the same handwriting as the body of the deed, and made with the same ink and probably with the same pen; and there is nothing to indicate fraud or attempted fraud, and the interlineation itself is apparently prejudicial to the appellee rather than to the appellant.\nArgued Jan 30, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 105, July. T., 1892, by defendant, Andrew Camp, from judgment of C. P. Lehigb Co., April T., 1892, No. 68, on verdict for plaintiff, William Zimmerman.\nBefore Pax,son, C. J., Green, Willliams, Mc-Collum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nTrespass for cutting trees.\nAt the trial, before Albright, P. J., plaintiff claimed that he was the owner of the land on which the trees stood, and offered in evidence deed from Samuel Opp and wife to William Zimmerman, dated April 1, 1860, for a messuage and tract of land situate in Lynn township, Lehigh county, deed duly acknowledged, but not recorded, and alleged to include the premises in controversy in this case. Objected to for the reason that there are interlineations and alterations in the description of the premises conveyed. Counsel for the plaintiff states that the interlineations and alterations do not refer to or concern the disputed line.\nBy the Court: It appearing to the court by an inspection of the deed that the interlineation of \u201c and one \u201d affecting a certain short line would change the survey against the plaintiff who now offers the deed in evidence and seemingly would make the disputed line more favorable to the defendant than if the interlineation were rejected\u2014in other words, that the interlineation does not unfavorably affect the defendant\u2014therefore the objection is overruled. Exception. [1]\nThe court also admitted under objection and exception a patent from the commonwealth to the plaintiff [2] ; the notes of testimony of a witness, now deceased, at a former trial [3] ; and the record of the former trial between the same parties. [4]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1-4), rulings on evidence as above, but not quoting in the specification the bills of exception or evidence\u2014corrected by amended specifications filed at bar.\nEdward A. Anderson, John H. Eow with him, for appellant, cited:\nMorris v. Vanderen, 1 Dall. 64; Jordan v. Stewart, 23 Pa. 244; Burgwin v. Bishop, 91 Pa. 336; Craighead v. McLoney, 99 Pa. 211; Robinson v.
