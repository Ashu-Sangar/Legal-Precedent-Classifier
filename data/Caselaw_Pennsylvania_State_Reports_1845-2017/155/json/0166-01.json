    "head_matter": "McCullough v. Ashbridge, Appellant.\nCustom.\u2014Mason\u2019s measurement\u2014Evidence.\nIn an action to recover the price of building four stone gate piers, at two dollars per perch, mason\u2019s measure, it is not improper to admit evidence of a custom among masons to measure piers by finding their actual surface contents, and dividing the result by sixteen and one half.\nArgued Feb. 9, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 100, Jan. T., 1893, by defendant, Abram S. Ashbridge, from judgment of C. P. Chester Co., Jan. T., 1892, No. 91, on verdict for plaintiff, James McCullough.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAssumpsit on building contract.\nPlaintiff claimed to recover $34.00 for building four stone piers or gate posts, at $2.00 per perch, mason\u2019s measure. The posts were circular in form, three feet in diameter and seven and one half feet high.\nAt the trial, before Waddell, P. J., plaintiff offered evidence of a custom among masons in the locality to measure piers by finding their actual surface contents, and dividing the result by sixteen and one half. Defendant claimed that the custom was unreasonable.\nDefendant\u2019s points were among others as follows:\n4. Request for binding instructions. Refused. [1]\n\u201c 7. There being evidence that there are different rules of measurement in this locality, the parties are relegated to the rules of law. Answer: If you should conclude that there are different rules, then it affects the question of custom; but it does not dispose of the question as to how much work was done. If you should conclude there are various rules as to measuring, then you will reach the conclusion that there is no custom about it; that the custom is not so uniform and certain as to warrant you in saying that it is a custom. And still it is for you to ascertain how much work he did by the measurements which have been submitted.\u201d [3]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were, (1, 3) instructions, quoting them.\nA. 8. Ashbridge, Jr., for appellant, cited:\nCope v. Dodd, 13 Pa. 33; Adams v. Pittsburgh Ins. Co., 76 Pa. 411; Jones v. Wagner, 66 Pa. 429 ; Jordan v. Meredith, 3 Yeates, 318; Walls v. Bailey, 49 N. Y. 464; Evans v. Waln, 71 Pa. 69; Horner v. Watson, 79 Pa. 242; Coleman v. Chadwick, 80 Pa. 81.\nThos. W.
