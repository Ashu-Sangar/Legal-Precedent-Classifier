We need not discuss the evidence or refer to the numerous authorities upon this subject. The case itself involves nothing new and we have gone over the subject so fully in former decisions that nothing remains to be added.

Schwartz et al.\nStatute of limitations\u2014Acknowledgment of debt.\nA statement by defendant that he is willing to pay his share of a joint debt and it should be paid, followed by an assertion that he would not pay unless compelled by law to do so, is not sufficient to toll the statute; nor is a statement that he was willing to pay his share if the other debtors did the same.\nPractice\u2014\u25a0Exception to reserved point.\nWhere no specific exception to the form of a reserved point is taken in the court below, the Supreme Court will not consider it.\nArgued Jan. 81, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 131, July T., 1892, by \u2022 plaintiff, Ephraim B. Heany, administrator of John K. Heany, deceased, from judgment of C. P. Montgomery Co., June T., 1890, No. 75, for defendants, John H. Schwartz and Simeon W. Moyer, non obstante veredicto.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nAssumpsit on promissory note.\nOn the trial, before Weand, J., it appeared that the note was given on July 23,1881, and signed by Abraham D. Delph, John M. Moyer, Isaac K. Kreibel, John H. Schwartz and Simeon W. Moyer. The evidence to take the case out of the statute was as follows:\nSchwartz said he was willing to pay his share and it should be paid. It all hung on Kreibel. He said he wouldn\u2019t pay unless he was compelled by law to do so. He didn\u2019t say how much he would pay.\nMoyer said it should have been paid long ago and he was willing to pay his share, but he said it was hard to pay lost money. He said he would have settled up this long ago, but it hung on others. He said he had been long willing to pay this money and it ought to have been paid long ago. He was willing to pay his share. He said he would like to have it fixed up, he was tired of it, but it depended on the rest, Delp and others he mentioned, and he mentioned Kreibel too.\nDelp, Kreibel and the others, except these two defendants, paid their proportion, and the suit was discontinued as to them.\nThe court directed the jury to render a verdict for plaintiff reserving the question of law \u201c whether there is any evidence to be submitted to the jury to warrant recovery against the defendants.\u201d The court subsequently entered judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.\nErrors assigned wore (1) in reserving the question of law, quoting it as above; (2) in entering judgment for defendants.\nCharles Hunsicker, Wm. E. Fannehower with him, for appellant, cited,\non the question of the statute of limitation: Palmer v. Gillespie, 95 Pa. 340 ; Croman v. Stull, 119 Pa. 91; Yost v. Grim, 116 Pa. 527.\nMontgomery Evans, Louis M. Childs with him, for appellees, cited:\nSenseman v. Hershman, 82 Pa. 83; Schaeffer v. Hoffman, 113 Pa. 1; Lowrey v. Robinson, 141 Pa. 189; Harbold v.
