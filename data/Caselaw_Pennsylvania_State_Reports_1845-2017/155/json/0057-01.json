    "head_matter": "Horn, Trustee, v. Davis, Appellant.\nConversion of piano\u2014Evidence of title.\nDeiendant leased a piano from a dealer who subsequently made an assignment for the benefit of creditors. The assignee under an order of court assigned the lease to plaintiff, as the trustee of a piano club. Defendant failed to pay to plaintiff the rent provided by the lease, and plaintiff brought trespass, defendant waiving the preliminary demand for surrender of the piano. Held, that evidence of the assignment for benefit of creditors, and of the written assignment of the lease of the piano to plaintiff was properly received to show title, and that plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of the piano in an action of trespass.\nArgued Jan. 4, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 359, Jan. T., 1892, by defendant, William J. Davis, from judgment of C. P. No. 2, Phila. Co., Dee. T., 1888, No. 544, on verdict for plaintiff, Elwood Horn, Trustee of tlie Albrecht Piano Club.\nBefore Paxson, C. J., Sterrett, Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Dean, JJ.\nTrespass for conversion of piano.\nAt the trial, before Fell, J., it appeared that defendant on April 25, 1884, joined a piano club organized by Albrecht & Co., and executed a lease of a piano by which he agreed to pay $1.50 per week for two hundred weeks. Defendant paid rent for nearly a hundred weeks, not consecutively, ceasing to pay in March, 1887. On April 1, 1887, Albrecht & Co. made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to Peter Boyd. Under an order of court the assignee assigned defendant\u2019s lease to plaintiff, who had been appointed trustee of the piano club. Plaintiff brought this action, defendant waiving the preliminary demand for surrender.\nThe court admitted in evidence, under objection by defendant, the auditor\u2019s report in the assigned estate of Albrecht & Co., C. P. No. 1, March T., 1887, No. 533, for the purpose of showing title in the appellee, and his right to recover. [1]\nThe court also admitted in evidence, under objection by defendant, the assignment of Peter Boyd, dated Oct. 27, 1888, assigning the particular lease (between Albrecht & Co., and William J. Davis) to plaintiff. [2]\nThe court charged as follows :\n\u201c The defence in this case is upon purety technical or legal grounds. I see no reason whjr the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, if you believe the testimony which has been offered. I see no reason why you should not believe it, as it is reasonable, it is probable and it is entirely uncontradieted. However, that is a matter for you. If you believe the testimony presented by the plaintiff in this case, you will find a yerdiet for the value of the piano, which has been fixed by the witness at $200. If you believe that is the right sum, you will find a verdict for that amount.\u201d [8]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1, 2) rulings on evidence, (8) the charge of the court, quoting it.\nCharles Davis, for appellant, cited:\nOverton v. Williston, 31 Pa. 155; Green v. Breunesholtz, 73 Pa. 423; Robinson v. Hodgson, 73 Pa. 202; Borland v. Stokes, 120 Pa. 282.\nE. 0. Michener, for appellee.\nJanuary 16, 1893 :"
