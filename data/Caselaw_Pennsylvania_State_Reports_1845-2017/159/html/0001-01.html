Before the policy was issued the assured applied to a local insurance agent, who could not place the risk in any of the companies he was agent for. He therefore applied to an insurance broker in Philadelphia. The broker applied to defendant, an insurance company. Defendant issued a policy, sent it by mail to the broker of Philadelphia, who immediately sent it by mail to the local insurance agent, who by mail delivered it to plaintiff. On the day after the receipt of the policy plaintiff sent a check for the premium to the local insurance agent, who duly received it, and drew the money from the bank, but did not pay it over either to the broker in Philadelphia, or to defendant company. About seven weeks after the policy was issued the property of the insured was destroyed by fire. In an action on the policy it appeared that the <a id="p2" href="#p2" data-label="2" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*2</a>broker was in the habit of placing insurance for defendant, and was allowed a commission of twenty per cent of the premium.

The stipulation in the policy, which, it is urged, must defeat a recovery, is as follows : “ If the premium for this policy or for any renewal of the same, shall not be paid to the secretary or an agent of the company duly appointed as such in writing, within fifteen days from the date of its issue,” then the policy shall be void. It will be noticed, the premium money was paid to McKean, who was neither the secretary nor an <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>agent of the company, duly appointed by writing; he had no official connection whatever with the company. But the conjpany’s formally attested policy came into his hands for delivery to the insured. Why? Because it was sent to him by Downing for that purpose; he was, then, the mere representative of Downing, the vehicle chosen by him for the transmission of the policy, and the reception and remittance of the premium ; this appears from the testimony of both Downing and McKean. Downing’s agency was not by a formal written appointment; defendant denies that he was its agent at all. He testified he had been an insurance broker, with an office in Philadelphia for fifteen years; that he had placed a number of risks with defendant company before he applied for this policy; always collected the premiums, and remitted them, less his commissions, to the company; that on his application the company sent him this policy, and he sent it to McKean to deliver to the insured, and collect and remit the premium to him. For negotiating and placing these risks, the company allowed him, Downing, a commission of twenty per cent of the premium, he remitting to the company eighty per cent. He did not deny his liability to the company for the premium. If the company delivered this policy to Downing, on the understanding that he was to de-' liver it to the insured, collect the premium, retain his percentage, and remit the balance to the company, certainly, whatever may have been his attitude before that time while negotiations were pending, he was the agent in fact of the company for the delivery of the policy and the collection of the premium; as fully the agent of the company as if the secretary had handed him the policy in the company’s office, with instructions to deliver it to the insured next door, and collect the premium.</p>
    <p id="b36-4" data-blocks='[["BL_36.5",36,[277,1924,1157,195]]]'>Downing does not deny that McKean merely represented him in the delivery of the policy and the collection of the money; the payment to McKean was, in its legal effect, a payment to Downing.</p>

But if the company itself, either expressly or by acts which warrant the implication, has in fact appointed an agent to deliver a policy and collect the premium, the receipt of the money by such agent is the receipt by the company. To hold otherwise, would be a fraud upon the policy holder. He runs the risk of the honesty of his own agents, who apply to the company for insurance upon his property, and the risk of the authority to collect in the man to whom he pays, but he does not guarantee the company that its own agents, sent by it to deliver his policy and receive his-money, will pay it over to them. The intention in inserting this provision, doubtless, was to protect the company against default on the part of those who were mere solicitors of insurance for the insured, but it was not intended to make the insured answerable for the default of the company’s own agents ; nor will any perversion of the manifest purpose of the stipulation be permitted to work such a result.</p>

Our brother Green puts the decision expressly on the ground that the insured had paid the <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>premium to a broker he knew was not the agent of the company, and therefore took the risk. If, in that case, Haeseler, the agent of the company, had sent an errand boy with the policy to the assured to deliver it and bring back the premium, the policy would have been enforced even though the errand boy had lost the money or embezzled it. So in the other cases cited, there was no actual payment of the premium to an agent authorized by the company to receive it. Here the jury has found, on competent evidence, there was such payment to such agent.</p>

The law in those cases may be invoked by dishonest insurance companies to escape payment of what ought to be held a clear legal obligation; and attempts will be made under them to pervert the clause referred to into a mere trap for unwary but honest insurers. Take the case in hand: The owner of property on the 27th of January receives a policy dated the 13th of same month, regularly attested, issued by the company, insuring property to the value of $1,300 against fire, for one year from its date; he pays the premium to the person handing him the policy, assuming, as a business man naturally would, that the company having intrusted the executed policy for delivery to the man who offers it to him, the same man has authority to receive the money; then, resting on the security inspired by the possession of the company’s executed contract, and his payment of the consideration demanded, he makes no further inquiry; seven weeks after the date of the policy, when nearly one seventh of the term covered by the insurance has expired, his property is destroyed, and he is met by a refusal to pay on the ground that the premium paid had not reached the company’s treasury. All this time, he has had possession of the policy with no notice from the company that the premium <a id="p9" href="#p9" data-label="9" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*9</a>had not been handed over; yet during the same time the risk must have been carried on the books of the company as a valid outstanding risk; that is, if the company kept any books showing the condition of its business and the extent of its liabilities. We assume, the policy was not canceled for nonpayment of the premium, for no notice of default was given the assured, and the secretary of the company, who was familiar with the books, and who testified at length, does not say that it was canceled.</p>
    <p id="b39-5" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[140,857,1170,1370]]]'>Under such a state of facts, and applying to them the law invoked in the cases cited, unless the policy holder, as in this case, can further adduce evidence that he to whom he paid his money was in fact authorized to receive it, he is insured if there be no fire, but not insured if one occur. For if, without notice to him of the non-receipt of the premium oh an executed and delivered policy, the company can declare it void, when a fire occurs seven weeks after it has been paid for, it can do the same seven months after; in effect, the policy holders, under such a clause, become insurers of the honesty and promptitude of those to whom the insurance company, without a written appointment, intrusts its policies for delivery. It ought to be held that, under such a clause, the insurers themselves waive it, whenever, by their voluntary act, the policy leaves the office to be delivered to the insured on payment of the premium; and this, without regard to the fact that some one, having no nominal connection with the company as agent, hands over the policy and receives the premium. By the very fact of issuing a policy which requires, apparently, nothing but delivery and payment of premium to put it in force, the company arms every man into whose hands it may come with the power to receive its money; there could be no conduct more significant of an intention to waive the advantage of such a clause than this. But, without regard to the soundness of this individual opinion of what the law ought to be, the case before us, on its facts, being clearly outside the principles laid down in the cases cited, the judgment is affirmed, and appeal dismissed.</p>
