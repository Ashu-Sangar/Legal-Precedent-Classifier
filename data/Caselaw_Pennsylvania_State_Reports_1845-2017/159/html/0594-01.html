Hartman, Esq., it appeared that the order of Fraternal Guardians was chartered Dec. 2,1888, under the act of 1874, for “ the maintenance of a society for beneficial or protective purposes to its members from funds collected therein.” It organized by the enactment of a constitution and by-laws, which provided for the erection of a supreme lodge and of subordinate lodges. It issued certificates of membership, stipulating that any member who should comply with all the requirements of the order should, at the end of three and one half years from the date of his certificate, receive a sum not exceeding one eighth of the amount mentioned in such certificate, and that thereafter he should receive the same amount at the end of each three and one half years he continued in good standing in the order, until the certificate should mature. On Sept. 80,1892, the order was the owner of a benefit fund aggregating about #800,000. At that time certificates had matured to the amount of nearly #600,000. On that date it made a deed of assignment of all its effects to Joseph L. Tull, Esq. On Nov. 19, 1892, the assignee filed his first account of the trust estate, charging himself with upwards of #250,000 of cash, realized out of the benefit fund. At the audit of his account, the holders of matured certificates demanded to be paid in preference to members holding unmatured certificates.</p>

His certificate was a contract for twenty-eight years, and there was an obligation upon every member to continue his certificate in force for this period of time. This obligation was wisely imposed by the originators of the order, inasmuch as it created a mutuality between the members whose certificates matured first and those succeeding them. And in this respect this order differs materially from <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>other orders of a somewhat similar character, and popularly known as ‘get-rich-quick-orders.’ In the latter, when the period of membership had been spent and a certificate matured, the member, as such, terminated his relationship to the organization, except that of creditor, in the event of his claim not being paid. Upon the maturity of his certificate his payments . were finished, and those that were behind him had to pay their money to cancel his certificate, without any obligation on his part to contribute towards maturing any subsequent member’s certificate. In the Order of Fraternal Guardians an entirely different method was adopted. The certificate was made to cover a long period of years, and it was to be paid in eighths. The member receiving his first eighth could not immediately sever his connection with the order, because the members following him had the right to be matured likewise, and from a fund which it was his duty for a period of twenty-eight years to maintain by assessments to be paid by him on his certificate, and by virtue of his membership.</p>

What is meant by a sum not exceeding one eighth? Is not this merely a maximum limit of the amount to be paid to the certificate holder? [Can it be argued that a contract to pay any amount not exceeding a certain sum is a <a id="p599" href="#p599" data-label="599" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*599</a>contract to pay that sum ? The mere interrogation suggests its absurdity. It was intimated at the argument that a sum not exceeding $625 might mean five cents. True enough, it might. But in an uncertain matter like this the law in its wisdom would say this meant a sum which could be reasonably paid with a due regard to all the circumstances of the case.] [2] Now, what would have been a reasonable sum to have paid the matured certificates in this instance ? It appears by the appraisement that the entire assets of the order amounted to $810,000. On the day the assignment was made there were nearly $600,000 due to matured certificate holders. In two months more enough certificates would have matured to wipe out the entire benefit fund that it had taken nearly four years to accumulate. The payment of the maximum sum mentioned in the certificates would have plunged the, order into bankruptcy. [Is it at all in doubt whether, under such circumstances, a court of law or equity would compel the payment of the maximum sum on the certificates ? It may be said that the supreme executive committee had power to call an unlimited number of <em>assessments; </em>but the exercise of it would have been disastrous to the order.] [3] [Under these circumstances, the auditor cannot see how it would be possible to award the matured certificate holders the maximum limit of their certificates.] [4]</p>

This order embarked in a business, and every member contributed equally, according to his interest, towards consummating its purposes. The funds have been well preserved, and the amount now in the hands of the assignee, if there has been no shrinkage in the order’s assets, is sufficient to refund every member in good standing every dollar that he paid into the benefit fund. The organization has been honestly conducted, but, through lack of confidence of the community in enterprises of this character, it has been forced to close up its business and distribute its assets. The officers of the order are to be complimented upon their action in deferring payment of matured certificates. The first certificates to mature were those held by the officers of the concern and those instrumental in starting the organization. It would have been to their pecuniary advantage to have paid the certificates as they became due, but they refrained from doing so, as such action might have been followed by the appointment of a receiver, as a doubt existed whether or not such a course would not have been in excess of their charter rights. As the matter now stands, however, the organization has not been guilty of committing any ultra vires <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>acts, and there is the greatest moral certainty that it never will be in a position to exceed its charter rights.</p>

Twelve exceptions filed to said report were dismissed by the court, and distribution decreed in accordance with the schedule submitted by the auditor. Dismissal of said exceptions, all of which are recited in the first twelve specifications, and refusal to'award the fund in the hands of the assignee to the holders of matured <a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>certificates in preference to the holders of certificates which had not matured at the date of the assignment, constitute the subjects of complaint in the several specifications of error. We have considered the questions involved, and are of opinion that the findings of fact and conclusions of the learned auditor are substantially correct, and, for reasons fully set forth in his report, the decree should be affirmed. In view of the insolvency of the order, the distribution made by the court below is just and equitable.</p>
