Defendant’s road was built wholly on its own property, and neither overhangs nor takes that of any other owner. It was built at right angles with the street and reached from one lot owned by the company to the other.

Conrade, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20Pa.%20328" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="154 Pa. 328">154 Pa. 328</a>. Hence it follows that, in considering the testimony in such cases, plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of every fact and inference of fact that might have been fairly found by the jury or drawn bjr them from the evidence before them. Testing the case at bar by that rule, we have no doubt the judgment of non pros should have been taken off. Without undertaking to summarize the testimony on which plaintiffs relied, or to refer specially to any portion of it, we think it is quite sufficient to have warranted the jury in finding in their favor. It tended to prove, among other things, that defendant company, chartered under the act of 1874, constructed <a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>its double track incline against the westerly side of plaintiffs’ dwelling house (located on the northerly side of Frederick street) and thence, on an ascending grade, across the street at right angles thereto. On the north side of the street, the structure is elevated eight feet above the sidewalk, and on the south side several feet higher. Beginning at plaintiffs’ house and extending thence forty feet westerly along the northerly line of the street, defendant built a heavy stone wall or abutment, on which were placed four iron'beams, thirty-six inches wide vertically, by which the superstructure was supported. That part of said abutment adjoining plaintiffs’ dwelling was so constructed that water, conducted there by the iron beams and otherwise, was discharged against the brick wall of the house and so saturated the same that the plaster and paper on the inside thereof was injured and partially destroyed, and the rooms became mouldy and untenantable. While the witnesses did not state, in dollars and cents, any amount of damages resulting to plaintiffs therefrom, they so described the nature, character and extent of the injury to the plastering, etc., that the jury could have ascertained with reasonable accuracy the amount thereof. As described by the witnesses, the actual damages were by no means inconsiderable. In Allison v. Chandler, <a href="/mich/11/0542-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="11 Mich. 542" data-case-ids="1918157" data-case-paths="/mich/11/0542-01">11 Mich. 542</a>, it was said: “ Juries are allowed to act upon probable and inferential, as well as direct and positive proof.

But, if it were otherwise, the plaintiffs were entitled under the evidence to at least nominal damages, unless their witnesses were disbelieved: Pastorius v.
