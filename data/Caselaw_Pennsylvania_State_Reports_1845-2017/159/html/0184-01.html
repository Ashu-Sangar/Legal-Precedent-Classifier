But the conclusive answer in the present case is that the parties have clearly stipulated for the mode in which the trial shall be made, and it is to be by a well on this land.

But it is enough for us that the parties have contracted for the thing to be done and the damages for not doing it.

It does not set up any accident or mutual mistake, but that the parties used language which the defendants thought to mean what the law says it does not mean.
