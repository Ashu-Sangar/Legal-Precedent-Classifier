The son of defendant’s testator, an employee of the firm, became a defaulter, and the firm obtained a judgment against him for the sum which he had appropriated. Prior to the defalcation, and at a time when the son was solvent, he conveyed certain real estate which he owned to his wife, subject to a building association mortgage. After the defalcation, but before judgment was obtained by the firm, the son and his wife executed a mortgage to defendant’s testator on the same property. Subsequently, and after the judgment was entered against the son, the building association proceeded on its mortgage and the real estate covered by it was sold at sheriff’s sale, and bought in by defendant’s testator to protect his mortgage.
