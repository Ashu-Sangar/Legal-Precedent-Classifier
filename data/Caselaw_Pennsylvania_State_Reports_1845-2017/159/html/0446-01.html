Defendants averred in their petition for the rule that the bond was .the consideration for stifling and settling prosecutions for larceny, larceny as bailee, etc. Plaintiff in his answer averred that the prosecutions were made in heat, and upon information received, and upon further investigation, found unsustainable, and that he was advised and believed that the prosecuting of said charges in the criminal court would be considered as an attempt simply to prosecute a civil debt, and make the criminal court a vehicle by which to secure a statement of accounts between himself and partner and employee.

There was nothing illegal in this. Under all the evidence we think there was a good legal consideration for the bond, and the rule to open judgment is discharged.”</p>
