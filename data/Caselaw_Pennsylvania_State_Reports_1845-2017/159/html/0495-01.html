The defendant contends that this pavement was not well laid, and that the plaintiff did not substantially comply with the contract. You have heard all that has been said on that subject. You have heard, on the other side, what the officers of the department thought of it. It' seems they approved of it, and one of the officers swears that he gave notice to the defendant about the curbing; that it was left at the defendant’s office. If it was left at his office, that is a good service of notice, although he did not get it. With regard to the character of the pavement, you are to attend, not only to the defendant’s evidence upon that subject, but also to what is said by the plaintiff’s witnesses, who are the officers of the city, who inspected this work. They not only approved of this work, and certified the plaintiff’s bill, but they come here to-day and say that the work was well done.”</p>

In the event of want of notice, the law is that the defendant is entitled to be allowed the difference between what the city charges him and what he might have got it done for himself. He is not to get the city’s curbing, which they paid for, for nothing.” [2]</p>
