In 1889, his health» failed and for two years he was compelled to leave Philadelphia and reside at Atlantic City, N. J. Early in the spring of 1891, having recovered sufficiently to resume work, his attention was called to an advertisement in the ‘Public Ledger’ of this city, in the month of April, 1891, offering for sale a drug store, with or without practice, at Camden, N. J., signed, Dr. Goodwin, Kenton, Delaware. The deponent communicated with the plaintiff, the advertiser, and negotiations took place between them. The plaintiff represented that his practice, though only two years old, averaged a return of $1,200 a year, and was constantly increasing. That the stock of the drug store was worth $2,000. That it was fully stocked and compared in this respect with the best in Camden — and that its daily receipts ran from six to fourteen dollars, and on one occasion during the negotiations he exhibited to deponent what he represented to be a copy of his ledger, showing cash receipts of the drug store for the then preceding twelve months, which ranged, as it appeared, from $225 to $100 per month.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b583-6" data-blocks='[["BL_583.6",583,[122,1555,1163,502]]]'>“ During these negotiations which lasted over a month, the deponent repeatedly asked for opportunity to inspect the stock of the said store; but by ingenious pretexts these requests were evaded by the plaintiff, either by pretending want of time on the part of the plaintiff, or the excuse that he was rarely in Camden, or that he was detained by business in Delaware, or he would fail to be present on appointment and his representative would profess not to have the keys of the store. These devices were plausible and the deponent did not suspect that the plaintiff was contemplating a fraud.</p>

The deponent then closed the purchase, and gave notes in suit (for $1,500), and a bill of sale of the stock and certain fixtures of said store was taken; but no assignment of the said alleged medical practice was made or any stipulations concerning the same. ‘</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b584-5" data-blocks='[["BL_584.5",584,[271,698,1161,655]]]'>“ On taking possession of the store, an inspection and account of the stock exposed the premeditated fraud practiced upon the defendant by the plaintiff. The stock was almost destitute of the drugs and medicines absolutely required in a drug store. What tinctures and syrups and other preparations there were, which are usually made in the store, were worthless, not being made in accordance with the U. S. Pharmacopoeia and of only half the strength prescribed. The herbs, roots, barks, and leaves which ought to be renewed every season, were so stale as to be utterly useless and fit only to be thrown away, the most of them having been there from six to ten years, as deponent is informed and believes; most of the drawers and other receptacles were empty and the rest partly filled with spoiled and rotten material.</p>

The cases and windows were filled mostly with bottles containing colored water — nearly all the perfume bottles contained merely water. New even of the cheapest articles in general use needed to carry on a drug store were there. Even the nominal value of the whole was less than $100, and the most of that was in patent medicines which were obsolete and unsalable.</p>

On examining the file of prescriptions for the preceding five months up to date of deponent’s purchase it was found that the plaintiff sjrstematically and almost daily, in numbering the prescriptions, skipped many numbers, in order to deceive any proposed purchaser, so that it would appear at a glance that he had filled twice or more prescriptions than he really had done.</p>

Further, that the plaintiff had himself purchased the said drug store two years before the sale to deponent, and had systematically depleted the stock and turned it into cash. Further, that just before possession of the store was given to deponent the plaintiff carried off from the store to Delaware all the drugs which were costly and used in putting up prescriptions. Further, that the receipts from the drug store during the plaintiff’s ownership had been always very small and hardly covered the expenses, . nd that the plaintiff’s practice amounted to almost nothing.</p>
