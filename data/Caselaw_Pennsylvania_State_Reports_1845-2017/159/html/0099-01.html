Objected to unless the witness has actual knowledge of the loss; counsel for defence object to any speculative theory. By the Court: We think the witness ought to show a little more knowledge. Without any facts, we do not think his guess ought to be considered by the jury. You must get some facts to show that the witness has a knowledge of what he is talking about. Q. I wish you would state to the jury how this line affects the value of that property, and why it does it? A. Well, it affects it just in this way, I think there is a large portion of the farm that could not be sold at all in five or ten acre lots at this time with that pipe line where it is.” The witness stated, under objection and exception, that the total damage would be about three thousand dollars.

If the “amount” of the damages shall be determined “ by a jury,” the necessary inference is that the power of the jury in that respect cannot be limited by the act of the court in approving the bond tendered by defendant. The bond is not intended as a measure of damages, but merely as security. There is no provision for appeal from the order of court approving the bond; but, in recognition of the constitutional right of trial by jur}1', for the purpose of determining the amount of damages, express provision is made for appeal from any preliminary assessment of damages “ by viewers or other<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>wise.” In practice, tbe court is generally careful to require a bond sufficient^ large in amount to cover all damages to which the landowner may be entitled; but, whether that be done or not, the power of the jury, in the premises, is wholly unaffected by the amount that may be named in the bond.</p>
