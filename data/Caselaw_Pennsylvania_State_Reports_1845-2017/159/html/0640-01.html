The company’s agent explained these erasures as follows: “ A. It was the understanding that it would release the express company as well as the railroad company from all liabilities. I showed him this paper — it was laid right before him when he signed it. I didn’t say anything to him. I told him this was the release to be signed. He signed it. I told him then that I was busy, and he was in a hurry to get out. He then even gave me his check, and said: ‘Fill this out afterwards.’ He signed it, and said: ‘ Fill this out afterwards, I am in a hurry to get out.’ And the same way with the release. He said: ‘ I will sign it, and you can ñx it up afterwards.’ And that is how the erasures came <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>about. If Mr. Armstrong had remained there at the time long enough for me to fix up that release, the erasures would have been made right there in his presence, but inasmuch as he was in a hurry to get out, he simply signed the release and did not even give me a chance to fill anything in, much less make any erasures, saying I should fix up the release afterwards; that all that was required of him was his signature, and I should fix up the release afterwards, which I did.” Offer overruled and bill sealed.

    <p class="summary" id="b671-4" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[130,902,1163,608]]]'>“ [It is claimed by the plaintiffs that the horse for some reason or other pressed against the side of the partition, which partition gave way because of the insecure manner in which it was arranged. It is claimed that the side of the partition being too small to fit in, a piece had been nailed against its end which fitted in the groove so as to conceal it from casual observation, and that when the horse pressed against the side of the stall this piece gave way, causing the horse to fall on the lower piece and by his weight breaking his legs.] [7] This is denied by the defendant, which contends that this car was not so constructed, or that, in other words, the side of the stall was not pieced out, and that will be the first question for you to decide. . . .</p>

If that is a fact then what should the defendant have done ? The law, as I have read it to you, required the defendant to provide against every ordinary case of this kind; it was bound to take into consider<a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>ation the fact that horses will be restless on the ears, that passing trains will frighten them and that they will move from side to side; and, therefore, knowing that as it was their duty to know it, it was their duty to provide a car which would ordinarily protect horses under those circumstances. Did they do it ? If they did not then the law would hold them liable for any negligence resulting therefrom. . . .</p>

Schlimme testifies to you that a passing train caused this horse to swing to one side, and from part of his testimony.you might infer that the horse plunged and reared.] [6] But was it in an unusual manner? Was it in any but the ordinary manner in which horses do move back when they hear an approaching train ? If it was, then the express company were bound to provide against it.</p>

    <p id="b673-5" data-blocks='[["BL_673.11",673,[130,1117,1164,812]]]'>This was an action to recover damages for the loss of a horse which the defendant company undertook to carry from North Wales in Pennsylvania to New York city. The horse was injured, and had to be killed in consequence of alleged negligence on the part of the defendant in the construction of the stalls in the car upon which the horse was to be carried. The learned court below correctly and fairly instructed the jury as to the conditions upon which the liability of the defendant would depend, and left to them the question whether the stall in which the horse was placed was negligently or carefully built with reference to the due care of the horse. As there was considerable testimony on this subject, it was not possible to take the question of negligence away from the jury. They have found by their verdict that the stall was negligently constructed and that the injury happened in consequence thereof, and that finding disposes of that question.</p>
    <p id="b673-6" data-blocks='[["BL_673.12",673,[132,1937,1162,453]]]'>The release was properly excluded. The erasures were not made when the plaintiff signed it. They were made afterwards by the defendant’s agent and there is no evidence that the paper was shown or read to the plaintiff after the erasures were made. But even if the release was free from objection in this respect it could not accomplish the purpose for which it was offered. It could not release the defendant from liability for negligence, as we have frequently decided. For any other purpose it was immaterial. We think the case was properly tried.</p>
