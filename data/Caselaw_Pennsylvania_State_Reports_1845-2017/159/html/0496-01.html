Mann, Esq., it appeared that at the time of the assignment, which was on July 16, 1891, foreclosure proceedings had been begun on a first mortgage. The company, at the time of the assignment, was in debt, including the mortgage given by it to B. F. Baer, over $27,000. The assignee advertised a sale of the assigned estate, to be held Nov. 6, 1891, on the premises. The property was at this time advertised to be sold by the sheriff in December, 1891, under the foreclosure proceedings. At the assignee’s sale the property was first put up as a whole, and the highest bona fide bid was $23,500. The assignee did not accept this bid, and proceeded to sell the machinery and fixtures in parcels. During the sale a notice was read by the plaintiff in the foreclosure suit, claiming that the fixtures of the brick yard, including engines, shafting, grinding machine, belting, sheds, lumber, etc., were covered by his mortgage, being part of the realty. The sale of the personal property rvas proceeded with and realized over $3,000, a large part of which was paid to the assignee in cash. A writ of estrepement was served on the assignee immediately at the conclusion of the sale, forbidding him to sell the fixtures of the brick yard, and he returned to the purchasers the money that had been paid for the articles purchased^ under advice of counsel, but did not again offer the plant.</p>

The means for such an investigation were not presented to him, nor was any evidence offered tending to show the same, other than the amount of claims against the assigned estate, some of which, it must be borne in mind, were contingent and resulted from the failure of the company to carry on its operations ; nor can the auditor see how the distribution of the assets of the assigned estate could be made the forum in which questions of such character could be determined.</p>

They were sustained and distribution of the fund was decreed in accordance with the schedule thus revised. The specifications charge that the court below erred in dismissing eighteen of said exceptions recited therein respectively. Some of these relate to findings of fact and others to conclusions of law- We have examined the record with special reference to the questions thus presented, and find no error, either in the findings of fact or in the conclusions drawn therefrom, that requires a reversal or modification of the decree. The auditor’s findings are in accordance with the evidence, and his legal conclusions, as qualified by the action of the court in sustaining the sixteenth and twenty-fourth exceptions, appear to be correct. They are all so fully set forth in his elaborate report that it is unnecessary to refer to them in detail. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
