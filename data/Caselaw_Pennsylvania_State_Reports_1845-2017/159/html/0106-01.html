You have not a great deal of testimony upon the subject here; you have not perhaps as much as you might have. We have not very full information from either side as to just what variety of goods was stored in this warehouse. Of course, the character of a great many of them has cropped out, but there has not been a systematic effort, so far as I recollect, on either side, to show you definitely what was in this warehouse. That might, of course, be of considerable importance, because the character of the goods would aid you in determining what was reasonable and ordinary care with regard to their protection. If they had especially inflammable goods there, then ordinary care would be higher and greater care than if they had goods there which could not be easily ignited. You have, however, as I have said, some information with regard to the nature of this warehouse. It appears that they had a cold storage attachment, which necessitated the constant use, I believe, day and night, of an engine, for the purpose of refrigerating rooms for that purpose. That appears to have been under the same roof, in the same building, as these other goods. You have the information that the warehouse was six stories high. These goods were stored in the sixth story, I believe, and you have some information as to some of the things that were on the other floors. That other information is largely incidental. The defendants say that they took the advice of the Board of Underwriters, parties skilled in the matter of dangers from fire, and that they took the precautions that they suggested; that they put barrels of water, I believe, on the different floors, and water buckets and fire extinguishers ; that they swept up the building three times a week, possibly-every day, but I think three times a week, and they had a man examine it the last thing before he left every night, and that it was examined upon this particular night in that same way. They admit that they had no watchman there during the night; that the building was empty except that the engineer was pres<a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>ent during night; but they state the engineer’s sole duty was to attend to the engine, that he was under no obligation to go any place else; in fact it appears to have been his duty not to go to any place else, if I recollect the testimony correctly, but to stay with his engine; of course that would not apply to a case of emergency, if he could do anything.</p>

You will, however, take in connection with that the allegation of the defendants that there was less likelihood for the occurrence of any fire at night than in daylight, because there were not the same fires there. There were some fires on the other floors, or at least lights, at times during the day, but they say there was nothing of that sort at night, — nothing more than the heat from the engine and perhaps the torch used by the engineer about the engine.</p>

A fire originated in the second story and destroyed the entire structure, with its contents. Among the latter were the goods of the appellees which were stored there. The present suit was brought to recover their value. The appellees alleged that their loss was the result of appellant’s negligence in not keeping their goods safely, and in not- insuring them, having agreed to do so. As to the latter, one of the appellees, Miss Tower, testified that when she paid the storage on these goods the assistant in charge of appellant’s office inquired whether she wanted'the goods insured, that she requested that appellant should have it done, and that it agreed to do so. That after the fire she called, and being told these goods were not insured she said, “ I left orders for you to have the goods insured.” The assistant however denies that she gave any order to have them insured. The evidence was therefore for the jury to determine whether the appellant.made an agreement with appellees to obtain for them an insurance upon the goods in question. It is contended by appellant that, as the proofs do not show the essential elements of a parol contract for insurance, no agreement was proved. The <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>appellant was engaged in the storage business, made it a part of such business to effect insurances in companies when requested by its customers to do so, and protected itself for its advances and charges by holding the goods. A contract made for that object therefore would be in the direct line of its business and not one of insurance requiring certain essential elements to constitute it. It would not be a voluntary and gratuitous act, but in fact would be an undertaking in connection with the bailment. Miss Tower testified that the appellant’s representative asked her if she wanted the goods insured, and she replied that she thought they being there insured them. He replied: “ Not unless you leave orders to that effect.” She says that she then gave the order. If this testimony be not successfully contradicted, it shows the course of the business was to obtain insurances for bailors, that appellant so indicated to appellees, who acted upon it, that it accordingly entered into the contract and made it part of its duties to obtain the insurance for which it was to be paid, and for the expenses of which as well as other charges it was to hold the goods. The learned judge therefore properly submitted the evidence in regard to the alleged contract to the jury, and the assignment of error that he refused to charge: “ That the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove that, at the time the alleged agreement was made to insure plaintiff’s goods, the amount of the insurance, the time for which it was insured, the rate of insurance, the premium to be paid, and the risk insured against, all were agreed upon; a want of any of these elements is essential and makes the contract an incomplete one and the plaintiffs cannot recover,” is not sustained.</p>

The appellant was a bailee for hire and was bound to exercise ordinary diligence and care. Its liability could only be the result of a failure to exercise such care or diligence. The proofs do not show a want of this care or diligence, nor do they warrant an inference of either. The cause of the fire is not shown and apparently is not known. One witness saw the fire coming out of the second story of the building, and knocked at the front door. The engineer in charge, holding a small torch such as engineers usually have, came towards the door, of which he had no key, and then went back <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>towards the engine room. He subsequently explained to witness that he did so in order to turn off the ammonia tanks, manifestly to avoid an explosion. This witness testified there seemed to be something like grease or butter that was burning and dripping down through the elevator shaft. Another witness testified that the engineer had a light in his hand, stood in the front of the door, hallooed out something and started back. This was the extent of the plaintiff’s proof.</p>
    <p id="b142-4" data-blocks='[["BL_142.5",142,[301,816,1164,806]]]'>On the part of the defendant it was testified there was no inflammable material or fire in the building. One of appellant’s witnesses, an employee, testified that on the evening of the fire, prior to it, he went to the top of the building and had in his hand a little circular oil lamp with a wick out through the top. That when he reached the top of the building he blew it out and descended in the dark to the first floor, where, having placed a cover over the wick of the lamp, left it in his room back of the engine room. Having done so he left the building in the charge of the engineer. The testimony clearly does not justify an inference of negligence, and does not amount to a scintilla. The learned judge therefore erred in refusing to charge : “ There is no evidence in this case showing that the defendant did not exercise ordinary care of plaintiff’s goods. As a bailee for hire, it is not responsible for this accidental loss by a fire which was not caused by its negligence.”</p>
