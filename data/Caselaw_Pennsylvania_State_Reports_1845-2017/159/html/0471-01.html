    <p class="summary" id="Ah_" data-blocks='[["BL_501.15",501,[164,1551,1162,650]]]'>At the trial, before Biddle, J., it appeared that early in the morning of April 18, 1889, plaintiff’s employees were driving a team of horses and a wagon on Kensington avenue on their way to Philadelphia. Defendant company operated, on Kensington avenue, a double track street railway by means of ears and small locomotives, popularly known as “ dummy ” engines. Evidence on behalf of plaintiff tended to show plaintiff’s wagon was being driven along one of the tracks in a train of other wagons, and as it approached a dummy engine on the other track it was turned off towards the curb. The engineer then sounded an unusual and extraordinary whistle, and plaintiff’s horses became frightened and ran in front of the engine and were injured.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b501-11" data-blocks='[["BL_501.16",501,[164,2209,1161,95]]]'>Plaintiff’s evidence was to the effect that his horses were quiet and used to the ordinary running of the cars.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b501-13" data-blocks='[["BL_501.18",501,[209,2363,1115,36]],["BL_502.1",502,[237,371,1163,1764]]]'>“ Now the allegation here is that these noises, or this noise, <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>was not necessarily incident to the running of this road; that while it may be that it was their duty to give notice by sounding a whistle if danger was apparent to the engineer who was running the train, yet it is contended here that the whistle blown on this occasion was of such an unusual and extraordinary character as to frighten horses which otherwise were perfectly accustomed to the use of dummies, and the usual and necessary noises which they create. The plaintiff called a number of gentlemen who were in the habit of using this road. It seems to be a road to market from Frankford, a favorite route, or at least a route very much used by farmers coming to market. , These gentlemen say that they have been using the road, some of them for twenty or twenty-five years, and they say that they never heard such a whistle as this was before. One of them said that once before he had heard such a whistle, but the others said that they had never lieard such a whistle. One of them said that it was of such a character as to induce him to look out of his wagon to see what was going on. Therefore the question for you to determine is, was this an unnecessary thing for them to do for the purpose of warning persons whom they feared were coming on the track? Now the engineer, whose testimony 1 think was perfectly frank [said that he did not see anybody on the track; that the persons who were alleged to have been on the track on Orleans street did not influence him to blow this whistle at all; that it was not that anybody was on the track, but his allegation is that he thought one of the wagons in this train of wagons approaching him was about to get on the track.] [5] The question will be for you to say whether a single blow of the whistle would not have been enough to warn this man, if he was or did intend to get right in front of the engine, to keep back. The question of course, the main question here, if you believe this was an undue and unnecessary use of this whistle and that the plaintiff is entitled to damages, is to decide what you consider a fair compensation for the injury he has sustained. . . .</p>

To have instructed the jury, as requested in either of defendant’s points, recited in the first four specifications, would have been plain error. Instead of showing “ that there was no unnecessary or <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>wanton sounding of the whistle,” etc., the testimony tended to prove quite the contrary. The defendant company’s right to use Kensington avenue was not exclusive. It was in common with the public; and wherever such common user of a highway exists, it is the duty of railway companies to exercise such watchful care as will prevent, as far as possible, accidents or injuries to persons and property. In such circumstances, a greater degree of care, on the part of the railway company as well as the public, is required.
