The plaintiff lived at Paoli, and it was his custom to take the 5.55 A. M. train from that place to his business in Philadelphia. At Paoli station there are three tracks, the south track on which trains for Philadelphia run, the middle tracks used for various purposes, and the north track for trains going west.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b572-6" data-blocks='[["BL_572.7",572,[266,849,1158,601]]]'>“ The 5.55 A. M. train from Paoli east started from this point. The engine and cars remained over night in a yard west of the station and north of all the tracks. On coming out of the yard in the morning the train was carried by a switch across the north track to the middle track, and it passed east on this track some distance beyond the station, where it was switched on to the south track and backed up to the station. The station is south of the tracks, and a shed or shelter is on the north. A bridge extends over all the tracks a few feet west of the station, and is reached by steps on either side leading to it. Between the south and the middle track is a wooden fence extending about seventy yards east of the station.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b572-7" data-blocks='[["BL_572.8",572,[266,1460,1156,399]]]'>“ The plaintiff lived south of the railroad and had taken this train for the city almost every morning for a year, and was familiar with the station and its surroundings. On the morning of October 24th, three days before the accident, he arrived at the station one minute before the starting time, and found his train standing on the middle track. At the request of the conductor he passed around the east end of the fence, and got on the train where he found it standing.</p>

He saw a train standing on the middle track, and, supposing it was the train he was to take, stepped from the platform, crossed the south tracks, and walked eastward on the roadbed between the tracks and the fence to reach the end of the latter in order to pass around it.</p>

Before reaching the <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>end of the fence he met this train, and was struck by it and severely injured. The morning was dull and rainy, and he walked with his head down and he carried an umbrella, which obstructed his view of any object in front. He was intent on reaching what he thought to be his train, and was looking at it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b573-3" data-blocks='[["BL_573.4",573,[153,650,1158,297]]]'>“ He did not look down the track, as he supposed no train was in that direction. On reaching the station and seeing cars standing on the middle track, he at once concluded that the same conditions were before him that existed on the 24th, and instantly, and without reflection or exercising any precaution, acted upon that conclusion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b573-4" data-blocks='[["BL_573.5",573,[153,956,1158,143]]]'>“ On this occasion he did not step upon the roadbed at the suggestion of any one, but at his own instance, and during the year he had but. once taken the train on the middle track.</p>

With a single exception, every morning for a year, he had found the train on the south track ; that it was on the middle track on that morning, was evidently due to some exceptional cause, and could not give rise to a reasonable belief that a new place of starting had been established. If such a belief could arise, the fence was a standing notice not to attempt to reach the train by crossing the south track, and perfectly safe means of reaching it by a bridge over the tracks had been provided, and a reasonably safe one by the plank crossing at the eastern end of the fence.</p>
