In this case, if the will was allowed to stand, the entire estate is liable to the tax; but the only son of testator, and to whom no bequest was made, for the reasons stated in the will, that he was already amply provided for, filed a caveat to contest the validity of the will. After some testimony had been taken, an agreement of compromise was entered into between some of the legatees and the caveator, whereby they authorized the executor to pay to him a certain sum out of the bequests to them in settlement of the controversy, and, in consideration thereof, the caveator agreed to withdraw the caveat, discontinue all proceedings, and that the will should be admitted to probate, etc.</p>

We have reached the conclusion that, under the most favorable construction of the act, so far as respects the contention on behalf of the commonwealth, <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>they are not so liable, and for the reason that the amount paid the caveator was never received by them as legatees, and, under the act, it is only so much of the estate which actually passes to them by virtue of the will that is liable to the tax. It will readily be seen if the contest instituted by the caveator had been successful he would be entitled, under the intestate law, to the entire estate, and freed from the tax. But instead of further litigation he accepted a portion of the estate, relinquished his claim to the balance, and thus, of course, reduced the amount passing to the legatees, and, in fact, to the extent of the amount he received, the will is a nullity. So that all the legatees take is the amount of their bequests, after deducting the sum paid the caveator. And this they concede is subject to the tax.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[286,1103,1164,796]]]'>“ This, we think, is the proper construction to be placed upon the act of assembly. A contrary view would not only be inequitable, but work a hardship upon legatees and distributees, and surely it was never contemplated thus to impose a double burden. And, it may be sirggested, the compromise is infinitely more to the interest of the commonwealth than if the terms of settlement were reversed, viz., the will set aside, the entire estate received by the caveator, and then he had paid the legatees, as a gratuity, the amount they now receive. No tax whatever would then be paid. And, as shown in Kerr’s Est., 2 Dist. R., 535, [affirmed, the next case,] the payment to the caveator ‘ simply reduced the estate afterwards passing to volunteers, with the same effect as if the reduction had been caused by the payment of debts, or if the payment or surrender had been the result of a suit terminating in favor of the claimant.’</p>

    <p id="b541-4" data-blocks='[["BL_541.5",541,[124,695,1164,345]]]'>The act imposes the tax upon all estates “ passing ” to col-laterals, not merely upon estates “ actually ” so passing; non constat, but that a devolution of title upon collaterals is a sufficient “ passing ” within the meaning of the act. This view is strengthened by the fact that the commonwealth’s right to the ■tax accrues, and is a lien on decedent’s real estate, as of the date of his death: Frank’s Est., 28 W. N. 328.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[127,1053,1161,705]]]'>The legal effect of the compromise is the same as though the validity of the will had been established by a verdict in favor of proponents — the will is admitted to probate, the whole estate passes to collaterals, and of course becomes subject to the tax. As the record stands, the executor cannot with safety pay the whole of decedent’s estate otherwise than to collaterals ; the orphans’ court must so distribute it when his account is audited. The will once admitted to probate, the title of the collaterals to the whole estate, less debts and administration expenses, relates back to the testator’s death, and must be taken to have accrued as of that date, so that the caveator must, necessarily, take mediately through the Phelipots under the agreement of compromise, and not directly from decedent, as in case of intestacy: 19 A. &amp; E.
