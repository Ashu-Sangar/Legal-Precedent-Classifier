The. bill is simply a general bill to the West View Oil Company for numerous minor articles, together with a few larger items of casing, and tubing and sand lines, and the only attempt at classification is a designation of the persons to whom the deliveries were made. It would be impossible to tell from anything contained in the claim of lien what things, or whether any things, were furnished to any of the engines, or to any of the boilers, or to any of the machinery or fixtures. Presumably the casing was furnished to the wells, but whether to one or all, or to which, does not appear. It might be inferred that the tubing lines and sand <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>lines were worked from the derricks, but there is no statement to that effect, or for which of the wells they were furnished. There are numerous items of unions, cups, cocks, nipples, washers, valves, coupling and bolts, but nothing to show where any of them were used, or whether they were furnished to any particular engine, boiler, rig, fixture or improvement.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.5",422,[250,693,1159,1614]]]'>In the case of Ely v. Wren, <a href="/pa/90/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="90 Pa. 118" data-case-ids="1065628" data-case-paths="/pa/90/0118-01">90 Pa. 118</a>, a very similar kind of claim to this was filed by Wren, the claimant, “for a debt due to him for work done and material furnished by him, for and about the erection and construction, and upon the credit of improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, screens and fixtures put up or erected by E. B. Ely &amp; Co., tenants of a leased estate on land of another in the said county of Carbon.” A lien was claimed against the improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, etc., and against the leasehold estate of the tenants, all of which was fully described. A bill of particulars with a schedule of the machinery, etc., on the premises was annexed. This claim of lien was held by this court to be so defective in its want of particularity and precision that it was ordered to be stricken from the record. The present Chief Justice, delivering the opinion, said: “ The claim was thus filed not only against the interest of E. B. Ely &amp; Co. in the improvements, engines, etc., but against the improvements, engines, etc., themselves; and also against a number of undefined structures and articles adjacent thereto, upon which it is not claimed that any work was done, or for which any materials were furnished by the claimants. It was not confined, as the act provides, to the specific improvements upon which the work was done, or for which materials were furnished. . . . There is an absence of that certainty and precision which should characterize a statement that forms the basis of a special lien, which, if not otherwise satisfied, is designed to be enforced by a judicial sale, resulting in a transfer of title. The proceeding is in rem and the claim should be so certain and definite as to indicate with at least reasonable precision the property that is to be subjected to the lien, and the extent thereof. Without this it fails to furnish sufficient data for the entry of a judgment upon which the levari must issue for the sale of the property.”</p>

It is of course obvious that this item could not have been furnished for any rig, boiler, engine, machinery, fixture or improvement, and could only be used in a well. It would therefore not be a lien on any of the machinery, etc., and could not be a lien at all except possibly against a well. But which well? The claim does not say, or whether it was furnished to all the wells or any number of them less than all. If it was furnished for one or two of course the other wells which had none of it, and might be far distant, could not be subjected to any lien for itj and could not be sold to pay for it. The other largest items are for tube lines and sand lines. These aggregate $267.37, and together with the casing amount to $611.88, and the entire claim is but $782.65. It is manifest that these lines could not have been furnished to any one of the three boilers, or any one of the four engines, or to any of the machinery, screens, fixtures or improvements. They are only for use in the wells, and are entirely loose and unfastened to the leasehold premises, or any of the machinery. And yet if this lien were sustained the whole of the leasehold, and all of the boilers, engines and machinery could be sold for the nonpayment of this item. Nor is it stated for what one or more wells these lines were furnished or used, and this simply increases the confusion.</p>

Mr. Chief Justice Woodward, in delivering tire opinion, said: “ In Thomas v. Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%2073" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="6 Wright 73">6 Wright, 73</a>, we said the word ‘improvements,’ in this act, was to have a reasonable construction, and was not to be applied to temporary and insignificant additions, but to such permanent and substantial erections as do essentially augment the interest which the tenant has in the land. The same observation may be applied to fixtures and spikes for a railroad down a slope in the interior of a mine. They do not belong, in our judgment, either to such improvements or fixtures. The railroad itself is as temporary as the use of that slope. ... In its nature it is a mere transient convenience, and an attempt to execute a lien against it vrould be attended with all the embarrassments pointed out in Summerville v. Wann, and more. Doubtless it might be called an improvement or fixture if we felt that the statute was entitled to a liberal construction, but, conceiving that it is not, we are disposed to stop where its words stop, and not to push them an inch beyond their indubitable meaning.”</p>

When it is considered how large a proportion of the wells are only “ dry holes,” and are therefore abandoned at once and all the machinery and appliances removed, and how large is the number of wells that yield so small a product as to be unprofitable to work, and they also are abandoned, and how many wells that have been for a time profitable to work have soon run down to an unprofitable production, and how many become exhausted in a short time, it is readily understood that no character of permanency can be attributed to such articles as casings and tubing and sand lines. These are all as capable of use in one well as another, and may be and are constantly transferred from wells where they are of no use to others where they may be of service.</p>
