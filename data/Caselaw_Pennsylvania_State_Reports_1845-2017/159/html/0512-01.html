Palmer died Sept. 25, 1886, leaving a will, which was duly admitted to probate, by which she left all her property to Mary Jane Kerr, a friend. The heirs at law and next of kin of Mrs. Palmer thereupon began proceedings to contest her will. Mrs. Kerr died in the meantime, and the contest was afterwards compromised, by her heirs at law and next of kin entering into an agreement by which they withdrew all claim to Mrs. Palmer’s personalty and to one half of her realty. In assessing the collateral inheritance tax upon Mrs. Kerr’s estate the register of wills declined to make any deduction by reason of the property <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>surrendered under this agreement.

Such persons are neither legatees nor devisees, heirs or next of kin, nor are they grantees, etc., under assignments or transfers made or intended to take effect after the death of the bargainer. The allowance or compromise of their claims simply reduces the estate after-wards passing to volunteers, with the same effect as if the' reduction had been caused by the payment of debts, or as if the payment or surrender had been the result of a suit terminating in favor of the claimant.</p>

The validity of the will was impeached, and only so much of Elizabeth S. Palmer’s estate as remained after the recognition of the rights of those who claimed under the intestate laws became the estate of her beneficiary.
