In the case just cited the requisites of a valid location, as to third persons and rival corporations, are said to be a preliminary entry by engineers and surveyors who run and make out lines, map them and report them to the company, and the adoption of such a line by the board of directors; and all this is to be proved as any other facts, and when proved has the same effect upon all interested as though it had been recorded.

If the branches are all to be begun and finished with the main line, there would seem to be no reason why their location and termini should not be stated in the charter or act of incorporation, as well as those of the main line, and not left to be afterwards determined by the directors as they may deem it necessary, or to be connected with roads thereafter to be constructed.</p>

If the plaintiff’s location is to be deemed to have been abandoned, it must be either because the facts and circumstances warrant an inference of an actual intention to abandon, or because they justified the defendant in acting upon the supposition of an abandonment and so estop the plaintiff, or because the lapse of time was such that the law will presume an abandonment,-or because the law has declared certain acts to be an abandonment.

P. Corwin, secretary of the company plaintiff. No statute requires a railroad company after making a location to watch the pins or marks put in and keep them in position, just as no statute requires any map or location to be recorded. [The failure of the plaintiff to do so was therefore not an act which prejudiced the defendant by leading it to believe the plaintiff’s branch line to be abandoned.] [12] Indeed if it be true that the defendant company did not in fact know of the plaintiff’s location when its own was made it cannot have relied on any evidence of the abandonment of that which it did not know existed.</p>

In the absence of any definite ruling, and considering the relatively long time necessary for the construction of so extensive and costly a work as a railroad, it would be presumptuous for the master to say that a delay of five years and two months in building a branch railroad is evidence of its abandonment by mere lapse of time. The legislature having fixed no limit, perhaps no court would be justified in fixing one short of the time in which a surrender might be presumed by prescription.] [13]</p>

L. 231, as applying to this case and making the facts of this case conclusive proof of abandonment. The act provides, ‘ That whenever any turnpike, plank road, canal or slackwater navigation or public highway of any company or corporation .... has been or shall have been, for the period of five successive years or upwards, decayed, out of repair and unused for the purposes mentioned in the charter of said company, the same shall be deemed and held to be abandoned .... and such condition and nonuser may be given in evidence in any suit or proceeding wherein the facts of such abandonment may be material and shall be conclusive proof thereof.’ [This act does not seem to apply to railroads.] [14] It is true that railroads are public highways belonging to corporations, but at the time of the passage of this act they constituted by far the largest and most important class of such highways, and it is not to be supposed that the legislature intended to include them under this general name, after mentioning by name turnpikes and canals. This case is like that in Coke’s Reports, referred to in Blackstone’s Commentaries, where a statute regarding ‘ deans, prebendaries, parsons, vicars and others having spiritual prcjmotion,’ was held not to extend to bishops, on the ground that persons or things of a higher degree were not to be supposed to be included in general words following an enumeration of those of a lower degree. [Besides, the act evidently applies only to the case of the highways which have been once built and then suffered to fall into decay for five successive years, and <em>not to </em>those which have never been built.] [15]</p>

We are of opinion that the learned master’s findings of fact were warranted by the evidence, and that his conclusions of law are substantially correct. Those findings and conclusions, together with the authorities cited in support of the latter, are clearly and concisely stated in his report and need not be repeated here. They warrant the general conclusion that the location claimed by the plaintiff company was regularly and legally made and adopted, and its right thereto has never been relinquished or forfeited; and that, subject to the payment or securing of damages to landowners, it has the lawful right to construct and operate its branch railroad upon said location.</p>
