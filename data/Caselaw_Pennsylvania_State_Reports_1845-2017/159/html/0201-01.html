Defendant claimed that plaintiff was in default from March 1, 1892, to Aug. 7, 1892, one hundred and fifty-nine days. Plaintiff claimed that the delay was caused by the failure of defendant’s architect to furnish the lines and levels of the building on or before July 15,1891, as required by the contract.</p>

That is a question for you.] [1] The architect has testified that holes had been drilled and iron pins put in; that the foundation was in solid rock; that the excavation was done at the time this contract was let, and that the plans were furnished at that time. Before, however, you can enforce this clause, you must find that the levels were furnished as required in this precedent condition. If they were not furnished before the 15th of July, or on that day, then when were they furnished ? Is there anything in this case to indicate that there was any delay because the levels were not furnished, and that, the levels being furnished, the work went on ? Is there any evidence that there were ever any levels furnished other than those that were furnished on or before the 15th day of July, 1891 ? One of the witnesses has testified that the levels were indicated, in a measure, by the plans. I believe the architect so testified, — at any rate, he testified that the foundation had been dug and that the pins had been put in. You will consider all the case, gentlemen, — all the evidence in the case, and all the circumstances surrounding it, and then find, as a fact, primarily, whether or not these levels were furnished; because, in view of the wording of this clause, we feel that it is our duty to say to you that that is a condition precedent to the enforcing of this claim for damages. The lines and levels must have been furnished some time; the building has been completed, and neither party to this controversy has offered one scintilla of evidence going to show that it was not upon the proper lines or that it was not constructed at the proper levels. Were any lines and levels, other than those marked and indicated upon the ground at the time this contract'was made, given? This was a printed contract, and was filled in upon a printed form. Of course, the wording of it has to be treated with the same consideration as if it were written, and every condition set forth in it has to be fulfilled; but, in such matters, it is sometimes an explanation <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>of conditions which are injected that they were included in,and through inadvertence, or because the mere having them in there would not do any harm, they are permitted to stay.</p>

Plaintiff’s right to recover depended on questions of fact which appear to have been properly submitted to the jury and found in his favor. The main questions were, whether he substantially performed his contract with defendant within the time and in the manner required by the terms thereof. Was there a failure by him to perform in either of these respects; and, if so, was it due to his own neglect or default, or to the <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>neglect, default or improper interference of its architect? If the jury found there was a failure to perform within the time required, and the delay was chargeable to plaintiff himself, they were instructed, as requested in defendant’s second point, that the measure of damages was the twenty-five dollars per day, specified in the contract. If they found that, notwithstanding an honest effort on his part to perform his contract, he failed to do so in some minor particulars, and the building was accepted by the defendant in that condition, they were instructed to allow such reasonable deductions as would adequately compensate for such deficiencies in workmanship and materials. On this subject, the learned trial judge — in affirming plaintiff’s seventh point — charged thus: “If the jury find, under all the evidence, that the plaintiff made every reasonable effort, in good faith, to perform his contract fully and within the period given, him to perform it, and that the building was completed and taken possession of and used for its intended purpose, and adequately serves said purpose, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the balance of the contract price, together with the amount admitted to be due for the additional work, less such deductions as will compensate the defendant for any minor imperfections and omissions ; and if the jury also find that such imperfections and omissions and the delay were chargeable to the action of the defendant’s architect, and not to the fault of the plaintiff, then no deduction should be allowed on account of them.” In same connection he further said: “ You must bear in mind, however, as to the element of delay, that it must be chargeable to the action of the architect; if he failed to furnish the lines and levels, or to do any other act which he was required to do under the contract, or if he made such changes in the plans and specifications as to cause delay, the plaintiff would not be answerable for such delajq but if the delay resulted from the condemnation, with reasonable promptness, of material which the architect, under the contract, was required to pass upon, and the necessity of procuring other material, such delay would not be chargeable to the architect.”</p>
