That the merchandise and fixtures in the store conducted by him as such agent are the property of the Northwestern Hardware Company, and passed to the appellees as its receivers who were duly appointed.

But it is contended that the Northwestern Hardware Company having permitted VanKirk to do business under the name of G. C. VanKirk &amp; Co., having held out G. C. VanKirk as a partner, that the creditors having sóld goods to him as such without knowledge of the agency, that the said company having dealt with him for the„sale and purchase of goods, that G. C. VanKirk having paid all the checks and clerk hire and having bought goods upon the faith of his being a partner of said G. C. VanKirk &amp; Co., the Northwestern Hardware Company, and consequently the appellees, its receivers, are estopped from denying that he was such a partner. <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>It may be that these creditors may hereafter establish an equity which will protect them, but on July 5th, five days prior to the confession of the judgment in question, this merchandise, together with other property of the company, passed into the custody of the appellees, who had been appointed receivers. Having done so, such possession will not be interfered with by a judgment confessed in a different court and execution issued thereon.</p>

If the property might be taken piecemeal from the custody of the receiver, the remedy of the creditors under the mortgage would become worthless, or at least greatly imperiled. Ample authority has been cited by the defendants in error. If a creditor believes that the property was not legally mortgaged, or for any good reason should not pass into the hands of the receiver, his duty is to apply to the court having appointed the- receiver to ask its discharge out of custody in order that he may proceed against it. For these reasons we think the court below was right in setting aside the levy and execution.”</p>
