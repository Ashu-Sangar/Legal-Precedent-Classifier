Plaintiff by mistake had taken an Allegheny avenue car instead of a car to Frankford where he lived. When the Allegheny avenue car reached its terminus he refused to get off unless his ticket or his fare was returned to him. The conductor refused to return either, and ejected him from the car. Plaintiff then took the car to Frankford. The conductor of the Frankford car and a passenger named Slafer testified that plaintiff made no com<a id="p629" href="#p629" data-label="629" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*629</a>plaints of having received any injury, and that he was not apparently suffering from any. In rebuttal witnesses for plaintiff testified that at a criminal hearing of the conductor of the Allegheny avenue car for assault on plaintiff, Slafer had sworn that plaintiff had stated on the second car that he had been hurt at the hands of the conductor of the first car. The testimony of other witnesses for plaintiff tended to show that plaintiff was suffering from an injury shortly after he alighted from the second car.</p>
