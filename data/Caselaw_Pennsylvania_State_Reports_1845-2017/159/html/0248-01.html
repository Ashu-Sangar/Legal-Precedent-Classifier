When the train got to McKeesport, some police officer came aboard the . train, and, in pursuance of a telegram which had been sent from Connellsville, and signed by R." F. Shephard, the officer took the plaintiff off the train, and from that to the police station in McKeesport, and from there to the lock-up. The train arrived at McKeesport about six o’clock in the morning, and shortly after that the plaintiff was taken to the lock-up, where he remained until something after nine o’clock, when he was released. Mr. Shephard, who had sent the telegram, on coming to Mc-Keesport and going to the lock-up discovered that he was not the party that was wanted, and consequently he was immediately released.</p>

The baggage master gave this telegram to the conductor, and the officers went on to the train and were talking to the conductor; there is a little difference of statement as to what occurred after the officers went in; the plaintiff stated that when they came in the conductor said: ‘ This is the man — take him off.’ Plaintiff admitted, however, that something was said about these men getting on the train at Connellsville. Another witness says that the conductor said ‘ These are the two men that got on at Connellsville,’ and pointed out the two men. It seems that there was some little delay at McKeesport, and the conductor started his train, and said, as some of the witnesses state, ‘ If you want to take this man off, take him off; I will not stay here all day.’ After the train started it was stopped and the officer took the plaintiff off. Some others spoke about the conductor having said: ‘ Take him off; there are the men; if you want them, take them off,’ or some expression of that kind.</p>

Defendant’s counsel has asked me to say that there is no such liability on their part. The action is brought for false, arrest and false imprisonment. It seems from the testimony that Mr. Shephard was the detective agent of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, but there is no evidence that the company ever authorized him to arrest any person, or to direct the arrest of any person, without a proper warrant being issued. Ordinarily no man or officer has a right to arrest another on some charge of a crime committed, unless there is an information upon oath charging the party with the crime, and a warrant issued for his arrest. Sometimes when a party is seen committing a crime an officer may arrest him ‘ on view,’ but ordinarily no person or officer has such right without an information made, and warrant issued for his arrest; I say there is no evidence in this case that Shephard was thus au<a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>thorized by defendant company, and it is not to be presumed that he had that power. If Shephard himself had come to Mc-Keesport and had gone aboard the train and taken this man off, without an information and warrant, he would have been guilty of an unlawful arrest, and would be personally responsible for such conduct; the company would not be responsible any more than it would if the conductor had committed an assault and battery upon a passenger, or had committed any other crime upon a passenger; therefore this telegram was no authority for these officers to arrest the plaintiff and take him off the train, and in no event would the railroad company be liable for what these officers did after plaintiff was taken off the cars.] [1] He was taken to the police station ; it was early in the morning, and according to the evidence he told them who he was, and where he lived, and showed them his bank book and other papers to show that there certainly was some mistake in his arrest, and he said to the officers on the car that he was not the man they were after. When such information was given to the officers they ought to have been careful as to what they did. It was enough to put them on their guard, and as they were proceeding illegally, proceeding at their peril in arresting him, they ought to have been more careful. [The telegram did not authorize them to lock him up in the prison of McKeesport. It simply authorized — if they did anything — that they should arrest and hold him until they would identify him. They might have detained him — perhaps detained him without any trouble at all, because he made no resistance — might have perhaps kept him at the station house, or any place else, but taking him to the lock-up and locking him in the prison, without any warrant, or anything of the kind, was a gross outrage, but the railroad company would not be responsible in any event for that.] [2]</p>

I say to you that if the conductor simply pointed out the plaintiff as one of the men that got on at Connellsville — if that is all he did, there can be no recovery here at all against the defendant company.] [3] I submit to you the question on another aspect of the case, because of the testimony of some of the witnesses. If the conductor pointed out these two men as the men that were wanted under this telegram, and if he pointed out the plaintiff as one <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>of the men referred to in the telegram, and aided the officers to take him off the train, then I say to you that the plaintiff can recover, but to recover only such damages as resulted from his being unable to complete his trip that day.] [4] In that event he could recover only what pecuniary loss he sustained by not being enabled to go to Pittsburgh on that-train, and then the question is has he proven any loss ? He got his breakfast in McKeesport, paid for by Mr. Shephard, because as soon as it was found that there was a mistake' in the case Mr. Shephard took him out, got him his breakfast, and got his transportation down to Pittsburgh without any expense — I presume he gave up his ticket from Connellsville to Pittsburgh, when the conductor first came around, but he paid nothing for his trip from McKeesport down, and according to his testimony he found out from the party he saw in McKeesport that there was really no necessity for his going to Pittsburgh that day, for the party he wished to see was not there. -He returned to Connellsville, his home, that evening,'and the next day came back to Pittsburgh.</p>

By nominal damages we mean a very small sum, a few cents. It is different from what is called substantial damages, where there has been a substantial injury, but where there has been simply a technical wrong the damages are simply nominal.”] [5]</p>

Such is not the rule. Nominal damages are those recoverable where a legal right is to be vindicated from an invasion that has produced no actual present loss of any kind. If there has been any actual loss, then the damages must be compensatory, and for false imprisonment, as for trespass in improperly ejecting plaintiff from the cars, such damages include, in addition to actual expenses incurred, compensation for loss of time, interruption of business, bodily or mental suffering, humiliation and injury to feelings.

First, was Shephard the agent of defendant in ordering the arrest, and had he such authority, actual or apparent, as justified the conductor in obeying his telegraphed order ? It is not necessary, as the learned judge seems to have told the jury, that the defendant should have authorized Shephard to make an arrest without a warrant. If he had the general authority, actual or apparent, to act for the defendant in the capacity of detective officer, and such authority included, expressly or by general usage and consent, the power to make an arrest in their behalf, then the mode of execution of such power, with warrant or without, was immaterial, and the defendant was liable in either event. That is the general ground of the operation of the maxim respondeat superior. If the master orders the thing done, he is responsible for the manner in which the servant does it. There was some evidence of Shephard’s employment as detective for the defendant, and that question must go the jury.</p>

This also was a question for the jury. The conductor has general power and control over the train and all persons on it, with authority to compel observance of the regulations of the company, to preserve order, and to employ the whole force of the train men, and of passengers willing to assist, for these purposes. These extensive powers involve the correlative duty to protect passengers, not only from injury by negligence or accident, but also from violence and illegal annoyance or interference by other parties. In Pittsburgh etc. R. R. Co. v. Hinds, <a href="/pa/53/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="53 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1004776" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0512-01">53 Pa. 512</a>, a woman passenger was injured during a fight among a mob of disorderly men that had got on the train at a way station. This court held that the railroad company escaped liability for allowing them to get on only because the evidence showed clearly that the conductor had no opportunity or force adequate to prevent them, and the railroad company was not bound to anticipate such an occurrence, but that it was liable if the conductor did not do all he could to stop the fighting. The law on this point as to the duty to protect passengers from violence and disorder, is laid down by Chief Justice Woodward with great stringency. The conductor, <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>he says, “ has large powers at his disposal, and if properly used, they are generally sufficient to preserve order. . . . His official character and position are a power. Then he majr stop the train and call to his assistance the engineer, the fireman, all the brakesmen and such passengers as are willing to lend a helping hand. . . . Until at least he has put forth the forces at his disposal, no conductor has a right to abandon the scene of conflict.” Again in Pittsburgh etc. R. R. Co. v. Pillow, <a href="/pa/76/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="76 Pa. 510" data-case-ids="1038877" data-case-paths="/pa/76/0510-01">76 Pa. 510</a>, it is said that there is no sound distinction between injuries from negligence in the equipment or management of the train, and those arising from the misconduct of passengers upon it. “ If the employees of the road had no control or power over passengers, this argument would be sound. But they have such power, and they are just as responsible for its proper exercise, as they are for the proper running of the train.” This case was quoted approvingly in Rommel v. Schambacher, <a href="/pa/120/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="120 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="559941" data-case-paths="/pa/120/0579-01">120 Pa. 579</a>, where upon the same principle an innkeeper was held liable for not protecting a guest from the drunken freak of another. And what is said in Lang v. Penn. R. R. Co., 154-Pa. 342, as to the protection of goods, applies a fortiori to the protection of the persons of passengers. “ The railroad company was, represented in the carriage and safe-keeping of the freight on the train by the men to whom the train had been committed. If they deserted their posts and left the goods uncared for, and they were stolen or destrojmd, their employer must suffer for their inefficiency.”</p>

If therefore he took part in the-illegal arrest the defendant was liable for the consequences of his act. But even beyond this, it was his duty under ordinary circumstances, as already said, to protect his passengers from trespass while under his care, and if he stood by and saw them illegally molested in any way without an effort to protect them, it would be negligence for which the defendant would be liable. He was not however required to enter into a contest with or put himself in opposition to the officers of the law, and if he merely stood by without taking part in the arrest by known policemen, he was not necessarily bound to inquire into their authority, or assert his own <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>against it. How far the conductor in the present case assisted in the arrest is the subject of some conflict in the testimony, and what knowledge he had of the illegality of it, is not clear. Although the telegram was addressed to him, as the conductor of that train, he does not seem to have assumed the direction of the affair, but rather to have acquiesced in what the police whom he found there on his arrival should do, with the suggestion that they should not detain his train. The case must therefore go to the jury to determine what he did, and whether, in accordance with the principles of law, it was a proper performance of his duty.</p>
