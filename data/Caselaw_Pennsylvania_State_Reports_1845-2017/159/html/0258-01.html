The verdict for defendant is necessarily predicated of their finding that plaintiff’s husband made default in the payment of said assessments. Hence, it follows, according to the very terms of the contract, that the beneficiary certificate became “ null and void.” There is no escape from this conclusion, unless the learned judge erred in one or more of the particulars complained of.</p>

Benevolent Association, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20Pa.%20119" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="137 Pa. 119">137 Pa. 119</a>, recently quoted approvingly in North Western Ma<a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>sonic Aid Association v. Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=154%20Pa.%20104" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="154 Pa. 104">154 Pa. 104</a>. In the former, our late brother Clakk, after concisely stating the general object or purpose of an insurance company, said: “ What is known as a beneficial association, however, has a wholly different object and purpose in view. The great underlying purpose of the organization is not to indemnify or to secure against loss; its design is to accumulate a fund, from the contributions of its members, ‘ for beneficial or protective purposes,’ to be used in their own aid or relief, in the misfortunes of sickness, injury or death. The benefits, although secured by contract, and for that reason to a limited extent assimilated to the proceeds of insurance, are not so considered. Such societies are rather of a philanthropic or benevolent character; their beneficial features may be of. a narrow or restrictive character; the motives of the members may be to some extent selfish, but the principle upon which they rest is founded in the considerations mentioned. These benefits, by the rule of their organization, are payable to their own unfortunate, out of funds which the members themselves have contributed for the purpose, not as an indemnity, or security, against loss, but as a protective relief in case of sickness or injury, or to provide the means of a decent burial in the event of death. Such societies have no capital stock. They yield no profit, and their contracts, although beneficial and protective, altogether exclude the idea of insurance, or of indemnity, or of security against loss.” To the class of associations, thus described and distinguished from insurance companies, the association defendant clearly belongs; and hence the application for membership, setting forth the terms and conditions thereof, was rightly received in evidence. The act of May 11,1881, has no application to contracts such as the one sued in this case. '</p>

The testimony as to assessments three and four for January, 1888, notice thereof to plaintiff’s husband, and nonpayment thereof, was rightly received. If that testimony was believed by the jury it was quite sufficient to entitle the defendant to a verdict. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
