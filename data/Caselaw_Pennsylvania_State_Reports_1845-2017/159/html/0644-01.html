The allegation is that Latshaw induced plaintiffs to sell him the stocks by false representations as to their value and as to his object in buying. The stocks consisted of 750 shares of the New York &amp; Middle Coal Field Railroad &amp; Coal Co., 1500 shares of the Arion Silver Mining Co., and 500 shares of the Montana Gold &amp; Silver Mining Co., and had belonged to one Daniel Latshaw, deceased, the father of defendant, and were bought by plaintiffs at an executor’s sale of decedent’s effects, held March, 1887, for 111.40.</p>

In September, 1891, one C. R. Lindsay, who previously had been connected as secretary with the New York &amp; Middle Coal Field Railroad &amp;’Coal Co., wrote to Daniel Latshaw, not knowing he was dead, inquiring whether he still held <a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>any stock in said company, and asking the lowest price he would take for it, stating also that the stock had no market value but that he could use it at two dollars per share. This letter was received and answered bjr defendant S. B. Latshaw, who then wrote to Saylor, one of the plaintiffs, asking whether he still held the stocks bought at the sale, and what he'would take for them. A correspondence was then carried on between defendant and Saylor, in.which Latshaw stated that he believed the stocks had no intrinsic value, and that he could find no offices of the company, and offering twenty-five dollars for the lot. The parties, plaintiff and defendant, afterward met at Pottstown, when the stocks mentioned were sold to Latshaw for fifty dollars. It is alleged by plaintiffs that at the time of transfer Latshaw was asked by Saylor, ‘ What is there in this stock that you appear so anxious to have it? You laughed at me when I bought it,’ and that he replied, ‘ I want it as a relic of my father’s effects; it has no value, and no office or officers of the company,’ and that these representations were the inducement to sell them to him. At this time Latshaw had Lindsay’s offer of two dollars per share for the 750 shares of railroad and coal company stock. The other stocks had no market value, nor does it appear that the companies are still in existence.</p>

The bill prays for a reassignment of said shares and for an injunction to prevent further transfers.</p>

But we fail to find that plaintiffs have brought themselves within any of the excepted cases. To the plaintiffs these stocks have no special or peculiar value, and were not purchased for any special purpose. The only object of their purchase was to make money for them, and hence their only value to plaintiffs is what might be realized from a resale. When they bought, plaintiffs thought they were worthless, and did not even know that the companies had an existence; and, therefore, if there was nothing else in the case but a mere breach of contract, plaintiffs would have a complete and ample remedy at law for the loss sustained, if any.</p>

It is no answer to say that the stocks other than the railroad and coal company stock have no market value, and that the damage on that account could not be ascertained, for it is apparent that as to them defendant made no fraudulent representation, for he knew nothing of their value, nor do the plaintiffs; and were it not for the railroad and coal company stock, this suit never would have been brought. In the language of the master: ‘ The wrong, therefore, against which they complain is the acquirement of the coal stock from them for a nominal price. If they paid the full value of the coal stock they will, under their own showing, be entirely compensated for all damages consequent upon any wrong of the defendant.’</p>

What he said at the executors’ sale had nothing to do with plaintiffs’ purchase, and after that he was acting towards them as an individual, and their relations were simply that of vendor and <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>vendee. He was not bound to disclose his knowledge of the value of the stocks, provided he did not make fraudulent representations or suppress the truth when it was his duty to speak. Plaintiffs had opportunities for informing themselves of the condition of the various companies, but they appeared to have taken but little interest in the matter. Was he guilty of such fraud as will entitle the plaintiffs to the relief asked for? It is true that a confidential relation is not necessary to establish a constructive trust, and that a trust may arise from actual fraud; but this fraud alone will not be sufficient to warrant relief, unless the parties relied upon the fraudulent representations which were the inducements to their contract.</p>

Ed., *174, it is said: ‘The jurisdiction for rescission and cancellation arises where a transaction is vitiated by illegality or fraud, or by reason of its having been carried on in ignorance or mistake of facts material to its operation. And it is exercised .... for setting aside executed conveyances or other impeachable transactions, where it is necessary to replace the parties in statu quo. And in such cases, though pecuniary damages might be in some sense a remedy, yet if fraud be complained of there is jurisdiction in chancery.’ The author instances amongst cases of this character the procuring contracts to be made or acts to be done by means of willful misrepresentation, either express or implied, etc. But to constitute a ease of this kind there must be a representation, express or implied, within the knowledge of the party making it, reasonably relied on by the other party, and constituting a material inducement to his contract or act. Tested by this rule, have the plaintiffs a standing in a court of equity ?</p>

It thus appears that plaintiffs had means of information open to them, and that they investigated the matter. How can it be said, therefore, that they relied on Mr. Latshaw’s representations as to value rather than on their own knowledge.</p>

And for this he cites Vernon v. Keys, 12 East, .632, where the vendee ‘ falsely and deceitfully represented to the vendor that he was about to enter into partnership in the same trade with other persons-whose names he would not disclose, and that these persons would not consent to his giving the plaintiff more for his interest than a certain sum; whereas, in truth, neither A and B, with whom he was then about to enter into partnership, nor any other intended partners of his, had refused to give more than that sum, but had then agreed with the defendant that he should make the best terms he could with the plaintiff, and would have given him a larger sum. And in fact the defendant charged them with a larger price in account for the purchase of plaintiff’s interest.’ Held, that an action on the case did not lie for this false and deceitful representation by the bidder of the seller’s probabilities of getting a better price for his property, for it was either a mere false representation or at most a gratis dictum of the bidder upon a matter which he was not under any legal obligation to the seller to disclose with accuracy, and on which it was the folly of the seller to rely.</p>

It is apparent that plaintiffs are seeking to recover damages for their loss, and not to recover the specific chattels sold. It is not alleged nor shown that the stocks have to them <a id="p649" href="#p649" data-label="649" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*649</a>any especial value apart, from their money value, and plaintiffs will be placed in statu quo when they are paid what they have lost in money. In Mackintosh v. Tracy, 4 Brews. 59, it was held that ‘ in cases of fraud, especially where the fraud relates to sales of personal chattels, and where the 'relief sought is merely compensation in damages, if the remedy at law is adequate, relief is not ordinarily granted in equity.’ See also Parsons on Contracts, vol. 2, p. 782.”</p>
