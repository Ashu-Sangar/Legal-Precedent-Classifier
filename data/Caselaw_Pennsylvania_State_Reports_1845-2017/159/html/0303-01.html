What provisions are material must be gathered from the relation of each to the purpose and scope of the act; and when, therefore, successive steps are prescribed for the creation of corporations these must obviously be regarded as imperative. Enabling statutes, on the principle of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>impliedly prohibit any other mode of doing the act which they authorize; they must be strictly construed: Sutherland on Stat.

That was the last of successive steps required to be taken, and the right to begin the transaction of corporate business was made to depend upon the taking of that step. . “ From thenceforth,” the act expressly declares, the subscribers and their associates and successors “ shall be a corporation for the purposes and upon the terms named in the said charter.” One of the purposes of the <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>act being exemption from personal liability in tbe transaction of business, it is obviously material that the public should have notice, and notice by record was accordingly prescribed.
