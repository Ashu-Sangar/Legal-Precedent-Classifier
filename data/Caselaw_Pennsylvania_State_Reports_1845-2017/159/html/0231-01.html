Included in this residue is real estate situated in this commonwealth, part of which these accountants have sold under said power, and the proceeds are here for distribution. Between the dates of Julia C. Coleman’s death and this sale, the register made an appraisement of the land for the purpose of collateral inheritance tax, and from that appraisement no appeal has been taken. The register now claims the tax out of this fund, and the accountant denies its liability, because the legatees ‘acquire nothing more under the will than a right to receive a sum of money out of the proceeds of sale; a mere chose in action ; a claim of strictly personal character.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.5",262,[240,998,1171,1467]]]'>“ The solution of the question involved in this case turns mainly upon the application of the maxim that the situs of personal property follows' the domicile of the owner. It was said in Small’s Est., <a href="/pa/151/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="151 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="836645" data-case-paths="/pa/151/0001-01">151 Pa. 1</a>, that as a general rule intangible personal property of a nonresident, such as bonds, mortgages and other choses in action, is governed, as to its situs, by the fiction of law above noticed, and hence such property is not subject to collateral inheritance taxation under the act of 1387, because not situated in this state. Some species of personal property, it is true, when used in carrying on business or for other particular purposes,- may have an actual as distinct from a legal situs ; but the local character of the use takes it out of the operation of the rule. And of this Small’s Estate is of itself a striking illustration. Not only was the ‘ thing ’ given employed in a business which was by its nature localized, but the manifest intent of the testator was that it should remain in this state. The bequest was specifically of testator’s interest, including ‘ all the property, real and personal, notes, stocks, bonds and accounts,’ in a limited partnership organized under the laws, and having its principal place of business in this state. The value of the property depended largely upon its continuance here. There was no reason for its conversion and transmission to the testator’s domicile, and it was given to the surviving partners as such in specie. The facts plainly made an exception to the general rule. The actual situs was here, and liability to the tax followed. It is urged upon behalf of the commonwealth that this case rules the present; but the facts differ in material respects. The gift here was of an interest in a fund whose distribution belonged to the domicile of the donor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b263-3" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[151,390,1164,2027]],["BL_264.1",264,[280,383,1157,193]]]'>
      <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>“ It was said in Bittinger’s Ap., <a href="/pa/129/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="129 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="568063" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0338-01">129 Pa. 338</a>, that the collateral inheritance tax was not a succession, but a direct tax upon the * thing ’ given in the hands of the donees. What was the ‘ thing ’ given to these legatees ? The answer is in Miller v. Com., Ill Pa. 321, in which it was held that where a testator domiciled in this state orders land situated without to be sold to pay pecuniary legacies, these legacies will pass to the legatees as money, subject to the domiciliary law, and consequently to the collateral inheritance tax. ‘ Under all the decisions it cannot be questioned,’ said the court, ‘ that the third clause of (sale under the) will operated as a conversion of the residuary real estate into personalty efficacious from the moment of testator’s death. . . . Had there been a mere direction to" sell, as was the case in Drayton’s Ap., <a href="/pa/61/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="61 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="428597" data-case-paths="/pa/61/0172-01">61 Pa. 172</a>, we should have felt bound to hold there was no conversion, and that as the land was situated in another state it would not be subject to collateral inheritance tax.’ The facts here are precisely similar, and should work the same result. The thing given was not land, but an interest in its proceeds. If bonds, notes, stocks, bonds and mortgages be intangible personal property, surely this is. The administration here being ancillary, the legatees have no status. Local debts and expenses having been paid, it is the sole duty of the administrator to transmit the balance to the domicile for administration. The collateral tax is imposed only on what remains for distribution after all the expenses of administration, debts and rightful claims of third parties, domestic as well as foreign, have been paid or provided for; it is only the net balance that is liable. How, then, is it possible to impose a tax on this fund when it has never been ascertained judicially how much or whether any of it will go to the collateral legatees ? Who can tell how much of the fund may be successfully claimed by creditors and others as against the legatees ? The court of the domicile is the only tribunal that can determine how much will ultimately go to them : Oreutt’s Ap., <a href="/pa/97/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="97 Pa. 179" data-case-ids="444784" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0179-01">97 Pa. 179</a>. Suppose the whole of the fund should be required for the payment of claims of domiciliary creditors, a tax imposed here now would be upon a class not within the purview of our law and unjust. Suppose the legatees should be entitled to receive only part of the fund upon which the tax is imposed here, the expense of recovering the excess would be a burthen. So, too, the impo<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>sition of a tax here would result in the hardship of a double tax. It is apparent, therefore, that the imposition of a tax on the fund here would not only be unwarranted by the act of 1887, but would work injustice to these beneficial parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b264-4" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[276,585,1161,299]]]'>But in addition to these reasons, there is a question of public policy involved which is worthy of consideration. The rule that personal property follows the domicile of the owner is internationally recognized and observed as being founded in convenience (2 Wm.
