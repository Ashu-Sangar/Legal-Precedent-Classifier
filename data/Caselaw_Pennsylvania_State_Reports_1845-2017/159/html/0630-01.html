The evidence did not show that she was present when the will was made, or that she had anything to do with the making of the will in her favor. It was produced by her after his death.</p>

Is the proof of the relationship itself sufficient evidence to sustain a finding by a jury of undue influence ? Dean v. Negley, <a href="/pa/41/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="41 Pa. 312" data-case-ids="480041" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0312-01">41 Pa. 312</a>, is cited in support of these propositions. But in that case it was shown that the testator was suffering from a cancerous disease, that his mind became debilitated from the use of opiates which rendered him particularly subject to the control of the person with whom the illicit intercourse was had. She exercised despotic influence over him in many of his business transactions. She nursed him in his sickness, and his family could have no communication with him except in her presence or in the presence of some member of her family. In other words there was evidence of numerous acts and circumstances showing the force of her influence over the enfeebled mind. In that case the contestants did not rely upon the relationship itself to show the undue influence, but offered proof of the actual existence of such influence. Where, in addition to the unlawful relationship, there is evidence indicating constraint, control, interference, impaired testamentary capacity, loss of will power, habits of intemperance, sickness or disease, at the time the will is made, the case should go to the juiy.</p>

Unlawful cohabitation of the legatee and testator is not of itself sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer undue influence.

While we all disapprove of such an act where an illicit relationship exists, it is nevertheless legal if it is the result of the free, voluntary act of the testator. A testator has the legal right to devise his property to his mistress : McGeary v. McGeary, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.%2022" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 A. 22">3 Atl. R. 22</a>.

It shows a determination on the part of the testator that the legatee should not be defeated. He may have feared that the will would not be safe in the hands of his family, for they were justly indignant because of the continual visits to Mrs. Russell.</p>

This neglect does not show mental debility. The witnesses speak of the testator as a sober, strong-minded man up to the time of his fatal sickness, and the attending physician says that in 1887, at the time of the first sickness, ‘ He was a very decided character, a strong-minded man and a very self-willed one. ... In 1889, after the acute symptoms of the paralysis passed away, his mind was as good as ever I knew it.’ The inattention to business was a natural consequence where there is an indulgence in adulterous practice.</p>

The application was for an issue upon the question of undue influence exercised by Anna M. Russell upon the testator in procuring the legacy in her favor. In point of fact the case is absolutely destitute of proof of a single act of influence, undue or otherwise, on the part of Mrs. Russell. There is no testimony to show that she ever, at any time or in any circumstances, even so much as asked him to make a provision in her favor. The will was written by the testator himself, fourjmars before his death, without the slightest proof that Mrs. Russell was present or had anything to do with it, or that she knew anything about it.</p>
