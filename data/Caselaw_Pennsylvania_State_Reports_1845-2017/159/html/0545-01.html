The word ‘heirs,’ ex vi termini, implies representation; and in this respect its meaning is not changed by being coupled with the word children. It is not to be assumed that the two words are used as meaning the same thing, especially where there is an obvious reason for using both. In a bequest to chil<a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>dren, grandchildren will not take, even where by statute lapse is provided against in the case of children dying in the lifetime of the testator: Gross’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/10/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 Pa. 360" data-case-ids="962703" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0360-01">10 Pa. 360</a> ; Guenther’s Appeal, 4 W. N. 41; hence in such cases the number of persons to take is to all intents and purposes fixed, and the per capita rule of distribution is not altogether unnatural or unreasonable. But in a gift to ‘ heirs ’ or to ‘ children and heirs,’ grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and descendants to the remotest degree may and are entitled to take; and the persons so entitled may change from day to day, after the execution of the will, and in the lifetime of the testator, both in number and degree of relationship. In the present case, for example, — where the testatrix had two living children, one grandchild, the child of a deceased son, and two grandchildren, of another deceased son, —under a per capita division each would have been entitled to one fifth; and had the limitation been simply to children of the deceased sons, the number of shares could not have increased, though it might have been diminished by death of some of them in her lifetime. Under the gift to heirs, however, if one grandchild had died before she did, leaving six children, the shares, if the same rule is to be applied, would be reduced to one tenth each; or, if all the grandchildren had so died, each, leaving six children, to one twentieth; while the children of the testatrix would thus be lowered to the level of grandchildren.</p>
