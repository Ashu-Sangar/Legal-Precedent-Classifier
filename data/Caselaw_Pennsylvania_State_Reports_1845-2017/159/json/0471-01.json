To have instructed the jury, as requested in either of defendant\u2019s points, recited in the first four specifications, would have been plain error. Instead of showing \u201c that there was no unnecessary or wanton sounding of the whistle,\u201d etc., the testimony tended to prove quite the contrary. The defendant company\u2019s right to use Kensington avenue was not exclusive. It was in common with the public; and wherever such common user of a highway exists, it is the duty of railway companies to exercise such watchful care as will prevent, as far as possible, accidents or injuries to persons and property. In such circumstances, a greater degree of care, on the part of the railway company as well as the public, is required. The degree of care to be exercised must necessarily vaiy with the circumstances of each case: Gilmore v. Railway Co., 153 Pa. 31.\nThe testimony was also conflicting, and presented questions of fact which were necessarily for the consideration of the jury. In any view that can be taken of the case, it could not have been withdrawn from their consideration.\nThere is nothing in either of the specifications of error that would justify a reversal of the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Lott v. Frankford & Southwark Pass. R. R., Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Street railways \u2014 Whistle\u2014User of streets.\nWhere the public and a street railway company have a common user of a street, it is the duty of the railway company to exercise such watchful care as will prevent, as far as possible, accidents or injuries to persons and property. In such circumstances, a greater degree of care on the part of the railway company, as well as the public, is required; but the degree of care varies with the circumstances of each case.\nIn an action against a street railway company to recover damages for an injury to a team of horses and a wagon, it is proper to submit the ease to the jury, where there is evidence that defendant\u2019s engineer, on a dummy engine, sounded the whistle of the engine in an unusual and extraordinary manner as he approached plaintiff\u2019s wagon, which was on the other track, and that plaintiff\u2019s horses were thereby frightened and ran in front of the engine, resulting in the injuries for which the suit was brought.\nArgued Jan. 5, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 422, Jan. T., 1893, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila., Dec. T., 1889, No. 254, on verdict for plaintiff, Jamison Lott, Jr.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nTrespass for injuries to horses and wagon.\nAt the trial, before Biddle, J., it appeared that early in the morning of April 18, 1889, plaintiff\u2019s employees were driving a team of horses and a wagon on Kensington avenue on their way to Philadelphia. Defendant company operated, on Kensington avenue, a double track street railway by means of ears and small locomotives, popularly known as \u201c dummy \u201d engines. Evidence on behalf of plaintiff tended to show plaintiff\u2019s wagon was being driven along one of the tracks in a train of other wagons, and as it approached a dummy engine on the other track it was turned off towards the curb. The engineer then sounded an unusual and extraordinary whistle, and plaintiff\u2019s horses became frightened and ran in front of the engine and were injured.\nPlaintiff\u2019s evidence was to the effect that his horses were quiet and used to the ordinary running of the cars.\nThe court charged in part as follows:\n\u201c Now the allegation here is that these noises, or this noise, was not necessarily incident to the running of this road; that while it may be that it was their duty to give notice by sounding a whistle if danger was apparent to the engineer who was running the train, yet it is contended here that the whistle blown on this occasion was of such an unusual and extraordinary character as to frighten horses which otherwise were perfectly accustomed to the use of dummies, and the usual and necessary noises which they create. The plaintiff called a number of gentlemen who were in the habit of using this road. It seems to be a road to market from Frankford, a favorite route, or at least a route very much used by farmers coming to market. , These gentlemen say that they have been using the road, some of them for twenty or twenty-five years, and they say that they never heard such a whistle as this was before. One of them said that once before he had heard such a whistle, but the others said that they had never lieard such a whistle. One of them said that it was of such a character as to induce him to look out of his wagon to see what was going on. Therefore the question for you to determine is, was this an unnecessary thing for them to do for the purpose of warning persons whom they feared were coming on the track? Now the engineer, whose testimony 1 think was perfectly frank [said that he did not see anybody on the track; that the persons who were alleged to have been on the track on Orleans street did not influence him to blow this whistle at all; that it was not that anybody was on the track, but his allegation is that he thought one of the wagons in this train of wagons approaching him was about to get on the track.] [5] The question will be for you to say whether a single blow of the whistle would not have been enough to warn this man, if he was or did intend to get right in front of the engine, to keep back. The question of course, the main question here, if you believe this was an undue and unnecessary use of this whistle and that the plaintiff is entitled to damages, is to decide what you consider a fair compensation for the injury he has sustained. . . .\n\u201c [Gentlemen, I don\u2019t know whether you recall the testimony of the engineer. What I thought he said, and what I told you he said, was that he thought one of these wagons was coming on the track. The recollection of the counsel for the defendant is that he said he saw it coming or turning on the track. I will have to leave it to your recollection for you to decide. It don\u2019t make, perhaps, a great deal of difference, in view of what occurred, whether he saw this man coming, or thought he was coming on this track.\u201d ] [6]\nDefendants\u2019 points were among others as follows :\n\u201c 2. Under all the evidence, it appearing that there was no unnecessary or wanton sounding of the whistle, but that it was done to warn the driver of the vehicle that preceded it, the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [1]\n\u201c 3. Under all the facts of this case, it was the duty of the engineer to sound the whistle as he did, and therefore your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [2]\n\u201c 4. It appearing, from the evidence, that the plaintiff\u2019s horse was high spirited and easily frightened, he was guilty of contributory negligence in driving it along Kensington avenue, and therefore your verdict should be for the said defendant.\u201d Refused. [3]\n6. Request for binding instructions. Refused. [4]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $455.50.\nErrors assigned were (1-6) instructions, quoting them.\nWm.
