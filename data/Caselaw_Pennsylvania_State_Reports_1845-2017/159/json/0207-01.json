        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nThe contract in this case comes clearly within both the letter and spirit of the act of 1887. That act gave married women unrestricted power to acquire real estate and to incur corresponding liabilities. It declares: \u201c That hereafter marriage shall not be held to impose any disability on or incapacity in a married woman as to the acquisition .... of property of any kind in (1) any trade or business in which she may engage, or (2) for necessaries, or (3) for the use, enjoyment and improvement of her separate estate, .... or (4) her right and power to make contracts of any kind, and to give obligations binding herself therefor; but every married woman shall have the same right to acquire .... property, real and personal, .... in the same manner as if she were a femme sole.\u201d . . . This plainly emancipated her from common law disabilities, and authorized her to contract as a femme sole: Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258.\nThe unrestricted power of acquisition in trade or for necessaries is conceded; but it is insisted that defendant\u2019s acquisition being within neither of these clauses, her power, and consequently her liability, were limited to that which was necessary to the \u201c use, enjoyment and improvement \u201d of real estate which she already owned. This is but a narrow construction of a single clause of the act. The word \u201c improvement \u201d it is true implies an existing subject.; but does not control, nor even color, the meaning of the words \u201cuse\u201d and \u201cenjoyment \u201d with which it is coupled. They were coupled for the sake of convenience; but were employed to express distinct and independent purposes in reference to the separate estate. The \u201cacquisition\u201d of lands would often be advantageous to the \u201cuse \u201d and \u201cenjoyment\u201d of her separate estate when not required for its \u201c improvement.\u201d If the separate estate should consist entirely of personalty, circumstances might arise in which the acquisition of land would be the only available \u201c use \u201d and \u201c enjoyment.\u201d It would be strange, indeed, if, when a married woman has been expressly given unlimited power to acquire real estate \u201cin any trade or business,\u201d or for \u201cnecessaries,\u201d or \u201c to make contracts of any kind and to give obligations binding herself therefor,\u201d and \u201cto acquire .... property .... in the same manner as if she were a femme sole,\u201d she should be unable to acquire a home for her \u201c use \u201d and \u201c enjoyment.\u201d The purpose of the legislature was broad and liberal and must be interpreted in a like spirit. With the exception of such disabilities as are particularly specified in or contemplated by the provisions of the act, married women were emancipated from their common law disabilities, and authorized to incur contract liabilities as if they were femme sole; and such has been the trend of our decisions whenever questions have arisen since the passage of the act: Adams v. Grey, supra. As defendant is not within any of the exceptions, her liability necessarily follows, and the judgment entered on the special verdict must be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Smith, Appellant.\n[Marked to be reported.]\nMarried woman \u2014 Contracts\u2014Purchase of real estate \u2014 Act 1887.\nUnder the married persons\u2019 property act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332, a married woman may enter into a contract to purchase real estate for the purpose of a residence for herself and family, and she is personally liable for the money borrowed to pay for it.\nThe word \u201c improvement\u201d in the act does not contract or even color the meaning of the words \u201c use\u201d and \u201c enjoyment.\u201d These words were coupled with the word \u201c improvement\u201d for the sake of convenience, but they were employed to express distinct and independent purposes in reference to the separate estate. The acquisition of land may be an advantageous use and enjoyment of her separate estate.\nWith the exception of such disabilities as are particularly specified in or contemplated by the provisions of the act, married women are emancipated from their common law disabilities, and are authorized to incur contract liabilities as if they were femme sole.\nArgued Nov. 2, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 235, Oct. T., 1893, by defendant, Henrietta C. Smith, from judgment of O. P. No. 3, Allegheny Co., Feb. T., 1892, No. 250', on special verdict in favor of plaintiff, Annie W. Steffen, executrix of Christian Steffen, Jr., deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, Mitchell, Dean and Thompson, JJ.\nAssumpsit on promissory note.\nThe jury returned the following special verdict:\n\u201c 1. That on Feb. 25,1889, the defendant Henrietta C. Smith was, and now is, a married woman.\n\u201c 2. That said Henrietta C. Smith then was in receipt of an annual income of \u00a72,400 derived from a trust estate consisting of realty and personalty.\n\u201c 3. That on Feb. 25, 1889, A. J. Stephenson and wife by their deed conveyed to Henrietta Catherwood Smith a certain piece of ground situate in the Twentieth ward, of the city of Pittsburgh, in said county, the consideration therefor being $27,500.\n\u201c 4. That the terms of said sale were $4,000 cash, and the balance of $23,500 was secured to the vendor by a purchase money mortgage of the same date, recorded in Mortgage Book vol. 473, p. 262, and payable as follows, viz.: Aug. 15, 1889, $3,500; March 1,1890, $5,000; March 1,1891, $5,000; March 1, 1892, $5,000; March 1, 1893, $5,000; with interest on the balance of unpaid principal money paj^able semi-annually, with the usual scire facias clause in case of default of payment of principal or interest.\n\u201c 5. That the said real estate was a residence property, and after purchase occupied by the defendant and her family as such.\n\u201c 6. That on the same date, Feb. 25,1889, the said Henrietta C. Smith made and delivered and received the proceeds of the following note:\n\u201c \u2018 $3,200 Allegheny, Pa., February 25th, 1889.\n\u201c \u2018 Three months after date I promise to pay to the order of The Enterprise Savings Bank thirty-two hundred dollars at The Enterprise Savings Bank. Without defalcation. Value received. H. C. Smith.\u2019\n\u201c Endorsed, \u2018 T. L. Clark, Cashier.\u2019\n\u201c7. That the said note was, before maturity, discounted by the said Christian Steffen, Jr., who has since deceased, and his estate is now administered upon by said plaintiff.\n\u201c 8. That said note was discounted for the purpose of borrowing money with which to purchase said piece of real estate, and $3,000 of the proceeds of said note were actually so applied with the knowledge of said bank and said Steffen, being a part of the cash payment of Feb. 25, 1889.\n\u201c 9. That a mortgage bearing date Feb. 25, 1889, for $3,000 upon said property was given by said defendant to said bank as a collateral security for the payment of said note.\n\u201c 10. That the mortgage given to said vendor to secure the said unpaid purchase (money) was afterwards,- and before the bringing of this suit, foreclosed, by scire facias proceedings, the property sold thereon and the lien of the mortgage given to said bank was divested.\n\u201c If under the facts stated the court shall be of opinion that the defendant is liable for the amount of said note, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff and against the defendant in the sum of $8,200 and interest from May 28, 1889. If the court should be of opinion that the defendant is liable only for such part of the proceeds as were actually applied in said purchase, then judgment to be entered for plaintiff for $8,000 and interest from May 28,1889. If the court shall be of opinion that under the facts of the case defendant had no power to bind herself by the contract declared upon, then judgment to be entered for defendant.\u201d\nThe court entered judgment for plaintiff for $3,200 with interest from May 28, 1889.\nError assigned was above judgment, quoting it.\nJames R. Mdcfarlane, for appellant. \u2014\nThe contract in this case is not within the sphere of the powers and liabilities of a married woman, created by the married persons\u2019 property act of June 3, 1887, P. L. 332. The purposes for which she may acquire property of any kind are limited, and the only possible binding one here is the use, enjoyment and improvement of her separate estate. To buy a house and lot, even for a home, is not a use, enjoyment and improvement of her separate estate : Latrobe Association v. Fritz, 152 Pa. 224; Real Estate Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496 ; Koechling v. Henkel, 144 Pa. 215 ; Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258; Abell v. Chaffee, 154 Pa. 254.\nWhile the act does \u201c greatly enlarge her powers,\u201d the cases decided by this court in every instance follow the principles laid down in the two leading cases of Real Estate v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496, and Koechling v. Henkel, 144 Pa. 215, limiting her powers and liability to (\u00ab) necessaries, (5) separate business and ('c) management of her separate estate. Whether expressly conferred or an incident to her rights, the contract power relates to these three heads.\nBrooks v. Bank, 125 Pa. 394, was the note of a business firm in which a married woman was a partner. Real Estate Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496, was a note given by a married woman as surety for her husband, or to aid him in carrying on his business, and she was not liable. Koechling v. Henkel, 144 Pa. 215, was a judgment against a married woman, regular on its face, without facts shown on its face to bring it within the act, and it was held good on the ground that she must show that it was not authorized. Bauck v. Swan, 146 Pa. 444, held that the power to sell under the word \u201c dispose \u201d carried with it the power to employ an agent to sell. Milligan v. Phipps, 153 Pa. 208, was a mechanic\u2019s lien for an improvement on a married woman\u2019s land. Evans v. Evans, 155 Pa. 572, decides only that personal property was a wife\u2019s and did not belong to her husband\u2019s creditors, even though she had bought it with borrowed money. Whether the loan was within her sphere of contracting power was not in the case, and, it not being shown to the contrary, it is presumed that it was. A horse, buggy and harness are doubtless necessaries on a farm. Packer v. Taylor, 2 Dist. R. 443, is an erroneous decision.\nJohn M. Groehring and S. Harvey Thompson, for appellee, not heal\u2019d. \u2014\nThe act of 1887 was clearly intended to bestow upon a married woman the power to acquire an estate: Real Est. Co. v. Roop, 132 Pa. 496 ; Adams v. Grey, 154 Pa. 258 ; Abell v. Chaffee, 154 Pa. 254.\nUnder the act of 1887, appellant had the power to purchase a residence property for'herself and family upon credit and to borrow money to pay for it, and having done so is liable.\nDec. 30, 1893 :"
