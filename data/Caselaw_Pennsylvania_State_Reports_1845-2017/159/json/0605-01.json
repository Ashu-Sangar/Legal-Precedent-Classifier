        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Green,\nIt must be confessed that the plaintiffs displayed but little wisdom in accepting the defendant\u2019s promises to pay them for excessive charges in his accounts, instead of corrections of the accounts by the decree of the auditing judge. But whether wise or unwise, the defendant\u2019s promise to pay whatever fee should be allowed to his counsel, out of his commissions, and that the estate should not be charged with any amount as a fee to his counsel, was in writing, and his- affidavits set forth no real defence to it. It is of no consequence to say that it was signed by him \u201c in the haste and excitement of the court room,\u201d and \u201c does not contain the agreement as he made it.\u201d Such allegations are totally insufficient to set aside written agreements. There is no allegation of fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, or that he was induced by any parol promise which was subsequently broken, to sign the agreement, and nothing short of such defences could be heard against the contract. We think the affidavits disclose no defence against this part of the claim.\nAs to the item $116.50 for excessive commissions charged in defendant\u2019s second account, he makes no defence at all except the general release subsequently asserted which will be presently considered.\nAs to the item of $173, it is \u2018founded upon a written order given by Boyd, defendant\u2019s counsel, on the defendant, for the payment of that amount of money out of the fees allowed him in the adjudication made by the orphans\u2019 court. The claim is only made upon the order, and not upon any promise of defendant to accept such an order, or any order, drawn by Boyd. It was never accepted by Daly and therefore he is not liable upon it as an order for the payment of money. Maginn v. Dollar Savings Bank, 131 Pa. 362; Hazleton Co. v. Improvement Co., 143 Pa. 581. As an equitable assignment of a fund it is of no avail against the affidavit of defence, which alleges that the acceptance was refused because Boyd was largely indebted to him. \u2022 We do not think it was necessary for the defendant to go into a minute specification of such indebtedness in an affidavit of defence, as the unaccepted order created no prima facie liability on Daly\u2019s part which he was bound to dispel by alleging a specific set-off. Any indebtedness from Boyd to him which did not leave the clear sum of $173 due to Boyd, would be a sufficient reason for refusing to accept, and as there is nothing on the record showing such air amount of indebtedness affirmatively, a denial of it is enough to carry the question to a jury, where the whole subject can be heard and determined.\nSo far as the alleged releases are concerned they amount to nothing, for several reasons, one of which is alone sufficient to demonstrate the inadequacy of their allegation. The alleged promises of the defendant to pay were outside of the balances determined by the accounts to be due to the heirs, and therefore any releases of such balances would be no reply to such promises. Moreover the affidavits do not annex any copies of the releases nor disclose their contents, nor do they give any particulars from which their applicability to the defendant\u2019s promises of payments can be determined.\nIt is not clear that judgment can be entered for the plaintiffs under the act of May 31, 1893, P. L. 185. That act only provides that judgment may be taken for such amounts of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as are admitted to be due, and that execution may issue for such admitted indebtedness, with a right to proceed to trial for the remainder of the claim. It was doubtless passed to settle all doubts upon that subject, as there were different opinions relating to it. But it would be inapplicable in this case because these affidavits do not admit anything to be due. While in our opinion they are insufficient as to two items of the claim, they are not admissions of the correctness of those items, and literally the case is not brought within the terms of the act. We feel obliged with some reluctance to reverse the judgment because of the situation as to the third item of the claim.\nJudgment reversed and procedendo awarded.",

Such a case is not brought literally within the terms of the act, namely, that the amounts are admitted to be due.\nArgued Jan. 15,1894.\nAppeal, No. 71, Jan. T., 1894, by defendant, Patrick K. Daly, from order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March T., 1893, No. 275, making absolute rule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence in favor of Mary G. Reilly et al., to use of Thomas D. McGlathery.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nRule for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defence.\nPlaintiff in his statement claimed to recover $440 under an agreement in writing entered into by defendant. He averred that defendant, as executor of Thomas Costigan, deceased, had charged excessive commissions in his account, and when his account was called for audit had agreed, in consideration of the distributees not asking for a surcharge, to pay his own counsel fees. The writing was as follows, signed by T. D. McGlathery and P. K. Daly: \u201cDaly will pay Boyd (his counsel) whatever fee the court allows him out of his amount of commissions allowed in the account, and the estate will not be charged with any amount as fee to Boyd.\u201d\nPlaintiff also averred that defendant had agreed to pay to the distributees $116.50, excess of lawful commissions, if they would not ask a surcharge.\nPlaintiff also claimed to recover $173 on the following order, signed by Henry M. Boyd, which plaintiff claimed defendant had accepted:\n\u201c Philadelphia, May 3, 1892, I hereby authorize and direct Patrick K. Daly, trustee of estate of Thomas Costigan, deceased, to pay Thomas D. McGlathery, attorney for heirs, $173, and charge and deduct this amount from fees allowed in the adjudication filed April 13, 1892.\u201d\nPlaintiff further averred in his statement that the distributees of the estate of Thomas Gostigan, deceased, had made an assignment to him for a valuable consideration of all their claims against defendant.\nDefendant averred in his affidavit of defence:\n\u201c That it is true he was the executor and trustee under the will of Thomas.Costigan, deceased, and filed his account in the orphans\u2019 court, which was audited, and the adjudication now remains of record in said court as plaintiffs aver, a copy of which they have failed to attach to their statement of claim.\n\u201c That it is untrue that defendant admitted that his commissions were excessive, and the questions of commissions and counsel fee were submitted to and passed upon by the orphans\u2019 court, defendant being represented by counsel.\n\u201c That any agreement made on his behalf by his counsel, Henry M. Boyd, Esq., (now deceased) to refund to the distributees of the estate of Thomas Costigan, deceased, as executor, was without consideration and beyond the scope of counsel\u2019s authority.\n\u201c That the agreement signed by defendant to pay Boyd\u2019s fee out of his commissions, while being without consideration, has been settled by the settlement and releases with the distributees hereinafter mentioned.\n\u201c That the adjudication of the orphans\u2019 court in the matter has -been confirmed absolutely and all the awards paid, excepting a balance with accrued interest amounting to $994.04, and a mortgage of $500 and one year\u2019s interest thereon, which was held by defendant, pending litigation between the distributees over matters arising immediately after the awards were made.\n\u201c That the defendant has paid and settled with all the plaintiffs, and has been released from all demands, except the above mentioned sum of $994.04 and the said mortgage of $500.\n\u201c That the litigation among the distributees has been settled, and the orphans\u2019 court, upon the petition of the use plaintiff, issued its writ of fieri facias against the defendant for the sum of $1,650, which, on June 24,1893, upon the application of defendant\u2019s counsel, joined therein by tbe use plaintiff as counsel for all the distributees of the said estate, was amended so that the same should issue for the said sum of $994.04, above mentioned, and on the same day that amount was paid to the sheriff of Philadelphia and so returned by him.\n\u201c That the above mentioned mortgage of $500 was assigned oy defendant to Catharine Gallagher, one of the distributees, pursuant to an arrangement made between all the parties to this suit.\n\u201c That the order of Henry M. Boyd upon defendant, dated May 3, 1892, for $173, was never accepted by the defendant; on the contrary, the said Boyd being largely indebted to him, he refused to accept and honor the same.\n\u201cThat the whole estate has been audited and settled by the orphans\u2019 court, and all awards paid and releases given to the defendant by all the plaintiffs, long prior to their assignment to the use plaintiff, except the balance paid to the sheriff upon the execution above mentioned.\nDefendant, in a supplemental affidavit of defence, averred :\n\u201c That he did not agree to pay to the distributees whatever fee was allowed his counsel by the orphans\u2019 court, as alleged in the statement filed; on the contrary, he was at the bar of the court and had no conversation with the distributees, but did to their counsel assent to the payment of so much of his counsel\u2019s fee as the orphans\u2019 court should deem excessive. That the memorandum signed by him was presented to him in the haste and excitement of the court room, and does not contain the agreement as he made it, nor was there any consideration for the same, except a threat to object to his commissions, which were not excessive, to wit: 2^ per centum upon $31,539.69, the proceeds of real estate. That the orphans\u2019 court did reduce defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s fee from $500 to $440; to wit, $60.00, which the defendant is ready to pay.\n\u201c That he has had and made a full settlement with all the distributees prior to their assignments to the plaintiff, and received from them releases of all demands due by him, except the sum of $2,800 (clerical error, should be $994.04), which was retained by him upon their express directions to pay orders given upon him by them, which sum has since been disbursed and paid, and full acquittance been given.\u201d\nThe court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, assessing the damages at $846.71.\nError assigned was order as above.\nAlbert P. Peterson, for appellant. \u2014\nAn averment, in an affidavit of defence, that words contrary to the express understanding and agreement of the defendant were inserted in an obligation, is sufficient to justify submission of case to jury: Ecoff v. Gillespie, 13 W. N. 564; Church v. Jones, 132 Pa. 462.\nWithout a written acceptance by defendant or his authorized agent, there could be no recovery against him upon the order: Act of May 10, 1881, \u00a7 1, P. L. 17; Maginn v. Bank, 131 Pa. 362.\nThe affidavit and supplemental affidavit aver facts which, if proved on the trial, would oblige plaintiff to give evidence, dehors the instruments sued upon. It has been held that such averments justify the submission of the case to a jury: Hutchison v. Boggs, 28 Pa. 294; Converse v. Colton, 49 Pa. 346; Thompson v. Clark, 56 Pa. 33; Kaster v. Welsh, 157 Pa. 590.\nJ. O. Stillwell, for appellees. \u2014\nAn affidavit of defence should aver distinctly every fact necessary to constitute a defence; nothing should be left to inference : Peck v. Jones, 70 Pa. 83.\nIt has been held that it is only when a chancellor would reform the instrument that parol evidence is admissible to contradict it, and the evidence must be clear, precise and indubitable : Murray v. R. R., 103 Pa. 37; Phillips v. Meily, 106 Pa. 536 ; Sylvius v. Kosek, 117 Pa. 67; Jenks v. Fritz, 7 W. & S. 201.\nA mistake has been defined to be \u201c that result of ignorance of law or fact, which has misled a person to do an act which, if he had not been in error, he would not have done: \u201d Bisph. Eq. \u00a7 ,185; Bruse v. Nelson, 35 Iowa, 160.\nA defendant should specifically state what the parol agreement is. He should state it so clearly that the court may decide whether it is not substantially the same as the writing: Fox v. Sheldrake, 1 Del. Co. R. 22; McBrier v. Marshall,. 126 Pa. 390; Johnson v. Blain, 126 Pa. 426; Ecoff v. Gillespie, 13 W. N. 564.\nAcceptance of the order was not necessary: Act of May 10, 1881, P. L. 17; Maginn v. Bank, 131 Pa. 362.\nAn equitable assignment of a part of a fund may be made Hazleton Co. v. Improvement Co., 143 Pa. 581.\nAn affidavit of defence must not be evasive: Lehman v. Jaquett, 5 W. N. 183.\nPayments and releases must be set out fully as to the dates, amounts, from and to and by whom made: McCracken v. Congregation, 111 Pa. 106; Blackwood v. Dean, 5 Lanc. L. R. 213; Hiestand v. Williamson, 128 Pa. 122. It is not sufficient to state that defendant has receipts for the money claimed: B. Association v. Phillips, 1 Luz. Leg. Rec. 104. Payments must be expressly stated to have been made on account of the claim in suit: Selden v. Bid. Assn., 81* Pa. 336. The consideration for the release must be shown: Kaufman v. Cooper Iron Co., 105 Pa. 537.\nIt is a fatal defect in an affidavit of defence to refer therein to a material paper which is accessible, without annexing a copy thereof, that the court may judge of the legal import of its terms: Erie City v. Butler, 120 Pa. 374.\nAn instrument of writing is within the affidavit of defence law, if it be for the payment of money as contra-distinguished from one for the performance of any collateral undertaking, though not exhibiting on its face a prima facie right in the plaintiff to recover, if supplemented with such averments of facts as, with the instrument itself, would warrant a verdict for plaintiff: Vulcanite Paving Co. v. Phila. Traction Co., 115 Pa. 280.\nThe practice act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, embraces not only such instruments for the payment of money as weye within the affidavit of defence law prior thereto, but also all actions sounding in contract: Bradley v. Potts, 2 Dist. R. 79.\nIt is respectfully suggested that, if the court is of the opinion that the affidavits present a sufficient defence to any of the plaintiffs\u2019 three items of claim, then the judgments entered in the case should be permitted to stand as to such items as to which the affidavits do not present a sufficient defence, and a venire awarded as to the former, only, under the provisions of the act of May 31, 1893, P. L. 185.\nFebruary 12, 1894:"
