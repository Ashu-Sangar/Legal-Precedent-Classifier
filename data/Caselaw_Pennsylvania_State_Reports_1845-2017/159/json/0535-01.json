For reasons given in that case, the court below erred in entering judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.\nJudgment reversed, and judgment now entered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff for four hundred and sixty-nine dollars and seventy cents, the amount found by the jury, with interest from date of the verdict,",
