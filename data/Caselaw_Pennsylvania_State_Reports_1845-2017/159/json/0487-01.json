The testimony is such as to leave no doubt as to the alleged negligence of the defendant. If- believed by the jury, as it doubtless was, they could not do otherwise than find that those who were charged with the duty of keeping the street in proper repair were grossly negligent. The case was clearly for the jury.\nThe only errors assigned are, the refusals of the learned trial judge to affirm defendant\u2019s points. The first of these asked binding instructions to find for defendant. To have affirmed that would have been plain error. The other two points were rightly refused. There is nothing in the record that would justify a reversal of the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Shaw v. Philadelphia, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Contributory negligence \u2014 Streets\u2014Municipalities.\nIn an action against a city to recover damages for personal injuries, it is proper to submit the case to the jury where the evidence for plaintiff tends to show that plaintiff was thrown from a wagon in which he was riding, by reason of the wheels of the wagon sinking into a deep rut in the street, and that the rut had been allowed to continue in the street for over a year.\nThat plaintiff knew of the condition of the street before he undertook to ride over it is not such contributory negligence as will prevent his recovery, where no other street was open for him to take.\nArgued Jan. 5, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 440, Jan. T., 1898, by defendant, from, judgment of C. P. No. 4, Philadelphia Co., June T., 1892, No. 367, on verdict for plaintiff, William Shaw.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Arnold, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that plaintiff was riding on a wagon (driven by another) along 52d street in Philadelphia, holding on boxes to be delivered at the railroad, when the wagon wheel went into a rut, the wheel veered over, and threw plaintiff off, injuring him. Evidence for plaintiff tended to show that the street' at the point where the accident occurred had been in bad condition for over a year; also that plaintiff knew its condition, but no other street was open for him to take.\nDefendant\u2019s points were as follows:\n\u201c 1. The jury should find for defendant.\u201d Refused. [1]\n\u201c 2. If the jury find that the plaintiff had just as full means of knowing the condition of the street as the city\u2019s highway inspector could have, and yet chose to take the risk unnecessarily of riding in the wagon, they must find for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [2]\n\u201c 3. If the jury find that another street was open to the driver of the vehicle in question, by Media street and Peach street, which he could have taken, they must find for the defendant.\u201d Refused. [8]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $2,000.\nErrors assigned were (1-3) refusal of defendant\u2019s points as above, quoting them.\nE. Spencer Miller, assistant city solicitor, Ohas. F.
