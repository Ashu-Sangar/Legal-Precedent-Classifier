    "head_matter": "Kerr\u2019s Estate. Commonwealth\u2019s Appeal.\nCollateral inheritance tax \u2014 Decedents' estates \u2014 Compromised claims.\nThe collateral inheritance tax cannot be imposed upon moneys paid to extinguish the title of persons claiming adversely to the decedent, or upon property surrendered by way of compromise to persons so claiming.\nTestatrix devised her estate to a friend, who died pending an issue devisavit vel non. The heirs of the devisee compromised with the contestants and surrendered a portion of the estate to them. Meld, that the property thus surrendered never formed a part of the devisee\u2019s estate, and was not liable as such to the collateral inheritance tax.\nArgued Jan. 12, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 10, Jan. T., 1894, by the Commonwealth, from decree of O. C. Phila. Co., April T., 1890, No. 101, on appeal from assessment of collateral inheritance tax, in estate of Mary J. Kerr, deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAppeal from assessment of collateral inheritance tax.\nFrom the record it appeared that Elizabeth S. Palmer died Sept. 25, 1886, leaving a will, which was duly admitted to probate, by which she left all her property to Mary Jane Kerr, a friend. The heirs at law and next of kin of Mrs. Palmer thereupon began proceedings to contest her will. Mrs. Kerr died in the meantime, and the contest was afterwards compromised, by her heirs at law and next of kin entering into an agreement by which they withdrew all claim to Mrs. Palmer\u2019s personalty and to one half of her realty. In assessing the collateral inheritance tax upon Mrs. Kerr\u2019s estate the register of wills declined to make any deduction by reason of the property surrendered under this agreement. From this decision E. R. Hallman, her administrator d. b. n., appealed.\nThe opinion of the court below was as follows, by Penbose, J.:\n\u201c Collateral inheritance tax can only be imposed in the cases specified by the statute, viz., upon real or personal estate passing at the death of the owner, \u2018 either by will or under the intestate laws of this state, or ... . transferred by deed, grant, bargain, or sale, made or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment after the death of the grantor or bargainer,\u2019 to the persons, etc., made subject to such tax.\n\u201cNo liberality of construction can extend the language .of the statute so as to make it include either moneys paid to extinguish the title of persons claiming adversely to the decedent whose estate is liable to taxation, or property surrendered by way of compromise to the persons so claiming, and thus never forming part of the decedent\u2019s estate at all. Such persons are neither legatees nor devisees, heirs or next of kin, nor are they grantees, etc., under assignments or transfers made or intended to take effect after the death of the bargainer. The allowance or compromise of their claims simply reduces the estate after-wards passing to volunteers, with the same effect as if the' reduction had been caused by the payment of debts, or as if the payment or surrender had been the result of a suit terminating in favor of the claimant.\n\u201c It was conceded at the argument that the tax was paid upon the entire estate of Elizabeth S. Palmer, the original testatrix ; and the question now presented only affects the tax chargeable against the estate of Mary J. Kerr, her residuary legatee and devisee. The validity of the will was impeached, and only so much of Elizabeth S. Palmer\u2019s estate as remained after the recognition of the rights of those who claimed under the intestate laws became the estate of her beneficiary. N> more than this is taxable as the estate of the latter.\n\u201c The appeal is sustained, and the appraisement for taxation corrected in accordance with this opinion.\u201d\nJError assigned was decree as above.\nHoward W. Page, S. Davis Page, H. P. Allinson, Bois Penrose and W. U. Hensel, attorney general, with him, for appellant. \u2014 -\nThe will once admitted to probate, the Palmer relatives must claim under and not against it, so long as the decree of the register admitting it to probate remains in force. By that decree Mrs. Kerr\u2019s title under the will, inchoate and imperfect up to that time, was perfected and related back to Mrs. Palmer\u2019s death, so that in contemplation of law she was seized of the realty and possessed of the personalty as of that date: Fuller\u2019s Case, 2 Story (U. S.) 327 ; 19 A. & E. Enc. L. 181; Shoemaker v. Walker, 2 S. & R. 555; Purd. Dig., 582, pi. 92; Ives v. Cress, 5 Pa. 121; Jones v. Patterson, 12 Pa. 153; Peeble\u2019s Ap., 15 S. & R. 39.\n-Since the passage of the act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 533, it has been held that the probate of a will, devising real estate, by the register of wills, is a judicial act, which cannot be impeached collaterally, and is conclusive upon all persons interested, unless contested within five years: Cochran v. Young, 104 Pa. 333; McCort\u2019s Ap., 98 Pa. 33 ; Wilson v. Gaston, 92 Pa. 207.\nNor can the decision of the register be reversed and set aside by the decision of the register of another county, even though the record fail to show jurisdictional facts : Shoenberger\u2019s Ap., 139 Pa. 132.\nUpon the question of seizin and devolution, Frank\u2019s Estate, 28 W. N. 323, a case decided by the orphans\u2019 court in 1891, not cited upon the argument below, is in point.\nThe fact that after the will had been admitted to probate, proceedings were taken in the orphans\u2019 court by the Palmer relatives to contest its validity, and an issue awarded to the common pleas, did not divest Mrs. Kerr\u2019s title, pending the determination of those proceedings: Westcott v. Edmunds, 68 Pa. 34.\nHad the payment been made pursuant to an agreement of compromise made by Mrs. Kerr in her lifetime we concede that it might well be regarded as a debt due from her estate, as suggested by the court below. Small\u2019s Est., 151 Pa. 1, is in point.\nJ. Rodman Paul, and Biddle Ward, for appellee,\nnot heard, cited: Neal\u2019s Est., 17 W. N. 192; South\u2019s Est., 2 W. N. 212; Stinger v. Com., 26 Pa. 429; Commonwealth\u2019s Ap., 34 Pa. 204; Reish v. Com., 106 Pa. 521; James\u2019s Est., 2 Del. Co. R. 164; Frank\u2019s Est., 28 W. N. 323; Orcutt\u2019s Ap., 97 Pa. 179; Strode v. Com., 52 Pa. 189.\nJanuary 22, 1894:"
