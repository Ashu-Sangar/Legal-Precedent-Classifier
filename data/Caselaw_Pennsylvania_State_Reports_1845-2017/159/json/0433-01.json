        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Dean,\nThe opinion in Cote v. Murphy et al., filed this day, decides this case also. There was no evidence of a combination to break down Buchanan in his business as a contractor or builder. The evidence showed a lawful combination of workmen engaged in the building trades, to advance wages, by demanding that in the future the employers pay for eight hours work the same wages that had theretofore been paid for nine hours. The defendants were members of an association of employers which by combination resisted this demand. This combination agreed among themselves they would not sell material to contractors who conceded the advance, would not do work of any kind for \"them. In pursuance of this agreement they refused to furnish material to plaintiff or to work for him, because, as they believed, he was aiding the striking workmen in their attempt by combination to advance the price of labor. There is no evidence of malice or intention to injure this plaintiff. If Kerr, one of defendants, as plaintiff alleged, at the trial, broke his contract to deliver him brick, then he has an action against him on the contract for damages. But the other defendants are not answerable for conspiracy because of such breach of contract by one of their number, when such breach of contract formed no part of the agreement or combination to resist a combination advance in wages.\nThe defendant\u2019s 4th prayer for instructions, which was refused, and which constitutes appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, that there was \u201c no evidence of a common purpose between any two or more of them to injure plaintiff,\u201d should have been affirmed.\nThe judgment is reversed at costs of appellee.",

    "head_matter": "Buchanan v. Kerr et al., Appellants.\nConspiracy \u2014 Combination of employers \u2014 Wages.\nIn a civil action for conspiracy where it appears that workmen engaged in building trades entered into a lawful combination to advance wages by reducing the hours of \"labor, and that defendants were members of an association of employers which by combination agreed among themselves that they would not sell material to contractors who conceded the advance, and induced other dealers not to furnish such material, defendants are not liable in damages to a person in the same business who aided the strike by selling materials to the strikers and contractors, and who by reason of the combination was not able to procure all of the material which he desired.\nIf one of the parties to such an agreement is guilty of a bi\u2019each of contract in refusing to furnish material, an action will lie against him for damages; but such breach of contract does not render the other parties liable for conspiracy, if such breach of contract formed no part of the agreement or combination to resist a combination to advance the price of labor.\nArgued Nov. 7, 1893.\nAppeal, No. 46, Oct.
