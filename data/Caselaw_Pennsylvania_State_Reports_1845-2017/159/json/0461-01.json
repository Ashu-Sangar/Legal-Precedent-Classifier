The son of defendant\u2019s testator, an employee of the firm, became a defaulter, and the firm obtained a judgment against him for the sum which he had appropriated. Prior to the defalcation, and at a time when the son was solvent, he conveyed certain real estate which he owned to his wife, subject to a building association mortgage. After the defalcation, but before judgment was obtained by the firm, the son and his wife executed a mortgage to defendant\u2019s testator on the same property. Subsequently, and after the judgment was entered against the son, the building association proceeded on its mortgage and the real estate covered by it was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and bought in by defendant\u2019s testator to protect his mortgage. The sale discharged the lien of the firm\u2019s judgment. Held, that defendant\u2019s testator had the right to purchase the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and take title thereto clear of any trust in favor of the firm.\nArgued Jan. 3, 1894.\nAppeal, No. 369, Jan. T., 1894, by plaintiff, Bonaparte Shoe, surviving partner of the firm of Shoe & Chard, from decree of C. P. No. 1, Phila., March T., 1890, dismissing bill in equity against Eugene Ziegler, executor of William Chard, Sr., deceased.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nBill for account of rents and profits of real estate.\nThe master reported the facts as follows:\n\u201c This suit was commenced by a bill filed by Bonaparte Shoe, surviving partner of the firm of Shoe & Chard, against Eugene Ziegler, \u2018 executor of the estate of William Chard, Sr., deceased,\u2019 which decedent was the other partner, praying that certain real estate, to wit, the premises Nos. 1908,1910 and 1912 Mercer street, in this city, be decreed partnership assets, and that an account of the rents thereof be stated, a receiver appointed, an order of sale of said premises made, and the proceeds of such sale distributed as partnership assets, and that an injunction be granted, staying any sale mortgaging or incumbering said property. Although the plaintiff failed to prove some of the averments in his bill, there was little real dispute as to most of his allegations.\n\u201c The master finds as follows : Bonaparte Shoe and William Chard, Sr., were in partnership for a number of years, carrying on the business of repairing vessels, at Camden, N. J., until July, 1885, when the affairs of the firm were wound up.\n\u201c At the beginning of the year 1880, they took into their employment William Chard, Jr., who was a son of one of the partners, and who, for some time afterward, occupied a position of responsibility and trust with the firm. Prior to his said employment, on August 23,1879, William Chard, Jr., had purchased the premises in question, the deed therefor having been recorded August 25, 1879.\n\u201c He obtained a loan from the Richmond Mutual Building Association, and executed a mortgage to them for $1,600 which is dated Jan. 24,1880, and was forthwith recorded; a bond of indemnity in $300 ivas also given at the same time to secure said loan. On Feb. 5, 1880, the said premises were conveyed by William Chard, Jr., and wife, to Charles F. McCoy, who the same day conveyed them to Mary E. Chard, wife of William Chard, Jr.; both of these deeds were _ duly recorded.\n\u201cIn the month of July, 1883, William Chard, Jr., was discharged from the employment of the firm, having been charged with embezzlement, and on August 26, 1883, he was arrested. On Oct. 2, 1883, an action was commenced by a capias in the Court of Common Pleas No. 4, of this county, to Sept. T., 1883, No. 334, by the firm of Shoe & Chard, against William Chard, Jr., to recover the moneys appropriated by the latter. On Feb. 27, 1884, William Chard, Jr., was tried in Camden county, New Jersey, for embezzlement, and the jury disagreed.\n\u201c On May 22, 1884, William Chard, Jr., and Mary E., his wife, executed a mortgage to William Chard, Sr., to secure the sum of $500, money advanced or loaned by the father to the son, stated by one witness to be for the payment of counsel fees in the criminal proceedings in New Jersey against the son, by another witness for the payment of the fines of $500 imposed by the Camden court. There is no evidence that this was not given for valuable consideration, and that it represented a like sum advanced or loaned by the father to the son.\n\u201c On June 24,1884, William Chard, Jr., was again tried in Camden county, and convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of $500.\n\u201c On May 10, 1886, a verdict for $3,000 was obtained in the action in Court of Common Pleas, No. 4, above referred to, by the firm of Shoe & Chard, against William Chard, Jr.\n\u201c On September 30,1886, the building association commenced proceedings on the mortgage, and on December 6th of the same year, the premises were sold under said proceedings, at sheriff\u2019s sale, to William Chard, Sr., for $1,450, to whom the sheriff conveyed them.\n\u201c On December 17, 1888, WiHiam Chard, Sr., died, having made a will, dated January 21, 1886, in which he devised the residue of his estate to his executors, exonerated his children from advancements made them, and directed his executors to invest the sum of $6,000 and pay the interest thereof, clear of all debts, etc., to his son, William Chard, Jr., during life, this being the only interest which the son has under said will.\n\u201c On January 13, 1890, an attachment execution was issued in said action in Common Pleas, No. 4, against money in hands of the executors of said will belonging to William Chard, Jr.\u201d\nThe master found that the bill was without equity and should be dismissed.\nExceptions to the master\u2019s report were dismissed.\nError assigned was dismissal of exceptions and confirmation of report, not quoting exceptions.\nHenry R.
