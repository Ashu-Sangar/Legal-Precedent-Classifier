    <p id="AMX" data-blocks='[["BL_306.9",306,[262,1142,1158,1121]]]'>Testator, in his lifetime, was a depositor in the Aldine Trust Company, and at his death there was standing to his credit, in two accounts, the sum of $6,711.89. These his ancillary executor withdrew, and deposited the amounts thus obtained in two new accounts, which he opened in the same company, as “ancillary executor of the estate” of testator. Prom time to time deposits were made in these accounts by the ancillary executor, and cheeks were drawn thereupon. Subsequently the trust company failed, and the secretary of banking took possession of it and its assets. At the audit of the account of the ancillary executor, the secretary of banking made a claim for $16,000, the amount of a demand note signed by testator, and the ancillary executor sought to set off thereagainst the sum of $6,246.83, which was the balance standing to the credit of the estate in the two deposit accounts. The auditing judge refused to allow the set-off; the court in banc sustained the_andllary executor’s exceptions and allowed the set-off, and the secretary of banking thereupon took this appeal. The decree must be affirmed., 1</p>
    <p id="b306-7" data-blocks='[["BL_306.10",306,[265,2284,1146,100]],["BL_307.1",307,[181,327,1152,361]]]'>In his brief, appellant says: “It is admittéd for the sake of argument that an executor representing a de<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>ceased, succeeds to his obligations and to his rights. It is also admitted for the sake of argument that ordinarily a depositor is entitled to a set-off of his deposit against any claim made by the bank.” Under the authorities in this State, we can eliminate the twice-repeated “for the sake of argument,” and find that what is left is the settled law here.</p>
    <p id="b307-5" data-blocks='[["BL_307.4",307,[163,709,1170,587]]]'>It is first objected by appellant that, if the set-off is allowed, inequity will probably result, because the estate will get the full amount of its deposit, whereas the other depositors may get but a fraction of theirs. This is true; but the inequity, if any, will be precisely the same as would have been the case if testator had lived and been allowed the set-off, or as it is in the case of every other living depositor making a like claim. Admittedly, any-1 one in either of the classes last referred to, could enforce the right of set-off. See Fisher, Commissioner of Banking, v. Davis, <a href="/pa/278/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="278 Pa. 129" data-case-ids="1080579" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0129-01">278 Pa. 129</a>.</p>
    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.5",307,[177,1308,1156,641]]]'>It is next objected that mutuality of claim is an essential element in all matters of set-off, while here, it is mistakenly asserted, there is no mutuality, since the claim of the secretary of banking is against testator, and the set-off allowed is by' the éxecutor. In both fact and law, however, the claim of the secretary, as presented on the settlement of the account, is against the estate of the testator, in the hands of the ancillary executor, and the set-off is urged by the estate of the testator, in.the hands of the ancillary executor. A brief reference to our authorities will show how mistaken is appellant’s claim on this point.</p>

The reason for the disallowance, though this is immaterial, is generally stated to be <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>that the executor or administrator could sue individually for the price agreed to be paid to him for the assets he sold, and hence the claim and the attempted set-off are in different rights.</p>
