Kessler was seated on the front seat of a truck which he owned and which was being operated along the Frankstown Road, Johnstown, by his employee under his direction. Plaintiffs claim that the truck was negligently operated and by reason thereof it crashed into and demolished certain buildings of the plaintiffs and that it also inflicted personal injuries on Frank Wiesheier, one of the plaintiffs. The accident also caused the death of defendant’s intestate, Harry A. Kessler, and the defendant was duly appointed by the Register of Wills of Philadelphia County administrator <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>of Kessler’s estate. Both Kessler and defendant resided in Philadelphia. A summons in trespass against the administrator was issued in Cambria County and the writ was served on defendant in Philadelphia County by the sheriff thereof who had been deputized for that purpose by the sheriff of Cambria County under the Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 751. In defendant’s petition to show cause why the service should not be set aside, he sets forth that the court acquired no jurisdiction over him by the service because the Act of Assembly under which service was attempted “does not provide for service upon a nonresident administrator of a decedent, there being no allegation that the administrator was concerned or connected in any manner with the accident out of which the action arose.” Plaintiffs filed an answer admitting the allegations as to the manner of service but denying that the service was invalid.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[285,1246,1150,693]]]'>The Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 751, 812, section 1208, provides, inter alia: “Civil actions for damages. All civil actions for damages, arising from the use and operation of any vehicle, may......be brought......in the county wherein the alleged damages were sustained ......in the court of common pleas of said county, and service of process......may be made by the sheriff of the county where the suit is brought deputizing the sheriff of the county wherein the defendant or his registered agent resides, or where service may be had upon him under the existing laws of this Commonwealth, in like manner as process may now be served in the proper county......”</p>

Kessler in Philadelphia during his lifetime. At common law the action would not have survived his death.

Section 35 (b) of the Fiduciaries Act of June <em>7, </em>1917, P. L. 447, 20 P. S., section 772, provides-: “Executors or administrators shall have power, either alone or jointly with other plaintiffs, to commence and prosecute all actions for mesne profits or for trespass to real property, and all personal actions which the decedent whom they represent might have commenced and prosecuted except actions for slander and for libels; and they shall be liable to be sued, either alone or jointly with other defendants, in any such action, except as aforesaid, which might have been maintained against such decedent if he had lived.

However, that case refers to suits <em>by </em>fiduciaries, whereas the case before us is a suit <em>against </em>a fiduciary, and the Fiduciaries Act not only authorizes suits against fiduciaries, but the title thereof expressly refers to “suits against fiduciaries.” Considering the Fiduciaries Act together with the Act of June 22, 1931, supra, we have a legislative warrant both for making an executor or administrator a defendant in an action such as that under discussion, and also for the service of the resulting process on him in the county wherein he resides. Plaintiff was within his legal rights in demanding from Joseph A. Kessler, Administrator of the Estate of Harry A. Kessler, satisfaction for the injury alleged to have been done him (the plaintiff) by the intestate, Harry A. Kessler, and having <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>thus legally fixed upon the administrator the status of a defendant, he (the plaintiff) was entitled under the Act of 1931 to have service of process made by the sheriff of the county where the suit is brought deputizing the sheriff of Philadelphia County wherein the defendant resides to serve that defendant, to wit, Joseph A. Kessler, Administrator.</p>

L. 905, 997 (reenacted in section 1208 of the Act of 1931, supra), “was an enlarging not a restricting-act.” The vast amount of traveling in late years done by persons in automobiles and the numerous injuries inflicted by motor vehicles operated by such itinerants has made it the policy of the law, as evidenced in recent statutes and decisions, to bring tortfeasors who are nonresidents of the county in which ■torts are committed by them within the jurisdiction of the courts of those counties. To give the statute under consideration complete effect in all cases we must hold that when the alleged tort-feasor dies before suit is brought, service of process may be made upon his administrator or executor in the county in which the latter resides.</p>

In proceeding against them for torts, even property belonging to them cannot be reached by process, and in cases of contract nothing but the property can be affected unless the defendants voluntarily appear and submit to the jurisdiction. We may congratulate ourselves that such has been the policy, for nothing can be more unjust than to drag a man thousands of miles, perhaps from a distant state, and in effect compel him to appear and defend under, the penalty of a judgment or decree against him pro eonfesso.”</p>
