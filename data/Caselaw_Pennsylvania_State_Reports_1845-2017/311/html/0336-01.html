The argument confuses the relations of the bond and mortgage. Properly understood, a bond and mortgage, though given in a single transaction, are more than a single security and have always been so regarded. In Meigs v. Bunting, <a href="/pa/141/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="141 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="974920" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0233-01">141 Pa. 233</a>, 239, <a href="/citations/?q=21%20A.%20588" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="21 A. 588">21 A. 588</a>, we said, “A bond and mortgage are <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>distinct and separate securities, though for the same debt......and the satisfaction of one security will not in fact be satisfaction of the other, unless the parties so intend, or the debt be actually paid: Fleming v.

Examination of the history of the time will reveal that the word was not intended to include a bond accompanying a conveyance of the land in mortgage for the obvious reason that the mortgage may stand alone as the investment. “Bonds and stock of any private corporation» were investments of the class generally known as personal securities in contrast with investments in real estate, or real securities, a term that, in 1873, had been familiar for more than 100 years. In Attorney General v. Bowles, 3 Atk. 806, 26 Eng. Rep. 1260, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke said “......but here, the money is not only directed to be laid out in land, but in some real security. I can take these words only in the common sense and acceptation; for there is a known established distinction in this court between government and real securities, and the latter means mortgages or other encumbrances affecting land. The word ‘real’ is a term adopted in the law, and can never be understood in any other sense than landed securities;......’’ In Hemphill’s Est., <a href="/pa/18/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="18 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="969080" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0303-01">18 Pa. 303</a>, the same distinction was recognized, and in Com. ex rel. v.

By section 14 of the Act of March 29, 1832, P. L. 190, fiduciaries were authorized, with the approval of the Orphans’ Court, to invest in specified public obligations,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">*</a> “or on real securities”; by section 2 of the Act of April 13, 1854, P. L. 369, they were authorized “to invest trust moneys in ground rents or other real estate by leave of the proper court.” It appears not to have been until 1870, that the field of investment was enlarged to include personal securities of corporations. For then, by Act of April 1, 1870, P. L. 45, the provisions of section 14 of the Act of 1832, supra, were extended to include bonds of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company secured by its general mortgage of July 1, 1867; by an Act of March 29, 1872, P. L. 31, to the general mortgage bonds of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company; by an Act of April 3,1872, P. L. 833, to the general mortgage bonds of the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company, and, by the Act of April 4, 1873, P. L. 59, to bonds issued by the Pennsylvania Railroad .Company under an Act of February 7,1873. The necessity for this enlargement is legislative recognition that bonds of the kind specified in these statutes were not real securities as defined for purposes of the classification referred to, for if they had been, the legislation would have been unnecessary. The effect of this radical change in economic policy became the subject of serious discussion in the constitutional convention of 1873 (De<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>bates: volume <em>2, </em>page 744 et seq., volume 5, page 293 et seq.) and was ultimately reflected in the prohibition on future legislation contained in article III, section 22. It is to be noted that by the Acts of 1832 and 1854, supra, the right to invest in real securities was general, and not limited to mortgages by individuals. The corporate mortgage, made as in this case, is as completely a real security as the mortgage of an individual. Section 22 does not in terms deny power to authorize investment in real securities given by corporations, and there is nothing to indicate intention to change the policy of the law theretofore existing as respects trust investment in real securities, nothing to show thát it was intended to operate differently on the mortgage of a given tract of land if given by a corporate owner of the tract direct to the mortgagee than if the same mortgage were made by an individual owner. On the contrary, the bonds and stock that are condemned as trust investments are of the class designated as personal securities, of which those mentioned were well-known examples.</p>
