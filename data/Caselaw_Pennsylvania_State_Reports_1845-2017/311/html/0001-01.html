(4) That it was not alleged that plaintiff had supplied vouchers to defendant and the averment in the statement of claim that Ockman, Haberman and Company had “arbitrarily refused to supply” them was not sufficient to excuse this omission and to warrant recovery.</p>

      <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>This brings us to a consideration of the meaning of the contract. Was it one of absolute guaranty of payment when plaintiff had performed, as plaintiff contends, or was it one of mere paymastership when funds were in its hands, as defendant alleges? At the outset, it should be observed that defendant’s undertaking with plaintiff was executed for a consideration paid by the latter. The defendant was a paid surety. What it guaranteed to plaintiff was payment of the sums due for materials furnished to the Ockman Company “out of the moneys due” and owing to it under the contract with Arey-Hauser Company. The language used is not at all susceptible of the meaning that payment was guaranteed solely out of money which should come into defendant’s hands — that its only obligation was that of a mere paymaster. The phrase in the contracts “when and as the same shall become due and payable out of the moneys due” obviously refers to the time when defendant may be called upon to make good its guaranty, not to the funds out of which it is to pay.</p>
    <p id="b31-3" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[171,1420,1154,964]],["BL_32.1",32,[279,323,1145,207]]]'>As to the verbal agreement set up by defendant, that it was agreed between Ockman, Haberman and Company, the plaintiff and the defendant, that “the vouchers, as presented, should be paid out of moneys when collected by defendant from Arey-Hauser Company...... which funds had been assigned by Ockman, Haberman and Company to defendant,” it is sufficient to say as the learned judge below stated in his opinion, “Such an agreement is at utter variance with the writing and would destroy its effect and value. It would transform a contract guaranteeing payment by a debtor into a mere promise to pay when and if the promisor should be provided by the debtor with funds. It would reduce the defendant’s obligation from that of a guarantor of payment to that of a paymaster, with no duty but to pass along money when received from the party primarily liable.” For this ruling reliance was properly placed on our line of cases of which Gianni v.
