In the course of his employment and at or before 10:30 a. m. that day plaintiff went up on the flat roof of a building which adjoins the Penman Building on the <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>south and which is owned by one Thomas Tiddy, in order to repair a rainspout under the eaves.</p>
    <p id="b416-4" data-blocks='[["BL_416.4",416,[269,447,1152,750]]]'>Defendant at that time maintained a line of poles and Avires along the east side of Pear Street. One of the poles stood near the junction of the Penman and Tiddy Buildings. On this pole there were two pairs of cross-arms extending east and west, the lower extending over the roof of the Tiddy house. Just beloAV this lower arm and at the edge of the roof was a fuse box the top of Avhich was from eighteen to twenty-four inches above the roof. On the upper cross-arms were strung high tension wires carrying 4,000 volts while Ioav tension wires carrying 110 to 220 volts were strung on the street side of the lower cross-arms. On the street side of the pole there was a transformer. A neutral wire extended from the high tension wires down into the fuse box.</p>

A witness for defendant testified that current could pass through the fuse box Avithout blowing the fuse if that current was not of sufficiently high voltage to blow it.

He then became unconscious and fell to the street below, a distance of about twenty-five feet. He was taken to the hospital where he later regained consciousness. • He suffered burns at the base of the spine, on the hands, and behind his left ear, in addition tó a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. A physician testified that when he arrived at the scene of the accident to render first aid to the plaintiff, he noticed a perceptible odor of burnt flesh.</p>

Mrs. Muldowney testified that she “saw a man” standing on the cross-bar of the pole near the wires at about 9:10 A. M. on the day of the accident. She said, “The day was raining and the wind was blowing,” and the man “was sort of bent over toward the building.” Her son gave similar testimony, but neither of them could identify plaintiff as the man they saw. It was the contention of the defense that the man these witnesses saw was plaintiff and that the burn at the base of the spine was received because he was on the pole and not on the roof at the time of contact and that the fuse box was not charged with electricity at the time plaintiff says it was.</p>

It was for the jury to say whether the defendant took every precaution suggested by experience and the known dangers of electricity to prevent injuries to persons who might lawfully be near this fuse box.

There was no “defective insulation” of wires to be observed by anybody. Plaintiff had no reason to apprehend that a box which he saw before him would transmit into him a current of electricity if he came in contact with it. This court held in Yeager v. Edison Electric Co., <a href="/pa/242/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="242 Pa. 101" data-case-ids="998801" data-case-paths="/pa/242/0101-01">242 Pa. 101</a>, 104, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20872" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="88 A. 872">88 A. 872</a>, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Potter: “One who is brought by his employment in close proximity to electric wires which are apparently insulated, can not be fairly charged with contributory. negligence in coming in contact with the wires, unless the contact was the result of heedlessness, or of <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>his own lack of proper precautions for his safety.” The question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence was clearly a question for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b421-3" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[189,500,1153,751]]]'>It was also a question for the jury as to whether there was any interruption of current in defendant’s line at or about the time of plaintiff’s injury. It was testified in this case that the fuse box became charged with electricity only when there was an interruption of current by breaking defendant’s line or otherwise. As to whether there was interruption the evidence is conflicting. The testimony of plaintiff’s witnesses, while not direct and positive on that fact in issue, furnished, if credited, facts from which there could legitimately be inferred that there had been an interruption of current in defendant’s line at or about the time plaintiff received the shock about which he complains. This testimony was all for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b421-4" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[191,1264,1154,643]]]'>Complaint is made of the admission of testimony that there ivas no warning sign on the fuse box. Plaintiff in his statement set forth that the defendant company failed to provide any warning or signal that the “safety switch box and other appliances were dangerous and that electric current was passing in and through the same.” Evidence of there being no such warning was admissible in support of this averment, and was also ad-' missible as showing the circumstances immediately surrounding the act in question. These are álways admissible as part of the res gestae. See 11 Encyclopedia of Evidence, page 391.</p>
    <p id="b421-5" data-blocks='[["BL_421.6",421,[192,1918,1154,478]],["BL_422.1",422,[264,331,1147,90]]]'>Complaint is also made of the admission of testimony that the fuse box was not installed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the National Electrical Code as taken from the National Electric Light Association Safety Code. As the record stood, this testimony was of minimal importance, and though it was not the way to prove usage (see Albus v. Toomey, <a href="/pa/273/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="273 Pa. 303" data-case-ids="1070756" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0303-01">273 Pa. 303</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=116%20A.%20917" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="116 A. 917">116 A. 917</a>), its admission was not reversible error. Plaintiff in this case was under no obligation to prove that de<a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>fendant had departed from ordinary usage in the maintenance and, location of its fuse box.</p>
    <p id="b422-4" data-blocks='[["BL_422.4",422,[257,440,1156,1725]]]'>Appellant argues that “the unbending test of .negligence in methods, machinery and appliances is the ordinary usage of the business,” and that “no deviation by the defendant from any standard observed by those engaged in the same business was shown in this case. There is absolutely no competent testimony in this case that the equipment of the defendant or the construction of the equipment was not in accordance with the ordinary usage in the business.” Usage becomes important only when the conduct in question is not inherently dangerous. Vigilance must, always be commensurate with danger. A high degree of danger always calls for a high degree of care. The care to be exercised in a particular case must always be proportionate to the seriousness of the consequences which are reasonably to be anticipated as a result of the conduct in question. Reason does not have to wait on usage; the latter must wait on reason. Ordinary common sense dictates that if in a harmless looking box there is something lurking that would kill or injure anyone touching that box, the latter must be so situated, if it is possible or reasonably practicable to do so, that persons are not likely to come in contact with it. If the box must be placed where persons are likely to come in contact with it, there should be adequate warning given of its dangerous character. As this court said [referring to steam locomotives], in an opinion by Mr. Justice Agnew in The Frankford &amp; Bristol Turnpike Co. v. The Phila. &amp; Trenton R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/54/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="54 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1006354" data-case-paths="/pa/54/0345-01">54 Pa. 345</a>, 350: “It is the duty of those who use these hazardous agencies to control them carefully, to adopt every known safeguard, and to avail themselves from time to time to every approved invention to lessen their danger to others.”</p>

Customary methods or conduct do not furnish a test which is conclusive or controlling on the question of negligence, or fix a standard by which negligence is to be gaged. The standard of due care is such care as a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances of the particular case, and conformity to customary or usual conduct or methods cannot amount to more than a circumstance to be considered together with other circumstances of. the case in determining whether due care has been exercised: 45 C. J., page 707, section 87.</p>
