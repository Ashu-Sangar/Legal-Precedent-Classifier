Fluke and James H. O’Rorke, trading as The Home Realty Company, a dwelling house in Altoona for $6,000. Of this sum $2,261.14 was paid in cash on the execution of the agreement. The balance $3,738.86 was <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>to be paid in monthly installments of $35 each, with interest on deferred payments. The legal title was in Fluke. On October 8th of the same year, the purchasers entered into open, exclusive and notorious possession of the premises and occupied it as a dwelling house, residing in it from that time until the present time. Monthly payments were being duly made when in 1925, Fluke, the vendor, gave a mortgage for $3,000 to the Seaboard Company. It was recorded in January of that year. At the same time, he gave another mortgage for $700 to the Finance Company. It was recorded the same day as the Seaboard mortgage. In December, 1926, Kinch and wife borrowed $4,000 from John C. Peightal and gave a mortgage on the premises as security. With this money, the balance of the purchase money due the vendor was paid. A deed was executed at the same time from Fluke to the appellants. When the purchase price was paid, Kinch and his wife knew nothing of the execution of the two mortgages; neither the Seaboard Company nor the Finance Company made any inquiry as to the condition of Fluke’s title by reason of the occupancy of the premises by the appellants.</p>

The attorney took up the matter with Peightal. He agreed to make the loan provided he, Peightal, was allowed a commission of $200 for making the loan. When the attorney searched the record for mortgages and other liens, he discovered the two mortgages, but decided the mortgages were not against the land in question, and did not report them to the mortgagees. The loan was made and the commission paid to the attorney, who retained $50 from it and remitted $150 to Peightal.</p>

The court below found that the recording of the mortgages to the Seaboard and Finance Companies between the time of the execution of the agreement and the execution of the deed, was constructive notice of these liens to Kinch and his wife, the appellants. In addition, the court found that the latter had actual notice of these mortgages through the knowledge their attorney had after searching the record.

It has been stated that where a vendor sells lands by articles of agreement, a subsequent judgment against the vendor binds the legal estate in the vendor but only to the value of the unpaid purchase money: Brooke v.

Reed, 16 S. &amp; R. 265. As it has been otherwise stated: a judgment against the vendor of land retaining legal title is not so much a lien on the legal title as it is on the unpaid purchase money.- These statements of the law are broader than the cases there mentioned will sustain for they omit any mention of notice to the vendee. The question here involved is whether the recording of a mortgage against the vendor’s interest is constructive notice of the lien of that mortgage <em>to vendees in possession </em>under an agreement of sale.</p>

It is sometimes said “that the record of a deed [or mortgage] is constructive notice to all the world.” That, it is evident, is too broad and unqualified an enunciation of the doctrine. Recording is constructive notice only to those who are bound to search for it: <em>subsequent </em>purchasers and mortgagees, and, perhaps, all others who deal with or on the credit of the title, in the line of which the recorded deed [or mortgage] belongs: Maul v. Rider, <a href="/pa/59/0167-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="59 Pa. 167" data-case-ids="426979" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0167-01">59 Pa. 167</a>, 171; Bank v.

In order to complete the assignee’s right with respect to such an assignment, the law requires actual notice be given to the mortgagor of the assignment.

To do so would impose too great a burden on the mortgagor. Actual notice must be given to the mortgagor of the assignment.</p>

The mortgagee has ample opportu<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>nity to ascertain the state of the possessor’s title, the amount of purchase money due the mortgagor;, and is given ample opportunity to effectuate his lien by notifying the vendee under articles of his mortgage or judgment. We can readily see where land is sold by articles of agreement and the purchaser does not go into possession, that his subsequent payment of purchase money to the vendor must be at his peril if judgments or mortgages have been entered in the interim. Such lien holders have no means of information (apart from actual notice) that the mortgagor or judgment debtor has parted with his title. The rule must be otherwise as to the sale of land under articles of agreement where possession is taken thereunder and held openly, continuously and notoriously. The opportunity is then afforded to the mortgagee of completing his lien by actual notice to the vendee in possession. We, therefore, conclude that the recording of a mortgage or docketing of a judgment is not constructive notice of a lien on land to a vendee then in possession under an agreement of sale. The mortgage operates as an assignment of the balance of the purchase money due but actual notice is required to make it effective. In other words, the lien of a mortgage or judgment, whether or not recorded or docketed, on the unpaid purchase money due from a vendee of land in possession under an agreement of sale, is not effective so as to require payment of the unpaid purchase money to the mortgagee or holder of the judgment unless actual notice of such mortgage or judgment has been given to the vendee in possession.</p>

In Brooks v. Bordner, <a href="/pa/125/0470-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="125 Pa. 470" data-case-ids="563965" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0470-01">supra,</a> the court reached the conclusion which we do in the instant case as to the effect of vendee’s possession. The effect of recording the mortgage as notice to the vendee was not considered. Moreover, the result of the case was to substitute a different person to receive the purchase money due. In McMullen v. Wenner, 16 S. &amp; R. 17, there was nothing to show vendee’s possession when the judgment was entered. No notice of vendee’s interest was given and nothing had been paid when the agreement for the purchase of the land was made. When the deed was delivered and the bonds were given in payment for the land, the judgment of record then indicated the state- of vendor’s title; vendees were affected with notice of the title, and were under a duty to protect themselves against it; but in the instant case, the possession of the vendees was the equivalent of recording for the purposes of notice so that they had no reason to search the record when they made their payments, provided it had been clear at the time they entered into possession under their agreement to purchase.

Dennis, <a href="/pa/303/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="303 Pa. 72" data-case-ids="1129993" data-case-paths="/pa/303/0072-01">303 Pa. 72</a>, 77, the court said: “A principal is not affected with notice, actual or constructive, where the acts complained of consist of independent and unrelated acts outside the usual scope of the agency.” In Hertzler v.

Upon examination of the record, we find that the attorney had no knowledge or notice of the existence of these two mortgages as liens on this particular land. He was asked the question and it was not contradicted: “Q. You say now that you didn’t know of the existence of any lien or encumbrances or mortgages on this Kinch property when you made the examination? A. Yes. That is what I stated to you. Q. And you have now just put on the record your statement ‘ that you didn’t have any knowledge of the mortgage of the Seaboard Insurance Company of $3,000 and the mortgage of the Finance Company of America of $700? A. No. I will explain that this way. I had knowledge of these two mortgages but did not have knowledge of the fact that they were liens of this property. Q. Then you were mistaken in the liens on this property? A. I was mis<a id="p414" href="#p414" data-label="414" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*414</a>taken in the two descriptions in these two mortgages. That they were not identical with the description in the deed. Q. Did you make any effort to determine whether the two descriptions embraced in these two mortgages were the same as the property which was conveyed by Fluke tó Kincli? A. I made my examination as I always do. I got the list of the mortgages against the person in the title. And then the description in the mortgage and if I believe they are not liens against the property I check them off. That is what I did here. Q. How long after this loan of Peiglital’s was closed did you find that these two mortgages covered the Kindi property? A. Not until Mr. Kobert Hare came up to the office and informed me. Q. That was the first information you had? A. Yes. That was the first I had. Q. That was how long after the date of the Peiglital mortgage? A. I will go the other way. I think that was possibly a year ago, as near as I can recollect. Q. Approximately four years after the date of the Peiglital mortgage? A. That was about the time. The Peiglital mortgage was in 1926.”</p>

A principal is not to be affected with knowledge of his agent unless his agent has, or could have had within his duty, the knowledge with which it is sought to affect him: if the agent did not know, then, of course, his principal could not know.</p>
