Charles Lafferty,.by Ms will of 1875, created a residuary estate that was to endure for the life of Ms surviving children and until the youngest grandchild living at the death of his surviving child, reached twenty-one. During this period the income was to be paid to his children <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>with remainders over! The. disposition of this income after the death of certain children has often brought this will before the courts for consideration. In 1901 after Francis Lafferty’s death, Judge Ashman passed on the disputed items of the will in the adjudication of the 14th account. Under Judge Ashman’s decree the income arising through Francis Lafferty’s share was given to the executor and trustee, thus recognizing the validity of the second wife’s claim. When the 15th account came on for adjudication, Judge AshmAn changed his mind and. awarded the income to the guardian of the children, and by so doing decided, that this wife had no share in the estate. On exceptions, the court in banc, in an opinion by Judge Penrose, reversed this order, recognizing the claim of the second Mrs. Carr. This action was affirmed by this court on appeal. See Lafferty’s Est., <a href="/pa/209/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="209 Pa. 44" data-case-ids="936253" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0044-01">209 Pa. 44</a>.</p>

To summarize their positions: the issue can be determined only when the general trust terminates. The effect of such a conclusion is that the limitation over may carry a child’s share to more remote issue than grandchildren of testator. Appellants also contend that as the former litigation concerned income, appellants are not bound by it, nor does it control because appellants have never had their day in court. If they have had, say appellants, the decisions are wrong.</p>

It gives to the executors the residue of the estate to hold until the last surviving <em>child </em>dies, and thereafter until the youngest grandchild living at the decease of the surviving child shall or should arrive at lawful age if living. The executors are directed to collect the income and pay it in annuities, one-sixth of the net income to each child. These annuities could not be assigned or anticipated, nor were they liable for debts, contracts, or engagements, nor to attachment and execution. There is nothing in this item that limits or controls the remainders that may be created thereafter, nor is there any reference or intimation therein that remainder interests are in the issue living when the trust <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>terminates. Nothing therein suggests testator intended to exclude the immediate offspring of his own children, living at the deaths of such children, simply because such grandchildren, or other offspring then living, might die during the continuance of the trust; or, as Chief Justice Paxson says in Wengerd’s Est., <a href="/pa/143/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="143 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="978531" data-case-paths="/pa/143/0615-01">143 Pa. 615</a>, 621, to exclude “by the mere accident of his death the day before the money was distributed.” Item 5 having designated the sums to be paid annually to his children during their lives, the next item, the 6th, contains specific directions as to the disposition of such shares after their death.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[259,991,1155,963]]]'>. Item 6 provides that should any of testator’s children die (1) without issue then living, or (2) leaving issue then living who die during minority leaving no issue then living, the share of such child goes over to the original residuary trust estate to increase the annuities of other surviving children and the issue of those children that may be deceased. <em>This is the only limitation over in testator’s will </em>and is the limitation referred to in and which permeates other items of the will. We must ascertain what testator meant by it. It is this limitation as referred to in other items that gave rise to the difference of opinion among the Judges and here presents the question: are the gifts contingent until the termination of the trust because the identity of issue cannot until then be ascertained? Vesting would thus be suspended ; ownership left hanging in air. Meanwhile the interim interests in income would become as intricate as a Chinese puzzle.</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[257,1966,1152,423]],["BL_487.1",487,[201,327,1154,959]]]'>Testator intended to vest an equal share in each child’s line of descent and keep it within that line at least to include his child, and the children or issue of a child living at the child’s death. Pie also intended if a child died without issue that this child’s share should go to testator’s other children then living or to their issue, if any. In item 6, he stipulated how this was to be done and that such child’s share should merge into the gen<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>eral residuary trust estate and become extinct so far as that child’s interest in or dominion over it was concerned. The limitation over speaks and is effective, if at all, from a child’s death. One of the following events must occur to make effective the limitation over: (1) death of a child without issue then living, or, (2) death of a child leaving issue then living who die during minority without issue then living. The possibility unmentioned by item 6, and which must always be kept in mind, is that when one of testator’s children dies, his or her children or issue may, by that time, have reached twenty-one. There can be no limitation over <em>if a child die leaving issue then living who is twenty-one or over. </em>In the event testator’s child dies and leaves such issue, item 7 or 8 is immediately operative. That is, either testator’s child will have appointed in exercise of his power under item 7, or he will not have, and his share is disposed of under item 8.</p>
    <p id="b487-5" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[199,1308,1155,958]]]'>The phrase “should a child die and leave no issue living at his death” means but one thing — death of a child of testator without child, children or issue of, such child him surviving. So conversely, if a child should die “leaving issue living at his death” means that the issue of testator’s child must be alive when the child dies. The child’s death not only fixes the time when its issue must be ascertained, but it fixes the.time (1) when vesting takes place, and (2) for determining whether the limitation over is to take effect. Under the will no other time for either of these purposes is mentioned or reasonably possible. It is at that time the issue must be living, not at some later period. If such issue be alive at the child’s death, “and such issue shall all die during minority leaving no issue then living,” means that when such issue dies before majority and leaves no issue.then living (that is, the line of descent ends), the,limitation over takes effect.</p>

Hence, testator included this condition subsequent to throw back into the general estate the share vested in such issue upon the death of testator’s child. But the fact that must exist to prevent the limitation over from taking effect is death of a child with issue then living. If this crucial fact exists, the estate vested in the issue subject only to the possibility of being divested if such issue die during minority without surviving issue.</p>

    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[284,1309,1153,737]]]'>An estate will not be construed to be contingent, if it is at all practicable to construe it as vested: McCall’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0254-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="86 Pa. 254" data-case-ids="1056658" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0254-01">86 Pa. 254</a>, 257; Carstensen’s Est., <a href="/pa/196/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="196 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="916820" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0325-01">196 Pa. 325</a>, 330.

As a result, in item 7 of his Avill he gave to each of his children <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>leaving issue at Ms or her death a limited testamentary power to appoint either <em>“absolutely or in trust ” </em>his or her respective share to and among his or her issue, in such shares, proportions and estates as the child should determine. These appointed shares are taken by such issue subject: (1) to the trusts of this will during the life of the trust, i. e., the original residuary trust; (2) to the limitations over to the surviving children or the issue of deceased children. These qualifications of the power merely embody the limitation over prescribed in item 6. The death of the child who exercises such power, fixes the time when the issue shall be ascertained and take (Pepper’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=120%20Pa.%20233" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="120 Pa. 233">120 Pa. 233</a>), under the power thus conferred. The child, children or issue receive from the parent an “absolute” estate or one in a trust the parent may create. Such estate is, however, subject to the limitation over as mentioned in item 6. If the issue are over twenty-one at the child’s death, the appointment, as made by the child, is, for all time absolute, though its enjoyment in possession may be postponed until the end of the trust created by testator. The same result occurs if the issue are under age at the child’s death and thereafter reach twenty-one, or die leaving issue then living. Appellant contends, inter alia, that when the power is exercised, the limitation over to the issue is the same as that contended for in the 6th item, i. e., to issue living at the termination of the trust. Judge Penrose in reversing Judge Ashman in the adjudication of the 15th account in this estate, construed item 7 even more liberally to the child, children or issue, than do we. He states: “The error has probably arisen from reading the will of the original testator as if the limitations attached to the powers of appointment given by him to his children extended to the estates given by them to their children, although the power is to appoint ‘to and among Ms or her children or issue in such shares, proportions, and estates, absolutely or upon trusts, as he or she may so will or appoint.’ The donees of the power could not ex<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>ercise it in favor of persons not belonging to the designated class of objects, but their appointees acquired all rights of ownership, unlimited in power of disposition.” He held the limitation over did not adhere to the power. There may be much force in this conclusion as appears from the concluding part of the 7th item, which.reads: “that is, during such trust the annuities shall be subject to the disposal of my children as aforesaid, and the shares of the residuary estate to take effect in possession at the expiration of the trust,” but the entire will must be considered. When it is, it is apparent that téstator did not thus free the appointed interests.</p>

    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[191,1405,1155,852]]]'>It is contended by appellant, as it . was as to items 6 and 7, that the limitation over in item 8 had the effect of imposing a qualification on the estates to be taken therer under, to the extent that the limitation was not. to the issue living at the death of the child of testator but to the issue of testator’s children living at the end of the trust. But this limitation over mentioned in item 8 is the same limitation stated in item 6, <em>the only limitation over mentioned in the will. </em>As we have considered this item, we may say further that to follow appellant’s argument we must adopt a conclusion that is entirely out of harmony with the testator’s intention, and would be construing the limitation over as affecting interests not contemplated by the will, thus causing the interim interests to so fluctuate as to be exceedingly difficult of ascertainment.</p>

This intent applies likewise to those who took under item 8. But he never intended the interdiction to be carried to a remote degree, to the possible detriment or exclusion of grandchildren or other issue. It will be noticed that the share that is taken under the 8th item is the same share which could be appointed under the 7th item. Under item 8 a certain share of the principal or corpus is distinctly directed to be held in trust “for the child, children or issue of such decedent or decedents living at his, her or their deaths.” This shows clearly the distributive proportions in which those persons were to take, that is, equally the proportion that their deceased parent would have taken if then living; the last words fixed the death of a child of the testator as the time of vesting in the issue of such child, and show the stirpital character of such interests..</p>

The word “contingent” does not impale or control vesting in issue, as above indicated, and as so clearly evidenced by other items of the will. This item does make certain that if at the termination of the general residuary trust an unexpired minority existed, thus making possible the operation of the condition subsequent in item 6, and thereafter the con<a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>tingency should occur, the share, which had vested in the minors and was divested by reason of their deatli under age without surviving issue, should go over to the issue of other children of testator as such other children had appointed by their wills under item 7, or as provided under item 8,in event of their failure to appoint.
