The liability is, in the alternative; several has to do only with the remedies of the holder, conferring upon holder the remedy of pursuing the co-makers separately and recovering the whole amount due on the note from either, but it does not add to the substantive right involved, i. e., the payment of the note by the makers. The obligation of the makers, as between themselves, is joint. If the holder recover from one the full sum due on the note, that one may compel the other to reimburse him the proportionate share for <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>which he is responsible. The rule of substantive law, as distinguished from the procedural, is that co-makers are <em>jointly </em>responsible for the satisfaction of the obligation ; the substantive right in the holder is to have payment of the note by the makers. It is well to keep in view this familiar legal status of the parties because of the insistence by appellee that the joint and several obligation of the note serves to extend the scope of the severally owned securities of one maker pledged as collateral, to the joint liabilities of the other maker with third parties. See Torrance v. Third Nat. Bank, <a href="/f/210/0806-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="210 F. 806" data-case-ids="6747955" data-case-paths="/f/210/0806-01">210 Fed. 806</a>, 808.</p>

Third Nat. Bank, supra. In it two individuals, Graham and Salsbury, executed their joint and several note to a bank <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>for $43,000. Graham and Salsbury became indorsers individually on notes of other makers. These were discounted by the bank. Subsequently the bank sold the collateral securing the note of Graham and Salsbury for $56,000, and after satisfying that note for $43,000, applied the surplus to the individual liability of Graham and Salsbury on their indorsements. The trustees in bankruptcy of Graham and Salsbury, individually, sought to recover the surplus from the bank and it was held they were entitled to it. The case holds that if property, even when jointly owned by the pledgors (in the instant case the property was owned individually by appellant), is pledged for their <em>joint </em>liability, the surplus of the proceeds thereof, after satisfaction of the note, may not be applied to the several liability of the makers as indorsers on the notes of others. If the distinction is pressed that this several liability as indorser is very different from the liability of A. M. Heffner on his joint and several notes made directly to appellee, it is answered by indicating that the property pledged in the instant case was the individual property of appellant and it would be manifestly inequitable to subject it to the payment of joint liabilities of her co-maker and others. If property jointly owned is not subject to the several liabilities of the owners, for a stronger reason, property individually owned by one of them should not be subject to the joint liability of the other and a third person. Other cases sustain this conclusion. See In Re Evans et al., <a href="/f/238/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="238 F. 543" data-case-ids="6745615" data-case-paths="/f/238/0543-01">238 Fed. 543</a>, wherein the court stated that the liability of three joint makers is different from the liability of two joint makers. Collateral pledged to secure the joint liability of James and Alan was not to be subjected to payment of the joint obligation of James, Alan and John. Such a result strengthens our conclusion, for Mrs. Heffner was owner of the stock pledged for the joint liability of herself and A. M. Heffner, and was not even a party to the joint liability on the notes of A. M. Heffner with other persons.</p>

Superior Ct. 341</a>; but an examination of these cases fails to sustain it. Oleon v. Rosenbloom &amp; Co., supra, does not consider the problem of the case before us except to recognize that an individual may contract that collateral presently deposited for a loan may be subjected to the payment of prior or subsequent loans. It holds that the security of the pledge, for all of such liabilities, follows the note, upon indorsement by the payee, into the hands of the indorsee so that, if the indorsee holds other claims against the maker, the collateral may be subject to their payment. Mulert v. Nat. Bank of Tarentum, <a href="/f/210/0857-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="210 F. 857" data-case-ids="6748266" data-case-paths="/f/210/0857-01">210 Fed. 857</a>, is identical, and the court expressly limits its decision to that point by saying at page 859: “This question, be it observed, is the only one here involved and decided.” We may point out, however, that in both Oleon v. Rosenbloom &amp; Co., supra, and the Mulert Case, the other liabilities of the maker which the holder planned to satisfy were several liabilities — liabilities of the same class as the liability of the individual note for which the collateral was primarily pledged as security.</p>

The plaintiff maintained that the bank was not a holder for value except as to the presently made loans, but the court held that there was <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>present value and that the bank had given value even as to the antecedent indebtedness; thus following a well recognized principle.

The other provision stressed by appellee is: “as security......for any and all liability or liabilities, matured or unmatured, of such maker, indorser or indorsers, guarantor or guarantors to said Bank, which liens shall be enforceable in like manner and shall be subject to all provisions herein above and before mentioned and set out.” This does not enlarge the classification of liability secured, but merely strengthens the security for such liability by granting to the Bank a “like lien upon any and all funds, stocks, bonds, notes, and other property at any time in the hands of the Bank......” But were, this sentence open to other interpretation as to the extent of the liabilities to which it has reference, it would still be subject to the fatal objection that it is dealing with property other than that specifically deposited as collateral for this note, i. e., property which may be “at any time in the hands of the Bank.”</p>
