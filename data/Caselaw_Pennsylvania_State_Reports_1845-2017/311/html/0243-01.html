In its affidavit of defense under section 20 of the Practice Act, defendant set up that the bond was null and void, being prohibited by statute. Judgment was entered for defendant and this appeal followed.</p>

The scope of that section, originally authorizing incorporation for the purpose of insuring titles to real estate, was much enlarged by an Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 159, enabling such corporations, inter alia, “To become sole security for the faithful performance of the duties of any national, state, county or municipal officer, and to execute such bonds or recognizances as may be required by law in such cases.”</p>

L. 248, entitled “An act limiting the power of state banks, banking companies, trust companies, saving banks, and unincorporated banks, to become surety on bonds.” Section 1 provides, “That the word ‘Bank,’ as used in this act, means any state bank, incorporated banking company, trust company, savings bank, or unincorporated bank, heretofore or hereafter organized.” Section 2 provides that no bank, so defined, and therefore no trust company, “shall become surety on any bonds, except that any bank, which has qualified itself under the laws of this Commonwealth to engage in a fiduciary business, may become sole surety in any case where, by law, one or more sureties are or may be required for the faithful performance of the duties of any assignee, receiver, guardian, committee, executor, administrator, trustee, or other fiduciary, and may also become sole surety on any writ of error or appeal, or in any proceeding insti<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>tilted in any court of this Commonwealth in which security is or may be required”: Section 3 provides that “Any bonds executed and delivered in violation of the provisions of this act shall be null and void.” Section 4 repeals all acts or parts of acts inconsistent with it.

In DeHaven v. Pratt, supra, decided in 1909, in considering the “trust company,” as the term was used in the early Act of May 11,1874, P. L. 135 (repealed by the General Banking Act of 1876, supra, Gordon v. Winneberger, <a href="/pa/310/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="310 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1144316" data-case-paths="/pa/310/0362-01">310 Pa. 362</a>), in its possible relation to companies incorporated like the defendant, it was pointed out that the designation “trust company” applied to such companies specially incorporated prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1873, and did not refer to “the modern trust company [which] did not then exist nor was there any authority by which it could be created at that time......” This “modern <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>trust company” was evolved from the title insurance company by means of enabling legislation and has become the trust company as the term has for some time been generally understood. The amendment of 1889, supra, expressly conferred the power “to take, accept and execute trusts of every description.” In the Act of . June 27,1895, P. L. 399, the legislature itself designated such companies as trust companies; in the title to the Revenue Act of June 13, 1907, P. L. 640, they are described as “commonly known as title insurance or trust companies.” In considering that act, this court considered them trust companies: Com. v. Mortgage Trust Co., <a href="/pa/227/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="227 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="1008525" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0163-01">227 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=76%20A.%205" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="76 A. 5">76 A. 5</a>. They are designated trust companies in the Act of May 8, 1907, P. L. 192, and in the Act of May 23, 1913, P. L. 354, providing the order of distribution among creditors; in the Act of May 8, 1907, P. L. 189, requiring a reserve fund; in the Act of May 9, 1923, P. L. 173, conferring the privilege of discounting, etc.; in the Act of May 9, 1923, P. L. 174, permitting merger, and in the Act of July 11, 1923, P. L. 1071.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> We have no doubt that the legislature intended to include corporations, formed as defendant was, within the term trust company in the Act of 1923 prohibiting the execution of surety bonds except in the limited classes specified in section 2; appellant, very properly, does not contend that a tax collector is within any class specified.</p>

    <p id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[261,659,1152,694]]]'>We cannot accept the contention, which would nullify the act by leaving no corporation to which it could apply. The sweeping provision of the Act of 1923 is that “No bank [as defined] shall become surety on any bonds ......” like that in suit. The statute is neither more general nor less particular and specific than was the grant of power to become surety on such bonds in effect when defendant received letters patent. The obvious intention was to regulate banking by prohibiting such companies from thereafter becoming surety for the faithful performance of the duties of any municipal officer; this, the legislature was competent to do: Noble State Bank v. Haskell, <a href="/us/219/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="219 U.S. 104" data-case-ids="3653474" data-case-paths="/us/219/0104-01">219 U. S. 104</a>.</p>
