Defendant filed an affidavit of defense in the nature of a demurrer, raising the legal question that the contract of guaranty does not cover the alleged liability of the Foley Chevrolet Company to the plaintiff under the facts set forth in the statement of claim. The court below sustained the affidavit of defense, and entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiff appealed.</p>

It was provided by the contract that “This guaranty and the performance thereunder shall be construed and determined according to the law of the State of New York.” However, no allegation is to be found in the pleadings stating the law of New York relating to the construction of such a contract. We shall, therefore, presume the law of our sister state on this subject to be the same as that of Pennsylvania. If the name of the state be changed, the words of Judge Porter in Cape May Real Estate Co. v. Henderson, <a href="/pa-super/42/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="42 Pa. Super. 1" data-case-ids="412423" data-case-paths="/pa-super/42/0001-01">42 Pa. Superior Ct. 1</a>, whose opinion was affirmed by us per curiam (231. Pa. 82), apply exactly to the instant case: “The case as presented, however, does not permit us to inquire what the law of that state may be. The case must stand upon the pleadings, the statement of the plaintiff and the demurrer of the defendant. The statement contains no allegation as to the law of New Jersey and the demurrer is, of course, barren of any suggestion upon that subject. The laws of a foreign country or another state of the union must be proved as facts, and, in the absence of allegation or evidence to the contrary, must be presumed to be the same as that of the forum: Musser v. Stauffer, <a href="/pa/178/0099-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="178 Pa. 99" data-case-ids="885511" data-case-paths="/pa/178/0099-01">178 Pa. 99</a>, and <a href="/pa/192/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="192 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="908977,908997" data-case-paths="/pa/192/0398-01,/pa/192/0398-02">192 Pa. 398</a>.” Further authority for this well settled principle of law is to be found in Baughman’s Est., <a href="/pa/281/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="281 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1086979" data-case-paths="/pa/281/0023-01">281 Pa. 23</a>, and Oberlin v.

All the words and expressions in the agreement referring to liabilities expressly guaranteed by the defendant relate to some form of credit transaction, such as drafts, notes, .acceptances, and negotiable instruments, or to some action connected therewith, such as issuing, accepting, en<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>dorsing, discounting, and purchasing. When, therefore, to the specifically enumerated classes of instruments is added the general expression, “agreements and other obligations,” these general words must be construed, under the familiar rule of ejusdem generis, as referring to some form of credit transaction similar to those specifically named: Cleveland &amp; Western Coal Co. v. Cyclops Steel Co., <a href="/pa/278/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="278 Pa. 346" data-case-ids="1080504" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0346-01">278 Pa. 346</a>; Real Estate-Land Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Bankers Trust Co., <a href="/pa-super/104/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="104 Pa. Super. 493" data-case-ids="698536" data-case-paths="/pa-super/104/0493-01">104 Pa. Superior Ct. 493</a>. What was obviously contemplated when this contract was made was that plaintiff should extend credit to the Chevrolet Company, or to individuals on behalf of the Chevrolet Company; the extension of credit was the stated consideration for the contract, and it was only from such losses as might arise therefrom that defendant undertook to hold plaintiff harmless. The “full indebtedness” of the Chevrolet Company to the plaintiff, which was guaranteed, xvas that which resulted from such transactions. Certainly, plaintiff’s partial payment of the Chevrolet Company’s rent did not create an obligation covered by the terms of the contract. But even if the words “agreements and other obligations” be considered sufficiently broad to include any liability of the Chevrolet Company to the plaintiff for the rent paid by the latter, the contract does not contain a guaranty of payment of such liability. The “agreements and other obligations” payment of which was insured were those entered into by plaintiff “for the account or in the behalf of” the Chevrolet Company. The settlement with the landlord upon which defendant’s asserted liability is based can under no interpretation be called one for the account of or on behalf of the Chevrolet Company; plaintiff entered into it solely to protect its own interests — its property rights in its automobiles. The effect of plaintiff’s contention, were it correct, would be to make this instrument a guaranty of all debts which the Chevrolet Company might owe, for, to bring them within the terms of the contract, plaintiff need only pay such debts, where<a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>upon defendant, under Ms contract, would be liable for the amount thus paid. Such an interpretation of the agreement is obviously impossible.</p>
    <p id="b509-3" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[191,512,1156,1069]]]'>Plaintiff’s counsel states in his brief that the automobiles were in the possession of the Chevrolet Company under a trust receipt with promissory notes attached, and that by the landlord’s seizure there was a breach of the agreement whereby the Chevrolet Company had possession. From this he argues that defendant is liable for plaintiff’s loss by reason of the breach of the Chevrolet Company’s agreement. We find no basis for this contention in the record. Except in plaintiff’s brief, there is no mention of any agreement relative to the automobiles seized. In the words of the learned court below, “There is nothing in the statement of claim showing how the automobiles came to be on the premises of the Chevrolet Company, or what the ‘obligation’ or ‘agreement’ was in regard to them. All we know is that automobiles belonging to the plaintiff were on the premises of the Chevrolet Company, that this company did not pay the rent to its landlord, that the latter levied a distress for the rent in arrear and seized the automobiles in question.”</p>
