They are as follows: (1) “It is a rule of statutory construction that an earlier law will be repealed by implication by an act covering the entire subject-matter of the former law, and manifestly intended as a substitute for it. But this rule is founded on presumption of legislative intent, and will not apply where a contrary intent is clearly apparent”: Long et al. v. Phillips, <a href="/pa/241/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="241 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="976068" data-case-paths="/pa/241/0246-01">241 Pa. 246</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=88%20A.%20437" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="88 A. 437">88 A. 437</a>; Com. ex rel. v.

It is unquestionably true that where the provisions of a general and of a local or special act are so irreconcilably conflicting that both cannot be given effect, the inconsistent provisions of the earlier local or special act are repealed by implication....... An intent to repeal the inconsistent provisions of the <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>earlier special act may be inferred from the fact that the provisions of the two acts are so glaringly repugnant to and so radically irreconcilable with each other as to render it impossible for both to stand. And the fact that the general statute is couched in negative terms is indicative of a legislative purpose to have it replace all others upon the same subject”: 25 R. C. L. 927, section 177.

Each act provides for advertising in newspapers for a specified number of weeks, for “due notice” of the specifications so that the bids may be formulated intelligently, for the recording of the bids, and for the giving of security which will receive official approval. The Act of 1870-requires approval by a judge of the court of common pleas; the Act of 1913 requires approval by the court of quarter sessions. The latter act adequately meets public requirements and there is no need of both acts. The Act of 1913 manifestly supersedes the Act of 1870; it completely excludes it from the field it formerly occupied, except possibly the field of bridge construction at a cost of less than $250.</p>
