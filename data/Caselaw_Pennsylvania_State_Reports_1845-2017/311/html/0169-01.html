An action of assumpsit was brought by Fred B. Gernerd, Trustee in Bankruptcy of Charles H. Hoch and Oscar S. Hoch, individually, and as copartners, trading as Hoch Contracting Company (hereinafter referred to as the partnership), against the Union Indemnity Company, a corporation, (hereinafter referred to as the Indemnity Company), to recover the value of certain road building equipment originally owned by the partnership which the company had taken into its possession. After trial plaintiff recovered a verdict for $13,255.</p>

On July 10, 1930, the company executed this bond. The application, Avliich when accepted constituted a contract between the partnership and the company, contained, inter alia, the following: “That for the better protection and security of the Company, the undersigned, as of the date hereof,, hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to the Company, all the rights, titles <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>and interests of the undersigned in and to all the supplies, tools, plant, equipment and materials of every nature and description that he or it may now or hereafter have upon said work, or in or on about the site thereof,......and the undersigned does hereby authorize and empower the company, its authorized agents or attorneys, to enter upon and take possession of said supplies, tools, plant, equipment, materials, and enforce, use and enjoy the title thereto and the possession thereof <em>m the event of cmy default on the part of the undersigned in the performance of the contract hereinabove referred to </em>[italics supplied] or in the payment of any of the premiums above mentioned.”</p>

At the time the contract was executed, the partnership owned practically all of the equipment, machinery, and building materials set forth in the statement of claim. The company, upon the execution of the bond by it and of the assignment of the equipment to it, did not take possession of the equipment but allowed it to remain in the possession of the partnership. The insolvency of the partnership became manifest as early as March 23, 1931, when a meeting was held in the directors’ room of an Allentown bank, attended by representatives of certain banks and of the Indemnity Company, and by Charles Hoch representing the partnership. A statement was there made that “Hoch is insolvent.”</p>

On the same day the United States Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania issued an order restraining the Indemnity Company “from further proceedings against the assets of the alleged bankrupts upon an execution issued out of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County and an exemplified copy of which was entered of record in the County of Pike.” <em>August 3, 1931, </em>the partnership was adjudged bankrupt. <em>August 24,1931, </em>F.

It would be dangerous to the public to countenance such transactions. It may be conceded, indeed it must be, that the rigor of this rule in later years has been somewhat relaxed, but the rule itself still remains the law of <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>our State.
