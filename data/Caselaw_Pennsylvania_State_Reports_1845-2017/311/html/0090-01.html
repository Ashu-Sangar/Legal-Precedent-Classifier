Eighty-five per cent of the contract price was to be paid as the work progressed, 12% was to be held until the buildings Avere accepted, and .3% retained by the owner for twelve months, subject to the completion of the buildings, as security against any loss arising from defective Avorkmanship, materials and settling.</p>

The OAvner paid to the contractor all the money called for by the contract with the exception of the retained 3%, amounting to $36,253.52, and the sum of $10,000. The latter sum was held to pay for the work of terracing, etc., as above stated. The contractor, having failed to go ahead with this work, was notified on February 24th that unless he proceeded to finish the work, he would be ordered to withdraAV from the premises. On March 3d, the contractor, having done nothing, was ordered to withdraw, and the OAvner stated it Avould finish the work and deduct the cost from the money in its hands.

The surety used $1,975 of that sum to repay it for sodding, etc., and applied the balance to other items it was compelled to assume under its bonds because the contractor had failed to pay them. The cost to surety for maintenance of the building for one year after the date of acceptance was $6,275.

The surety made claim to this sum and a suit was instituted by the receiver against the owner, in which the surety interpleaded.

      <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>To determine the questions involved, it is necessary to ascertain the status of the general contract for the construction of the buildings after they were accepted in January and February, 1930. One building was accepted absolutely, and the other two were accepted but for the work of terracing, sodding, and seeding, ánd subject to the requirement of maintenance for one year from the date of acceptance, to pay for which $10,000 was retained by the owner. By these acts the owner indicated that he considered the buildings entirely completed. As to the work of terracing, sodding, etc., while the provisions of the general contract may apply as to manner and method of performance, once the buildings were accepted, such work may be regarded as the subject of an agreement having the status of a new contract. The surety cannot regard it otherwise as it consented to the arrangement between contractor and owner.</p>
    <p id="b121-3" data-blocks='[["BL_121.4",121,[174,1242,1154,533]]]'>Under these circumstances, there was no default in the contract to complete the buildings; they had been accepted. Nor could there be as to any part of the work that had been performed in connection with the buildings prior to their acceptance. If there was a later default, it was in connection with the unfinished terracing, sodding, etc., and the owner had taken a specific sum to pay for the cost of this work. After paying for it there remained a balance of $1,300 over its cost, such cost including the maintenance item of $6,275.</p>

While the failure of the contractor to complete these items and maintain the buildings for a year after they were accepted may have been a default as to such work, it was not one as to the general contract for the completion of the buildings. Such default, even if the surety had been required to complete the unfinished work of sodding, etc., under the terms of the general contract between <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>tlie owner and contractor, or was likewise required to complete under tlie terms of its bond, would not entitle the surety to the retained percentage to reimburse itself for the sums paid for labor and material on the general contract. The obvious reason is that as to such unfinished work the surety was fully paid and did not lose a dollar. The surety, in completing without loss the unfinished work, stands exactly in the same position as to the retained percentages as if the contractor had completed his contract and had failed to pay labor and materialmen, whom the surety had thereafter paid. The surety is not entitled, under the doctrine of subrogation, to moneys then in the owner’s hands. This principle is further discussed in answering .the next question.</p>
    <p id="b122-4" data-blocks='[["BL_122.4",122,[286,1074,1152,1171]]]'>The surety earnestly contends that the failure of the contractor to pay the labor and materialmen which it is required to pay is such a default in the contracts for construction that it is entitled to the fund. Ordinarily, and at common law, the owner is under no liability in a contractual sense, nor is he under any duty to pay, nor may his property be subjected to payment of labor and materialmen of the contractor. This common law status as to any owner’s property for which labor and material is supplied has been changed by statute. Such property is made subject to a statutory liability to labor and materialmen of his contractor, who are given the right, subject to certain qualifications, to file a mechanic’s lien for their claims. Property of municipalities, school districts and the like are exempt from such liability. A mechanic’s lien or attachment in the nature thereof cannot be filed against property belonging to these agencies of government. The legislature has, however, seen fit to protect labor and materialmen engaged by a contractor in the erection of public buildings or doing public work, by requiring the contractor to give a bond to protect them.

Under federal statutes a <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>single bond is required which must provide for the completion of the contract and the payment of labor and materialmen: 40 U.

It has been held by federal courts that there is a direct contractual obligation to the government as a party to the contract, binding on the contractor and surety, to pay labor and materialmen. Consequently, when the contractor fails to pay labor and materialmen, it is tantamount to a breach of its contract with the United States government. When this occurs and the surety pays the labor and materialmen, it stands in the position of a surety completing a contractual obligation of a defaulting contractor and performing an equitable duty to the United States. It is therefore entitled to subrogation to the rights of the United States in the fund. Subrogation does not arise through the contractor but from the government’s rights: Prairie State Bank v. U.

Therefore, the failure to pay labor and material-men standing alone did not breach either of these instruments.

The acts simply required an “additional bond” for the protection of labor and materialmen and it was under that obligation the surety was required to pay. The contractor’s obligation to pay labor and materialmen came through the agreements between the contractor and such claimants. Therefore, when the surety paid these claims, without other facts, (Lancaster County National Bank’s Appeal, supra,) it can predicate no right through the construction contract with the owner, or the bond given for that construction, or the statutes referred to, to any part of the funds in the owner’s hands due under the construction contract.</p>

The surety was held liable on the ground that the city owed no duty to labor and materialmen, and therefore had no obligation to withhold payment from the contractor. The court said: “The notice not to pay the contractor would have exonerated the surety if the payment was one which the city ought to have withheld, <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>but it was not. The city was under no obligation to pay the claimants, nor to see that they were paid.

Southern Surety Co., supra, holding that the Acts of 1917 and 1925, providing for a bond to protect labor and materialmen, merely make obligatory on certain districts what was perhaps optional prior thereto.</p>

They, as labor and materialmen, had no right of subrogation against the owner. They had a claim against the contractor and it was to that claim the surety was subrogated, but that right did not extend to the contractor’s money due and in the owner’s hands, unless it was seized by legal process.

This is the mode which equity adopts to compel the ultimate payment by him who in good conscience ought to pay the debt, to the relief of him whom none but the creditor could ask to pay.

Mr. Justice Simpson, speaking for the court, said that “the contractor could not get the semi-final estimate......until and unless all ‘claims for labor and materials have been satisfactorily settled,’......It knew, for it was bound to know, that the statute, the contract and the bond made the rights of the materialmen and workmen paramount to those of the contractor, and that upon these <a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>provisions the materialmen, workmen and surety had the right to rely.”</p>
