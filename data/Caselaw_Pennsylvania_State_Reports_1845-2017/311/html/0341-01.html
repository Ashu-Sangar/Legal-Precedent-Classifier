Franek had been elected Justice of the Peace of the Borough in January, 1930, for a term of six years. On November 3, 1931, the newly organized City held its first general municipal election for the purpose of assuming its status as a Third-Class City. Julius Schermer was elected Alderman of the second ward, and received a commission for a term of six years commencing January 6,1932. The second ward was the same one in which Franek was a resident when commissioned Justice of the Peace. At the same general election Franek was elected Mayor of the newly constituted city. The change in organization precipitated cross actions of quo warranto. Schermer instituted his action to oust Franek from the office of Justice of the Peace and Franek re<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>taliated with a similar proceeding to oust Sehermer from the office of Alderman. The court below ousted Sehermer from the office of Alderman and sustained Franek as Justice of the Peace. Appeals followed which will be decided in one opinion.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[276,604,1151,859]]]'>A writ of quo warranto to oust a public officer possesses many of the elements of a criminal prosecution. Historically, it was a criminal proceeding on information and resulted in the imposition of fines and sentences of imprisonment. While the writ soon lost its criminal character and applied to the mere purpose of trying the civil rights involved, it retained the criminal form. As a result, the action is brought in the name.of the Commonwealth to redress a public wrong, is prosecuted in the name of the Commonwealth’s attorney and by his leave; if the Commonwealth is successful, it results in ousting the usurper from the office which he unlawfully holds. The question, being a public one, cannot be raised by a private person, but by the attorney general or the district attorney: Com. v. Cluley, <a href="/pa/56/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="56 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="1009157" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0270-01">56 Pa. 270</a>; Com. v.

This is a defect which must not ordinarily be overlooked since the protection of public rights is involved; but as it was stated at the bar of this court that the district attorney had consented to the use of his name, although he made no formal appearance, the omission in this case is overlooked. We adopt this attitude more readily as we bear in mind that the attorney general or district attorney may not arbitrarily refuse either to bring the action or permit the use of his name by a private relator. Should he do so, the party aggrieved by his failure may, in a proper case, compel his cooperation by mandamus: People ex rel. v.

He must possess some peculiar, personal interest aside from his general interest as a member of the public: Com. v.

Hence, there was no vacancy to which Julius Schermer could be elected as provided in section 32 of the Third-Class City Act, supra; therefore, he has no such right or interest as would warrant a judgment of ouster.</p>

He declares that this right cannot be defeated on a demurrer to the pleadings. Ordinarily, this is correct: Com. v.

However, Schermer in his petition to oust Franek from the office of Justice of the Peace sets up all the averments of fact as we have related them, and they are a sufficient ground on which this court can base its judgment.

The Legislature of this Commonwealth has determined in several instances certain offices to be incompatible, and it would be a transgression of the power of this court to hold the offices of Mayor and Justice of the Peace incompatible when the Legislature has not seen fit to act in the matter.</p>
