This was done pursuant to a written agreement entered into between plaintiff and the fifteen.defendants guaranteeing payment at maturity of a promissory note given plaintiff by one of its debtors, the Barr Manufacturing Corporation.- This agreement provided, inter alia, “..... .if the said note, or any renewal or renewals thereof, with interest at the rate of six (6) per cent per annum, is not paid at maturity, we, and-each of us, do hereby covenant to pay the same, and we, and each of us, empower any prothonotary or attorney of any court of record with<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>in the United States, or elsewhere, to appear for us, and each of us, and after one or more declarations filed, confess judgment against us, and each of us as of any term, for the amount of the said principal indebtedness remaining unpaid, together with interest which has accrued thereon, or may thereafter accrue, with costs of suit and attorney’s commission of ten (10) per cent for collection, releasing all errors, waiving the necessity of any preliminary demand upon us, or any of us, for payment of the said judgment, and waiving the rights to claim for any property any statutory exemption from levy and sale, and waiving inquisition and condemnation upon any real estate that may be levied on by virtue of any writ of fi. fa. issued upon any judgment obtained on this obligation.”</p>

The original agreement, pursuant to which the Blair County judgment was entered, was not filed in the prothonotary’s office until argument on May 5, 1932, on the rule to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off, granted on defendant’s petition of April 4, 1932.

If that should be done an aggrieved defendant would have to petition in 67 counties to have the judgment opened. When a judgment is entered in county “B” by the filing of an exemplified copy of a judgment on record in county “A,” a.defendant need not concern himself except with the validity of the parent judgment. If it is desirable that judgments should be entered on copies of instruments containing a power of attorney to confess judgment, it might be practicable and serve a useful purpose to have a rule of court in the several counties of the Commonwealth providing that judgment cannot be entered on a copy of such an instrument without the preliminary filing of an affidavit that the original was in the possession of the person filing the prsecipe for the entry of judgment and that no judgment had been entered elsewhere on the original or on any copy thereof. The rule should also provide (1) that the prothonotary of the court of the county in which the judgment was entered on a copy should affix his certificate to the original instrument containing the warrant of attorney, to the effect that judgment had been, entered in that county on a <em>copy </em>of the original, and (2) that when a judgment has been entered anywhere on a <em>copy </em>of the original instrument, judgment cannot again be entered on a copy of that instrument except upon a duly exemplified copy or otherwise as-and when provided by statute.</p>

L. 206, section 1, provides: “That whenever in any note, bond, or other obligation, given for the payment of a debt or the performance of any obligation, there is contained on the part of the maker or obligor a waiver of inquisition on real estate, and the said note, bon'd, or. other obligation is entered of record in the office of the clerk of the proper court, and becomes a lien on any real estate of the maker or obligor, such waiver of inquisition shall be effective against and bind the real estate on which the same is a lien, in the hands of the maker or obligor, or in the hands of anypurchaser or subsequent owner of such real estate, and shall at all times enure to the benefit of the payee or obligee of such note, bond, or obligation. In any proceedings for the collection of such note, bond, or obligation by a sale of the real estate on which the same is a lien, whether such real estate be in the hands of the maker or obligor or in the hands of a purchaser or subsequent owner, the real estate may be sold on a writ of fieri facias or venditioni exponas, as may be provided in <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>said note, bond, or obligation, or as may be provided by law, without any proceedings for an inquisition on the real estate, as is now provided by law.”</p>
    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[282,494,1153,1076]]]'>The court below aptly said: “This act establishes the right of waiver of inquisition and makes the same effective against not only the obligor but any subsequent purchaser or owner and if any obligation does not specifically designate the writ upon which the real estate may be sold that then the land may be sold upon a writ provided by law....... In the obligation which is the basis of this judgment the defendants waive ‘inquisition and condemnation upon any real estate that may be levied upon by virtue of any writ of fieri facias’ and therefore the inclusion of the phrase in the confession of judgment ‘and agreeing that such real estate shall be sold on said writ’ is superflous language and in no way does it provide the plaintiff with a right which it does not have without such words, neither does it prejudice or work a hardship or disadvantage, or in any way change the legal rights or remedies of the defendant, and whether it was included in the original confession as the result of a clerical error or otherwise it in no way affects the regularity of this judgment.”</p>

Plaintiff is not asking to amend its declaration or warrant of attorney. In Mars Nat. Bank v. Hughes, <a href="/pa/243/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="243 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1001650" data-case-paths="/pa/243/0223-01">243 Pa. 223</a>, 225, <a href="/citations/?q=89%20A.%201130" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="89 A. 1130">89 A. 1130</a>, this court held: “For errors in the entry of the judgment, or for the correction of clerical mistakes, application should have been made to the court to correct the original judgment to conform to the facts.” In Pacific Lumber Co. v. Rodd, <a href="/pa/287/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="287 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="1099642" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0454-01">287 Pa. 454</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.%20122" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="135 A. 122">135 A. 122</a>, this court said: “That by error there was included in the confession of a waiver of inquisition, condemnation and exemption, which waiver did not appear in the original note filed...... It is true that the use of a warrant to secure an entry exhausts the power thereunder in so far as to prevent the confession of a second judgment based on a different ground or for a different amount, but the right to correct clerical errors is not thereby lost.”</p>
    <p id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[206,1594,1153,746]]]'>The defendant in his answer to the rule to show cause why judgment should not be corrected, avers: “The court should not permit the amendment of this judgment inasmuch as the rule has not been served upon all of the defendants in the judgment.” This fact does not affect the defendant who has appeared. He has answered and submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the court which has jurisdiction of the subject-matter. He did not apply to have the judgment stricken from the records in behalf of his codefendants. Whether or not the judgment of the court oil this rule is conclusive as to the remaining defendants, it concluded the defendant who appeared and submitted the cause for judicial determination.</p>
