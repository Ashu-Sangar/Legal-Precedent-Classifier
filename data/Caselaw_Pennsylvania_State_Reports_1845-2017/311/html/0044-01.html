    <p id="b72-7" data-blocks='[["BL_72.13",72,[282,1231,1151,368]]]'>This case was tried twice in the court below. On appeal to the Superior Court, following the first trial, the judgment entered for plaintiff was reversed and a new trial ordered: <a href="/pa-super/101/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="101 Pa. Super. 189" data-case-ids="692959" data-case-paths="/pa-super/101/0189-01">101 Pa. Superior Ct. 189</a>. On the second trial, the court below, after hearing plaintiff’s witnesses, entered a nonsuit, which it subsequently refused to take off. This appeal followed.</p>
    <p id="b72-8" data-blocks='[["BL_72.14",72,[279,1611,1152,629]]]'>■ The action is in ejectment and was brought by plaintiff upon a rule entered by defendant in possession to determine the title to a small tract of ground on Nittany Mountain, Potter Township, Center County. Defendant claims the tract in dispute as part of the property conveyed to him by deed of July 14, 1926, from Mary F. Stahl, widow, who, with her husband, had purchased it under special warranty deed from Henry F. Bitner and wife. Plaintiff claims the land as part of the property purchased by him under general warranty deed dated March 23, 1918, from the same Henry F. Bitner and wife.</p>
    <p id="b72-9" data-blocks='[["BL_72.15",72,[265,2261,1162,95]],["BL_73.1",73,[171,313,1151,644]]]'>The land in controversy is bounded on one side by the -site of an old turnpike. The deed to Detwiler describes <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>the boundaries of his property where it adjoins Coldren’s as follows: “Beginning at a point on the public road leading from Centre Hall to Bellefonte, 10 rods from the corner where the lands of J. J. Arney, E. M. Huyett and S. W. Smith and James Stahl meet, thence north 52% degrees east, about 130 perches to corner of tract of land recently sold by the above named H. F. Bitner to Mrs. Mary Stahl; thence along the said Stahl tract, up the mountain, to the edge or brow of the mountain, to stake; thence along the brow of the mountain 20 perches to the public road; thence along the public road 71 perches to the place of beginning.”</p>
    <p id="b73-4" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[170,968,1153,1402]],["BL_74.1",74,[285,315,1148,88]]]'>There is no controversy as to the definiteness of the place of beginning named in this deed, or as to the course of the public road. It was admitted in plaintiff’s testimony that the distance named along the public road is the main point in dispute. Plaintiff maintains that following a course of 20 perches along the “brow of the mountain” to the public road brings this point of his boundary line a distance of a fraction over 61 perches from the place of beginning, and establishes the point intended, and that the distance of 71 perches named in the deed is in error. Plaintiff’s contention would thus extend the line of his property along the public road by ten rods, and reduce defendant’s boundaries to that extent, the latter’s deed, as shown by the testimony, also calling for a distance of 71 rods along the same course. Appellant endeavors to support his contention by testimony of a surveyor who ran lines for him and under his [appellant’s] direction, along what the surveyor regarded as the “brow of the mountain,” starting from a stone which plaintiff pointed out as calling for the corner of the land, following a line which the surveyor testified he found marked by post and stones until he came to stones at the edge of the road, at a point 61 rods from the place of beginning. It is to be noted that none of the monuments referred to by this witness were mentioned in plaintiff’s deed. There, the beginning of the <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>20 perch line was a stake, which plaintiff does not claim to have found.</p>
    <p id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[281,423,1152,423]]]'>Plaintiff further endeavored to support his contention as to the boundary line by evidence that defendant, before purchasing his property, had leased part of the tract of ground along the turnpike from plaintiff’s guardian. The lease, however, antedated the purchase of the disputed land by defendant, was indefinite as to the location of the property covered, and was properly rejected by the court below.</p>
    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[281,858,1151,900]]]'>Plaintiff also sought to introduce oral evidence to the effect that, in a conversation with a third party, “sometime previous to 1927,” defendant had referred to plaintiff as owning “the whole top of the mountain here,” and in support of his claim that such testimony was relevant and admissible, cites Sheaffer v. Eakman, <a href="/pa/56/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="56 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="1009213" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0144-01">56 Pa. 144</a>, which states, “The character of a possession may always be shown by contemporaneous declarations of the tenant, and especially is this true when the party who offers them is endeavoring to make out a title under the statute of limitations by his own possession and that of tenants, or by the latter alone”; but we there added that “the declarations of......tenants could not be received to show the boundaries of the survey.” In the present instance plaintiff was not trying to prove ownership by possession over a term of years, but by the terms of his deed.</p>
    <p id="b74-8" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[281,1780,1150,584]],["BL_75.1",75,[175,314,1155,1078]]]'>Plaintiff further assigns as error the ruling of the court striking out testimony of plaintiff, on cross-examination, that he had put a fence along the property “on the line that Mr. Stahl showed me, in the presence of Mr. Coldren.” ' This point was correctly ruled in the opinion of the Superior Court, on appeal in the first trial of this action (101 Pa. Superior Ct. at page 196) where it is said: “James Stahl, one of the grantees in the original deed from Bitner was dead. His right had passed by the operation of law to his wife, and from her, by her own act, to the defendant, a party on the record who rep<a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>resented Ms (James StaM’s) interest in the subject in controversy.
