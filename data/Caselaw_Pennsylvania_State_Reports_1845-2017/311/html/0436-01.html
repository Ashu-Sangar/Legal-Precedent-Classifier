In building the Delaware River Bridge the Commission directed a change of grade in that street. The Commission’s authority was conferred by the Act of July 9, 1919, P. L. 814. Plaintiff, who was engaged in a business requiring the use of trucks, averred in the court below that the new grade of the street, six feet below, its former grade, prevented access to his premises; and as Front Street was the only means of access, the change destroyed the use of the premises. He was obliged to vacate his leasehold and remove his .heavy machinery therefrom. The action to recover damages resulted in a verdict for defendant which the court below refused to disturb. This appeal followed.</p>

The constitutional provision reads: “No bill, except general appropriation bills, shall be passed containing more than one subject, <em>which shall he clearly expressed in its title.” </em>The part of the title to the Delaware River Bridge Act, which is pertinent to the question now under dis<a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>eussion, reads as follows: “......providing for the acquiring, [taking,] and condemnation of the real estate for the site and approaches thereof [i e., of the bridge,] and making an appropriation for the purposes of this act.” As the body of the act is sufficiently comprehensive to cover claims for the consequential damages which plaintiff sustained, the question is, does the title give sufficient notice of the new liability that is to be imposed on the Commonwealth.</p>

The Constitution does not bar the enactment of a statute authorizing the taking of such property with compensation, and if, in the taking, consequential damages result, the statute may provide for just compensation to be made for such damages.

These piers and rights were taken; this was a taking of physical property, not the creation of mere consequential damage.

His business of collecting, baling and shipping waste paper required convenient access to and from his leasehold property by trucks. The lowering by six feet of the grade of Front Street on which his property faced took away his sole access to his premises, thereby destroying the value of his leasehold. The work of changing the grade in front of his property began in February, 1926. In March, 1926, Raiguel was obliged by this change of grade to vacate his property and to remove his heavy machinery therefrom. His landlord <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>compelled Mm' to pay the rental for the unexpired balance of the term, i: e., until February 20,1927. The landlord’s proceedings against Raiguel ended in a judgment against him, duly affirmed by the Superior Court. (See Girard Trust Co. et al. v. Raiguel, <a href="/pa-super/93/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="93 Pa. Super. 123" data-case-ids="678542" data-case-paths="/pa-super/93/0123-01">93 Pa. Superior Ct. 123</a>.)</p>

    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[223,933,1153,478]]]'>The majority hold that the Constitution bars plaintiff from recovery' because the Delaware River Bridge Act of July 9, 1919, P.

    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[220,1424,1156,961]]]'>With this I cannot agree. That the legislature intended the Commonwealth to make compensation for damages such as were sustained by plaintiff is evident from section 2 of the act, where appears this sentence: “The term ‘cost of construction,’ as used in this act, shall include the cost of constructing the superstructure and substructure of the bridge and the approaches thereto, and the cost of acquisition of the ground for the site of said bridge and the approaches thereto, <em>including any </em>franchises, easement, rights, <em>or damages incident thereto or consequent upon the talcing thereof ” </em>(Italics supplied.) That plaintiff’s easement was “acquired” by the Commonwealth in constructing the approaches to the bridge is indisputable. “It is well settled that the right to the use and possession of a lot abutting on a public street is property and the right of access is equally property”: Lewis on Eminent Domain, volume 1, page 56.</p>

The City Solicitor in asking for binding instructions said: “The case rests on but one question, and that is a question of law as to the voluntary removal...... If there had been a legal proving of a damage, it is not a damage that is assessable, by reason of the fact that the evidence shows he voluntarily abandoned the property.” The court submitted that question with what I view as erroneous instructions.</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[270,859,1152,694]]]'>There is nothing in the statement of questions involved, in either appellant’s or appellee’s paper book, even remotely referring to an alleged defect in the Bridge Act’s title on which the court’s opinion in this case is now grounded. However, even if we assume that the question of the amplitude of the title of the Delaware River Bridge Act was squarely raised, I can find no warrant for holding the title inadequate. We have had other acts in this Commonwealth providing for the imposition on the body politic or on a subdivision thereof of liability for damages for change of a highway grade, and the titles to these acts have been no more ample than is the title now challenged.</p>

More important than this, it appears from “the statement of the case” filed in lieu of pleadings, that there was in the Memorial Bridge case no cutting down of the street immediately in front of the plaintiff’s property but there was merely abutment of the bridge in the center of the street in front of plaintiff’s property and the center line of this bridge was approximately the center of State Street, 120 feet wide. The bridge property had a width of 80 feet and the southern boundary line was approximately 20 feet from the property line of petitioner’s land. The Dauphin County Court in the opinion filed in that case said: “ ‘Where a bridge is built within the lines of a street and does not overhang any of the land of the abutting property owner the element of damage is the exclusion of light and air from the property’: Jones v. Erie &amp; Wyoming Valley R. R.

The word “eastments” nowhere appears in the act. The damage sustained by plaintiff in the Memorial Bridge case was clearly what is known in law as “consequential damage.” None of plaintiff’s property was taken away from him. No easement of ingress or egress was destroyed.

These incorporeal rights have been generally defined as the right of access to navigable rivers in front of the abutting owner’s lot and adjacent thereto, and the right to make a landing wharf or pier for his own use or the use of the public, subject to the general rules imposed by the legislature for the rights of the public.

The form of action in which the remedy must be sought cannot be decisive of the question whether the injury falls within the constitutional prohibition.”</p>

      <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>Whether the injuries to Raiguel’s property are characterized as “consequential” or held to constitute a “direct taking” of a property right is immaterial. He is in either event entitled to recover damages, for what was taken from him has all the legal qualities of property. For consequential damages the Bridge Act fully provides and the title of the act is ample; for damages for a direct taking for public use of any property — and an easement <em>is </em>property — the Constitution guarantees compensation.</p>
    <p id="b480-4" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[275,891,1156,1348]]]'>I would reverse this case with a venire for I believe, the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury. In substance he charged that Baiguel “abandoned any claim” for damages by vacating the premises. Nothing in the evidence supports any charge of abandonment. Baiguel was obliged to vacate the premises for he had been deprived of the use of them by having access to them taken away by the deep excavation in front. Furthermore, the court erred in instructing the jury that plaintiff’s damages could not be ascertained until after the completion of the work in front of his premises. This instruction was contrary to the decisions of this court. See O’Brien v. Penna., etc., R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/119/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="119 Pa. 184" data-case-ids="558095" data-case-paths="/pa/119/0184-01">119 Pa. 184</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.%2074" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="13 A. 74">13 A. 74</a>. There were also erroneous instructions on the measure of damages, and error committed in the exclusion of testimony of a real estate expert who qualified as being familiar with real estate values generally in the neighborhood in question but whose offer to testify as to the rental value of Baiguel’s property in February, 1926, was improperly excluded, the court saying: “As a real estate expert nobody questions his opinion, but as a leasehold expert, I do not believe he has had the proper experience to qualify as an expert. He is a buyer and a seller, not a renter.” (See Hope v. Phila. &amp; Western R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/211/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="211 Pa. 401" data-case-ids="940145" data-case-paths="/pa/211/0401-01">211 Pa. 401</a>, 403, <a href="/citations/?q=60%20A.%20996" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="60 A. 996">60 A. 996</a>.)</p>
    <p id="b480-5" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[279,2248,1149,200]]]'>My conclusions are: plaintiff sustained legal injuries that were compensable under the law; his case was submitted to the jury with erroneous instructions; there should be a new trial.</p>
