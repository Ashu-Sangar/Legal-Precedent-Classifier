In our review, in accord with the established rule, we inquire only whether, on the facts developed at this stage of the pi’oceeding, the injunction should have been continued, necessarily withholding any expression of opinion on the merits until after final hearing and decree: Casinghead Gas Co. v.

As they had entered subject to the terms of the original mine lease by plaintiffs’ predecessors to Moffitt- Steifiing Gas Coal Company, they were necessarily bound by its terms. Two days later, June <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>23, 1932, plaintiffs sold to one of the defendants, MapelSterling Coal Company, “5,000 tons of coal in place in the Pittsburgh seam of coal......[part of the coal described in the original mine lease]......and the 5,000 tons hereby sold are to be mined and removed from that portion which was formerly assigned to the Mapel-Sterling Coal Company and are to be mined and removed in accordance with the best methods of mining and removing coal so as to protect said mine. The said five thousand toms of coal hereby sold are to be mined and removed within the next thirty days, and when said five thousand tons of coal are removed the said Mapel-Sterling Coal Company shall cease operations in said mine, and that this agreement for the sale of said five thousand tons is not in any way to affect the notice heretofore given to terminate said leasehold estate further than the right to remove the said five thousand tons of said coal.”</p>

He was of opinion that six months’ notice of cancellation was necessary pursuant to the original mine lease and that plaintiffs’ bill was premature. We do not think so. The parties are in equity. They were competent to agree, and if the defendants, expressly or by implication, waived applicable conditions of the original mine lease, to the terms of which they were subject, and, in compliance with the notice, ceased mining on or about June 21, 1932, they must abide the consequences of their conduct, and no <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>reason yet appears in the record why they should not do so.</p>
    <p id="b559-3" data-blocks='[["BL_559.4",559,[194,449,1152,698]]]'>Having placed themselves in that position, let us consider what they did then. On June 23,1932, as has been said, plaintiffs sold to one of defendants 5,000 tons of coal in place, to be mined as provided in the agreement, part of which has been quoted above. There is evidence that defendants not only mined the 5,000 tons but some 40,000 tons additional for which they have not paid; that they have not mined “in accordance with the best methods of mining and removing coal so as best to protect and preserve said mine.” Certainly if those assertions are true — and for present purposes we must accept them — plaintiffs have made out a case requiring immediate equitable intervention. until final hearing.</p>
    <p id="b559-4" data-blocks='[["BL_559.5",559,[192,1158,1154,751]]]'>The evidence supports the conclusion that defendants are estopped from claiming the benefit of the provision requiring six months’ notice. Why should they buy and pay for 5,000 tons of the coal on June 23d if they already had the right to mine it? Or agree to mine it in 30 days if they had the right to mine it on their own time? Or consent that the agreement of June 23d should “not in any way [affect] the notice heretofore given to terminate said leasehold estate further than the right to remove the said 5,000 tons of said coal,” if the notice was not accepted absolutely? Moreover, the evidence is that they entered, pursuant to that agreement, conducted mining operations, failed to keep their agreement to withdraw, and mined in excess of the tonnage purchased.</p>

It would violate that equitable rule now to permit the defendants to assert that they may disregard the cancellation notice and enjoy a right to continue the mining under the cancelled mine lease, after having made the purchase of the 5,000 tons with the right to mine it subject to the conditions already quoted: Bispham, Equity (9th <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>ed.), section 282; Miranville v.
