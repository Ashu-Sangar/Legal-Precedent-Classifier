Both averments were specifically denied in the answer.

This court, however, in considering them has never impressed the strong arm of an equitable injunction unless the circumstances imperatively required it. There must be present evidence showing either disorder, coercion, intimidation, violence, boycott, or threats or acts looking to the same end, no matter how those forces may be set in motion or brought to bear on the parties; unless physical violence, fear or molestation, or breach of the peace follow, or are likely to follow these acts, or property rights are unlawfully damaged, our courts have always refused to act.</p>

When we depart from this course and assume an arbitrary attitude in favor of either of the parties, we then destroy our usefulness as courts in maintaining law and order, and more especially as the arbiters in matters where justice alone should prevail. Property rights would rest on insecure foundations, and our decision, contrary to the justice of the cause, would so circumscribe the objects of one of the parties as to make its existence useless as a factor in social life tending to better “the living conditions of a large part of the body politic,” or as a very much needed agency for employment.</p>

Had this been the course pursued an injunction could not properly have been granted. Appellants also had the right, at a proper time and in a proper way, to point out to plaintiff’s employees that their contracts, whether legal or illegal, were unAvise, and hence the employees should exercise their privilege to ‘withdraw from the employment of said company.’ This much is secured to the citizen by the constitutional provision that: ‘The free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.’ ”</p>

No intimidation or coercion can be predicated on these facts. There was no congregation of people or any occasion for a congregation because of the movement of the automobile. The music did not tend to draw a crowd of noisy or disorderly people (Edmunds v. Duff, <a href="/pa/280/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="280 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="1084480" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0355-01">280 Pa. 355</a>), and the defendant had the same right to use a music-producing box to attract attention as any merchant had. Of course, if it played loud, boisterous music, it would constitute a nuisance, and the authorities or any person might in a proper proceeding secure redress for it.</p>
    <p id="b113-3" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[191,1146,1153,1014]]]'>The placards on the sides of the automobile did not contain a single line that would coerce, intimidate, or in the slightest degree control the mind. They stated that the theatre did not employ members of organized labor and “we respectfully urge you as our friend not to patronize the above theatre.” This language involved no element of coercion or intimidation, either as a fact or in the legal sense of these terms. What coercion can be predicated on a simple request made in writing on a placard or on a card not to deal with, trade, or do business with a certain named individual? The minds of the parties who received or saw the notice were free to follow their unrestrained inclination; they were at entire liberty to go to the theatre unmolested if they saw fit. There was not the slightest allusion to a threat of any character. The writing itself was sufficient evidence of its own innocence, yet this was the substantial ground of appellee’s complaints. See Nann v. Raimist, <a href="/ny/255/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="255 N.Y. 307" data-case-ids="1994842" data-case-paths="/ny/255/0307-01">255 N. Y. 307</a>.</p>

    <p id="b114-4" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[280,433,1150,907]]]'>Appellee contends that the distribution of the cards by the three or four members of the union on the streets was an unlawful picketing. This question was not raised by the pleadings, nor was any evidence submitted to directly show such activity. There is no question here of the right to picket in a strike. There has been no attempt by respondents to induce complainant’s present employees to cease work as punishment to the owner, or to force men to join the union. . It may have been, and no doubt was, the purpose of the union, through the acts complained of, to secure work for union men even though it resulted in the discharge of nonunion men: Pickett v. Walsh, <a href="/mass/192/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="192 Mass. 572" data-case-ids="463634" data-case-paths="/mass/192/0572-01">192 Mass. 572</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=78%20N.E.%20753" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="78 N.E. 753">78 N. E. 753</a>. The court below construed certain acts to be an unlawful picketing and enjoined them, and in so doing the judge not only went beyond the prayer of the bill, but the facts on this record will not sustain his decree.</p>

The mere distribution of the cards was not evidence of it; they were passed out like thousands of store or other similar circulars are to-day. The men distributing the cards did not speak to the patrons. The cards were handed out for the purpose of inducing the public not to attend the theatre, which, as we have shown above, is a perfectly legal means of accomplishing the main and undoubted purpose, to wit, securing employment for union men. The distribution was not calculated to, nor did it, create fear for their personal safety if they continued to go to the theatre. There was no annoyance, intimidation, or moral coercion from these acts. It is true a few men were posted in <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>front of the theatre building and handed cards to those entering, but they did not go upon the theatre property, and this distribution of cards occurred on one day only. Of course such conduct in front of or adjoining the theatre entrance, continued over a period of time, would create a situation calculated to éngender annoyance, fear, and intimidation of possible patrons: Bomes v. Providence Local No. 223 (R. I.), <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20581" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="155 A. 581">155 A. 581</a>. In that case, the men having placards on their hats, of the .same tenor as' the cards here, spoke to patrons in a manner intended to create an impression of danger. The judge in that case found coercion and intimidation from the manner of approach to patrons. No such evidence appears in our case. Standing alone, acts such as passing cards would indeed be a novel form of “unlawful picketing.” The distribution of store or other like circulars would all fall within such category.</p>
    <p id="b115-3" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[181,1256,1154,587]]]'>The defendants had the right of communication, or persuasion, provided their appeals were not abusive, ■libelous, or threatening, and that the manner of approach to persons visiting the theatre was orderly. We have decided this so often that citation of authorities is scarcely necessary. The court below in its decree went far beyond any prayer contained in the bill. We hold that the court was clearly in error in granting the injunction, as the acts complained of have not a single element that thé courts have deemed essential for equitable relief in a proceeding of this sort.</p>
