E.

Appellant’s cause of action rests on two contracts of sale each of which contains in paragraph four thereof a provision reading: “No warranties have been made by the seller unless endorsed hereon in writing.” Notwithstanding this provision in the contracts, appellant alleges that defendant’s agents orally represented that the trucks described in the contracts had been manufactured in certain particular years. As the record stands, to permit the alleged warranty to be proven would be to depart from the law as interpreted by this court. In Hill &amp; MacMillan, Inc., v. Taylor et al., <a href="/pa/304/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="304 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1132409" data-case-paths="/pa/304/0018-01">304 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=155%20A.%20103" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="155 A. 103">155 A. 103</a>, we said: “The courts have during recent years insisted upon rigid adherence to the rule that when parties commit their engagements to writing, i. e., integrate their understandings and agreements into a formal, explicit contract and when they exclude from the contract, as they did here, all previous communications not contained in the contract and provide that no modification shall be binding unless in writing, they cannot be permitted, in a suit brought on the written contract, to prove parol modifications of that contract unless they aver fraud, accident or mistake in omitting from the writing sued on the terms afterwards offered in evidence.” In this case now before us, as in the one just cited, there is no such averment.</p>
