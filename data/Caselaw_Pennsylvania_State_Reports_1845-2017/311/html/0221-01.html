If we understand the positions taken by plaintiff in the argument, they are that the wrongful conduct of both the agent, and the medical examiner, in recording-false answers, relieves the plaintiff of the effect of the breach of warranty; that there was no breach of warranty because “there is no limitation of the agent’s authority set forth in the printed application,” and that, in any event, “the applicant’s good faith” was for the jury.</p>

Koppelman might have but did not read the application signed by him, and, in consequence, contended that he was ignorant of a limitation of the agent’s power expressed in the application, and was, therefore, not bound by what he had signed; we held that he must be treated as knowing what he <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>would have learned by reading the application. The scope of the presumption is not restricted to the mere discovery of the limitation of the agent’s authority; the applicant is presumed to know all that a reading of his application would have revealed. In Sinker’s case, we said: “There is no allegation that the applicant was blind or deaf or that she was unable to read. The statement simply is that she signed the paper without reading it. If she was incorrectly reported therein, it was then her own fault.” In Fletcher’s case the Supreme Court cited with approval Ryan v. World Mutual Ins. Co., <a href="/conn/41/0168-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="41 Conn. 168" data-case-ids="745416" data-case-paths="/conn/41/0168-01">41 Conn. 168</a>, and said: “The application was signed without being read. It was held that the company was not bound by the policy; that the power of the agent would not be extended to an act done by him in fraud of the company and for the benefit of the insured, especially where it was in the power of the assured by reasonable diligence, to defeat the fraudulent intent; that the signing of the application without reading it or hearing it read, was inexcusable negligence; and that a party is bound to know what he signs.” In Newsholme’s case, the Court of Appeals said: “In any case a man who has signed, without reading it, a document which he knows to be a proposal for insurance, and which contains statements in fact untrue and a promise that they are true and are to be the basis of the contract, cannot escape from the consequences of his negligence by saying that the person he asked to fill it up for him was the agent of the Insurance Company.”</p>

The only witnesses called were the widow of the insured, and her brother, one, Bell. She was not present when the application was signed. Bell was manager of decedent’s business and states that he was present. Applebaum, the insured, was able to read; he was not unacquainted with insurance applications, having two other policies, besides having had experience with other applications. If it became necessary to consider plaintiff’s contention that defendant is estopped from insisting on the breaches of warranty or false representation (plaintiff’s alternate position) we should be required to hold that the evidence to support the contention is not clear and satisfactory within the rule applied in Suravitz v. Prudential Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/261/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="261 Pa. 390" data-case-ids="1042228" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0390-01">261 Pa. 390</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20754" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="104 A. 754">104 A. 754</a>, and Panopoulos v.

Superior Ct. 415</a>, and that plaintiff’s case, which fails for breach of Warranty, would also fail for that reason. This would follow because Bell’s evidence, instead of being clear or satisfactory, is peculiarly unsatisfactory as a basis of confident inference. His recollection is uncertain; he contradicts the documents, or testifies about a different transaction from that under investigation, or is mistaken in material statements. In Pusic v. Salak, <a href="/pa/261/0512-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="261 Pa. 512" data-case-ids="1042272" data-case-paths="/pa/261/0512-01">261 Pa. 512</a>, 519, <a href="/citations/?q=104%20A.%20751" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="104 A. 751">104 A. 751</a>, we said: “the witness must be credible and the facts distinctly remembered and accurately stated.” The application and the medical examiner’s report, both signed by Applebaum, were dated November 6,1929, the date on which they were executed. Notwithstanding that, Bell testifies that the insured signed the application three weeks before. His testimony concerning the signing of the application is not only uncertain, but so indefinite that, after studying it, we have <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>been unable to understand exactly what he means. He states that the insured signed the medical examiner’s report before the examination was completed. Before evidence can be submitted to the jury for the purpose proposed by the plaintiff, the judge must be satisfied that it is clear and satisfactory; unless it reach that standard, it should not go to the jury: Miller’s Est., <a href="/pa/279/0030-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="279 Pa. 30" data-case-ids="1083460" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0030-01">279 Pa. 30</a>, 38, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20646" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="123 A. 646">123 A. 646</a>. Apparently the agent who presented the application blank to be filled in was named Speiser, though it is not witnessed by him, but by another person who could not have been present if Bell’s evidence is correct.</p>

The insurance agent neither did nor said anything that interfered with the applicant’s reading the application; it was interrupted and stopped, according to Bell, because of a message from the agent’s brother apparently given to Applebaum at some prior time over the telephone. Bell also testified that Applebaum told the medical examiner that he had been rejected before, and that “he don’t think he will pass”; to which the <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>examiner stated, “Well, we can put you through tbits company if anybody turned you down.” In plaintiffs reply to new matter she avers that “said insured fully advised the medical examiner that he had applied for life insurance in other companies and that he had been rejected by such companies as a suitable risk.” Applebaum’s knowledge of prior rejection, and of its probable effect on this application (referred to several times in the evidence) considered with Bell’s account of why Applebaum did not read what he certified to be correct in the two papers signed by him, makes it appropriate to quote the following: “In Swan v. Watertown Fire Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/96/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="96 Pa. 37" data-case-ids="494605" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0037-01">96 Pa. 37</a>, the insured signed an application which had not been finished. He directed another to fill it up, and expressed doubt as to the manner in which it should be done.

He could claim nothing because of such information in the keeping of unfaithful subordinates. Moreover, the false representations accompanied and were essential parts of the policies finally ' accepted.
