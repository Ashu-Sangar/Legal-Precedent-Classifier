The jury awarded $750 <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>to James T. Sheasley and $3,500 to Mrs. Sheasley against Charles D. Haney, finding defendant Rising not guilty of negligence. Defendant Haney appeals from the refusal of a new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto. An examination of the record convinces us that the case was carefully <em>tried; </em>the various questions which arose as to the alleged negligence of the respective defendants were for the jury, and were laid before them in a full and correct charge in which we find no cause for reversal.</p>
