        "text": "SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nUpon reconsideration, the trial court was directed to file a supplemental opinion explicating the standard upon which remittitur was granted, and the parties were given opportunity to file briefs in response to the supplemental opinion. To clarify our decision, we enter this brief supplement to the opinion of the court.\nOn remand, the trial court wrote:\n[W]e are being asked whether we found that \u2018the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to suggest that the jury was influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake, or corruption.\u2019 If pressed to apply that standard, we determine that the $8,000,000 verdict \u2018so shocks our sense of justice\u2019 so as to suggest that the jury was influenced \u2018by mistake\u2019 and by \u2018partiality.\u2019\nIf the trial judge is put in the position of echoing the \u2018magic words\u2019 of Carminati [v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 405 Pa. 500, 509, 176 A.2d 440, 445 (1962)] as to determining whether the verdict \u2018shocks the sense of justice,\u2019 or, as it has evolved, is \u2018shocking to the conscience\u2019 (see Tulewicz v. SEPTA, 529 Pa. 584, 606 A.2d 425 (1991), the trial judge will say \u2018yes,\u2019 and the other member of this Court en banc concurs in that statement.\nSlip op. at 4, 6. This is the correct standard.\nThe statement in our opinion dated March 29, 1994, that the en banc trial court \u201cunderstandably\u201d failed to state that the verdict shocked the court\u2019s conscience or sense of justice, has resulted in uncertainty as to the standard for granting a remittitur. The trial court\u2019s failure to use the words \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d was \u201cunderstandable\u201d in that our opinion in Scaife Co. v. Rockwell-Standard Corp., 446 Pa. 280, 290, 285 A.2d 451, 456-57 (1971), might have been read to eliminate the use of those words. Such a reading, however, is erroneous. In Scaife we condemned the bare use of such conclusory statements, insisting instead that the court\u2019s conclusion be supported by additional underlying reasons. If a trial court states only that a verdict shocks the conscience of the court, meaningful appellate review is impossible, but such a statement is necessary to insure that the correct standard is being applied. When a court finds that a verdict shocks its conscience, it must articulate both the conclusion and the reasons supporting a reduction of the verdict.\nThe trial court\u2019s opinions make it clear that the $8,000,000 verdict shocked the court\u2019s sense of justice and was shocking to the conscience. In addition, the court stated its supporting reasons for that conclusion. Accordingly, there was no. abuse of discretion, and the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nCAPPY, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion which is joined by PAPADAKOS, J.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.",

In my view, the error lies with the trial court\u2019s application of that standard to these facts in reaching its conclusion. \u25a0\nPAPADAKOS, J., joins in this concurring and dissenting opinion.",
