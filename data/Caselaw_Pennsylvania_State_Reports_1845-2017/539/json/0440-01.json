Scuilli, and a municipal police officer is not binding upon the District Attorney of Allegheny County. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court affirming the trial court\u2019s dismissal of charges against appellee is reversed, 423 Pa.Super. 453, 621 A.2d 620, and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\nPAPADAKOS, J., concurs in the result.\nCAPPY, J., files a dissenting opinion which is joined by ZAPPALA, J.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.",

Stipetich, 539 Pa. 428, 652 A.2d 1294 (1993). Upon review of the record in this case I cannot agree that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion to dismiss the prosecution.\nAs .in the Stipetich case, the trial court heard testimony regarding the \u201cagreement not to prosecute\u201d and found on the facts of this case, where it appeared that the allegations of child sexual abuse were related to the defendant\u2019s pending divorce from the child\u2019s mother, that sufficient grounds existed to grant the motion to dismiss. It appears from the record in this case that the dismissal was closely related to the facts at issue. The charges were initially made during the early stages of the divorce and then refiled two years later, when the family division agreed to allow the defendant unsupervised visitation with the child.\nGiven the careful consideration of the testimony of the parties by the trial court, I am loathe to find that the trial court abused its discretion.\nZAPPALA, J., joins in this dissenting opinion.",
