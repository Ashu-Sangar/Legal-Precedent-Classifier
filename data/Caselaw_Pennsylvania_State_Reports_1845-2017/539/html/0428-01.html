However, when an agreement is negotiated due process requires that the defendants, who fulfilled their obligations under that agreement be treated with fairness and justice. Having a court decide how to best protect the rights of the accused, as was done here, does not, by any stretch of the imagination, mean that non-prosecution agreements entered into by police officers will bar the district attorney from subsequently deciding to pursue a prosecution. The judiciary, in its supervisory power, always has the authority to fashion a remedy that meets the needs of the situation at hand.

The district attorney appealed, arguing that the time period which elapsed between when the <em>nolle pros </em>was granted and when it was vacated cannot be considered in determining whether or not a speedy trial violation has occurred, because a decision to <em>nolle pros </em>is wholly within the discretion of the district attorney. The Court rejected this argument and reiterated their holding from <em>DiPasquale: </em>“the district attorney’s power to decide whether and when to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case is subject to the power of the court to supervise all court proceedings and to protect the accused’s right to a fair trial.” <em>Whitaker </em>at 443, <a href="/pa/467/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="467 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1717283" data-case-paths="/pa/467/0436-01">359 A.2d at 177</a>.</p>

As the Commonwealth suggested in this case, suppression of the information garnered via the non-prosecution agreement may be the best remedy in certain cases. However, the remedy is within the discretionary power of the trial court to ascertain, which brings me to my initial point: the real issue in this case is whether or not the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motion to dismiss.</p>

The district attorney also argued that the non-prosecution agreement was invalid as the parties thereto failed to obtain the approval of the district attorney.
