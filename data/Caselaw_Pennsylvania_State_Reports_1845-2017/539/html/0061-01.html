Post-verdict motions were argued and denied, and the trial court sentenced Appellant to death on February 1, 1991 on the murder of the first degree conviction and to a consecutive term of 5-10 years imprisonment on the attempted rape conviction to be followed by a consecutive term of 1-5 years imprisonment on the possession of an instrument of crimes charge. The trial court also ruled that the aggravated assault convictions merged for sentencing purposes into the murder of the first degree conviction as lesser included offenses and that the indecent assault conviction merged for sentencing purposes into the attempted rape conviction as a lesser included offense. This automatic appeal followed.</p>

      <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>The evidence presented at trial, together with all reasonable inferences in favor of the Commonwealth, discloses the following. On Sunday morning, September 17, 1989, at approximately 2:55 a.m., Reading police officers were summoned to the 400 block of Gilson Alley in Reading, Pennsylvania, to investigate a report of an injured woman. Upon their arrival, Officer Hafner was met by Appellant and his father, Albert Norman. They took Officer Hafner to a place in the alley where a partially clothed woman was lying facedown next to two garbage trucks owned by Appellant’s father. The officer saw a substantial amount of blood in the cab of one of the garbage trucks and a trail of blood could be detected from the truck to the body. Blood was also found on the doorway of the cab and in the seat area. The victim, twenty-three year old Jacqueline Lugo, was found with her panties pulled down around her thighs, her shirt pulled up under her arms and her bra ripped in the front. Both her eyes had been beaten closed and she had sustained at least five other blows to the face. Her neck showed signs of being choked and a stab wound to her neck pierced through to her throat and tongue. Numerous stab wounds were found on her torso and dirt and stones were found inside her panties.</p>
    <p id="b205-5" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[185,1509,1152,472]]]'>Dr. Neil A. Hoffman, a forensic pathologist, who was also at the crime scene, observed the body and later determined that the cause of death was a stab wound through the heart. Similar stab wounds were detected on the left side of the victim’s neck, in the middle of her chest and in her abdomen near her navel and police eventually retrieved a broken knife blade and another knife from the crime area which could have easily made the types of stab wounds observed on the victim’s body.</p>
    <p id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[184,2003,1153,365]],["BL_206.1",206,[256,310,1151,261]]]'>Officer Albert D. Shade, Jr., who was dispatched to the crime scene with Officer Hafner, also found a yellow shirt stained with blood in a wooded area near the body. This shirt was later identified as having been worn by Appellant on the day of the murder and another witness was able to testify that Appellant was wearing the shirt just prior to the murder. When the officers arrived at Gilson Alley, Appellant was <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>wearing a jacket without a shirt and his hands and forehead were covered in blood as was the inside of his jacket. Blood was also found on the inside of Appellant’s waistband and underwear, suggesting that they got stained with blood when Appellant’s pant’s zipper was open and his pants were down.</p>
    <p id="b206-5" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[255,614,1150,369]]]'>There was evidence that yellow fibers were found in the victim’s bra and panties and that these fibers originated from the bloody yellow shirt worn by Appellant on the night of the murder and a fiber consistent with the victim’s clothing was found in Appellant’s boxer shorts. Evidence was also introduced that pubic hairs with the same microscopic characteristics as that of the victim were recovered from Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.5",206,[252,1026,1152,645]]]'>The blood found on the inner lining of Appellant’s jacket was the same blood type as that of the victim and expert testimony established that a blood stain on the yellow shirt was consistent with having been produced by wiping blood from a blood-bearing object or instrument, like a knife. In addition to this blood stain, there were other blood stains on Appellant’s jacket and on the yellow shirt that were caused by “spatter stains.” These stains consisted of small blood droplets aligned in a distinct pattern and were created when a blood source was punctured. The small pinpoint droplets found in Appellant’s jacket indicated that they were caused by a puncture wound made with great force.</p>

From the nature of the injuries to her body, a jury could infer that the homicide was intentional, malicious and premeditated. Finally, the jury could conclude from the types of blood stains on Appellant’s garments and the bloody yellow shirt that he was seen wearing during the day and prior to the murder that Appellant committed the crime. Accordingly, we are satisfied that sufficient evidence exists in this record to support the jury’s verdict of murder of the first degree, and dismiss Appellant’s sufficiency chai<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>lenge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Appellant further argues that in light of this initial violation of his constitutional rights, the incriminating statements he made following his finally being advised of his constitutional rights were also tainted and should have been suppressed in accordance with the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine. <em>Wong Sun v.

When the police arrived at the crime scene at approximately 2:55 a.m., on September 17, 1989, they were met by Appellant and his father. Appellant admitted to the police that he called them to the scene and further explained that he found the victim as he was walking through the alleyway and noticed a door ajar on one of his father’s garbage trucks. He also told the police that he found the victim in the front seat of the cab in an upright position behind the steering wheel. Appellant then explained to the police that he pulled the victim from the truck placing her on the ground approximately ten feet away from where he initially found her and that he covered the body. At this point, Appellant went to his father’s house and told him of his discovery. Appellant’s father then told Appellant to call the police which he did. Appellant related his account to the police while showing them where he had placed the body.</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.5",208,[233,1458,1155,898]],["BL_209.1",209,[166,316,1151,463]]]'>Following this initial conversation, the police conducted an investigation of the crime scene and asked Appellant to accompany them to City Hall to be interviewed. Appellant was told that he was being taken to City Hall as a witness and was driven to City Hall in the marked patrol car in which the police arrived. He was not frisked or handcuffed and when he arrived at City Hall he was asked to wait in an unlocked office for the arrival of the detective that normally questions witnesses in homicide cases. The officer in question, Detective George, had to be awakened because of the lateness of the hour and he arrived at City Hall within 45 minutes, at approximately 3:40 a.m., to conduct his conversation with Appellant. This interview was held in an unlocked room and Appellant was told twice he could leave if he so wished. Appellant was asked to draw a diagram of where he initially found the body and in response to this question, Appellant suggested it might be easier to return to the crime scene so <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>that he could actually show the area to the police. Detective George took Appellant back to the scene in an unmarked police car where he showed the officers where he found the body and how he moved it. Again, there is no evidence to show that Appellant was frisked or handcuffed or that the police car used to transport Appellant from City Hall to the crime scene and then back to City Hall was anything but a normal car with windows that opened from the inside and doors that locked from the inside.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[164,812,1153,901]]]'>Detective George testified that there were inconsistencies from the lighting conditions that he observed at the scene with the conditions that Appellant had described and he also observed blood stains on the inside of Appellant’s jacket which seemed inconsistent with Appellant’s claim that he got bloody while dragging the victim’s body. Once back at the police station, Detective George asked Appellant to take a polygraph test and Appellant then asked whether he could call his father. Detective George answered that Appellant could call anyone he wished and during Appellant’s conversation with his father, Detective George overheard the word “lawyer” and then he advised Appellant that he would help him contact an attorney if he so wished. When Appellant finished his conversation with his father, Appellant indicated that he would take the polygraph test and Detective George told Appellant he was free to leave City Hall at that time, but Appellant indicated he would rather stay to straighten out the situation.</p>

He was alone in this room, unsupervised, without handcuffs and the door was open. Prior to the beginning of the test, Sergeant Stajkowski, who administered the polygraph test, read Appellant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and Appellant waived these warnings and took the test. During the test, his freedom was unrestricted and he actually went to the men’s room unaccompanied at approximately 9:30 a.m. He returned to finish the test and other breaks were taken during the test and he was provided food at various intervals. After the test was completed, Appellant fell asleep in a cubicle <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>in City Hall where he remained until 1:20 p.m., when he was arrested. Up until this time, Appellant remained in unlocked surroundings, was never handcuffed or frisked and had unrestricted access to leave City Hall.</p>
    <p id="b210-5" data-blocks='[["BL_210.4",210,[265,541,1152,689]]]'>Appellant argues, however, that from the time he was asked to come to City Hall at approximately 3:30 a.m., he was subjected to a custodial interrogation and, therefore, he should have been advised of his constitutional right to remain silent at that time. Appellant cites that he was taken to City Hall in a “prisoner’s cage” section of a police car, was not allowed to wash once he arrived at City Hall and had to wait 45 minutes for the arrival of Detective George as being consistent with police conduct which would make one believe that their freedom of action had been curtailed. Because <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not given, Appellant argues that all the evidence acquired against him was illegally obtained and that it should have been suppressed. We disagree.</p>

He was transported to City Hall in the back seat of the police cruiser in which the police arrived (which Appellant calls the prisoner’s cage) and was not frisked or placed in handcuffs during the trip to City Hall or thereafter. Moreover, he was not placed in a secured waiting area even when he was being interrogated in City Hall. The police had no reason to believe that Appellant was involved in a homicide at this time especially since Appellant placed the initial call to the police telling them to come the crime scene. Accordingly, we reject Appellant’s assertion that the significance of the conduct of the police when they asked him to come to City Hall for questioning under these circumstances was such that his freedom of movement had been restricted. Rather, it appears that the police’s conduct at this time was entirely consistent with the questioning of a cooperative witness who had reported a crime and who might have significant information to convey to the police.</p>

Appellant was not handcuffed or frisked once .he arrived at City Hall and was not put in a locked or guarded room. He was fed and told many times that he was free to leave and it appears that he voluntarily stayed at City Hall until the polygraph test was completed. Additionally, if Appellant did not take the time to wash off his blood-soaked body it was not because he was prevented from doing so by the police. To the contrary, it appears that Appellant never showed any interest in washing-up and since he had free access to the bathrooms we can only conclude that if Appellant wished to clean up he was at liberty to do so. We are mindful, of course, that Appellant had to wait for 45 minutes until Detective George arrived at City Hall but, as already indicated, Appellant was not placed in a locked room nor was he handcuffed and he was told he was to be questioned as a witness and not as a suspect. We see no reason to disturb the trial court’s findings that Appellant was not-in custody during <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>his initial interview, second visit to the crime scene, and return to City Hall up until the time he was actually read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>

Appellant stresses that his history of convictions was always available to the Commonwealth and its attempt to amend its Rule 352 notice to add an aggravating circumstance which it was or should have been aware of violates the rule and should not be permitted. Appellant concludes from these circumstances that he was not given sufficient time or information to prepare for the sentencing hearing within the meaning of Rule 352 and that it was error for the trial court to allow evidence of this aggravating circumstance to be admitted at the sentencing hearing.</p>

The Rule allows the Commonwealth to amend its notice if it notifies the defendant promptly of the existence of an additional aggravating circumstance after arraignment and the Commonwealth relies on this portion of the comment to the rule to justify its conduct in notifying Appellant that it would seek to establish Appellant’s significant history of prior felony convictions upon the assertion that notice was given as soon as these convictions were discovered.</p>

No such situation is presented by these facts and we conclude that the trial court erred in allowing the amendment and in permitting evidence of Appellant’s prior felony convictions at the sentencing hearing to establish the aggravating circumstance that Appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(9)).</p>

To burden the defense, at this point in time, with considerations which could and should have been brought to their attention at or before arraignment forces the defense to shift its concentration from the matters at hand (jury selection and trial) wherein lies the prejudice.

The purpose of Rule 352 is clear. “It is intended to give the defendant sufficient time to prepare for the <em>sentencing </em>hearing.” <em>Comment, </em>Pa.R.Crim.P. 352 (1992) (emphasis added). Here, jury selection began on November 26, 1990. The Commonwealth specifically became aware of appellant’s prior criminal convic<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>tions on November 28,1990 and advised appellant’s counsel on that same date of its intention to use his prior convictions as an additional aggravating circumstance. Trial testimony did not begin until January 9,1991, five and a half weeks after the Commonwealth notified appellant’s counsel of its intention to use the additional aggravating circumstance at sentencing. On January 23, 1991 trial testimony concluded and the jury convicted appellant of first degree murder. The sentencing phase of trial itself did not begin until January 24,1991, nearly <em>two months </em>after the Commonwealth notified appellant’s counsel of its intention to use appellant’s criminal record as a third aggravating circumstance. Finally, on January 25, 1991, the jury sentenced appellant to death. Certainly, two months is more than sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly, the Commonwealth clearly satisfied the purpose of Rule 352.</p>
    <p id="b218-5" data-blocks='[["BL_218.4",218,[250,1187,1148,148]]]'>Moreover, the Commonwealth’s post-arraignment notification fell within the exception to Rule 352. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 352 provides:</p>

Nothing in the plain meaning of Rule 352, however, imposes an affirmative duty upon the Commonwealth <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>to conclude its investigative conduct, such as the ascertainment of a defendant’s criminal record, at or before arraignment. Rather, Rule 352 imposes upon the Commonwealth only the duty to disclose what they <em>know at or before arraignment </em>so as not to prejudice the defendant by inadequate time to prepare a defense to the aggravating circumstances. Here, the information was not known to the Commonwealth until <em>after </em>arraignment although appellant, as the convicted felon, had possessed this information for at least ten years prior to his trial. It is difficult to comprehend the majority’s harsh penalty upon the prosecution for a supposed lack of due diligence in learning the defendant’s prior record. It is even more difficult to comprehend the majority ascribing to the convicted individual a <em>tabula rasa </em>of ten years duration, which was only a decade later inscribed with a surprising reminder of his felonious misdeeds. There is no allegation of record that defense counsel was unaware of these convictions especially since the individual <em>most </em>aware of the convictions sat at counsel table with counsel.</p>
    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.4",219,[142,1356,1154,1015]]]'>Furthermore, the majority asserts that the Commonwealth’s notice of the third aggravating circumstance during jury selection prejudiced appellant because it possibly shifted the focus from jury selection to the sentencing phase. I would find that such a conclusion calls for sheer speculation given the facts of this matter. Notwithstanding that two months is sufficient time to prepare for the introduction of appellant’s criminal record at the penalty phase of trial, had the defense felt so burdened by the additional aggravating circumstance, it could have requested a continuance. Indeed, I submit that the defense’s failure to request a continuance in and of itself demonstrates that the defense felt unprejudiced by the post arraignment disclosure of the information. Moreover, this assertion of prejudicial distraction during jury selection is equally unpersuasive, especially where the Commonwealth notified the defense that they were seeking the death penalty on November 17, 1989, approximately one year and nine months <em>before </em>jury selection began. Surely, the defense was selecting a jury with that in mind.</p>

To the extent there may have been any surprise on behalf of the defense in learning of appellant’s prior history, such surprise was by virtue of defense counsel’s own failure to search the police files for these convictions, or simply to inquire of appellant this same information. The majority’s holding effectively elevates form over substance and raises technicality to a high art form. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority and would affirm the sentence of death.</p>

I think this reading unnecessarily expands Rule 352. The plain language of the Rule allows the Prosecutor to give notice of an aggravating circumstance after arraignment — when the prosecutor “becomes aware” of its existence. The purpose of this rule, as set out in the Comment following the Rule, is to- afford the defendant sufficient time to prepare for the sentencing phase.

The Majority states that notifying the defense of a third aggravating circumstance during jury selection causes the defense to switch its attention from the task at hand, and to focus on the sentencing phase. I disagree. The defense was already aware that the Commonwealth was seeking the death penalty and was selecting a jury with that in mind. The addition of a third aggravating factor did not prejudice the defense. The defense had two months between the time of notice and the sentencing phase. That two months constituted sufficient time for the defense to prepare for the penalty phase of the trial.
