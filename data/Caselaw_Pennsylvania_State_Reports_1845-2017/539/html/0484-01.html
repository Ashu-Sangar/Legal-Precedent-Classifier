Specifically, Powell alleged that PENNDOT had caused the death of her husband by negligently designing London Tract Road. Powell alleged in her amended complaint that the road where the crash occurred had no centerline designating the lanes of travel, no road markings or signs restricting passing, and no <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>shoulders or lateral clearance areas to provide room for emergency maneuvers.</p>

In <em>Dickens, </em>the plaintiff was struck by an automobile whose driver was fleeing at a high rate of speed from a police officer. The police officer had initiated the chase to stop the driver who was believed to be driving without a license and under the influence of drugs. The plaintiff sued the officer and his employer, the local township, alleging that the officer failed to exercise due care in the chase as the basis for a negligence action. We noted the general rule “that the criminal and negligent acts of third parties are superseding causes which absolve the original actor of liability for the harm caused by such third parties.” <em><a href="/pa/531/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="531 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1834343" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0127-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/531/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="531 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="1834343" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0127-01">at 130-31</a>, <a href="/pa/531/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="531 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="1834355" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0400-01">613 A.2d at 695</a>. Accordingly, we held that the driver’s criminal negligence, including driving without a license, not stopping when being pursued by a police officer, speeding through residential streets at 60 m.p.h, and ignoring a clearly marked stop sign, was a superseding intervening cause relieving the officer and the township of all liability.</p>

Thus, PENNDOT argues that Drumheller’s criminal negligence in driving under the influence automatically relieves it of any liability from the accident. As an initial matter, it should be noted that <em>Dickens </em>was concerned with immunity under the particular language of our governmental immunity statute, rather than our sovereign immunity statute. In any event, we do not believe that <em>Dickens </em>stands for the proposition that any criminal negligence renders an intervening force a superseding cause. We have previously recognized that criminal conduct does not act as a <em>per se </em>superseding force. In <em>Ford v. Jeffries, </em><a href="/pa/474/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="474 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1732149" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0588-01">474 Pa. 588</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0588-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="474 Pa. 588" data-case-ids="1732149" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0588-01">379 A.2d 111</a> (1977), a landlord allowed his house to become dilapidated and become a haven for rats, dogs and arsonists. When an arsonist set fire to the structure which damaged several adjacent houses, the landlord argued that the arsonists criminal conduct was a superseding cause as a matter of law relieving him of liability. We rejected this argument and held that it was a question for the jury to determine. Far from adopting any <em>per se </em>rule, in <em>Dickens, </em>we simply held that the <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>undisputed facts showed that the conduct of the driver was so “extraordinary” as to constitute a superseding cause as a matter of law. <em>See </em>57 Am.Jur.2d <em>Negligence </em>§ 601 (1989) (“[W]here the facts are uncontroverted and only one inference can be drawn, the question of whether there was a superseding or efficient intervening cause which would prevent the defendant’s act from being the proximate cause of the injury is a question of law for the court to determine.”) <em>Cf.

Instead, the proper focus is not on the criminal nature of the negligent act, but instead on whether the act was so extraordinary as not to be reasonably foreseeable. This was our approach in <em>Crowell. </em>There, the City of Philadelphia similarly argued that the defendant driver’s conviction for driving under the influence was a superseding cause that insulated the City from all liability. We rejected this argument and, instead, found that the driver’s actions in following the misplaced sign were entirely “foreseeable.” <em>Crowell, </em>531 Pa. at 413 n. 12, <a href="/pa/531/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="531 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="1834355" data-case-paths="/pa/531/0400-01">613 A.2d at </a>1185 n. 12.
