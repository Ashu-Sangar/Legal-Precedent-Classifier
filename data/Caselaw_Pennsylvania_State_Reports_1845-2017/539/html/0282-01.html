Scarfone testified that during the first telephone conversation, Manee asked him whether he knew if any marijuana was available. While Scarfone told Manee that he would see if any marijuana was available, in actuality, he reported the inquiry to Medley.- Medley instructed Scarfone what Manee should be told when Scarfone called Manee back.</blockquote>

It is undisputed that the initial calls between Scarfone and Manee were not recorded. There were three telephone conversations, secretly recorded, between Scarfone, Manee, and Medley. These three-way conversations disclose Manee negotiating the sale and delivery of the 100 pounds of marijuana for $50,000. Manee also agreed to fly to the Charlotte, North Carolina, airport to sample the marijuana he was buying, and to give Medley $1000 in expense money, with delivery of the 100 pounds to be made later in Pittsburgh.</blockquote>

Two days later Scarfone, accompanied by various law enforcement agents, came to Pittsburgh and met with Detective William Joyce of the narcotics section of the Pittsburgh Police. Joyce became the team leader for the finale. Ostensibly arranging for the delivery of the marijuana, Scarfone, in another recorded conversation, called Manee at his home and told him where Manee could meet Scarfone and the driver (actually an undercover agent) to complete the deal. Manee came to the designated meeting spot, displayed the money, and after the government agent agreed to exchange the marijuana at Mance’s house, Manee was arrested.</blockquote>

According to Manee, Scarfone had pressured him into buying some cocaine after Scarfone had provided Manee with a discounted hotel room and rental car in Florida. Through the ensuing years, Manee secured a college degree, obtained a good job with Westinghouse Electric Corporation, got married and had children. Manee claimed that Scarfone had called him some eight or ten times, starting in October, 1987. Manee testified that when Scarfone telephoned him toward the end of 1987, he told Manee that he was in financial trouble because he couldn’t pay the money he owed to some “big people,” who were threatening him. If Manee could help Scarfone sell their marijuana, it would reduce Scarfone’s debt. Manee asserted that he agreed to purchase the marijuana in order to help Scarfone.</blockquote>

In <em>Benchino, </em>the court conducted a thorough review of federal decisions involving outrageous government conduct and the due process defense, and concluded that “criminal investigations will be found to violate due process ‘only in the rarest and most outrageous circumstances.’ ” <em><a href="/pa-super/399/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="399 Pa.

The appellant in <em>Benchino </em>alleged outrageous government conduct where an arrested drug dealer, who was cooperating with the Commonwealth, indicated to the appellant that he wanted him to repay a large debt related to drug transactions that took place over one year earlier. The appellant and the dealer subsequently agreed that a third party (an undercover narcotics officer) would deliver cocaine to the appellant so that he could sell it and repay the debt. After reviewing the <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>analysis of various federal jurisdictions as well as the circumstances surrounding the investigation and arrest of the appellant, the Superior Court could find “no basis for holding that the investigatory techniques employed by the Commonwealth were so outrageous as to violate due process.” <em><a href="/pa-super/399/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="399 Pa.

    <p id="b427-5" data-blocks='[["BL_427.4",427,[191,685,1154,1550]]]'>We find the Superior Court’s well-reasoned analysis in <em>Benchino </em>to be applicable to the facts of the instant case. We note that it can be fairly observed that the methods of inducement employed by the confidential informant in the instant case do not rise to the level of those used by the informant in <em>Benchino. </em>Mance’s initial complaint with the police tactics used in this case is that the informer, Rocco Scarfone, was an untrained person who was permitted to initiate contact with suspected drug offenders without police supervision. Manee argues that during the initial conversations between Scarfone and himself, the police had no way of knowing how many times Scarfone called Manee; what methods of inducement Scarfone used on Manee; whether Manee had any initial interest in buying marijuana; or’what appeals Scarfone made to Manee. However, Manee does not allege that anything improper occurred during those conversations, but simply that the police did not supervise Scarfone during the preliminary conversations that resulted in the illegal drug transaction. Manee, in effect, would have this Court adopt a <em>per se </em>rule that prohibits a confidential informant from interacting with a potential subject of an undercover investigation without the prior direction and approval of the government. This we are not willing to do. The law provides sufficient protections and remedies to prevent improper methods of government persuasion and overreaching, none of which have been alleged here. Accordingly, we reject the claim that Mance’s due process rights were violated simply because the police did not monitor the content and manner of the initial conversations between Manee and Scarfone.</p>

In the instant case, it was reasonably necessary for the police to supply Manee with a sample of the marijuana that he would be buying in order to successfully maintain the credibility of the confidential informant and the police officers participating in the investigation. Additionally, the potential windfall that Manee expected to receive from the illegal drug transaction does not support a finding that his right to due process was violated; indeed monetary gain is the essential motivating force that drives sellers in a black market economy. Thus, we conclude that the marijuana sample given to Manee and the opportunity for large profit offered by the police do not support Mance’s claim that his right to due process was violated.</p>
    <p id="b428-5" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[227,1374,1152,688]]]'>Finally, we must address Mance’s claim that the police use of an informant who was paid a contingent fee violates due process under the state and federal constitutions. In the instant case, the informant, Scarfone, was paid a total of $1,500 ($500 from the Fort Lauderdale Police, $500 from the Pittsburgh Police, and $500 from the DEA) prior to Mance’s trial for his participation in the reverse sting operation. <em>Commonwealth v. Mance, </em>No. CC8802338, slip op. at 3 (C.P. Allegheny County November 18, 1991); (Reproduced Record at 53a). In addition, Scarfone received favorable treatment with respect to certain fraud charges that were pending against him. <em>Commonwealth v. Mance, </em>No. CC8802338, slip op. at 3; (Reproduced Record at 253a).</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[227,2087,1148,96]],["BL_429.1",429,[187,316,1155,1445]]]'>Based on our review of the record, we disagree with Mance’s characterization of the monies paid to Scarfone as a <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>contingent fee. Scarfone entered into a written agreement with the Fort Lauderdale Police which expressly stated that his compensation was “not in any manner contingent upon either the success of any criminal prosecution against any individual or entity or the success of any civil proceeding involving the forfeiture of any property that may be seized.” (Reproduced Record at 117a). Likewise, Scarfone’s payment was not contingent upon his testimony in either a criminal or civil proceeding. (Reproduced Record at 117a-118a). The record indicates that Scarfone received compensation for setting up the drug deal between Manee and law enforcement authorities and that Scarfone was paid shortly after Mance’s arrest. (Reproduced Record at 53a, 113a, 331a-333a). It is apparent that Scarfone’s payment was not contingent upon Mance’s conviction or Scarfone’s testimony at trial. <em>See United States v. Shearer, </em><a href="/f2d/794/1537-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="794 F.2d 1545" data-case-ids="1591230" data-case-paths="/f2d/794/1537-01">794 F.2d 1545</a> (11th Cir.1986) (fee paid to informer before defendant’s trial was not contingent on conviction and therefore did not violate due process rights). Scarfone’s role in the reverse sting was nothing more than that of facilitator between the police and Manee. The fact that Scarfone was compensated for his involvement in the investigation was a matter that the jury was free to consider in assessing the credibility of Scarfone as a witness. Thus, we conclude that Mance’s due process rights were not violated when law enforcement authorities paid a fee to Rocco Scarfone for his participation in the reverse sting that resulted in Mance’s arrest.</p>
