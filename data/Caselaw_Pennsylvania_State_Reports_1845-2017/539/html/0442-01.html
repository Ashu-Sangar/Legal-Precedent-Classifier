Martin, Appellant, injured his lower back during the course of his employment with Emmaus Bakery, Appellee. Appellant was totally disabled due to the injury which was diagnosed as a possible disc herniation, the type of injury which is routinely treated by chiropractic manipulation and physiotherapy. Appellant immediately began chiropractic treatment with Dr. Gary Tarola, a Board certified specialist in chiropractic orthopedics. As a result of the <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>chiropractic treatment and physiotherapy, Appellant was able to return to work on June 9, 1989, seven days after his work-related injury.</p>

However, the referee denied Appellant’s claim petition seeking reimbursement. In rendering his decision, the referee concluded that despite Appellee’s posting of a panel of physicians in accordance with Section 306(f)(1) of the Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act (the Act) of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. § 531(1), Appellant, instead, elected to seek treatment from a chiropractor, which precluded him from remuneration.</p>

The latitude the employer is given in creating a list of designated physicians and practitioners of the healing arts is obviously designed to afford an employer an opportunity to direct its injured employees, in the first two weeks of an injury, to physicians and practitioners of the employer’s preference. Admittedly, it is impossible to predict all the different types of job-related injuries which can befall an employee, but when an employer fails to include on the designated list those physicians or practitioners required by the injured employee for proper treatment of a particular job-related injury, we see nothing in the statute that prevents the employer from being required to pay for the employee’s treatment by the physician or practitioner which the employee’s injury dictates. <em>Overmyer </em>does not stand for a different proposition and, in fact, as in <em>Overmyer, </em>we see no evidence in the statute’s amendment of legislative intent to take away an employee’s right to use the type of practitioner of the healing arts needed when none are in the list designated by the employer.</p>

Appellee’s list of designated physicians and practitioners of the healing arts did not include any chiropractors. As a result, Appellant was required to choose his own chiropractor. The Commonwealth Court’s interpretation of Section 306(f)(1), as a practical matter, would force injured workers to wait fourteen days before seeking proper treatment where an employer fails to include a suitable physician or practitioner of the healing arts on its designated list. Under the Commonwealth Court’s ruling, if an injured employee requires the services of a dentist, but the employer’s designated list contains only names of physicians and no dentists, then the employee would either have to wait for fourteen days before seeing a dentist or pay for the first fourteen days of treatment for the work-related injury from his own pocket.

The problem with these assertions is that in this case, there is simply no evidence of record that any of the physicians listed on the employer’s list were incompetent to treat Appellant or were an inappropriate treatment provider.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a>,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Surely the Majority is not suggesting that medical doctors are unqualified to treat herniated discs!<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a> In this regard, I note that the referee’s finding that the <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>treatment received by Appellant was reasonable and “necessary” does not translate into a finding that chiropractic treatment was the <em>only </em>treatment that was adequate for Appellant. In other words, merely because the referee found that treatment itself was “necessary,” <em>ie., </em>Appellant’s injury required <em>some </em>treatment, does not mean that the <em>manner </em>of treatment, <em>ie. </em>chiropractic manipulation, was necessary to the exclusion of all other medical treatment.</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[238,797,1158,865]]]'>Finally, I note that the Majority’s decision provides no guidelines or legal principles for determining when the list of physicians and practitioners submitted by an employer is insufficient to treat an injured employee. Who is to determine what is the appropriate care required — the employee? If that is the intent of the Majority, why even have a statute that provides the employer with the opportunity to select suitable health care providers? Moreover, how many kinds of practitioners must an employer include in the list? I believe § 306(f) plainly vests discretion in the hands of the employer in a workable manner; the Majority’s interpretation creates ambiguity and confusion where none need exist. Therefore, I must conclude that the Majority has interpreted § 306(f) in a manner not only in derogation of the language and intent of the statute, but in also in a manner that is wholly unworkable. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>

I would also note that although the statute is remedial in nature and therefore is to be construed in favor of the injured worker, we are not permitted to ignore a rational plan adopted by the Legislature to govern the selection of health care providers in favor of perceived policy considerations and imagined horrors. Appellant's brief focuses repeatedly on the issue of “freedom of choice’’ with regard to health care providers, perhaps in an attempt to echo the recent national debate on this issue. However, the issue of freedom of choice and whether that is desirable or undesirable is simply not before this Court now. Rather, we are faced with interpreting a scheme that has already been adopted by the Legislature, not With judicially legislating what we may perceive to be the more desirable system.</p>

The latest amendments require the employee to visit an employer-designated health care provider "[pjrovided an employer establishes a list of at least six designated health care providers, no more than two of whom may be a coordinated care organization and no fewer than three of whom shall be physicians....” Clearly, the Legislature continues to indicate its legislative preference to provide the employer with control over the medical services initially obtained by an employee.</p>
