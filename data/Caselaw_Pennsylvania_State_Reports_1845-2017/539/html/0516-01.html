Neison a new trial in her’ civil action against appellee Laura B. Hines. Neison was granted a new trial after the jury returned a verdict in favor of Hines, and awarded Neison no damages for pain and suffering from injuries she sustained in an automobile accident caused by Hines.</p>

As Neison waited with her right turn signal on, she was struck from behind by Hines’ pickup truck. The impact caused Neison’s head to be thrown backward, shattering the rear window of her two seat sports car.</p>

At the hospital, she was treated <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>for head trauma and released. When, two days later, Neison awakened with pain in her neck and right shoulder, she returned to the emergency room, and was informed by the treating physician that the pain she was experiencing was not unusual. He prescribed pain relievers, and advised application of moist heat to the injured area.</p>
    <p id="b655-5" data-blocks='[["BL_655.4",655,[213,654,1153,639]]]'>On March 31, 1989, Neison consulted Dr. John K.S. Lee, an orthopedic specialist, for continuing pain from her injuries. Dr. Lee diagnosed cervical sprain, and imposed lifting restrictions, prescribed pain medication, and recommended a home exercise program to strengthen the injured soft tissue. Several months after her initial visit with Dr. Lee, Neison visited Dr. Andrew Lucas, a chiropractor, who began treating her concurrently with Dr. Lee. Dr. Lucas also diagnosed cervical strain, and implemented a regimen of regular treatment. Throughout her treatment, Neison continued to work at her job as a physical education and health teacher although in a reduced supervisory capacity.</p>

The only issue for the jury’s determination was the amount Neison was entitled to for pain and suffering as a result of her injuries. Neison offered the testimony of Doctors Lee and Lucas who both opined that the injuries Ms. Neison suffered were directly caused by the automobile accident. The only evidence offered by Hines was the testimony of Dr. William Mitchell, an orthopedic surgeon who examined Neison two years after the accident. Dr. Mitchell opined at trial that Neison had sustained a neck sprain and a shoulder blade sprain. He testified that these injuries were healed when he examined her, and that healing in this type of injury usually takes three to five months.</p>

This was the only testimony on the issue of damages. On cross-examination, the expert conceded that the net economic loss might be as low as $232,400.50 using a different set of variables for the calculations.

He received treatment at the emergency room of a local hospital where he was given a band-aid and two tetanus shots. Alleged that a tetanus shot caused injury to his sciatic nerve, the plaintiff sued the hospital and doctors for pain, suffering, and loss of consortium. After trial, the jury awarded only $42.50, the cost of the emergency room treatment, as damages. The trial judge ordered a new trial because the award did not include compensation for pain and suffering. We reversed the trial court, finding that the jury was free to believe that a puncture by a needle was a “transient rub of life.” <em>Boggavarapu, </em><a href="/pa/518/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="518 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1811664" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0162-01">518 Pa. at 167</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="518 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1811664" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0162-01">542 A.2d at 518</a>.

We concluded that the jury chose to believe the medical testimony of the defendants and this rejection of the specific cause of the alleged pain “reduced the issue from one of obvious injury to one of subjective pain.” <em><a href="/pa/518/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="518 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1811664" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0162-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/pa/518/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="518 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1811664" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0162-01">at 168</a>, <a href="/pa/518/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="518 Pa. 162" data-case-ids="1811664" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0162-01">542 A.2d at 518-19</a>.

Neison produced two medical witnesses at trial who testified that she suffered from soft tissue damage, a cervical sprain, and a herniated disk. Hines’ own witness conceded that Neison had been injured when he opined that she had a healed neck sprain and a healed shoulder blade injury. Thus, the fact that Ms. Neison suffered from objective injuries was not “vigorously contested.” Instead, the medical testimony of both parties established that Ms. Neison suffered from objective injuries, the defense expert only disagreeing as to their extent. These injuries suffered from a violent automobile accident are more than transient rubs of life as was the needle puncture in <em>Boggavarapu. </em>We agree with the trial court that they were injuries of the type that naturally and normally cause pain and <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>suffering and, accordingly, the jury was not free to disregard them.</p>

The defendant asserted that the injury was a minor one which healed in six weeks, and that any pain the plaintiff was suffering resulted from a pre-existing condition. The only evidence introduced at trial was the testimony of the plaintiff, his wife, and his two physicians. The jury awarded no damages, and the trial court denied a request for a new trial.
