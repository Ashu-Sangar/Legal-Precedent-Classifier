However, Appellant concedes, and the Commonwealth agrees, that he was never offered anything in exchange for a plea of guilty. Because there was no identifiable benefit from entering a guilty plea, it can not be said that Appellant is in a worse position than he otherwise would have been had he pled guilty. Moreover, Appellant’s contention that a guilty plea might have resulted in a life sentence is pure speculation. Therefore, trial counsel’s decision to proceed with a jury trial was a reasonable strategy, and we refuse to find him ineffective for pursuing such a course of action.</p>
