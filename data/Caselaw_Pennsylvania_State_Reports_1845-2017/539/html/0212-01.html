Prior to 1907, a criminal defendant could only seek review by a writ of error, which was limited to the arraignment, the plea, the issue and the verdict. Because the evidence presented at trial was not reviewable, a jury's inconsistent verdict in a conspiracy trial of two or more defendants was incapable of review upon sufficiency of evidence grounds. Thus as a way to protect the criminal defendant against jury prejudice or misapplication of the law, the conspiracy rule of consistency developed.
