The appellant, James Jones, was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502, two counts of arson endangering persons, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3301(a), and one count of arson endangering property, 18 Pa.C.S. § 3301(c). Following the hearing to determine the sentences for the first degree murder verdicts, the jury determined that there were three aggravating circumstances which outweighed one mitigating circumstance and rendered a sentencing verdict of death as to each murder. The court later imposed a sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment as to one arson conviction, consecutive to one death sentence and concurrent with the other, and suspended sentence as to the other arson convictions.</p>

The appellant was seen by neighbors running out of the front door. The hair on his face and head was singed and he was extensively burned. Examination by medical personnel at the scene and later at the hospital revealed second and third degree burns over forty percent of the appellant’s body, particularly his face, neck, and back.</p>

The appellant laid face down behind a bar, then saw and heard nothing until there was an explosion. He got up, found the basement on fire, and was burned running through the fire up the cellar stairs.</p>

He also testified that.only Moses Brown was seen leaving after the appellant. The Commonwealth also introduced evidence that the back door of the house was bolted and locked from the inside and the windows were barred, leaving the front as the only means of entrance and exit.</p>

From the positions of the bodies, chairs, post, etc., he indicated that the victims had been conscious when set on fire and had struggled to get free. He also testified that in his opinion the fire began as an intense fireball caused by the ignition of the gasoline vapors, which died down quickly leaving the bodies and surrounding materials burning. The Commonwealth’s medical expert gave his opinion that the appellant’s burns — to his face, right side, and back — were consistent with his having been standing near such a fireball then turning to run away. Additionally, a pair of glasses of the type worn by the appellant was found on the third step from the bottom.</p>

Two of the statements in question were made at St. Joseph Hospital, five were given after the appellant had been transferred to St. Agnes Burn Center, and two additional statements were made several months later during an interview at the police administration building.</p>
    <p id="b364-5" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[244,595,1153,775]]]'>The appellant argues that the statements at the hospital and the burn center were involuntary on account of his physical and mental condition at the time they were given. He points to the testimony of a physician indicating that he was seriously injured, suffering from second and third degree burns over 40% of his body. He focuses on testimony as to the types of medication he received — penicillin, mycostatin, benadryl, dilaudid, librium, and demerol — some of which, especially in combination, can make a person drowsy. He also emphasizes the observations of various witnesses as to his physical condition (heavily bandaged, oxygen tent, catheter, intravenous feeding, legs in a sling) and his apparent pain. He finally argues that as his arrest was based on these statements, the statements made at the police administration building following his arrest should have been suppressed.</p>

The Commonwealth notes that the court made extensive findings of fact, based in large part on the testimony of the appellant’s treating physician, that the appellant was awake, alert, oriented, and cooperative when interviewed by the police, and that the medication <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>he was given for pain did not affect his consciousness or awareness. The court did suppress one statement given after the appellant had been heavily sedated following symptoms of delirium tremens. However, this occurred after all of the other statements had been given.</p>
    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[192,590,1153,261]]]'>Our review establishes that the record supports the factual findings of the common pleas court regarding the appellant’s physical and mental condition at the time of the challenged statements. There is no basis for disturbing the court’s decision to admit the statements as voluntarily given.</p>
    <p id="b365-6" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[192,884,1156,576]]]'>The appellant’s second argument is that the court erred in refusing to suppress evidence seized at the scene of the fire without a search warrant, and in permitting Commonwealth witnesses to comment on evidence that had been suppressed. The appellant argues that the court should have suppressed photographs of the fire scene taken by fire department personnel. These photos depicted various objects (two burned chairs and an empty white plastic jug) that were later seized before the search warrant had been issued, and which the court ordered suppressed “in an overabundance of caution”.</p>

Under these circumstances, there <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>was no error in admitting the photographs or allowing the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b366-4" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[259,437,1152,313]]]'>The appellant’s third argument is that the court erred in finding that probable cause existed to support the issuance of two warrants, one authorizing the search of the premises and the other authorizing the seizure of the. appellant’s clothing. He argues that the affidavits supporting the warrants “fail[ ] to suggest any criminal conduct on the part of appellant.”</p>
    <p id="b366-5" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[254,806,1153,688]]]'>We note first that the court suppressed the clothing because it had been seized prior to the' issuance of the warrant. There is thus no claim of error for our review in this respect. Regarding the warrant to search the premises, the Commonwealth properly characterizes this argument as frivolous. As the court observed, “all evidence seized pursuant to the warrant and admitted into evidence was recovered from the basement or living room of the premises or from the bodies of the victims. The search of the defendant’s private rooms led to the discovery of no evidence.” Opinion at 33. The police were justified in obtaining a warrant to search the premises regardless of whether there was probable cause to connect the appellant to the crime.</p>

    <p id="b367-7" data-blocks='[["BL_367.6",367,[213,1262,1153,737]]]'>The Commonwealth later established through other witnesses that the appellant wore glasses every day; that he asked for his glasses from his hospital bed, complaining that he could not see without them; and that the glasses found on the steps were the kind that he constantly wore.

Commonwealth witness Michael Williams testified that he had been sitting outside his house in view of the scene for about five minutes, gone inside to take a phone call, and then returned outside when he <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>heard there was a fire across the street. The Commonwealth stated, in the presence of the jury, that it intended to lay the foundation for a plea of surprise, “based on a conversation the Commonwealth had with this witness before he took the stand.... ” N.T. p. 2.88. Counsel objected, and the ensuing discussion occurred out of the hearing of the jury. Counsel also moved for a mistrial on the grounds that it was improper for the prosecutor to plead surprise in front of the jury. The court denied the motion, ruling that the appellant had not been prejudiced by the prosecutor’s action.</p>
    <p id="b368-4" data-blocks='[["BL_368.4",368,[238,863,1155,843]]]'>The appellant argues here that by pleading surprise in the presence of the jury, the prosecutor was in effect testifying that Williams’s testimony was inconsistent with a previous unsworn statement to the prosecutor. The court observed that the prosecutor’s comments in the presence of the jury had no substantive content and thus could not have prejudiced the appellant. Additionally, it appears from our independent examination of the record that after the discussion in chambers, neither the substance of the prior statement (that Williams had been outside in view of the scene for an hour and had not seen anyone enter the residence where the fire occurred) nor any inconsistency, was presented to the jury. We therefore concur with the court’s determination that the appellant could not have suffered any prejudice from the prosecutor’s remark, much less prejudice sufficient to require a mistrial.</p>

Their clothes had been saturated with gasoline. He further determined, based on the presence of smoke in the victims’ lungs, that they were alive at the time they were set on fire.
