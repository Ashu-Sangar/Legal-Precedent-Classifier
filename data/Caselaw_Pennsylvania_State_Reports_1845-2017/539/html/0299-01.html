While the codefendant acted as a look-out, appellant pointed a gun at a store employee, Yang-Jin Kim, and ordered him to open the cash register and give appellant the money. Mr. Kim called to the store manager, Jai Ho Lee, who was behind the counter. Mr. Kim went to the register and hit the “no-sale” button in order to open the drawer. Mr. Lee closed the drawer and locked the register and then threw the key on the floor. The defendant, who was standing about four feet in front of Mr. Lee when Mr. Lee threw the key on the floor, responded by shooting Mr. Lee in the upper left side of his chest. The bullet entered the left lung and perforated the aorta, the main blood vessel to the heart, and then exited the body. Mr. Lee was pronounced dead fifteen minutes later having bled to death as a result of the gunshot. Appellant and his codefendant fled from the store after the shot was fired.</p>

Appellant surrendered to authorities on November 25, 1991 at approximately 11:40 a.m. in connection with another murder which had occurred on October 21, 1991. On November 26, 1991 Mr. Kim positively identified appellant from a photo array as the person who shot Mr. Lee on October 31, 1991. On November 27, 1991 at 8:05 p.m. appellant was arrested for the murder in <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>the instant case. The police informed appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>
      <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> rights and he gave a statement admitting his involvement in the robbery and shooting which resulted in the death of Mr. Lee. Appellant’s statement to the police began at 9:55 p.m. and concluded at 12:10 a.m. on November 28, 1991.</p>
    <p id="b443-5" data-blocks='[["BL_443.4",443,[161,604,1156,639]]]'>Appellant asserts that his statement was coerced by the tactics of the officers who questioned him on the evening of November 27, 1991. Specifically, appellant avers that the officers kept him in a small enclosed room and hollered at him and threatened him with physical violence if he did not confess. The officers testimony contradicted that of appellant. The trial court did not find credible appellant’s testimony that he was psychologically intimidated or threatened with physical violence by the officers who questioned him. The Court found the confession to be voluntary and the waiver of constitutional rights to have been valid and denied the motion to suppress the confession as involuntary.</p>

Essentially, appellant seeks a different ruling from this Court on the matter of the credibility of the witnesses. Upon review of the testimony and rulings of the suppression court we find the record clearly supports the findings of the lower court and affirm the denial of the motion to suppress. <em>Commonwealth v.

Appellant claims that since he was in custody from November 25th at 11:40 a.m., the confession made between 9:55 p.m. November 27th and 12:10 a.m. November 28th clearly violates the <em>Davenport </em>rule. Appellant overlooks the fact that his initial arrest on the 25th was for a different crime. The arrest for the murder of Mr. Lee did not occur until November 27th. The fact that appellant was in custody for a different offense at the time he was arrested for the instant murder is not relevant to a determination of whether the six hour rule was violated when he confessed to the second murder.</p>

The ninth peremptory was used to exclude a black juror who revealed that her ex-boyfriend had committed murder and that she was close friends with an individual charged with drug possession. The tenth peremptory struck a black juror whose nephew was charged with murder and theft. The eleventh challenge was to exclude a Hispanic juror; however, the defense did not demand an explanation. The twelfth and thirteenth challenges were used to strike black jurors who gave equivocal responses regarding their ability to impose the death penalty. The fourteenth challenge was exercised to remove a black juror who stated that she had a very close male friend awaiting trial on robbery charges.

At one . point in his opening the district attorney did state appellant’s name rather than the agreed designation of “killer.” The defense immediately objected and a side bar conference was convened. The trial court found the reference to have been inadvertent and not overwhelmingly prejudicial. The motion for a mistrial was denied and a cautionary instruction was <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>given.

In order to understand appellant’s specific claim of prejudice on this point the argument must be divided in two parts. One, appellant asserts that redaction of cross-implicating confessions in a joint trial is an inadequate protection of the defendant’s right to confront his accuser. Two, when the district attorney named appellant as the other person being referred to in the codefendant’s statement that destroyed any protection afforded the appellant by the mechanism of redaction.</p>

Johnson, </em><a href="/pa/474/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="474 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1732154" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0410-01">474 Pa. 410</a>, <a href="/pa/474/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="378 A.2d 859" data-case-ids="1732098,1732154" data-case-paths="/pa/474/0409-01,/pa/474/0410-01">378 A.2d 859</a> (1977). Admittedly, the redacted confessions along with the other evidence presented may reasonably lead the jury to infer that the “other guy” referred to within the confession of one defendant is obviously the codefendant. This Court recognizes that where the jury can infer that the redacted confession implicates the defendant, the defendant’s rights under the confrontation clause are implicated. However, not all violations of the accused’s right to confront his witnesses results in reversible error. The appropriate standard for review under these circumstances is the harmless error test as set forth in <em>Commonwealth v. Story, </em><a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">476 Pa. 391</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">383 A.2d 155</a> (1978). <em>Commonwealth v.

In this ease an eyewitness clearly identified appellant as the killer. In addition, the appellant confessed and admitted that he fired the fatal shot.

However, he did not do a comparison of each statement nor in any way did he emphasize the similarities; that was a matter left to the deliberation of the jury.

The defense did not request an explanation as to the first and second black jurors who were struck. We note, however, that the district attorney does offer an explanation for striking these two jurors in his brief to this Court and that the explanations are consistent with the notes of the voir dire examination. The first juror when questioned exhibited qualms about sitting in judgment of another person and also responded that he would be less likely to believe the testimony of a <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>police officer over another witness. The second juror stated that her brother had been tried on murder charges.</p>

The first alternate juror did deliberate in this case as one of the original jurors became indisposed and was excused from service; the record does not indicate the race of the original juror being replaced.</p>

Since the decision in <em>Bruton, </em>where the United States Supreme Court held that a non-testifying codefendant's confession naming the other defendant cannot be admissible against the defendant as it violates his rights under the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States constitution, this Court has approved the process of "redaction” whereby the names of codefendants are deleted from each others confessions in joint trial situations. <em>See Commonwealth v.
