We granted allocatur to resolve any conflicts in the lower courts as to the proper scope of judicial review of hospital staffing decisions. Moreover, we agreed to determine, as it is a matter of first impression, whether a hospital enjoys immunity for good faith peer review under 63 Pa.S. § 425.3. Because the Superior Court correctly decided these issues, we affirm.</p>

Appellee’s residency was performed under the training of Bernard Amster, D.O. It was appellee’s testimony that he accepted the residency with the understanding that, at its completion, he would join Dr. Amster in his practice and be permitted to treat unassigned emergency room patients at DVMC. For each year of his residency, appellee executed a resident-hospital contract. The contracts lacked any reference to guaranteeing Cooper the privilege of treating emergency room patients upon the successful completion of residency.</p>

A lawsuit was filed by half of the Board members against Drs. Amster, Berman, and Glass alleging that they had created conflicts to prevent expansion of the hospital and prevent admission, to the staff, of physicians who would compete in the <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>same practice areas as the defendant doctors. A countersuit was filed. Both suits were settled, and ultimately Dr. Amster’s faction gained control of the Board.</p>
    <p id="b760-4" data-blocks='[["BL_760.4",760,[278,527,1150,745]]]'>During Dr. Cooper’s final year of residency, the new Board, under the guidance of Dr. Amster, adopted new rules and regulations for the division of orthopedic surgery on July 30, 1982. The critical impact of the new rules was that DVMC established written eligibility criteria for orthopedists wishing to treat unassigned emergency room patients. Specifically, the new rules established the following four requirements for a doctor seeking to treat unassigned emergency room patients: (a) an AOA approved internship and an AOA residency; (b) certification in orthopedic surgery by the American Osteopathic Academy of Orthopedics; (c) be an active staff physician for at least three years; and (d) he must admit at least fifty (50) patients per year to the orthopedic service from his practice.</p>

    <p id="b760-6" data-blocks='[["BL_760.6",760,[274,1594,1164,797]]]'>Dr. Cooper submitted a formal, written request to Dr. Amster to treat unassigned emergency room patients at DVMC on October 2, 1984. Dr. Amster did not respond to appellee’s request. Consequently, Dr. Amster remained the-only orthopedic surgeon eligible to receive unassigned emergency room patients at DVMC. In February of 1985, appellee sent a letter to the DVMC Medical Executive Committee requesting privileges to treat unassigned emergency room patients. In his letter to the Medical Executive Committee, Dr. Cooper reaffirmed that he was told at the beginning of his residency he would have such privileges, if he chose to practice at DVMC. The Medical Executive Committee held a hearing on this matter on March 28, 1985, and subsequently denied appellee’s request to treat unassigned emergency room patients because he failed to meet the new criteria.</p>

The complaint was based on theories of tortious interference with prospective contractual relations, promissory estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of implied contract. The state court action focused on the refusal to grant appellant emergency room privileges at DVMC. Preliminary objections were filed and the trial court granted appellee leave to amend his complaint. The. amended complaint named only Dr. Amster and DVMC as defendants.</p>
    <p id="b761-6" data-blocks='[["BL_761.6",761,[163,1414,1152,681]]]'>Before the federal lawsuit had been dismissed for ripeness, the time arose for appellee’s 1986 annual reappointment review for general staff privileges. Dr. Amster informed DVMC’s administration that he could not review Dr. Cooper’s credentials because appellee had named him as a party defendant in a federal lawsuit. Consequently, DVMC retained an independent orthopedist, Dr. Keith Harvie, to perform the review. Dr. Harvie’s review included interviews with Drs. Master and Stepanuk, both of whom were defendants in appellee’s lawsuits, and a full interview with appellee. On November 25,1986, in accord with Dr. Harvie’s September 22, 1986, report, the DVMC Credentials Committee voted to limit appellee’s general staff privileges.</p>

This second state court action alleged: 1) federal and state due process and equal protection violations; 2) a violation of state antitrust laws; 3) tortious interference with business relationships; 4) intentional infliction of mental and emotional distress; 5) libel and slander; 6) breach of contract; and 7) a violation of the Health Care Facilities Act, 35 Pa.S. § 448.

The Superior Court held that there were issues of fact as to whether some individuals were motivated by malice so as not to be immune under the Peer Review Protection Act.
