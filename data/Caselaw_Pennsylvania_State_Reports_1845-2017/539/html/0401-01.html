    <p id="b539-7" data-blocks='[["BL_539.6",539,[152,1291,1153,961]]]'>The statement in our opinion dated March 29, 1994, that the en banc trial court “understandably” failed to state that the verdict shocked the court’s conscience or sense of justice, has resulted in uncertainty as to the standard for granting a remittitur. The trial court’s failure to use the words “shocks the conscience” was “understandable” in that our opinion in <em>Scaife Co. v. Rockwell-Standard Corp., </em><a href="/pa/446/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="446 Pa. 280" data-case-ids="1941827" data-case-paths="/pa/446/0280-01">446 Pa. 280</a>, 290, <a href="/citations/?q=285%20A.2d%20451" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="285 A.2d 451">285 A.2d 451</a>, 456-57 (1971), might have been read to eliminate the use of those words. Such a reading, however, is erroneous. In <em>Scaife </em>we condemned the bare use of such conclusory statements, insisting instead that the court’s conclusion be supported by additional underlying reasons. If a trial court states <em>only </em>that a verdict shocks the conscience of the court, meaningful appellate review is impossible, but such a statement is necessary to insure that the correct standard is being applied. When a court finds that a verdict shocks its conscience, it must articulate <em>both </em>the conclusion <em>and </em>the reasons supporting a reduction of the verdict.</p>

In addition, the court stated its supporting reasons for that conclusion. Accordingly, there was no. abuse of discretion, and the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>

In my view, the error lies with the trial court’s application of that standard to these facts in reaching its conclusion. ■</p>
