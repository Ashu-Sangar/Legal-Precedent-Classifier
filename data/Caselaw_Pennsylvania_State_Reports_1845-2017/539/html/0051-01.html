A syringe containing cocaine and a packet containing cocaine were found nearby by the police. No fingerprints were found on the syringe. Bell testified for the Commonwealth and accused Ulen of supplying the drugs. The only defense witness called during the case in chief was Ulen’s friend, James Henry, Sr., who gave evidence that Aleta Bell had shown him a syringe and a balloon earlier on the evening of the crime. Henry’s testimony, of course, was designed to show that Bell, known to Henry as a drug user, had the drugs rather than Ulen. Henry further testified <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>that he discussed the case previously only with defense counsel, his own mother, and Aleta Bell. (T.T., pp. 204-206.) The defense rested at this point. In rebuttal to Henry’s testimony, the Commonwealth called Charleene Bullock who had known Bell from their time together in prison.</p>
    <p id="b190-5" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[259,643,1150,590]]]'>Bullock stated that Henry called her upon her release from prison and arranged a meeting among Bullock, Henry and Ulen. Upon Ulen’s promise to “take care of you,” Bullock agreed to state that, while in jail, Aleta Bell confessed to her that she (Bell) had the drugs, while Ulen supplied only the syringe. However, Bullock testified Aleta Bell had never told her that she (Bell) had the drugs. (T.T., pp. 213-216.) This rebuttal testimony, it is important to note, impeached Henry’s claim that he had not discussed the case with anyone except his mother, Aleta Bell, and defense counsel and also enhanced Bullock’s credibility as a witness.</p>
    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[256,1275,1151,475]]]'>Following Bullock’s turn on the witness stand, the Commonwealth offered to play a tape recording of a telephone conversation between Bullock and Henry. The tape was made by the Harrisburg police in December 1989, pursuant to a report by Bullock that she had been offered money to testify falsely at Ulen’s trial. Bullock placed another call to Ulen that was recorded as well. Both recordings were made with Bullock’s consent. Neither tape was given to the defense before the trial.</p>
    <p id="b190-7" data-blocks='[["BL_190.6",190,[253,1800,1152,586]]]'>In seeking permission to play the Bullock-Henry tape to the jury, the prosecution argued that because Henry had testified that he had not discussed the case with others, it was “proper rebuttal to impeach the credibility of Mr. Henry because it shows a conspiracy between him and the defendant in this case and an attempt to suborn perjury.” (T.T., p. 219.) The trial judge held a conference in chambers, and afterwards the tape was played over the objection of defense counsel’s argument that its discovery had not been proffered prior to trial. The court insisted approvingly that, “this was rebuttal.” (T.T., pp. 229-230.)</p>

      <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>The defense then called the defendant in surrebuttal with respect to the testimony of Bullock. Ulen held fast on both direct and cross-examination to his position that he had not offered a bribe to Bullock in return for false testimony. (T.T., pp. 238-240.) On its turn, the prosecution sought to introduce the Bullock-Ulen tape in order “to ask the witness whether he recalls the following conversation.” (T.T., p. 240.) The defense again objected that this was a violation of discovery rules and an unfair surprise. The prosecution explained that the purpose of playing the tape was to “rebut his assertion that there was never any money involved between him and Charleene Bullock in exchange for her testimony.” (T.T., p. 242.) The tape was played to the jury, and Ulen was cross-examined by the prosecutor on the issue of whether a bribe had been offered to Bullock.</p>

Without Henry’s testimony, rebuttal by Bullock would not have occurred; without Bullock, Ulen might not have had to take the stand; without any of them, efforts to introduce the tapes well could have been ruled improper on grounds of relevancy. Since the Commonwealth created this scenario by withholding these tapes we find unpersuasive the trial court’s and the Superior Court’s logic that the tapes were not prejudicial because they merely corroborated testimony which Bullock gave in open court.</p>

The Superior Court, in very strong language, concluded that the tapes were deliberately withheld by the Commonwealth and that these tapes were material to the issues being tried. Further the Superior Court concluded that the withholding of this information could not be justified by its assertion that it was unaware of its value until after it had cross-examined Henty. From its reading of the prosecutor’s cross-examination of Henry, the Superior Court also concluded that the prosecutor was deliberately attempting to establish a situation in which the tapes would become material and concluded this portion of the analysis by stating, "we do not condone the Commonwealth's failure to provide these tapes to the defense prior to trial or its apparent attempt to ambush the defense.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Because of our conclusion that Appellant was denied a fair trial, it is unnecessary for us to address the thorny problem of whether the defendant’s decision to take the stand in response to the use of the recordings violated his right against self-incrimination or the other issues preserved for review; namely whether the prosecutor improperly referred to Appellant’s initial decision not to testify and-the prosecutor’s improper use of peremptory challenges during jury selection process.</p>

These recordings, lasting about fifteen minutes (T.T., p. 230) for the Bullock-Henry conversation and only four minutes (T.T., p. 242) for the Bullock-Ulen exchange, were not recorded by the court reporter and the transcripts which at least were given to the defendant also were not part of the trial court's opinion. The Superior Court (slip opinion, p. 18) took a dim view of this omission, and so does this Court. While there are sufficient facts revealed by the transcript to enable us to decide this case, we remind our trial courts that <em>all </em>testimony presented to the jury must be formally recorded and made a part of the record.</p>
