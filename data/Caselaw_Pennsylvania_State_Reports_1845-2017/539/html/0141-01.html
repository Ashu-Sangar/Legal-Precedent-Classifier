Ms. Boyle reported that she had just developed photographs depicting two small children, later identified as the children of appellant, David Duffy and one male adult, later identified as appellant, David Duffy, which could be interpreted as indecent in nature. The photographs were retained by Ms. Boyle when a customer, later identified as appellant, Janet L. Kramer, arrived to pick up this particular film processing order. Appellants were ultimately charged with sexual abuse of children, corruption of minors, endangering the welfare of children and criminal conspiracy as a result of those particular photographs. Appellants have maintained throughout that the photographs were taken while the parties and Appellant Duffy’s children were “horsing around.”</p>

Little. At the close of the prosecution’s case, the trial court granted appellants’ demurrers to the charges of sexual abuse of children, but denied their demurrers to the remaining charges. The defense proceeded to present its case. Prior to calling its last witness the defense requested a five minute recess in order to prepare its final witness, one of the alleged child victims. It was at this point that Judge Little abruptly recused himself and <em>sua sponte </em>declared a mistrial. A second trial was then scheduled for March 3, 1992, before the Honorable Raymond A Novak. Prior thereto, appellants each filed a Motion to Dismiss alleging that the second trial would violate principles of double jeopardy. The trial court granted those motions, dismissing the second prosecutions. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed the decision of the trial court and vacated the trial court’s orders and remanded for a new trial concluding that Judge Little, by and through his own actions, created the requisite manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial.</p>

    <p id="b284-7" data-blocks='[["BL_284.7",284,[272,782,1153,361]]]'>In reversing Judge Novak’s order barring the retrial, the Superior Court concluded that the trial judge’s “lapse of judicial decorum” created the requisite manifest necessity for the declaration of a mistrial. In so concluding, the Superior Court focused exclusively on the issue of recusal and ignored completely the trial judge’s failure to confer with trial counsel and the prosecution or to consider possible alternatives.</p>
    <p id="b284-8" data-blocks='[["BL_284.8",284,[268,1167,1154,1008]],["BL_285.1",285,[185,326,1157,999]]]'>While the rules as to recusal certainly require a judge to recuse himself when he believes he cannot fairly and impartially hear a matter, <em>Commonwealth v. Boyle, </em><a href="/pa/498/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="498 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1776076" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0486-01">498 Pa. 486</a>, <a href="/pa/498/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="498 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1776076" data-case-paths="/pa/498/0486-01">447 A.2d 250</a> (1982), the issue of recusal must, under the circumstances presented in the case <em>sub judice, </em>be balanced against the interests sought to be protected under the rules governing a finding of manifest necessity. The trial judge’s abrupt declaration of a mistrial in the instant matter leaves little doubt in my mind that he failed to adhere to the <em>Perez </em>doctrine of manifest necessity. With respect to the court’s obligation to hear from the parties prior to declaring a mistrial, the record here is unequivocal. At no point did Judge Little request a conference on the issue; indeed, the record evinces that he precluded any discussion of the matter prior to his declaring the mistrial. He did not even articulate his precise reasons for declaring a mistrial. Moreover, it is apparent that he also failed to consider any alternatives. Even assuming that Judge Little’s reason for declaring a mistrial was his knowledge of Duffy’s past criminal conduct, <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>that fact alone does not here support a finding of manifest necessity. First, the court gave no indication of the precise knowledge it did possess with respect to Duffy. As noted above, the primary focus for purposes of double jeopardy analysis is that the defendant retain control, or at the very least, some meaningful input into the decision whether to continue with the trial. <em>See, United States v. Dinitz, <a href="/us/424/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="424 U.S. 600" data-case-ids="12027140" data-case-paths="/us/424/0600-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/us/424/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="424 U.S. 600" data-case-ids="12027140" data-case-paths="/us/424/0600-01">424 U.S. at 600</a>, <a href="/us/424/0600-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="424 U.S. 600" data-case-ids="12027140" data-case-paths="/us/424/0600-01">96 S.Ct. 1075</a>; <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Walton v. Aytch, <a href="/pa/466/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="466 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1714993" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0172-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/466/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="466 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1714993" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0172-01">466 Pa. at 172</a>, <a href="/pa/466/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="466 Pa. 172" data-case-ids="1714993" data-case-paths="/pa/466/0172-01">352 A.2d 4</a>. Whatever knowledge the trial judge had of Duffy’s past criminal conduct was not gleaned from testimony presented during trial nor is it of record. Clearly, then counsel for the appellants should have been given an opportunity to discover just what information the judge did possess and to explore on the record whether that information warranted a recusal and the concomitant declaration of a mistrial. Both counsel would have then been in a position to confer with their clients as to the advisability of moving for a mistrial with only one witness remaining.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[186,1348,1154,307]]]'>More importantly, even assuming that a mistrial as to Duffy could not be avoided the same cannot be said for co-defendant Kramer. Severance was a clear alternative with respect to Ms. Kramer. If any prejudice occurred during the trial it inured to the detriment of appellant Duffy; not Ms. Kramer as the court’s knowledge related solely to Duffy.</p>

Diehl, <a href="/pa/532/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="532 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1835919" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0214-01">supra,</a> </em><a href="/pa/532/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="532 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1835919" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0214-01">532 Pa. 214</a>, <a href="/pa/532/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="49" data-cite="532 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="1835919" data-case-paths="/pa/532/0214-01">615 A.2d 690</a>.</p>
