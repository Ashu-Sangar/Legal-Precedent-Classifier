On October 11, 1990, two members of the vice squad of the Erie Police Department were working undercover as drug purchasers. Appellee approached the vehicle in which the two officers were seated and essentially offered to sell them cocaine. Appellee left and returned a short time later accompanied by one Tisa Howard. Ms. Howard approached the passenger side of the vehicle where she conversed with Officer Yeaney. Meanwhile, Appellee approached the driver’s side where he conversed with Officer Mioduszewski. As Officer Mioduszewski leaned toward the passenger window to consummate a drug transaction with Ms. Howard, his Smith and Wesson pistol was exposed to Appellee who then stole the pistol; and as Officer Mioduszewski turned around, Appellee had the gun pointed directly at him, as well as in the direction of Officer Yeaney and Ms. Howard. Appellee slowly backed off while pointing the gun at the officers. He then fled on foot. The officers gave chase and eventually caught Appellee exiting a nearby house. Prior to catching him, Appellee had stated, “Officers, I’ll give you back your gun.” Prior to that statement, the officers had not identified themselves as such. Appellee admitted that most of those events occurred, but testified that he did not know that Yeaney or Mioduszewski were police officers, but when he saw the firearm, he became frightened and took it so that no one would get injured.

At the completion of the trial, Appellee requested that the jury be <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>instructed that Appellee must have known that the undercover officers were police officers when he pointed the gun at them in order to be found guilty of aggravated assault on a police officer. The trial court refused this requested instruction concluding that knowledge of the fact that the victims were police officers is not an element of the crime under 18 P.S. § 2702(a)(3). During the course of their deliberations, the jury asked the trial court whether Appellee had to know whether the victims were police officers at the time of the assault. The trial court answered that it was not necessary that Appellee know they were police.</p>

In the ordinary case, a defendant would only be convicted of simple assault if the intent was to cause bodily injury to a victim. See, 18 P.S. § 2701. However, when the victim comes under one of several special categories, the legislature has mandated that more serious consequences flow from the same type of conduct, that is, the conduct becomes one of aggravated assault. See, 18 P.S. § 2702. Thus, intent to cause bodily injury to a police officer becomes aggravated assault under 18 P.S. § 2701(a)(3). The Superior Court then concluded that the fact that the <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>victim is a police officer must be viewed as an element of the crime since the victim’s status is specifically set forth as an element in the statute defining the crime, and since this fact transposes the same act of criminal conduct from a misdemeanor into a felony.</p>

Thus, the defendant’s ignorance of an officer’s official status is relevant in those rare cases in which an officer fails to identify himself and then engages in a course of conduct which could reasonably be interpreted as the unlawful use of force directed either at the defendant or his property. Under such circumstances, a defendant would normally be justified in using reasonable force against his assailant. He could then be found to have exercised self defense, which would negate the existence of mens rea. <em>See United States v.

The duties of a police officer, like the officers in the instant case, frequently include undercover investigation in which the officer’s official status is intentionally concealed. We do not interpret the language “in performance of duty” to require a defendant to have knowledge of the officer’s official status since such a reading would all but strip the undercover officer of the protection the legislature intended to afford him. Rather, we hold that a defendant’s lack of knowledge should only be considered in those cases in which a defendant acts with the <em>mistaken </em>belief that he is threatened with an intentional tort by a private citizen. That is not, however, quite the case here. Although appellant may in fact have believed that Officer Mioduszewski was a rival drug dealer, appellant’s seizure of the officer’s gun, which he then aimed at Mioduszewski, was a preemptive action, not one which is consistent <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>with self-defense.
