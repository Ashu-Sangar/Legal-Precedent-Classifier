As a result of this injury, Appellant received seven weeks of workmen’s compensation benefits.

On November 6, 1989, Appellant filed a Claim Petition in which he asserted that he was disabled as of June 30, 1989, <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>due to the back injury. Appellant also alleged that the injury was a recurrence of his previous injuries sustained in 1982 and 1986. On January 24, 1990, Appellant filed a Petition to Set Aside the Final Receipt of October 24, 1986, asserting that at the time of the signing of the final receipt his injury had not terminated. In the alternative, Appellant alleged that the latest injury was a new injury produced by a new occurrence which injured his back which was predisposed to damage due to his prior work-related injuries.</p>

The Board dismissed the appeal and affirmed the referee’s decision. In doing so, the Board concluded that the referee had sufficient evidence upon which to conclude that Appellant had suffered an aggravation of his original injury in June, 1989 and did not err by granting the claim petition. The Board also held that since the record supports a finding of a new injury, the referee’s alleged error in not differentiating between the claim petition and the petition to set aside the final receipt was moot. Finally, the Board ruled that since the record supported a finding of a new injury, no further inquiry into timeliness was required.</p>

Appellant executed a final receipt under <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>the Workmen’s Compensation Act (the Act),<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> an action which serves as <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the termination of an employer’s obligation to pay compensation for injuries sustained by an employee under Section 434 of the Act.</p>
    <p id="b467-4" data-blocks='[["BL_467.5",467,[186,545,1152,531]]]'>Section 434 further provides that a final receipt may be set aside if it can be shown that the relevant disabling injury had not, in fact, terminated when the final receipt was executed and if the petition to set aside the final receipt is filed within three years. Here, even if one were to conclude that appellant’s present injury arose from his previous injuries and, therefore, that his previous injury had not terminated, his petition to set aside the final receipt filed on January 24, 1990 was not timely since it was filed beyond the three year requirement of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b467-5" data-blocks='[["BL_467.6",467,[187,1102,1150,421]]]'>Since the petition to set aside the final receipt was not timely filed, appellant is required to demonstrate that he is entitled to compensation for an injury attributable to aggravation of a pre-existing condition upon proof that he suffered such injury in the course of and related to his employment. <em>Porochniak v.

This, appellant was unable to do.</p>
    <p id="b467-6" data-blocks='[["BL_467.7",467,[185,1548,1152,744]]]'>Appellant’s own medical expert, Dr. .Christopher G. Lynch, testified on appellant’s behalf that his present injury was an extension of his chronic back problems but he never unequivocally established a causal connection between appellant’s present disability and his alleged work-related injury. In fact, Dr. Lynch testified just the opposite. Dr. Lynch examined appellant on the day <em>before </em>appellant’s alleged injury of June 29, 1989. Dr. Wolfe’s notes recorded that appellant told him on June 28, 1989, that his condition was the result of performing routine chores around the house two days earlier and that he had been experiencing severe back pains since that time. Appellant did not at that time indicate that he had hurt his back. at school during his employment since that alleged disability incident had yet to occur.</p>

The hospital therapist included in her initial evaluation that appellant told her that his back problem resulted from pulling a rug off his deck. R.R. at 36a.</p>
    <p id="b468-4" data-blocks='[["BL_468.4",468,[253,746,1149,309]]]'>Despite the above evidence offered by appellant’s own expert witness and presumably disinterested hospital personnel, appellant testified that his injury took place, conveniently enough, at work on June 29, 1989, while he was moving boxes of files and tools. This allegation was corroborated by testimony from appellant’s co-worker.</p>
    <p id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[248,1077,1155,945]]]'>In light of the above, the Commonwealth Court reversed the referee and the Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board which had granted appellant’s petition for benefits. The majority opinion correctly states that this Court’s scope of review in workmen’s compensation matters is limited to determining whether there has been a violation of constitutional rights, errors of law committed, violations of Appeal Board procedures or whether necessary findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. <em>St. Joe Container Company v. Workmen’s Compensation Appeal Board (Staroschuck), </em><a href="/pa/534/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="534 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1839679" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0347-01">534 Pa. 347</a>, 351 n. 3, <a href="/pa/534/0347-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="534 Pa. 347" data-case-ids="1839679" data-case-paths="/pa/534/0347-01">633 A.2d 128</a>, 130 n. 3 (1993). Generally, the appellate court’s role in these matters is not to reweigh evidence or to review the credibility of witnesses. <em>Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v.

In order to find in favor of the appellant, the referee below had to totally <em>ignore </em>the testimony and depositions of unbiased witnesses to whom appellant gave contemporaneous <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>statements that his injury occurred in his <em>home </em>while doing routine chores.

    <p id="b469-4" data-blocks='[["BL_469.5",469,[160,563,1152,468]]]'>The Workmen’s Compensation Act is remedial in nature and is intended to benefit workers.
