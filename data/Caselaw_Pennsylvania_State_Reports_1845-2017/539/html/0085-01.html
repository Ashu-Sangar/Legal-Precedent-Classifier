On July 31, 1989, Celeste Sharpe, age 61, and Renee Mitchell, age 26, were found stabbed to death in the rear room of a candy store owned by Celeste Sharpe. Ms. Sharpe died from nine stab wounds. When she was found, her bra had been ripped off and her skirt was pulled up above her waist. It had been her habit to keep a wad of money rolled up in a ball and hidden in her bra. The money was gone. Renee Mitchell sustained twenty-five stab wounds. She was also found naked from the waist down, having had her panties ripped from her body. In the store, the cash register drawer was open and loose change was strewn on the floor.</p>

He first told an officer that he was in Ms. Sharpe’s store and saw the murders. Shortly thereafter, he recanted and told the officer that he watched the murder from across the street. Appellant requested that a detective accompany him down an isolated street where the two talked. At this time, appellant appeared to become agitated about the deaths of the two victims and the detective attempted to calm him down by patting him near the waist. When the detective put his hand on the appellant, he felt a hard object. He reached under appellant’s clothing and removed a ten-inch Bowie knife from appellant’s waistband. Appellant pulled up his sweater to wipe his forehead and revealed a blood stain on his t-shirt. The detective then asked appellant to go to the Police Administration Building (“Building”) to explain to the police what he saw and appellant acquiesced saying that he would do anything to help catch the people who killed the two women. He was treated as a witness, not as a suspect, and was neither handcuffed during <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>his trip to the Building with the police nor ushered through the prisoner entrance of the Building.</p>

This detective saw blood on the fly area of appellant’s pants and on his sweater, and asked appellant to remove his clothing, giving him a hospital gown. Appellant took off two bloodstained shirts, revealing a cut on his chest, and his pants and swim trunks, both of which had blood and red stains on them. The detective held the bloodstained clothes and applied for a warrant for their seizure. Appellant was given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and claimed to have been elsewhere during the murders. He also claimed to have won a large amount of money playing “craps,” that he received the chest abrasion from having been stabbed during a fight with two men and that an únidentified man had given him the Bowie knife.</p>

Appellant worked under the direction of Ms. Sharpe in the store, including the day of the murders, and claimed to be privileged to enter the back room, her living quarters. This claim was directly contradicted by testimony of a long-time employee who said appellant was never allowed in the back room unless with an escort and only for a brief time. The condition of Ms. Mitchell’s body and her state of undress provide sufficient evidence to support the finding that appellant had a specific intent to commit a crime against her.

Here, the district attorney disqualified and screened herself from any participation in this matter and, in fact, in any matter in which she presided as a jurist. Appellant points to no instance of her involvement in his case and certainly no conflict of interest. This claim is meritless.</p>

In <em>Williams, </em>the Commonwealth sought to amend its Rule 352 notification to include the aggravating circumstance that appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(9). The notification occurred one year after the defendant’s arraignment and on the second day of a month long jury selection. This court ruled that since the information could have been obtained prior to arraignment but was not, the trial court erred when it allowed the Rule 352 amendment and admitted the evidence to establish the aggravating circumstance. Since the jury’s finding of the existence of such circumstance was not supportable, a new sentencing hearing was ordered.</p>
      <p id="b238-9" data-blocks='[["BL_238.4",238,[286,2015,1120,334]]]'>Here, appellant had actual notice of the “multiple murder” aggravating circumstance because he was on trial for two murders. The Commonwealth stated on the record at the preliminary hearing, soon after the arraignment and before the selection of the jury, that the multiple murders aggravating circumstance would be included in those sought by the Commonwealth. And, finally, the jury failed to find the existence of such a circumstance. Unlike the situation in <em>Williams, </em>the sentencing verdict is not tainted and, thus, no prejudice can be demonstrated.</p>
