Instead, the attendant yanked the hose out of the plaintiffs hands causing gasoline to be thrown all over. The gasoline caught fire, severely burning the plaintiff. We affirmed the trial court finding that the plaintiff had sustained his claim of negligence.

We do not believe that these cases created a heightened or extraordinary standard of care above and beyond the standard of reasonable care for handling dangerous agencies. When we referred to a “higher degree of care” in these cases, we were not creating a second tier of “extraordinary care” over and above ordinary or reasonable care. Instead, we were simply recognizing the general principle that under the reasonable care standard, the level of care must be proportionate to the danger involved. Our use of the language “higher degree of care” merely stated the common sense conclusion that the use of a dangerous agency would require the reasonably prudent person to exercise more care. In fact these cases rejected any formalistic higher standard of care in holding that “no absolute standard of care [could] be fixed by law.”</p>

The defendant in this case was a grandfather who had left a loaded handgun in an unlocked dresser drawer. While alone in the house, his grandchild found the gun and inadvertently shot another child. We affirmed the trial court’s finding that the grandfather was negligent for permitting a highly dangerous instrumentality to be in the place where a child could come into contact with it. In so affirming, we found that the possession of a loaded handgun placed upon the defendant the duty of, “exercising not simply ordinary, but extraordinary care so that no harm might be visited upon others.” <em>Kuhns, </em><a href="/pa/390/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="390 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="1275666" data-case-paths="/pa/390/0331-01">390 Pa. at 344</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.2d%20395" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="135 A.2d 395">135 A.2d at 403</a>.

Our case law has long recognized this common sense proposition that a reasonable man under the circumstances will exert a “higher” degree of care when handling dangerous agencies. <em>See Pryor, </em><a href="/pa/376/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="376 Pa. 521" data-case-ids="1246166" data-case-paths="/pa/376/0521-01">376 Pa. at 526</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=103%20A.2d%20425" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="103 A.2d 425">103 A.2d at 427</a> (a “higher degree of care” imposed on persons dealing with gasoline); <em>Konchar, </em><a href="/pa/333/0499-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="333 Pa. 499" data-case-ids="1187963" data-case-paths="/pa/333/0499-01">333 Pa. at 501</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20A.2d%20913" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="3 A.2d 913">3 A.2d at 914</a> (a “high duty of care” required for the handling of gasoline); <em>MacDougall, </em><a href="/pa/311/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="311 Pa. 387" data-case-ids="1146245" data-case-paths="/pa/311/0387-01">311 Pa. at 393</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=166%20A.%20589" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="166 A. 589">166 A. at 591</a> (a “higher degree of care and vigilance” required for the handling of electricity); <a id="p606" href="#p606" data-label="606" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*606</a>and <em>Fredericks, </em><a href="/pa/282/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="282 Pa. 8" data-case-ids="1088422" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0008-01">282 Pa. at 13</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=127%20A.%20615" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="127 A. 615">127 A. at 616</a> (a “higher degree of care” required for the handling of gasoline).</p>

In examining these instructions, our scope of review is to determine whether the trial court committed clear abuse of discretion or error of law controlling the outcome of the case. <em>Williams v. Philadelphia Transportation Company, </em><a href="/pa/415/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="415 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1891820" data-case-paths="/pa/415/0370-01">415 Pa. 370</a>, 374, <a href="/citations/?q=203%20A.2d%20665" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="203 A.2d 665">203 A.2d 665</a>, 668 (1964). Error in a charge is sufficient ground for a new trial, if the charge as a whole is inadequate or not clear or has a tendency to mislead or confuse rather than clarify a material issue. <em>Glider v. Com. Dept. of Hwys., </em><a href="/pa/435/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="435 Pa. 140" data-case-ids="1924290" data-case-paths="/pa/435/0140-01">435 Pa. 140</a>, 151-52, <a href="/citations/?q=255%20A.2d%20542" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="255 A.2d 542">255 A.2d 542</a>, 547 (1969). A charge will be found adequate unless “the issues are not made clear to the jury or the jury was palpably misled by what the trial judge said or unless there is an omission in the charge which amounts .to fundamental error.” <em>Voitasefski v.

The charge informed the jury that the proper standard of care was “reasonable” or “ordinary” care under the circumstances in accordance with the law of this Commonwealth. The charge properly instructed the jury that the level of care required changed with the circumstances. The charge also informed the jury that the level of care required increased proportionately with the level of danger in the activity. We find nothing in this charge that is confusing, misleading, or unclear. From these instructions, the jury had the tools to examine the circumstances of the case and determine that the defendant was required to exercise a “higher degree of care” in using the dangerous agency of gasoline.</p>
    <p id="b743-7" data-blocks='[["BL_743.7",743,[166,1897,1150,475]],["BL_744.1",744,[251,327,1151,468]]]'>Nor do we believe that the failure of the trial judge to include the plaintiffs requested jury point for charge No. 4 was an omission constituting “fundamental error.” Plaintiffs requested point for charge stated that the defendant was required to use a “high degree of care” in employing the dangerous agency of gasoline. As discussed <em>supra, </em>there is no standard of heightened or “extraordinary care” in this Commonwealth that would entitle the plaintiff to this instruction as a matter of law. We do not believe that the phrase “high <a id="p608" href="#p608" data-label="608" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*608</a>degree of care” found frequently in our case law has any talismanic properties requiring that it always be used in instructing the jury on the standard of care in cases involving dangerous agencies or instrumentalities. We believe it more important that the jury be instructed on the proper standard of care, reasonable or ordinary care under the circumstances, and the requirement that reasonable care is care proportionate to the danger of the activity. This was clearly done in the instant case.</p>
    <p id="b744-5" data-blocks='[["BL_744.4",744,[246,847,1153,1119]]]'>Appellant argues that the language in his point for charge was nearly identical to Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instruction 3.16 which sets forth the standard of care to be employed on inherently dangerous instrumentalities. PSSCJI 3.16 provides that anyone using a dangerous instrumentality is “required by law to use the highest degree of care practicable.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Assuming the applicability of this instruction to the case at bar, we find nothing in it inconsistent with our holding today. The “highest degree of care practicable” is simply another way of phrasing reasonable or ordinary care under the circumstances. We note that this standard jury instruction and point of charge No. 4 are completely consistent with our law. In fact, the use of such an instruction may very well have made the issue clearer to the jury. However, our standard of review is not to determine whether the jury had the best or clearest instructions, but whether they had adequate instructions. We find the jury instructions given in this case to be adequate. The trial judge rejected the plaintiffs point for charge No. 4 as “cumulative” of other jury instructions. We find no abuse of discretion or error of law on the part of the trial court in making this determination.</p>

Matulevich, </em><a href="/pa-super/345/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="345 Pa.

Super. 507" data-case-ids="639160" data-case-paths="/pa-super/345/0507-01">498 A.2d at 941</a>. However, the issue before the court in <em>Matulevich </em>was whether the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that a possessor of a gun was strictly liable for any injury he caused. The Superior Court rejected the argument that the law of strict liability applied and affirmed the trial court's instruction that the standard was one of “extraordinary care." Thus, the issue of whether the proper standard was reasonable care or extraordinary care was not argued before the court nor questioned by any of the parties. Therefore, this case properly stands for the proposition that accidents involving firearms are to be governed not by strict liability principles, but by negligence principles. This case did not establish "extraordinary care” as the proper standard. Rather, it merely accepted <em>arguendo </em>the standard applied by the trial court and unquestioned by the parties as the correct standard.</p>
