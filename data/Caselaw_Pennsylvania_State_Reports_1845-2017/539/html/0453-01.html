First the taxing authority established a prima facie case by presenting the Vice Chairman of the Board of Property Assessment Appeals and Review, who testified that the common level ratio for the period in question had been set by the Board at 50%. The taxpayer’s expert then produced rebuttal evidence in the form of studies and numbers extracted from them, while the taxing authority in its turn produced evidence critical of the taxpayer’s methodology but without offering alternatives to the numbers, since no independent ratio studies had been performed. After receiving this evidence, the court set the common level ratio for the years 1977 through 1979 at thirty-nine percent. The common level ratio for 1980 through 1986 was not at issue, and remained unchanged at twenty-five percent.

The procedure requires that the taxing authority first present its assessment record into evidence. Such presentation makes out a prima facie case for the validity of the assessment in the sense that it fixes the time when the burden of coming forward with evidence shifts to the taxpayer. If the taxpayer fails to respond with credible, relevant evidence, then the taxing body prevails. But once the taxpayer produces sufficient proof to overcome its initially allotted status, the prima facie significance of the Board’s assessment figure has served its procedural purpose, and its value as an evidentiary devise is ended. Thereafter, such record, of itself, loses the weight previously accorded to it and may not then influence the court’s determination of the assessment’s correctness.

To overcome the taxing authorities’ prima facie case, Westinghouse called an expert who testified that he had conducted a ratio study of tax assessments to fair market value in Allegheny County for the years 1977 through 1979. In his study, the expert used a magnetic computer tape provided to him by Allegheny County, one of the parties to this litigation. The tape contained a report of all of the sales of real estate that occurred in Allegheny County in the years 1978, 1979, 1980 and 1981, and included the following data: parties to the sale, date of sale, assessed value of the property sold, market value of the property sold, whether the county considered the sale to be an arm’s length transaction, whether the property was sold at a sheriffs sale, the community in which the property sold was located, and other related information.

The expert testified that, in his study, he calculated a number of measures, including: (a) the central tendency, which is the ratio at which the ratios tended to cluster; (b) the median, which is the measure of the central tendency that provides a middle range below which half of the ratios fall and above which half of the ratios fall; (c) the modal range, which is the range in which the largest number of sales are made; and, (d) the aggregate ratio, which is a valuated ratio calculated by multiplying the ratio of each property sold by the sales price of that property. The expert concluded, based upon his study of public records, that the common level ratios for the years 1977, 1978 and 1979 were as follows: 1977 — 26.04 percent; 1978 — 25.94 percent; and, 1979 — 24.38 percent.</p>

Westinghouse learned that Mr. Berman’s appraisal of the property was $24,000,000, which was closer to the fair market value of $19,000,000 testified to by Westinghouse’s lead expert than it was to the $88,000,000 fair market value presented by the taxing authorities’ expert.

Did the trial judge here conclude that the evidence supporting the lower evaluations was substantial and thus support a higher evaluation? Or did the trial judge conclude that the evidence supporting the higher evaluations was substantial and thus supports a lower evaluation? Who knows? I don’t and I am sure the parties don’t!</p>

The trial judge, of course, can accept the opinion of one expert and reject the opinion of any contradictory expert and find the fair market value as proposed by the expert relied upon. There then is no <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>need for specificity in writing an opinion and articulating the evidence relied upon. The appellate courts can review the whole body of evidence relied upon by the trial judge and decide whether it is substantial.</p>
    <p id="b611-4" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[189,560,1152,412]]]'>If the trial judge does not rely completely upon the opinion of one expert to the exclusion of all others, the trial judge must, of necessity, select those portions of all the evidence which support the findings of fact as to fair market values. The trial judge in this case did not rely upon the opinion of either expert and he failed to tell us what portions of the evidence introduced'by all the experts were used to support his conclusions.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.6",611,[189,1005,1150,356]]]'>It is not for the appellate jurists to sift through the hundreds of pages of testimony and exhibits to pick and choose the evidence which substantially supports the findings of fact as to evaluations. It is for the trial judge to do so. Our duty is to determine whether the evidence the trial judge articulates as credible is substantial enough to support the findings of fact.</p>
    <p id="b611-6" data-blocks='[["BL_611.7",611,[187,1394,1151,476]]]'>The rule now established by the majority simply means that, henceforth, the parties in a tax assessment appeal can simply have their experts testify to low values for the taxpayer and extremely high values for the assessors and taxing bodies. The judge can then simply split the difference without explanation. I find this to be jurisprudentially wrong. On the other hand, maybe this new rule will bring about more settlements and avoid the necessity of <em>de novo </em>trials. The parties can just as easily split the difference as can- the trial judge.</p>
    <p id="b611-7" data-blocks='[["BL_611.8",611,[187,1894,1148,196]]]'>Simply stated, I believe the trial judge, as fact finder, must complete the question, “I find the fair market value (or common level ratio) to be x number of dollars BECAUSE ----”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> This has not been done here and I dissent.</p>

It is interesting to note that in each case cited by the majority to support the scheme of splitting the difference, the trial judge wrote a full opinion articulating the evidence relied upon to support the finding of fair market value.</p>
