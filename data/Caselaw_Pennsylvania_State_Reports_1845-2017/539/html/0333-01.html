The Referee finds from a review of the evidence that claimant has not presented accurate information regarding his work as a contractor. Specifically, the Referee finds that claimant’s “net profit” figure contained in his 1988 income tax return does not accurately reflect the earnings that he generates as a contractor and finds that the “gross income” figure of $26,-863.00 (which equals $516.60 per week) contained in his tax return is a more accurate reflection of his earning power. In addition, upon close review of his income tax records, the Referee finds that the foregoing figure of $516.60 per week is a conservative calculation of claimant’s present earning capacity.</p>

The Referee finds from a review of the evidence that in light of the fact that claimant operates his contracting business out of his home, that his business telephone is also his regular home telephone, that his business pickup truck is the only motor vehicle that he owns and that his financial information reflects deductions for office expenses, telephone expenses, trash removal, rent business property, truck expenses and depreciation, that a significant portion of claimant’s expenses are not in fact business-related. Accordingly, the “gross income” figure of $26,863.00, which the Referee finds equals claimant’s gross sales less than [sic] the costs of goods and/or operations, plus other income, represents a conservative estimate of claimant’s earning power.</p>
