      <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>This holding, we believe, is in accord with the common law rationale for the offense of burglary. Under the common law, burglary was “a forcible invasion of the right of habitation.” <em>Commonwealth v. LeGrand, </em><a href="/pa/336/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="336 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1195614" data-case-paths="/pa/336/0511-01">336 Pa. 511</a>, 518, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20896" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="9 A.2d 896">9 A.2d 896</a>, 899 (1939) (quoting 4 Blackstone, Commentaries 223). In <em>Le Grand </em>we noted that under the common law burglary was a “very heinous offense” where “[ejvery burglar is a potential assassin and when his felonious purpose encounters human opposition his intent to steal becomes an intent to kill.... ” <em><a href="/citations/?q=9%20A.2d%20896" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="9 A.2d 896">Id.</a> </em>Thus, the requirement that the burglar enter an “occupied structure” in our present statute reflects the concern for human safety found in the common law offense. Our holding today is likewise motivated by a concern for human safety. It is a common sense conclusion that storage facilities used in the carrying on of a business are a natural attraction for the criminal element. It is also a common sense conclusion that employees will be present at the such sites in varying degrees to maintain, secure, and utilize the storage facility. Thus, it is often possible that a burglar will encounter an employee, such as a guard securing the facility or an employee making a routine delivery, in the course of committing his crime. As Blackstone noted, this encounter will often turn violent when the burglar encounters human opposition. In the instant case, the facility manager testified that he and his employees entered the yard regularly. Notes of Testimony 1/10/92 at 15, 21-22. Thus, the defendant and his accomplice could just have easily broken into this facility while a Morris employee was present at the site creating the possibility of a violent confrontation.</p>

The inclusion of “any vehicle” in the statute demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to limit this statute to buildings. Instead, the plain language of the statute includes “any place adapted for carrying on business therein” as an “occupied structure.” We find a fenced and secured storage lot to be within the plain language of Section 3501. Therefore, we find resort to other methods of statutory construction offered by the Appellant to be unhelpful.</p>

The court vacated the conviction holding that such a yard was neither a place adapted for overnight accommodation nor a place adapted for carrying on business. We find that the plain language of Section 3501 supports the conclusion of the Superior Court in <em>Cannon </em>and dictates the result that residential backyards are not protected under the criminal trespass and burglary statutes, while fenced and locked commercial lots are. Hagan argues that such a conclusion is absurd and, therefore, contrary to our canons of statutory interpretation. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1) (in construing statutes, we presume the legislature did not intend an absurd result).

The record reveals that the Morris facility was surrounded by a fence with barbed wire. Notes of Testimony 1/10/92 at 20.

These cases are distinguished from the instant case in that they did not involve a surreptitious breaking and entering into a secured facility for the purpose of removing valuable items. Hagan argues that his actions were a defiant trespass because 18 Pa.C.S. § 3503(b) includes fencing as one of several ways in which a property owner can provide notice to trespassers that they are not welcome.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> We do not believe that the intent of this provision was to make all intrusions into fenced areas punisha<a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>ble only as a defiant trespass.

    <p id="b755-10" data-blocks='[["BL_755.10",755,[182,1049,1152,795]]]'>The issue is whether sufficient evidence supports appellant’s conviction of burglary for stealing scrap metal stored in an outdoor fenced lot. As described in the opinion of the court, appellant’s offense took place on industrial property in Philadelphia owned by Morris Iron and Steel Company, on which were two vacant burned-out buildings, a railroad track, and a lot partially enclosed by a chain link fence. The buildings had been vacant for months and the company had not carried on any operations at the location during that period. Various types of steel railroad equipment owned by the company were strewn about the fenced lot. A manager of the company had posted “keep out” signs on the fence, parked an old trailer truck against the inside of the gate giving access to the lot, and periodically inspected the property by driving past on the street outside the lot.</p>
    <p id="b755-11" data-blocks='[["BL_755.11",755,[184,1876,1148,149]]]'>The majority concludes that appellant’s entry into the fenced lot and gathering the railroad steel into piles satisfy the elements of the grave offense of burglary. I do not agree.</p>
    <p id="b755-12" data-blocks='[["BL_755.12",755,[184,2050,1149,314]],["BL_756.1",756,[269,323,1148,153]]]'>Originally defined as breaking and entering an occupied dwelling during the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein, the common law offense of burglary has been expanded by statute so that it now prohibits entering an “occupied structure ... with intent to commit a crime therein.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3502(a). An occupied structure, amazingly, <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>is defined to include any “vehicle or place adapted ... for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 3501.</p>
    <p id="b756-5" data-blocks='[["BL_756.4",756,[267,517,1151,312]]]'>Although the majority struggles to avoid the absurdity of such a definition, I cannot join in their interpretation. To state that an “occupied structure” may be any unoccupied place which is not a structure, so long as it is adapted for carrying on business therein, completely robs the words “occupied” and “structure” of meaning.</p>
    <p id="b756-6" data-blocks='[["BL_756.5",756,[264,871,1149,365]]]'>It is a fundamental rule that all provisions of a penal statute are to be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(1). If we are to hold that an unoccupied nonstructure is an occupied structure because it is adapted for carrying on business, I would at least require that “carrying on business” involve more than the passive storage of rusting steel outside burned-out industrial buildings. Therefore I respectfully dissent.</p>
