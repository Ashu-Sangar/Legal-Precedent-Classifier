      <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>However, the Superior Court, consistent with <em>Scofield, </em>fails to examine the increased degree of recklessness required by the aggravated assault statute, that is, recklessness “under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The argument advanced in <em>Scofield </em>was limited to the contention that the appellant was merely negligent, not reckless. However, Scofield had ingested both alcohol, though not to a degree which would raise his blood alcohol level to legal intoxication, as well as barbiturates before entering his car. There was eyewitness testimony to the erratic and unsafe quality of his driving prior to the accident which deprived his victim of a leg. Scofield was therefore aware of the extent of his incapacity before he struck the victim with his automobile. Having lost control of his vehicle before the collision, he continued to drive, thus manifesting “an indifference to the value of human life,” including his own.</p>

This conclusion derives, albeit imperfectly, from our opinion in <em>Commonwealth v. Heck, </em><a href="/pa/517/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="517 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1809914" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0192-01">517 Pa. 192</a>, <a href="/pa/517/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="517 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="1809914" data-case-paths="/pa/517/0192-01">535 A.2d 575</a> (1987). In <em>Heck, </em>we held that ordinary negligence would not sustain a conviction for homicide by vehicle. Rather, we found that the statutory definition of negligence in the culpability section of the Crimes Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
      <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>encompassed not the lack of care necessary to prove tort liability, but criminal negligence, otherwise a conviction relying on this provision would violate due process. In essence, the negligence defined in § 302 is a higher degree of negligence than that required for tort liability, since it includes the mens rea component of a criminal offense.</p>
    <p id="b618-5" data-blocks='[["BL_618.5",618,[255,671,1152,742]]]'>Similarly, we find that mere recklessness is insufficient to support a conviction for aggravated assault, which requires a higher degree of culpability, i.e., that which considers and then disregards the threat <em>necessarily </em>posed to human life by the offending conduct.. There must be an element of deliberation or conscious disregard of danger not present to the same extent in, e.g., either reckless endangerment, to which appellant admits, or driving while intoxicated. Aggravated assault is a second degree felony, reckless endangerment and driving under the influence of alcohol are second degree misdemeanors. The difference in grading reflects the relative seriousness of the crimes, and the differing levels of criminal intent involved. The quantum of recklessness required to prove the misdemeanors will not serve to support the felony.</p>

The recklessness must, therefore, be such that life threatening injury is essentially certain to occur. This state of mind is, accordingly, equivalent to that which seeks to cause injury. Examples of such behavior make the distinction clear. In <em>Commonwealth v.

Aggravated assault is, indeed, the functional equivalent of a murder in which, for some reason, death fails to occur.
