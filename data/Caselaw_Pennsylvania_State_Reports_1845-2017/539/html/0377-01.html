Due to the far reaching consequences of the continued application of these standards by the Commonwealth Court and the lower courts bound by its holdings, I believe we should address the merits of this appeal.

In addition, the trial court held that even if they had such a duty, Temple and the HGR were acting in good faith, and therefore were immune from liability under § 8607(c) of the UAGA and granted appellants’ demurrer. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed. We then granted allocatur.</p>

These cases, however, involved incidents in which medical examiners either ignored or deliberately failed to check records indicating that the deceased had next of kin who should have been notified.

Since no duty exists, the facts averred in appellee’s complaint <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>are legally insufficient, and a demurrer was properly granted by the trial court.</p>

The Commonwealth Court, however, did not address this issue, instead holding that petitioner’s preliminary objections should be denied on the ground that further proceedings might reveal bad faith on the part of appellants. Such a holding, resting as it does on the premise that respondent will be allowed to prove facts that are not averred in its complaint, is clearly at odds with our system of pleading which requires a party to set forth in the complaint those facts which he wishes to establish at trial. <em>See </em>Pa.R.C.P. 1019. Further, the Commonwealth Court’s holding clearly misapprehends the standard set forth by this court in <em>Buchanan, supra, </em>under which a court is only to consider the facts averred in a complaint when ruling upon a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer.</p>
