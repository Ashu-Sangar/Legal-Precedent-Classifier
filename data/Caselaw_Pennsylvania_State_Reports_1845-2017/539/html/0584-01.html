In the first appeal, the trial court ordered appellant Freedman to submit to blood tests and Superior Court quashed Freedman’s appeal from the blood test order. Freedman appeals Superior Court’s quashing of his appeal from the blood test order. In the second appeal, the trial court entered a support order in the amount of $110 per week plus an arrearage payment of $30 per week. Superior Court vacated the trial court’s order of support and remanded the case for a hearing de novo, which was to include consideration of Freedman’s claim that there was an improper commingling of adjudicative and adversarial functions in the proceedings before the trial court, <a href="/citations/?q=433%20Pa.%20Super.%20642" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="433 Pa.

Freedman’s motion for reconsideration was denied on February 21, 1992, and Freedman appealed this order to Superior Court.</p>

On September 4, 1992 a conference before a support master was conducted and on September 11, 1992 an order of support was entered for $110 plus $30 on arrearages to be paid on a weekly basis. Freedman filed motions to dismiss and for reconsideration, which were denied, and on September 28,1992 Freedman demanded a hearing on the support order.

According to Superior Court, in order for such an appeal to be heard, there must be a presumptive parent, i.e., the mother must have been married when the child was born, or the case must implicate “situations which permanently place one of the parties out of court.” That court went on to observe that presumptive parentage might arise in ways other than a child being born during wedlock, such as when a father holds himself out as the parent; a father having been found to be the parent by a court; or a father having been ordered to <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>pay child support.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Even though one of these considerations applies to the facts of this case (Haxall allegedly held himself out to be the father), the court held that before a mother can be estopped from “denying the presumptive parent’s paternity, there must unequivocally be a presumptive parent, not the mere supposition of one.” Restated, Superior Court apparently means that Freedman cannot successfully claim that McCandless is estopped from denying Haxall’s paternity, for Haxall and McCandless were never married. Thus, in Superi- or Court’s view, an interlocutory appeal of a blood test order will be allowed only when there has been a marriage. Superi- or Court also determined, however, that even if the appeal were permitted, its review of the testimony at the hearings on estoppel indicated that McCandless provided sufficient evidence to dispel the defense of estoppel.</p>

Trojak denied paternity and objected to the trial court’s order of blood tests on the grounds that the mother had not rebutted the presumption of her former husband’s paternity. In that case, this court held that it is appropriate to determine the actual relationship of the presumptive father (the husband) and natural mother of the child before blood tests are ordered. “A court may order blood tests to determine paternity only when the presumption of paternity [which applies when the mother was married at the time of concep<a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>tion and birth] has been overcome.” <em>Trojak, </em><a href="/pa/535/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="535 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1841488" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0095-01">535 Pa. at 105</a>, <a href="/pa/535/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="535 Pa. 95" data-case-ids="1841488" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0095-01">634 A.2d at 206</a>.</p>

However, if any person, by his or her conduct recognized a given person as the father of the child, that person may be estopped from challenging paternity. The <em>Trojak </em>court pointed out that where estoppel is applied, blood tests may be irrelevant, for the law will not permit a person in estoppel situations to challenge the status which he or she has previously accepted. Only when estoppel does not apply will blood tests be ordered. In <em>Trojak </em>estoppel did not apply because the mother was able to establish by clear, direct, convincing and unanswerable evidence that she and her husband did not live together as an intact family; her husband had not accepted the child as his own; the husband and wife had repudiated their marriage vows long ago; the husband never supported the child in any manner; and when the child was conceived, the husband was impotent.</p>

Not only is the child’s equanimity threatened and the family unity invaded, as we observed in <em>Trojak, </em>but also, for all practical purposes, the results of the tests very often control the case. Significant interests of the parties other than the child, therefore, are affected, and these interests, as well as the child’s interests, must be considered. Blood test orders accompanied by claims of estoppel, therefore, generally should be appealable, not only in cases in which the mother was married, as in <em>Trojak, </em>but in any case. Otherwise, appeals of blood test orders would be allowed in “married” cases under <em>Trojak, </em>but not in “unmarried” cases. Such a result could give rise to serious equal protection concerns, for although unique presumptions are involved where the mother was married when the child was conceived and born, the presumption of parentage in a “married” case is merely a form of estoppel, and estoppel may be raised both in cases in which there was no marriage and also in cases in which a child was conceived and born during the marriage.</p>

McCandless testified that before her child was born she had sex with Haxall perhaps four times; that when Haxall learned she was pregnant, he advised her to get an abortion; that although she resumed a sexual relationship with Haxall following the birth of her child, she and Haxall neither lived nor travelled together except for two occasions during which the two adults and the child went out to dinner. She admitted that she believed the child was Haxall’s and that she, Haxall and the child travelled to Haxall’s parents to allow them to see the child whom they believed to be their grandchild. She stated that she was "devastated” when she discovered Haxall was not the child’s father. In short, it is apparent that the lower courts evaluated this testimony as indicating that while McCandless and Haxall believed the child to be his, McCandless and Haxall did not conduct themselves in a manner consistent with Haxall's holding himself out as the father. We concur in that evaluation.</p>

Presumably, the issue of contempt remains viable. Because the finding of paternity is vacated pursuant to this appeal, there is no need for a de novo hearing (as required by Superior Court) on any support order which may have been entered, for there can be no valid support order without a finding of paternity. The trial court has already conducted hearings on the matter of alleged improper commingling of prosecutorial and adjudicative functions, as was required by Superior Court, and has determined that there was no impropriety. All that remains, then, is to adjudicate the issue of contempt, give Freedman the opportunity to submit to blood testing, make a finding as to paternity, and, if appropriate, enter an order of support.</p>

Freedman also argues that the plaintiff should be required to meet minimum threshold requirements before obtaining a court order for blood testing pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. § 5104(c). The statute requires, inter alia, that paternity be a "relevant fact” in the proceeding. Ms. McCandless testified that she had sexual relations with Freedman during the relevant period, an assertion which the trial court apparently believed, thus making paternity a "relevant fact” within the meaning of the statute. Moreover, a parallel statute, 23 Pa.C.S. § 4343, concerning actions to determine paternity, provides that genetic testing shall be ordered “upon the request of any party to an action to establish paternity.” The claim is meritless.</p>
