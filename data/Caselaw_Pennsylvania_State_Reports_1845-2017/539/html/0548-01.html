The first issue is whether there was sufficient evidence to support appellant’s conviction for driving a motor vehicle while his license was suspended as a result of a conviction for driving under the influence (“DUI”) where appellant alleges that the Commonwealth failed to prove that he received actual notice of the suspension where the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) sent notice of his suspension to an expired address. The second issue is whether appellant is estopped from asserting a lack of notice defense on Penn-DOT’s failure to mail his notice to his current address where appellant himself failed to provide PennDOT with his current address as required by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1515. For the reasons expressed below, we affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming appellant’s judgment of sentence.</p>

The officer also testified that as he began to issue a citation (for a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1543(b)), appellant asked him not to do so because he did not want to go to jail.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Despite appellant’s plea, the officer proceeded with the issuance of the citation, which gave rise to the conviction presently challenged by appellant.</p>

The trial court further found that, notwithstanding the lack of evidence demonstrating actual receipt of the PennDOT notice by the appellant, appellant was nevertheless estopped from arguing lack of notice based upon PennDOT’s mailing of the notice to an expired address. The trial court found that PennDOT’s failure to send the notice to a current address and appellant’s alleged failure to receive such notice was solely because of appellant’s own failure to apprise PennDOT of his current address in dereliction of his statutorily mandated duties under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1515.</p>

In <em>Kane, </em>we reversed the judgment of sentence because the evidence relied upon by the Commonwealth to support its position that the defendant had notice of his suspension was simply that PennDOT had mailed a notice of suspension to an address, which, as a result of a typographical error by PennDOT, differed from the address the defendant had provided to PennDOT. This Court held that the evidence that the notice of suspension was mailed, given the facts of <em>Kane </em>in and of <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>itself, was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had actual notice of his suspension. Here, contrarily, Penn-DOT mailed the notice of suspension to the address appellant had provided to it; however, because appellant failed to comply with his statutory duty under 75 Pa.C.S. § 1515 to notify PennDot of his change of address, PennDot mailed the notice of suspension to an expired address.

Obviously, were we to accept appellant’s argument, which we do not, a defendant automatically would be able to avoid a conviction simply by moving after his or her initial DUI conviction and then claiming that PennDOT mailed the suspension notice to the wrong address. The licensee could then continue to drive with a suspended license without fear of conviction if caught. A licensee could also give PennDOT a fictitious address. The <em>per se </em>holding appellant urges upon us would open the door to potential abuse by drivers seeking to avoid detection and arrest for driving while a license is suspended. For the reasons discussed herein, we reject this position as there is an array of other factors that can be considered by a court in determining whether a defendant had actual notice regardless of whether he or she received written notice by PennDOT. <em>See Commonwealth v.

As discussed herein, the mere fact appellant may have not received a written notice of a suspension from PennDOT is not dispositive of his claim. Moreover, the trial court found appellant’s testimony regarding his alleged lack of receipt of the notice highly suspect in view of the fact that other mail had been forwarded to his present address from his former address. <em>Id. </em>at p. 3-4.</p>

There is no penalty of imprisonment for driving while your license is suspended for a'non-DUI offense (e.g., accumulation of points) for first-time offenders. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1543(a).

In the event of a second or subsequent conviction for a violation of § 1543, however, a person shall be sentenced to pay a minimum fine of $200.00 and/or a term of imprisonment for not more than six months. 75 Pa.C.S. § 6503 (Subsequent convictions of certain offenses). There is nothing in the record that indicates that appellant was subject to the recidivist statute applicable to non DUI offenses so as to warrant his fear of going to jail when the officer stopped him. The reasonable inference made by the trial court was that appellant’s fear of incarceration arose from his knowledge that he was driving while his license was suspended for a DUI conviction, which carried a mandatoiy incarceration term.</p>

We note that in an exercise of caution, the trial or sentencing court should always inform the defendant that a § 3731 violation carries with it a mandatory sentence of one year license suspension. The court should further advise in cases where the notice of suspension is sent by PennDOT to the defendant's current address of record with PennDOT that it is incumbent upon the defendant to ensure that PennDOT has the defendant’s current address.
