    <p id="b498-13" data-blocks='[["BL_498.13",498,[264,1293,1153,680]]]'>Throughout these proceedings, the City has argued with respect to Trosky and Cirocco that the remedy for their removal from the promotion list would be reinstatement to the list.

According to the City, then, the relief ordered by the court infringes on the discretion granted by statute to the Public Safety Director and puts the officers in a better position than they would have been in had their names not been.removed from the list.</p>

Therefore, they argue, reinstatement to the list is no relief at all, and the only remedy is that they be ordered promoted.

In this Court, they cite to employment cases involving Title VII and the Pennsylvania Human Rights Act in support of their argument that “courts have considerable latitude in fashioning appropriate remedies.” Brief of Appellees at 13. They also cite to Section 754 of the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. § 754, which governs appeals from decisions of local agencies, as giving the court power to “enter any order authorized by 42 Pa.C.S. § 706 (relating to disposition of appeals),” meaning that the court “may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside or reverse ... and may remand the matter and direct the entry of such appropriate order, or require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.”</p>

    <p id="b500-5" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[259,943,1153,1084]]]'>As the City argues, given the discretion vested in the Public Safety Director it cannot be said with certainty that either Trosky or Cirocco would have been promoted but for the violation of the Police Civil Service Act. Although one of them might have been promoted, it is also possible that the Public Safety Director could have passed them over again and again, even through the last position to be filled. Indeed, the removal of Trosky and Cirocco had an adverse effect not only on them, but on McMeekin and Mihalow as well. As described previously, but for the improper removal McMeekin and Mihalow would have been among the top four candidates for the ninth position, while Cygrymus and Gregorchik would not. One can only speculate as to how the selections would have been made had the statutory procedure been followed throughout<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>, but clearly the relief ordered by the common pleas court placed Trosky and Cirocco in a better position than if the statute had been followed. At the same time it provided no remedy to McMeekin and Mihalow, who, though their names were not stricken, were deprived of the opportunity to have their names considered in proper order.</p>

      <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>The relief ordered also had the effect of interfering with the decision-making authority accorded by statute to the Public Safety Director. Not only did it require the promotion of two officers whom the Director, in his discretion, might lawfully have determined should not be promoted, it also required the creation of a position (actually, in combination with the relief ordered in the <em>Gregorchik </em>matter, two positions) in the rank of sergeant without regard to the administrative consequences of such action.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[162,839,1153,630]]]'>We do not find persuasive the appellees’ arguments in support of the rulings below. The general proposition from the employment discrimination cases, i.e., that the court has discretion to fashion an appropriate remedy, is sound. In each of the cases cited, however, the remedy of hiring, reinstatement, or promotion, along with back pay, was imposed upon a finding that the employer had refused to hire, or had fired, or had passed over the plaintiff for unlawful discriminatory reasons.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Here, it has not been, and cannot be, established as to any of the appellees individually, that he or she would have been promoted if the Public Safety Director had complied with the statute.</p>

Even if the proper procedure had been followed, each of the officers on the list who was not selected for promotion would have been required to sit for the next test in order to be eligible for the next round of promotions. Thus it is possible that both Trosky and Cirocco, even if they had not been removed from the list, would have still been on the list when it expired and had to sit for the next exam. We return again to the conclusion that the relief ordered by the common pleas court put Trosky and Cirocco in a better position than they would have been in had the violation of the civil service laws not occurred. On this basis, we conclude that the court abused its discretion.</p>

There, the municipality had given a test for promotion of applicants to the rank of police lieutenant, the civil service commission had certified a list of four eligible candidates, and the four had been promoted. After the promotion, nineteen fellow officers filed a request for hearing before the personnel board, challenging the promotion procedures and requesting rescission of the promotions. The board denied the request, but on appeal the common pleas court upheld the challenge. The four officers who had been promoted then sought to intervene in the action and have the order vacated. Intervention was denied.</p>
