The petition did not seek to terminate Atencio’s parental rights as to Emiliano and Gregory. The trial court appointed a guardian <em>ad litem </em>for Christopher and a hearing was held on December 17, 1990. On October 3, 1991, Linda Kling, the court-appointed counsel for Christopher, filed a report with the common pleas court, recommending, that the parental rights of Atencio be terminated and the adoption granted.

The trial court found that Atencio failed to perform parental duties for a period in excess of six months, consistent with the ground for involuntary termination set forth in Section 2511(a)(1) of the Adoption Act. However, the court found that the record was utterly devoid of evidence concerning the effect that the termination of Atencio’s parental rights might have on Christopher, considering the fact that his two brothers still have contact with their father. The court concluded that absent such evidence, it had no way of assessing the effect of termination on the child’s needs and welfare. The court subsequently denied the Landises’ application for reconsideration.</p>
