At approximately 6:30 a.m. on that same morning, the victim’s son discovered the body of his father lying behind the bar in a pool of blood. The victim had been stabbed repeatedly and set on fire. The victim’s wallet had been stolen and approximately $500 to $1,000 had been stolen from the bar.</p>

Appellant’s discontent with his attorneys has caused him to file a number of <em>pro se </em>motions and briefs in addition to those filed by court-appointed counsel. Present <em>counsel </em>has appended <em>to </em>the Brief for Appellant what is represented to be Appellant's own brief alleging other issues not included in counsel’s brief. This appended brief authored by Appellant is addressed to the trial court and is intended to be a supplemental brief in support of Appellant’s post-trial motions.</p>

When police entered Appellant’s hotel room armed with the aforementioned search warrant, they were accompanied by a parole officer who held a parole detainer. This detainer was based on the fact that Appellant was observed drinking alcohol in violation of one of his conditions of parole. Appellant maintains that the presence of the parole officer was a pretext because the search warrant executed on his hotel room was not based on probable cause. Based on our finding that the search warrant was supported by probable cause, we need not address this issue. We note, however, that parole officers may arrest a parolee without a warrant for violating any of the terms of his parole. See 61 P.S. § 331.27</p>
