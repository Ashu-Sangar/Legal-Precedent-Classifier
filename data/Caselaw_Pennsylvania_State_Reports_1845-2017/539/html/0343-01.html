A practical nurse employed by a nursing agency was assigned to various hospitals on a temporary basis. There was no suggestion that the workplace changed on a <em>daily </em>basis. The practical nurse could just as easily have been assigned to a hospital for several days at a time and the practical nurse would still be considered as not having a fixed place of employment. Or does the majority insist that if the practical nurse works at the same hospital two consecutive days or more, she now has a fixed place of employment?</p>

I am satisfied that the uncontradicted evidence establishes that the decedent was required to travel from job site to job site to oversee the work.
