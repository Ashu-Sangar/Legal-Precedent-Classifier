Such a proceeding was instituted by the wife, and on the 13th of November, 1882, the matter came before the judge of the criminal court of this county, and an order was then made that John J. Bauder pay $1.50 for the support of his wife and child as long as he lived separate and apart from her, and that he enter into bail in the sum of $100 to comply with that sentence, and in default of his entering bail should be committed to prison. .It appears he entered bail and thus becamé bound to pay the $1.50 per week, and I believe that sum has been paid from that time to this.</p>

But we have received that record in evidence, and you will have it before you as one of the circumstances in the case, showing how these parties came to be separated, and you can also receive it as persuasive evidence of things as they stood at that time, but not conclusive.

The reason for my conclusion is this: The Act of Assembly provides that if certain facts are proved, the injured party shall have a divorce, and if either party demand it, there may be a ijury trial, and if the court were to hold to-day that the decision of the judge in the criminal court was conclusive, then an injured party who alleged desertion and who proved it, and proved that it had existed for two years, would have denied that right which the law gives him, to have a divorce.</p>

Bauder wants to get rid of the pay of $1.50 to his wife, and on the other hand the wife resists the proceeding for divorce because she wants to continue to receive the $1.50 per week. That really has nothing to do with the case, excepting so far as you think that interest maj^ warp the judgment of the witnesses, and affect his or her credibility— that of the libellant or respondent. It is not a question whether he shall pay the $1.50 and she receive that much per week. The question is, has the respondent willfully and maliciously deserted libellant, and has she continued in that desertion for two years, counting to this daj'- ? If that is proved, your verdict ought to be in favor of the libellant. If not, the verdict should be against him and in favor of the wife.</p>

In the opinion of the court, if the court were to say that that was conclusive, then the Acts of Assembly, which provide that if desertion is proved for two years, the party is to have a divorce, would be negatived and of no effect.

Upon the trial the bond was produced in evidence after the husband had given evidence of desertion by the wife. The court trying the case, said that the bond might be viewed as'an agreement to live separate and apart, or, if not considered in that light, the libellant was at least precluded by it from alleging that the desertion took place from the 6th of July, 1844; that in the face.of that bond, before the libellant could allege willful and malicious desertion on his wife’s part, he ought to have communicated to her that his house was open to her and that he was ready to supply her wants and conduct himself towards her as a husband ought to do; that if, after such notice, she still persisted, then would the desertion have become willful and malicious, because without any good cause.

On that issue the jury returned a verdict in May, 1885, finding that the respondent, the appellant, willfully and maliciously deserted and absented herself from the habitation of the libellant, without any just or reasonable cause, and that such desertion had been persisted in for two years and upwards. This finding of facts if correct sustains the decree.</p>

It appears that by reason of the desertion <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>of bis wife by the appellee, after hearing the parties, the court of Quarter Sessions, on the 13th November, 1882, sentenced the appellee to pay one dollar and fifty cents per week towards the support of his wife and his child, so long as they should live separate and apart, etc.</p>
    <p id="b501-4" data-blocks='[["BL_501.5",501,[158,635,1191,695]]]'>This sentence of the Quarter Sessions was admitted in evidence on the trial of the present issue ; but the learned judge held it was no legal bar to the divorce prayed for by the libellant. In this there was no error. Two and a half years liad elapsed between this sentence and the decree of divorce. The evidence is that after the sentence was pronounced the libellant visited his wife “ nearly every week and every two weeks and later <em>every </em>month ” and proposed to her to keep house with him. He leased a house and repeatedly asked her to come and live with him. She answered him evasively, never expressed a willingness to do so, and did not return to him nor to his house. The evidence is ample to justify the jury in finding that he offered to receive and provide for her, and that she refused all his offers; and without any just or reasonable cause that she persisted in that desertion for two years and more previous to the trial of the issue.</p>
    <p id="b501-5" data-blocks='[["BL_501.6",501,[159,1338,1188,130]]]'>There is no error in the charge of the court nor in the answers to the points. We' discover no merit in the eighth and ninth specifications of error.</p>
    <p id="b501-6" data-blocks='[["BL_501.7",501,[424,1469,922,86]]]'>Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
