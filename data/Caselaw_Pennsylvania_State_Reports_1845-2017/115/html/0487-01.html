If a married woman were sued upon this contract and by way of affirmance of it, it is probable that under the Act of 1872 a judgment in some form could be obtained. That, however, is not the effort here, but the effort is to obtain a judgment based upon a tort, trover and conversion, against these two defendants. It is evident from the plaintiff’s case that the sewing machine was placed in the hands of a married woman in pursuance of the written contract in evidence, and whether her contract be treated as an absolute sale, or as a lease, it cannot be found from this- evidence that these two defendants or any one of them has been guilty of a tort.
