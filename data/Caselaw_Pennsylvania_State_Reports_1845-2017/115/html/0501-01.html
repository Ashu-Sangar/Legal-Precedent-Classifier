Some time prior to 1820, Robert Shaw made an improvement on land adjoining this Lambourn survey, and after Shaw’s death, J. B. Shugart, his executor, on September 19th, 1831, sold and conveyed this improvement, containing 226 acres and 77 perches and allowance, to Roland Curtin. About the year 1820, Andrew Hunter also made an improvement and acquired title to another tract of about 127 acres, adjoining the Lambourn survey and the Shaw improvement, which was likewise purchased by Roland Curtin, by articles of agreement <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>dated September 27th, 1881, from said Andrew Hunter. Afterwards the title of Roland Curtiu, Sr., to these three tracts of land became vested in his sons, Austin Curtin, James Curtin, John Curtin, Roland Curtin, Andrew G. Curtin and Constans Curtin, who, by articles of agreement, dated March 17th, 1854, sold and conveyed to Moses Thompson, John'I. Thompson, James Thompson “ the Martha Furnace property, with all land connected therewith, situate in Huston, Worth, Half-Moon, Patton and Ferguson townships, with all ore-lands, ore-rights, woodland and every part of the property connected with the Martha Furnace,” which included the three tracts above specified. No deed was made by the Curtins in pursuance of this agreement until May 15th, 1865, the Thompsons and Irvin holding the property in the meantime under the agreement. On December 17th, 1856, an article of agreement was entered into by Irvin &amp; Thompson to sell and convey to John Mattern, John B. Mattern aud George Mat-tern, a portion of the above-described tracts, supposed to contain about three hundred acres, at $25 per acre, amounting to about $7,500, and in this agreement it was expressly stipulated “ Irvin &amp; Thompsons to make the same title to Mattern that the Messrs. Curtins make them, but reserve to themselves, their heirs and assigns, the privilege to enter upon the land for the purpose of making search for iron ore, with the privilege to take the same away, and ground sufficient for roads and screening-floors and all other uses about the banks, but agree 'to fill up all the shafts they sink where no ore is got, and to pay at the rate of 12| cents per ton of 2240 pounds of good clean ore as a compensation for any damage that may be done the land.....And it is further understood that said Irvin &amp; Thompson reserve to themselves, their heirs and assigns, the entire ore-right on ten acres of land lying between the Desert Houses and Richards aud Chambers, with the privilege to enter upon the same to make search for iron ore and ground sufficient for roads and screening-floors and all other uses about the banks, and not to pay anything for that privilege.”</p>

On the 22d of August, 1857, a deed was executed by James Irvin, Moses Thompson and wife •and John I. Thompson and W'ife, to the Matterns, in pursuance of the agreement, for a consideration of $7,862.75, on which was endorsed a release bjr the Curtins, for a consideration of one dollar, of “ all their interest in the land mentioned and described in the within deed.” By this deed Irvin &amp; Thompsons convey to the Matterns by metes and bounds a tract “ con<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>taining 314 acres and 82 perches net measure, being originally part of the Andrew Hunter, It. Sliaw and Josiah Lambourn’s surveys, which became vested in Roland Curtin, and sold by Austin, James, Roland, John, Andrew and Constans Curtin to the parties of the first part, as their release to the same, executed on this deed, fully shows. The said parties of the first part make the following reservations, to wit: The right to mine and take away ore from ten acres of land contained in” certain fixed boundaries. “ Also, all the ore on the remaining part of the tract, by paying said parties of the second part at the rate of twelve and a half cents per ton of 2240 pounds for every ton mined and taken away by them, off the said tract, excepting on the ten acres, which said parties are to have without charge; they also reserve the entire privilege of all ore on said premises. To have permission to enter upon said premises to mine, clean and take away the same without let or hindrance from the said parties of the second part, their heirs or assigns. It is understood that the above reservation is to the parties of the first part, their heirs or assigns. It is understood that the parties of the first part bind themselves to fill up any holes made on the premises in searching for ore where ore is not found. The clear understanding as regards the above-named reservation is to extend to the parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns, and to give full privilege to enter upon the ground, with teams, wagons, etc., to haul said ore away, with privilege of ground for roads, etc., and to embrace the exclusive right to all the ore bn both the ten acres and the balance of tract.” Under the title so acquired by the agreement and deed from Irvin &amp; Thompsons, the Mat-terns entered into possession of the land conveyed, erected buildings, improved the property, and have continued in undisturbed possession ever since. For over twenty-one years they remained in undisputed possession of the property. During all this time both Thompsons and Matterns supposed that the entire tract was surveyed and patented. Their first information to the contrary was when a certain James Cross, in Juue, 1878, filed an application for 60 acres of land, evidently located on part of the Shaw improvement. And as soon as Moses Thompson, after investigation, could find no evidence that the Shaw tract had ever been surveyed or patented, he also filed an application for a tract of 230 acres to cover the Shaw tract, and at the same time entered a caveat against the Cross application. Cross likewise caveated against Thompson’s application. Both parties entered citations, and depositions were taken; but on the 17th of May, 1879, the dispute between Thompson and Cross was finally settled by the latter assigning his rights under his application to Moses Thompson <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>and John I. Thompson. On the day this settlement was made some of the Matterns were present and notified the Thompsons that they would now expect them to take the necessary steps to have the lands included in the deed from the Thompsons to the Matterns patented. In the proceedings on the Cross application, it was also discovered that .the Andrew Hunter had never been patented. After consultation among the parties and their attorneys it was then decided to withdraw both the Cross and the Moses Thompson applications, and to substitute a new one in the names of Moses and John I. Thompson, for 400 acres that would cover both the Shaw and Hunter tracts, setting forth in the application that it was made “for the use, benefit and protection of applicants and of those claiming under them, according to their respective interests and titles, and not otherwise.” Until this time the Matterns and Thompsons acted in harmony, both desirous of securing a patent such as would protect their respective interests in the property. This application was filed between August 15th and 20th, 1880, and on September 25th, 1880, William H. Blair, in right of William Cross, entered a caveat against this application. Nearly*- a ymar afterwards the Mat-terns also entered a caveat to the Thompson application, and on August 23d, 1882, applied for 200 acres in their own name, covering the ground conveyed to them on the Thompson deed.</p>

That the Board of Property made a mistake in awarding the patent to the defendants, we have no doubt, for the fee to the body of the land in controversy was clearly in the plaintiffs. Nevertheless, we think there was an error in directing a general verdict for the plaintiffs without a reservation of the defendants’ ore right. That right is found in the deed of Irvin and the Thompsons to the Matterns, dated August 22d, 1857. The language of the reservation is, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows: “ They also reserve the entire privilege of all ore on said premises. To have permission to enter upon said premises to mine, clean and take away the same without let or <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>hindrance from the said parties of the second part, their heirs or assigns.”</p>
    <p id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.6",527,[148,484,1188,1265]]]'>The learned president of the Common Pleas held that this reservation left in the vendors an incorporeal hereditament only, and that the verdict, though general, would have no effect upon it.

Moreover, according to the case of French <em>v. </em>Seeley, <a href="/watts/6/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="6 Watts 292" data-case-ids="1846156" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0292-01">6 Watts, 292</a>, the issuing of the patent, the necessary result of the present verdict and judgment, will cut off all rights which the defendants heretofore may have had in the land, one of which, undoubtedly, is the right of entry for the purpose of removing the ore. We are of opinion, therefore, that the defendants’ right should have been reserved by the verdict, for thus only can it be recognized in the patent. As this court, as well as the Common Pleas, has the power to amend verdicts in ejectments, especially those of an equitable kind, such as the one before us, and as it would be to no purpose to send the case back for re-trial, we direct air amendment of the verdict as follows: After the words “they find for the plaintiffs the land described in the writ,” add, “ reserving to the defendants their rights to the ore that may be in and upon said land, together with the right of entry, as described and limited in the deed of James Irvin, Moses Thompson and Mary, his wife, and John I.
