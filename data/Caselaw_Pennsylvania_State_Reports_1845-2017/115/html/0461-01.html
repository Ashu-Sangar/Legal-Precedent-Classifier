At most there was but a scintilla, by far too little to base thereon an adjudication as to the rights of property. It may be that in the case of a sale by the-commissioners of two tracts upon the same day, the law might regard fractions of a day in order to ascertain the relative rights of the parties. No such attempt was made in the present instance and in its absence we must regard the accident of priority in the delivery of the respective deeds as unimportant. The rights of the parties were fixed by the sale, and the subsequent payment of the purchase money and delivery of the deed relate back to that event. The purchaser has an inchoate title the moment the property is knocked down to him, which becomes perfect with the payment of the purchase money.

It is doubtless true that the title was absolute in the county if the county chose to enforce such right. The time allowed by law for redemption had passed.

Such purchase was held to be a redemption ; upon no other ground could such a transaction be maintained, as the commissioners have no power to make a private sale to a stranger for any price, whether more or less than 'the taxes in arrear. In Jenks <em>v. </em>Wright the power of the commissioners to pei’mit redemption after the time has gone by was said by Thompson, C. J., to be beyond dispute and to have been exercised in hundreds of cases, while in Steiner <em>v. </em>Cox it is treated as a custom, proper to be proved as a matter of evidence. Not as a custom to override the Statute, but to aid in its construction.</p>
    <p id="b481-6" data-blocks='[["BL_481.6",481,[146,908,1196,830]]]'>. The Acts authorizing sales of land by the commissioners or treasurer, are laws for the collection of taxes, and not for the confiscation of the property of the citizen, who, from any reason, may be unable to pay them when due. It would be beneath the dignity of a great commonwealth to seek to make gain out of the. misfortunes of her citizens. Hence we have a provision for redemption in case of both treasurer’s and commissioners’ sale. During the period allowed for redemption the equitable title is in the owner; the legal title is in the treasurer or commissioners, as the case may be, as security for the unpaid taxes and costs. After the five years have elapsed, in cases of sales by the commissioners, the owner loses his legal right to redeem. This is not because his equity entirely ceases, but because there must be a time certain when the commissioners may proceed, with or without the consent of the owner, to collect the taxes due. But an equity, not enforceable it is true, remains in the owner, sufficient to warrant the commissioners in permitting redemption at any time before a public sale to other parties, as precribed by Act of Assembly.</p>

The commissioners’ deeds respectively describe them only by their warrantee names; no courses and distances or other bounda-' ries or marks are given. They sold what they bought from the treasurer, and nothing else, and they sold them precisely as they had bought them.</p>

Both treasurer’s deeds appear to have been dated on the same day, but as before observed, it was the <em>sale </em>that fixed the rights of the parties, and not a scramble for the first deed. The commissioners therefore acquired title to the Joseph Taylor before they acquired title to the Robert Irwin. The Taylor was the older survey and paramount title. Hence when they subsequently bought the Robert Irwin, they bought what was <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>left outside of the Joseph Taylor, conceding these to be an interference as claimed. Holding the two titles therefore in the manner above stated, it is conceded the commissioners might, had they so willed, have sold this interference by metes and bounds. But they did not do so nor attempt it. They sold both tracts as they received them without any regard to location. The purchaser of the Joseph Taylor took by his deed just what the commissioners took by the treasurer’s deed. So of the Robert Irwin. Suppose, instead of making this sale of the two tracts, the commissioners had sold them to the owners at private sale. This, under the authorities cited, would have been a redemption, although after the five years. Surely no intexrtion of passing the interference would be presumed ixi such case.</p>
    <p id="b482-4" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[243,1039,1195,739]]]'>The county commissioners can only convey by deed what they have previously sold by public sale, excepting perhaps the single instance of a conveyance to the owner by way of redemption. The deed from the commissioners to the plaintiff below limits their conveyance to tlxe premises corxveyed to their predecessors by the treasurer’s sale of August Sd, 1874. The recital is as follows : “ It being the same tract of hind which J. B. Mitchell, treasurer of said county .... sold, granted and conveyed by deed poll dated the 20th day of November, 1874, to the commissioners of Centre county and to their successors in office,” etc. In like manner, the commissioners’ deed to the defendants below, refers to the sale of June 8th, 1874. The sale of the Joseph Taylor having been prior to the sale of the Robert Irwin, it is difficult to see how the treasurer’s deed conveyed to the county more than the residue of the Robert Irwin, that is to say, what reniained outside of it after the sale of the Joseph Taylor in June preceding.</p>
