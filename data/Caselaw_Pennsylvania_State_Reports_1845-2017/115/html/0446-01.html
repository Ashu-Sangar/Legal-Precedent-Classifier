The Association, on the 29th of August, 1878, issued a policy, for $1,000, payable to Charles Norris, her son-in-law. On the 16th of September, 1878, Norris assigned all his right, title and interest in the policy to Dr. Jacob R. Spangler, of York, Pa. It was understood between Mrs. Rausch and Dr. Spangler, before the application was made, that it was to be taken out in the name of Charles Norris as the beneficiary, because Dr. Spangler was the medical examiner of the Association and could not take it in his own name, and that it was to be assigned by Norris to Spangler. All of the assessments and annual premiums were paid by Spangler, whose assignment was accepted by the Association, and it was entered on their books.

The plaintiff sought to avoid the legal effect of his failure to bring suit by setting up the following facts; On March 10th, 1883, Dr. J. R. Spangler, in his own name, brought suit upon this policy in the Common Pleas of York county. As Mrs. Rausch did not die in that county, and as the principal office of the Association was in Lehigh county, the Court of Common Pleas of York could not obtain jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, through a service made by the Sheriff of Lehigh county on the officers in Allentown. A conditional appearance was entered for the defendant, and the Court after a rule for that purpose, set aside the-service, holding that under the Act of April 24th, 1857, (P.

Answer: — “ Yes sir.” If now, we admit that Norris had such an interest in the assured as would have warranted him in. taking a policy on her life, yet that fact cannot help out the plaintiff’s case since the policy was not founded on that interest, neither was it for the benefit of Norris, but for the benefit of one who had no interest whatever in the insured life. Norris’s name was used as a mere blind, and could deceive no one conversant with the facts; Spangler was the real beneficiary, and the policy would have been quite as efficient bad it been issued directly to him. The doctrine here advanced is supported by all our own authorities, one of the most recent being Corson’s Ap., <a href="/citations/?q=118%20Pa.%20438" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="118 Pa. 438">118 Pa., 438</a>. As a case in point, we may also cite Warnock <em>v. </em>Davis, <a href="/us/104/0775-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="104 U.S. 775" data-case-ids="3494802" data-case-paths="/us/104/0775-01">104 U. S., 775</a>; in which it was held, by Mr. Justice Field, that an insurable interest, such as will take the contract out of the wager class, must arise from the relation of the party taking the insurance to the insured, either as surety or debtor, or from the ties of blood, or marriage, so that from the relation thus established there may be some expectation of benefit or advantage in the continuance of the assured life. Otherwise the risk is to be regarded as a pure wager, in' which the interest of the policy holder is to be found rather in the cessation than the continuance of the life. On all authority, therefore, the court should have affirmed the defendant’s fifth, sixth and seventh points. Nor can we agree with the learned judge of the court below, that the running of the one year limitation prescribed by the policy was suspended by the York county suit. Passing by the fact that that suit was brought in the name of the equitable instead of the legal plaintiff, yet as it was instituted in a court not having jurisdiction of the defendant, it was wholly without effect. As a consequence, the analogy sought to be established between the plaintiff’s ease and the Act of the 27th of March, 1713, and the decisions under it, wholly failed, and so the court should have ruled. The judgment is reversed.</p>
