The Act of April 3d, 1872, in reference to the separate earnings of married women was intended to protect such earnings, wages, labor, salary, property or business as they might carry on independently of their husbands and in which they had special skill and knowledge; and does not protect any such labor or business in which the husband alone had skiil and knowledge.</p>

Previously they were considered the property of the husband, and they so continue unless she lias taken the benefit of this Act. Even then when she is declared a <em>femme sole </em>trader and comes into court claiming property, this Act provides that she shall be compelled to show title in the same. The possession of any property in a man would be a presumption of title — the possession of personal property. That is not so as to a married woman. She must show her title. There is no presumption in her favor. Now, under these Acts of Assembly, there have been numerous decisions of the Supreme Court, and they amount substantially to the point set up by counsel. It is Weil settled now that when a wife has a separate estate acquired in the manner in which I have already stated, and she buys property on the credit of that separate estate, she may hold it against the creditors of her husband. And it is not necessary that she shall have paid for it at the time of her purchase. She is not precluded from buying on credit, provided it be on the credit of her separate estate. And in all such cases it is incumbent upon her to establish the fact that the purchase was so made to protect her title against the creditors of her husband. This must be <em>hy </em>proof which satisfies the jury. “ A married woman having no separate estate cannot as against her husband’s creditors acquire real or personal property on her personal credit or on the credit of her subsequent earnings. Nor does the fact that she is <em>&amp; femme sole </em>trader modify the rule as to the meas<a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>ure of rule incuinbent on the wife. Property bought by a married, woman upon her individual credit and subsequently paid for from profits in business, is-to be regarded as the property of her husband, and subject to execution by his creditors.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[266,598,1186,572]]]'>That applies to cases where the married woman had no separate estate. Where the married woman has a separate estate of her own, as 1 have said, <em>she </em>may purchase property on the credit of' that estate and it will be protected as against Her husband’s creditors. It has been decided that a <em>femme sole </em>trader — a woman who'has acquired the right under this Act of Assembly — may employ her husband to superintend the business and have the benefit of his skill and labor; additional property purchased by such means belongs to her and cannot be levied upon by his creditors. The property acquired, if it be the result of the original investment, the creditors have no right to levy upon. She has just as much right <em>to </em>employ her husband as she has to employ any other person.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.6",486,[265,1170,1185,823]]]'>Now, gentlemen, these are the general rules which should <em>govern yon </em>in the investigation of this case. It is claimed by the plaintiff that the property in controversy in this case — the horses, harness and' blankets — were acquired by her out of her separate property — -out of property which had been originally given to her, and which she afterwards acquired in the management of what she had. On the other hand it is claimed by the defendant that she has not shown such property as would satisfy the jury that the ownership is made out as required by the rules of law. It will be for you to determine under all the evidence whether or not this woman has made out the required title. If she has she would be entitled to recover just the extent she has been injured. That would- be the value of the team of horses and harness and blankets, and the property. If you find that all the property belonged to her, and if she has shown it by proof satisfactory as I have stated — then you ascertain the value of that property as of the time it was taken —that is December 5th, 1884. Ascertain the value of the property at that time and add interest up to this time.</p>
