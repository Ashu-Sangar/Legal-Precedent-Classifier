J., in Weaver <em>v. </em>Wible, 1 Casey, 272, which is a clear statement of the law abundantly sustained by authorities. In Van Iiorne <em>v. </em>Fonda, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Johns.%20Ch.%20389" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Johns. Ch. 389">6 Johns.

How does this alleged resulting trust arise? In order to sustain a proposition of this kind, the plaintiffs are bound to show that Earley obtained his title in fraud of their right, or that their money was used in its acquisition : Blyholder <em>v. </em>Gilson, <a href="/pa/18/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="18 Pa. 134" data-case-ids="969047" data-case-paths="/pa/18/0134-01">18 Pa., 134</a>; Cross’s Ap., <a href="/pa/97/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="97 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="444768" data-case-paths="/pa/97/0471-01">97 Pa., 471</a>. But there is not even an offer to prove that so much as a dollar of the plaintiffs’ money went into the purchase of the lands in controversy. Then again, when we turn to the charge of fraud, it is unsupported b}r a shadow of proof. On this' head it is complained that the court overruled an offer to prove that Earley had employed Willard to make an examination of the lines and records of the company lands ; that he did make such an examination, and that “ these lands in controversy were within the bounds of the survey made by him at that time, or within <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>the bounds of a paper description which he has before him, and that all was done at the request of Dr. Earley for Earley, Brick-ell and Hite.” But we are as obtuse as the court below in perceiving how this, if proven, would have manifested the fact that the defendant acquired title to these lands as a co-tenant or trustee. A fatal defect in the offer is that it does not propose to show anything as to the manner of the acquisition, and failing this it fails altogether : Cross’s Ap., <em>supra.</em>

The offers in the third and fourth assignments are as ineffective as are the others.

So, there was no significance in the fact that both before and after the sale to Hall, the defendant declared that the sale was for the joint benefit of the parties and to perfect their title. Earley could not thus compromise Hall, and when the treasurer’s title was complete in Hall, he could sell to whom he pleased, and Earley, even though he had been a tenant in common with the plaintiffs in these Arery lands, could take from him a perfect title excluding his co-tenants: Lewis <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/watts/10/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Watts 354" data-case-ids="1850953" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0354-01">10 Watts, 354</a>; Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Mathiot, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 251" data-case-ids="1856362" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0251-01">4 W. &amp; S., 251</a>.

No specific tracts are defined, but “there were a number of those tracts, or parts of tracts, the title to which was in doubt,” and for that reason they were allowed to go to sale, and were to be bought in by Dr. Earley. Indefinite as this statement is, yet it is very clear that no reference could have been had to the lots in controversjs for ,as they had no pretence of title, of that fact there could have been no doubt. So, with reference to Earley’s letter of June 20th, 1878, it is not,only not certain that the land in controversy is referred to, but the contrary. Mr. Hall had purchased not only these Earley lots, but also the lands belonging to the company, and it is evident that reference is made to the latter when it is said, “ Mr. Hall will assign deeds at any time if money is paid at once, but if he pays out, or has to raise the money, we must pay the twenty-five per cent.” This language refers to a redemption, and not to a purchase of property not theretofore belonging to the company. But it is useless to dwell upon this fruitless matter, for there is nothing in the case which tends to raise a resulting trust.</p>
