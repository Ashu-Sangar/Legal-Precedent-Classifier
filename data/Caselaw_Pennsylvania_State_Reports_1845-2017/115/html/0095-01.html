He was the owner in fee of eighty acres of land which, it is said, was assessed for taxes at the rate of $500 per acre, but which one of the witnesses, at least, says, and he is not contradicted, was worth $1,400 per acre.

But this circumstance, alone, would not be sufficient to create a joint responsibility of the executors. “At one time,” says Mr. Justice Bkll, in Stell’s Appeal, 10 Barr, 152, “ it seems to have been received as an inflexible rule that where executors joined in a receipt they were jointly chargeable, on the ground that a joinder was unnecessary, unless they intended to be responsible for each other. But this rule has never extended to trustees, created by deed, since it was necessary all should join in the execution of the trust, and consequently were compellable to execute joint receipts, though one of them only received the fund. And even in the case of executors, modern good sense, looking beyond the technical reason of the rule, which was supposed to be applicable to the peculiarity of the trust devolved on them, seems to have broken down the distinction between them, and other trustees, bj'- denying that in reason, an intent to be jointly chargeable is dedueible from the mere fact of joining in a receipt: per Lord Eldon, 16 Ves., 479; McNain’s Appl., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20R.%2C%20148" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="4 R., 148">4 R., 148</a>; Brown’s Appl., <a href="/dall/1/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="1 Dall., 311" data-case-ids="12145704,1408439" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0311-01,/us/1/0326-01">1 Dall., 311</a>; Sterrett’s Appl., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pa.%20420" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="2 Pa. 420">2 Penn.

If John Noble retained the money under the claim that he was the natural guardian of his daughters, who were yet in their minority, and applied it to his own use, this was, without doubt, a perversion of- the money to an improper purpose, a plain misapplication of the trust moneys; <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>but, after an examination of all the evidence, we are unable to agree with the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court, that Wilson ought'to be held for the result. If .the testimony of Wilson is believed, and he is not- contradicted or in any way discredited, he made a vigorous resistance to Noble’s retention of the money for this purpose. He consulted Robert Woods, Esq., a highly respected member of the Pittsburgh bar, who was their counsel in the settlement of the estate, and Mr. Woods “backed” Noble’s pretensions to the money. Mr. Wilson says: — “He (Noble) claimed that he was the child’s legal guardian, and Woods, our attorney, he backed him up on it; I was not satisfied, and I went to see Mr. Miller (Jacob H. Miller, also a member of the bar) and paid him for counsel ; he came over, and they talked the matter over together, and they asked me whether he was responsible; I told them that he was, that he was well known to be (and so he was), and they agreed to give him the money.” This was on the 15th May, 1875, some seven days after the first $5,000-was paid. After the consultation, Mr.-Woods wrote, and Roble signed, a paper in the following form:</p>

Denying the right of Noble to retain the money, or to apply it to the purpose stated, what could Wilson do more than to place the whole responsibility of the transaction on Noble? The latter had a right to receive the money, Wilson could not gainsay his right, and, having received it, he might either deposit it to the joint account, or otherwise, as he chose. He was not bound to submit himself to the consequences of a joint control, and, therefore, to a joint responsibility, against his will; he was in good financial credit, and had a right to the custody of the fund on his own responsibility; and this was precisely the right which Wilson permitted him to exercise. Wilson did not consent to the proposed misapplication of the money; to that he objected, and applied to counsel for relief against it; but, being advised that if Noble was responsible, he had an undoubted right to take the money on his own responsibility, he suffered him to do so, taking a receipt to show the measure of his individual liability to the estate. <em>Won constat </em>that Noble would use the money as.'his own, or otherwise misapply it; it was his duty to invest it to answer the call of those eutitled when their right accrued, and certainly Wilson was <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>not called upon to guard the interests of the estate until its rights were invaded.</p>

It is doubtless the duty of all executors to watch over and, if necessary, as far as practicable, to correct the conduct of each other; an executor of trustee who stands by and sees a breach of trust committed by his co-executor, without any effort on his part to prevent it by the use of such remedies as the law may afford, becomes responsible for that breach of trust. In 1877, it is said, Wilson became aware that Noble was financially embarrassed and, in 1881, that he was using the trust funds, which he had collected, for his own purposes. Whether this embarrassment was supposed to be of a temporary nature, or of such a pronounced character as to seridusly affect his credit or to threaten insolvency; or whether his use of the trust funds was beyond the amount for which he then took Noble’s note, does not appear. The testimony on these points is certainly very meager and unsatisfactory. The sheriff’s recognizance appears to have been entered for the purpose of lien only as directed by law; it is not shown that Noble at anytime was obliged to pay any part of the money secured by it. The other liens were small in proportion to the estimated value of the property, and it does not appear that Wilson knew, or had any reason to suspect, that he was otherwise largely indebted.' Wilson, we think, acted in this matter in entire good faith; he stopped the further receipt of the trust money by Noble; from the year 1880, when he received the first information, he refused to permit Noble to make an}*- further collections; they agreed upon a receiver, and thereafter the collections passed into a receiver’s hands, and Wilson now stands charged with all the moneys which he received. He took Noble’s notes for the amount he had used of the trust estate, and with these notes he has been surcharged. Under these circumstances we hesitate to say that it was gross negligence in Wilson not to proceed without delay against Noble for an account, for his removal from office, and for a surrender of the trust estate in his hands, such a proceeding he would certainly not be required to institute against his co-executor, if he were required to do so at all, unless he knew, or had the means of knowing, and therefore ought to have known, that he was wasting and mismanaging the estate under his charge, beyond the amount for which he had already accounted to Wilson in the notes referred to, or that he was likely to prove insolvent, and of his knowledge, or means of knowledge, in this respect the evidence is, we think, slight indeed. Upon the first and second assign<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>ments of error, therefore, the decree of the Orphans’ Court must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="ACr" data-blocks='[["BL_120.5",120,[236,487,1182,384]]]'>The third and fourth assignments of error are not sustained. Having taken the notes referred to in the second assignment, it was Wilson’s duty under the circumstances to secure them by lien or otherwise, as any other loan or investment; not having done so, he must be held for payment thereof. The Plunkett loan was upon the personal security of the debtor alone, and the subsequent advance of funds in relief of the original loan was, under the facts shown, at the risk of the accountant.</p>
