Her right to do so was contested upon the ground that in consideration of a certain interest conveyed to her by an ante-n.uptial settlement, she had released all further claim to the estate of her husband. The contract was dated September 26th, 1867, about one month before her marriage to the testator. The testator, by this agreement, granted to a trustee a warehouse property on Front street near Market street, in trust to permit the said Caroline, after testator’s death, to receive the rents during her life; and the said Caroline, after releasing her thirds, covenanted that the testator should have the right to <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>couvev all tbe rest of his estate without her becoming a party to the deed or deeds of conveyance.

    <p class="summary" id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.6",335,[139,639,1185,1133]]]'>The question does not seem to be attended with difficulty. In the interest of the widow, it must be admitted that tbe parties toan ante-nuptial settlement stand in a relation which compels the exercise of the largest good faith, and excludes from their dealings the thought of any material concealment by either: Kline <em>v. </em>Kline, 7 P. F. S., Í20. This doctrine has been so sedulously adhered to, that a provision made by the prospective husband, which was manifestly disproportioned to the value of his estate, has been held to raise a presumption that he has practiced such concealment: Bower’s Appeal, 11 Nor., 265; Kline’s Estate, 14 P.F. S., 122. The principle was invoked by the widow of Stephen Smith. She showed that the testator’s real estate was valued at $56,500, or thereabouts, and that the inventory of his personal estate footed up $358,-493.10, with a net fund for distribution of $334,543.83. The property set apart for her use was assessed for taxation in the sum of $12,500, and has now a rental value of $1,200 per annum, out of which $231.25 must be deducted for taxes. She also showed that this property is in bad order, and that when the testator last repaired it, he declared that he did so only to keep it in tenantable condition during his own life. He did not record the deed of settlement, nor deliver it to the trustee; but kept it among his own papers. These circumstances, it was claimed, were sufficiently indicative of bad faith to cast upon his legal representatives the burden of showing the contrary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-7" data-blocks='[["BL_335.7",335,[134,1773,1190,737]],["BL_336.1",336,[260,462,1186,994]]]'>In answer to this, the solemn admission of the widow, that the testator had apprised her of the value of his estate, which appeared in the deed, may be used in two ways; it either throws upon her the burden of showing that she had been deceived; or if the <em>onus </em>is with the accountants, it is affirmative proof in their hands that she was not deceived. The language of her covenant is : “ The said Caroline Reimer, after full consideration, and with full knowledge of all the other estate; of the said Stephen Smith, in consideration of said intended marriage, and of the provisions of this deed, and for other good and valuable consideration her thereunto moving, doth,” etc-. The law presumes that she understood the force of these expressions when she used them over her signature. But the case does not rest upon her admissions. When the contract was executed, the present widow was forty-three years of age, without property, and earning her livelihood as an assistant in her brother’s photograph establishment. Th.e, testator was <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>fifty-two years old, with a family of six children. His estate ■was then worth, as shown by his books, $129,396.16, and the property which lie assigned to his wife yields now, at a time of low rentals, nearly $1,000 a jmar net. It is wholly outside of the question, that the estate has enormously enhanced in value since the marriage contract because the possibility both of its increase and diminution was a problem which was mutually waived by the parties. The only flaw in the testator’s case is his failure to record the deed. He certainly did not intend to destroy it, because it was found as carefully preserved as his own deeds. He did not convey the property, although the deed of settlement empowered him to convey it, without, his wife’s joinder, but subject to the trust. Hence, the widow has suffered no injury from his omission. But the testator did not stand upon the legal provision which he had made for his wife ; he supplemented it by a testamentary gift of the income of $15,000 for her life. Grouping these circumstances together, the auditing judge feels bound to decree that the widow’s right of election is gone. If authority were needed to show that the consideration was adequate, and that it was not affected by the after-acquisition of property by the husband, he would cite Ludwig’s Appeal, 5 Out., 535, and Rahe <em>v. </em>Bank, 15 Nor., 128.</p>
