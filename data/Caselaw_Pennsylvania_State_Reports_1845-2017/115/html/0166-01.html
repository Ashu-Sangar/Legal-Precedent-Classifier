It appears that the company, defendant, was incorporated in the year 1833, to build a road “ from a point near the intersection of Twentieth street and Pennsylvania avenue, in the Fifteenth ward of the city of Philadelphia, to a point in the Twenty-seventh ward of the said city of Philadelphia, near to the intersection of Fiftieth street and Bertram avenue.” The length of,the road, as provided by its charter, was to be, “as near as may be, three miles.” As actually laid out it is three and nine tenths miles. From a point about the middle of this road the defendant company has laid out a branch road to a point on the Delaware river. The length of this branch is six and six tenths miles. It is this branch which goes through the plaintiff’s property, and he seeks to restrain its construction upon the ground that it is an extension of the main line, and not a branch, and that it comes directly within the letter and spirit of the Act of 21st of May, 1881, P. L., 27, which authorizes railroad companies whose lines do not exceed fifteen miles in length, to extend their roads upon the terms and in the manner prescribed by said Act; and that inasmuch as the defendant company has not complied with the requirements of the said Act, it is acting <em>ultra vires </em>and has no right to take plaintiff’s land.</p>

The branch road referred to merely runs to the local freight depot on the Delaware at Dickenson street. This depot is about two miles in distance from the main line, yet to avoid the expense and inconvenience of locating it through the built-up portions of the city, a detour is made by which the actual length of the road is about six miles.</p>
