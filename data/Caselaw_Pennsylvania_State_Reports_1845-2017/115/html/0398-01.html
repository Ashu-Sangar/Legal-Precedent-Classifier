    <p class="headnotes" id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[241,644,1182,945]]]'>An. insurance company issued a policy of fire insurance on a building, permitting concurrent insurance, and stipulating that in case of loss, that immediate notice should be given to the company, and as soon thereafter as possible, the assured should render a particular account, and proof thereof, setting forth <em>inter alia, </em>the actual cash value of the property destroyed immediately before the fire, the amount of other insurance, and a plan and specifications of the building destroyed. By the terms of the policy, where there was concurrent insurance, each company was liable only for its proportion of the loss, which was to be paid within sixty days after due notice and proof of loss had been made by the assured, and received at the office of the company, unless the company had given notice of its intention to rebuild or repair the damaged premises. The building insured was totally destroyed by fire. Notice of this was given the company on the following day. More than sixty days after this, the secretary of the company wrote the assured, calling his attention to the condition of the policy, requiring a particular account and proofs of loss of the fire. More than a month after this the assured furnished the company proof of loss, but did not forward plans and specifications of the building destroyed. Twenty days after this, the assured brought suit on his policy. <em>Held, </em>That the proofs of loss were conditions precedent to the bringing of an action on the policy of insurance, and while under the circumstances it might be inferred that the company had waived the production of the pilan and specifications, yet this would not deprive the company of the time stipulated, in which to obtain the information elsewhere, or to determine whether they would rebuild the building, or pay the loss, and the suit having been brought within that time, was premature and could not be maintained.</p>

The defendant says the particular statement furnished did not furnish a plan and specifications of the building destroyed; and therefore, he insists, there can be no recovery because of that. If this, by the terms of the policy, were to be construed as a condition precedent, upon the non-performance of which the policy was to be forfeited, such omission would be fatal; but we do not so read and construe the contract. On this trial the dimensions and plan of the building were proven, though no draft was produced here; and as the defendant offered no evidence indicating any desire to adjust the loss or to rebuild, and if you find that the defendant company declined to acknowledge the liability, then we submit to the jury the question whether or not, under all the evidence and circumstances in this case, and in the absence of any request for plans and specifications, the clause in question was waived.</p>

The subject of insurance was a coal breaker; it was insured in the sum not exceeding $2,500, and the loss was total. A notice was forthwith forwarded to the company, giving the number of the policy, the amount of the insurance secured thereby, and stating that “the coal-breaker was burnt down,” on that day. In the decision of that case, the court treated the notice as a substantial compliance with the conditions of the policy'. “This was as particular a statement” say's Mr. Justice Thompson, “as could be given; the subject of insurance was a single structure; the amount to be paid for it, in case of loss, was fixed and referred to, and it was reported as a total loss; the particular statement required would have contained but this, in substance, if it had been made.”</p>

In all these cases, it was held, that a <em>particular </em>statement, or an account of the several items of a loss, could not, in the nature of the case, have been intended, where there was only a single subject of insurance, and the loss was total, that such a statement was obviously only meant to be furnished, when there was a loss of several distinct items of insured property or when the loss was partial only.</p>
    <p id="b419-4" data-blocks='[["BL_419.5",419,[140,792,1185,871]]]'>But it will be observed, that the policy in suit requires that certain specific matters shall be stated to the company, under oath, which by its special provisions are essential, in the ascertainment of the extent of the company’s liability, when there is but a single subject insured, and a total loss, as the particular statement is, where there are numerous subjects, or the loss partial. By the express terms of the policy, concurrent insurance was permitted and the insured, in case of loss, was entitled to recover no greater proportion of the loss, than the amount the policy bore to the amount of the existing insurance; and the second clause of the tenth condition of the policy, thereupon, provides that the assured in his particular account of the loss, shall set forth the “ other insurance, if any, on same property, or any portion thereof, with copies of the written portion of each policy, and endorsement thereon.” Another of the terms of the policy is, that the property destroyed may be replaced or rebuilt, or the damaged premises may be repaired, and, therefore, the sixth clause of the same condition provides, that “if the claim be for the loss on a building, the assured shall furnish a plan and specification ” thereof.</p>
    <p id="b419-5" data-blocks='[["BL_419.6",419,[133,1664,1188,824]],["BL_420.1",420,[275,430,1179,88]]]'>The clauses quoted, illustrate the distinction which, we think, may be drawn fairly between the cases cited and relied upon by the defendants in error, and the present case; it must be conceded that these clauses have especial application to a case like this. By the terms of this policy concurrent insurance was expressly permitted, and at the time of the fire actually existed, to the amount of $3,000; true, the loss is estimated at $4,000, and upwards, but how was the company to know what was the amount of the concurrent insurance, or that the whole amount of the insurance did not exceed the total loss. In order therefore that the company might accurately ascertain the amount of their liability under the policy, it was important that they should be furnished with what they had expressly provided for, a statement of the amount of the other insurance. And, further, that the company might intelligently exercise the option to rebuild, it was equally important that they should have what it was the undoubted duty of the assured to supply, the plans and specifications of the property destroyed. The loss was not payable for sixty days after such statements were <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>made and furnished to the company, and the contract was accepted expressly subject to the performance of these conditions-</p>
    <p id="b420-4" data-blocks='[["BL_420.5",420,[275,515,1178,221]]]'>It follows that no suit could be brought until these conditions were complied with, nor for sixty days thereafter, which time the company reserved after the extent of their liability could be determined from the proofs, either to pay the money, or to give notice of their option to replace the property.</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[274,732,1181,565]]]'>Proofs were made however and furnished to the company on the 28th of March, 1885; they would appear to have been furnished in compliance with a suggestion from the secretary of the company, in writing, dated 20th February, 1885, in which he calls the attention of the assured to condition X of the policy and says: “As soon as we receive the necessary proofs, in accordance with the requirements of our policy, we can determine whether we owe you anything, and, if so, how much.” The sixty days, it will be observed, had then fully expired and if the proofs were afterwards promptly furnished, or within a reasonable time, in compliance with the secretary’s suggestion and request, we think the company might well be supposed to have waived the previous delay.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.7",420,[270,1295,1182,910]]]'>But the proofs which were furnished did not contain plans and specifications, as required. The assured does state therein “that he will furnish whenever required by the said company, as full particulars as he can as to the construction of the building insured, its dimensions and condition at the time of said fire, and such additional information as shall be required by said company concerning said property; but notwithstanding this averment of his willingness so to do, it is nevertheless true that he did not furnish the plans, and specifications, as it was his plain duty to do. On receipt of these defective proofs, therefore, the company had the undoubted right to adhere to the requirements of the policy, and to reject the proofs, with notification to the , assured, or return them for amendment. But the company was not bound to reject the proofs ; the condition of the policy was inserted for the benefit of the company, and it was competent for the company to waive its provisions. The information necessary for the exercise of the option, might be obtained elsewhere. But it is plain that the company had sixty days after the proofs, as made, were furnished, or after the making of the amended proofs, as the case may be, in which to decide whether they would rebuild, or pay the money.</p>
    <p id="b420-7" data-blocks='[["BL_420.8",420,[269,2204,1181,261]],["BL_421.1",421,[152,390,1184,479]]]'>The proofs were furnished, as we have said, on the 28th March, 1885, and suit was brought on the 17th April, thereafter, In this interval the proofs remained with the company; no objection was made either to the form or substance thereof. It was not until 24th August, 1885, that the company in any way indicated their disapproval. It cannot be doubted that <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>the proofs were intended as a substantial compliance with the conditions of the policy; if they bad been rejected and notice given to the assured, or if they had been returned with the reasons for non-acceptance, more complete proofs would doubtless have been furnished, the. assured having averred his willingness to furnish the fullest information on this point, “ whenever required by the company.” The proofs of loss were but conditions precedent to the bringing of an action, and not of the insurance, and, we think, under the circumstances, it might well be inferred that the company Lad waived the production of the plans and specifications.</p>
