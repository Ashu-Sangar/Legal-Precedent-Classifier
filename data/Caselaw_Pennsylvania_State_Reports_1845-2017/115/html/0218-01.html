A judgment was obtained against Reese D. Fell for want of a plea. The narr alleged that Ella G. Fell, the wife of Reese D. Fell, acting through an agent bought of the plaintiff certain furniture in a house leased by the plaintiff, and agreed to purchase all his right in the lease of said house, upon the terms that the said furniture and the said lease should be delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant and accepted and paid for by her; and although the plaintiff has performed all the conditions precedent on his part, and all things have happened and occurred, and all periods of time have elapsed to entitle the plaintiff to a performance of the defendant’s contract, and although the defendants have been repeatedly requested to carry out and perform the agreement which they made with the plaintiff, and although said furniture and said lease were necessaries for the support and maintenance of said Ella G. Fell, in her rank, degree and station in life, and as such contracted for by her, yet the defendants did not accept or pay for the furniture or lease as aforesaid whereby the plaintiff has incurred expense in keeping the said furniture, and in endeavoring to procure the completion of said contract by the defendants, and has been forced to resell the said furniture and lease after notice to Ella G. Fell, for prices less than the prices to have been paid by the defendants, and has incurred costs, etc.</p>

Fell was a married woman, not living with her husband. In September, 1884, she contracted with the plaintiff to purchase from him the lease of a dwelling house, which he was then occupying, for the sum of $800, and the <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>furniture in the house for the sum of $2,500. She agreed to pay-cash for the same upon taking possession; when she went to take possession, the plaintiff was not in the house ; the servant admitted her, she examined the furniture, and declared that some of it had been removed, that it was not all that she bought, and she therefore declined to receive any of it. It was not seriously disputed- that the lease and furniture were necessaries for the support and maintenance of the defendant, Ella G. Fell, in her rank, degree and station in life. After notifying her to comply with her contract, or the lease and furniture would be sold at a time specified, Mr Brown sold them for a price much smaller than Ella G. Fell had contracted to pay.</p>

At common law the contract of a married woman, even for family necessaries, was void, and the only modification of this rule so far as our commonwealth is concerned, is found in <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>the Act of the 11th of April, 1848. This Act, however, provides “ that judgment shall not be rendered against the wife, in such joint action, unless it shall have been proved that the debt sued for in such action was contracted by the wife, or incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family of the husband and wife.” And the action authorized by the preceding part of the section in which the recited proviso is foun.d, gives the creditor a joint action against the husband and wife for debts contracted for necessaries for the support and maintenance of the family of the married woman. But we have before us an action against husband and wife, not for the price of articles furnished, and which were necessary for the support of the family, but for damages alleged to have resulted from a breach of her contract with the plaintiff. We need hardly say, that neither common law nor statute warrants an action such as this. But more than this; it was held by this court in Berger <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/pa/79/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="79 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="438381" data-case-paths="/pa/79/0340-01">79 Pa., 340</a>; citing Murray v. Keys, 11 Ca., 384; Park <em>v. </em>Kleeber, 1 Wr., 251; Bear’s Estate, 10 P. F. S., 430, and Davidson <em>v. </em>McCandlish, 19 Id., 169, that the pleadings must not only set out a debt contracted by the wife, but that it was incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family of the husband and wife, and that the evidence must establish these facts. When, however, we turn to the plaintiff’s narr, we find that the rule stated by the cases cited, and which is in fact but a statement of the peremptory requirement of the statute, has not been complied with. But it is therein stated “that the said furniture and the said lease were necessaries for the support and maintenance of said Ella G. Fell in her rank, degree and station in life, and as such contracted for by her.” This is no compliance with the Act, even if the alleged necessaries had been furnished, which they were not. This count would be good against the husband for and on account of goods furnished to his wife; but clearly not good under the 8th section of the Act of 1848 to charge her for necessaries furnished the family. Neither does this <em>narr </em>charge that she received from the plaintiff anything necessary or unnecessary, but simply a breach of contract. The object of the Act was to enable her, in relief of the family of which she might be a member, by her contract to procure food, clothing and other things of prime necessity for its comfort and use, but where that contract is productive of nothing that will sub-serve that use, it is clear that it is neither within the spirit and meaning, nor letter of the Act.</p>
