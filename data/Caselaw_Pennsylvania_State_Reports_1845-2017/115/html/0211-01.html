So far as they speak of relationship, existing at the time the witnesses speak, they are evidence in connection with other testimony before you.” There was other evidence upon this point. John Kemp, a witness called for the defendants, said: “I am a nephew of Joseph Kemp. Knew him and 1ns wife about twenty years. Went to their house about three or four times a month. Mrs. Kemp said she had a sister, Mary Edwards, an old bachelor brother, a son of Mrs. Edwards, in Australia, and two nieces, by the name of Lloyd, in Liverpool.” And upon cross examination : “The name of her brother was David Edwards. I heard he was dead. She said she had two nieces Ly a sister 'and their names were Lloyd.” This was defendant’s testimon)'-.

They are both plaintiffs, and both swear to the relationship. As before stated, the court ruled out all they said as to births, marriages and matters occurring prior to the death of Jane Kemp, but allowed what they said as to the mere fact of their relationship to go to the jury. It is not <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>pretended that the witnesses would have been competent prior to the Act of 1869, nor that they were made competent by that Act. If competent at all, it must be by virtue of the Act of 9th April, 1870, P. L., 44, which allows, in the enumerated cases, a party to the record to testify to “ matters occurring since the death of the person whose estate, through a legal representative, is á party to the record.” An examination-of the depositions shows that the witnesses testified to no matters occurring since the death of Jane Kemp. It is true, they both swore to their respective relationship to Jane Kemp. Surely, that fact did not occur since her death. It was an existing fact, and one which existed during the lifetime of Jane Kemp. Hence, when the witnesses prove a relationship existing after the death of Jane, they necessarily prove a fact existing prior to her death, and this is just what was ruled could not be done in Foster <em>v. </em>Collner, <em>supra.</em>

They were filled, as before stated, with' details of the alleged relationship, such as marriages, births, deaths, etc. The record does not show whether, all this was read to the jury, but it is fair to assume tliat it was, else the learned judge would not have instructed them to disregard it. If read to or by them, it might well have made a lodgment that the subsequent instruction would fail to efface.</p>

We cannot say it was error to admit the letter of attorney from Mary Edwards <em>et al. </em>to Edward F. Hoffman, who sues as their attorney in fact. It was a mistake to commence this suit in the name of the attorney in fact, but it was a technical mistake, amendable below, and here, if necessary. We presume the letter of attorney was offered to show authority to commence the suit. As, however, the letter is not given in the paper-book, we decline further comment.</p>
    <p id="b231-8" data-blocks='[["BL_231.8",231,[175,1965,1187,262]]]'>We see no error in excluding the paper purporting to be an agreement of Mary Edwards. It is signed by no one but herself, and is, therefore, not an agreement in the ordinary sense of the word. As the declaration of one claiming title, it ought not to affect her. She merely consents to the distribution of the estate in a certain way, upon a condition therein expressed.</p>
