Weaver subsequently became insolvent, and this mortgage being unpaid, McClurkan foreclosed it and obtained judgment on the 7th of March, 1871, for $5,446.76, the amount then due on it. A <em>levari facias </em>was issued on this judgment, and the property was sold thereunder to John K. Stewart on the 1st of December, 1871, who soon after obtained the sheriffs deed for it.</p>

But several years 'after this sale, in 1878, Reed received a message from John Barton, Esq., to call at his office in reference to his (Reed’s) said judgment, and having accordingly called upon Mr. Barton shortly thereafter, he then made an arrangement with Mr.-Barton to undertake the collection' of this judgment. Mr. Barton had not been attorney for Reed in the judgment before that date, nor in any other business, and Reed had not been acquainted with him prior to that interview. Mr. Barton had at that time been informed of certain facts connected with the above mentioned sheriffs sale to John K. Stewart which he believed would ren.der it fraudulent and void as against Henry Weaver’s creditors, and it was his purpose to test the validity of that sale b]'- proceedings on the Reed judgment. He accordingly issued a <em>scire facias </em>thereon, on the day Reed employed him for the purpose, and having revived it and levied on the same tract of ■land which had been sold in 1871 to John K. Stewart under -the McClurkan mortgage, he had it sold in pursuance of such levy and knocked down to Martin Reed for $50, an amount barely sufficient to cover costs. The sheriffs deed to Reed for the property was acknowledged on the 6th of July, 1878. At the time Mr. Barton sent for Reed to come to his office he was, and had been for some time before, attorney for Emily Weaver, complainant in this case, and in connection with his 'son. Edward L. Barton, his partner, he then represented two judgments held by John Moody in trust for her against her husband, Henry Weaver, one for $1,800, the other for $650, on which it was at first contemplated by Edward L. Barton to take such proceeding as it was afterwards determined to pursue under the Reed judgment to attack Stewart’s title to the land above mentioned. But as it was feared that if Mrs. Weaver’s husband was found to' be implicated in the alleged fraudulent transaction, relied upon to defeat Stewart’s title, her claim might thereby be prejudiced before a jury, it was deemed advisable by Mr. Barton to use Reed’s judgment <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>instead of Mrs. Weaver’s in making sale of the land, and it was for this reason that Mr. Barton sent for Reed to come to his office. But so far from withdrawing from his connection with the judgments of Mrs. Weaver when he took charge of Reed’s judgment, Mr. Barton revived them on the same day (the 12th of March, 1878,) on which he revived Reed’s judgment, and continued thereafter to have the collection of her judgments in view no less than Reed’s in all the subsequent proceedings. Mr. Barton’s testimony before the Master in that connection was that he did not remember on which of the judgments he issued a <em>scire facias </em>first, but he added: “We had hers revived as well as his, and kept her claim as well as Reed’s moving along together.”</p>

Stewart for the property, on the 21st of August, 1878, which, being afterwards tried, a verdict and judgment were recovered therein for the plaintiff, and this judgment having subsequently been reversed by the Supreme Court, a second trial was had, in which the plaintiff was again successful. This was followed again by an action for <em>mesne profits </em>brought by Reed against Stewart, and a judgment having been recovered against Stewart in that ease another sheriff’s sale of Stewart’s interest in the same lánd took place thereunder, and though sold to Mr. Barton, the latter afterwards conveyed it to Reed.</p>

Reed, however, denies that it is binding on him for two reasons: First, because he says it was without consideration; and second, because he says he signed it believing that the judgments mentioned therein were valid, subsisting and unpaid, whereas they had been fully paid and discharged long before. If this paper were purely voluntary and without consideration, as alleged by Reed, it would not be a contract such as would bind him. But on this point the Master finds that Mr. Barton was attorney for Mrs. Weaver in respect to her judgments as much so- as he was attorney for Reed in respect to Reed’s judgment, and when he issued suits of <em>scire facias </em>to secure the judgments of both these clients he had the collection of Mrs. Weaver’s judgments in view no less than Reed’s, and in all the subsequent proceedings, including the ejectment and the sheriff’s sale which preceded it, in Reed’s name, he had the same object before him, never once losing sight of his professional relation to Mrs. Weaver. • And in procuring Reed’s signature to the paper in question, Mr. Barton acted as attorney for both parties and for their common benefit. It also appears, from the testimony of Mr. Barton, that both Mrs. Weaver and her husband furnished important evidence on the trial of the ejectment, without which Reed might not have recovered. And it seems, too, that a certain paper was obtained from Mrs. Weaver and used on the trial which was deemed by Mr. Barton to be a valuable document in Reed’s favor, and there is hardly room for doubt that in the assistance thus rendered by Mrs. Weaver she was led to believe that her judgments would share in the fruits of the litigation. The Master considers all this state of facts sufficient to constitute a good consideration to make the paper in question a contract binding on Reed, and he should be held to it unless relieved from the obligation by the other objection he makes to it, consisting in the allegation that he signed it under the belief that Mrs. Weaver’s judgments were valid and unpaid, whereas they had been paid long before that time. As to this allegation, the facts are as follows : Neither of the judgment's mentioned in said paper was an original judgment, but both were entered in default of an appearance in suits of <em>scire </em>facias, one at No. 324, April Term, 1878, to revive judgment No. 400, November Term, 1869, which had been entered September 29th, 1869, for $1,300; the other at No. 328, April Term, 1878, to revive judgment No. 412, November Term, 1870, which had been entered September 23d, 1870, for $650, the plaintiff in each of <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>said judgments being John Moody,'trustee of Emily Weaver» and the defendant, Henry Weaver. These judgments were revived on the 12th of March, 1878, for their full amount, with interest, including the judgment at No. 324, April Term, 1878, being for $1,976, and the judgment at No. 328, April Term, 1878, for $942.50. But the original judgment, No. 400, November Term, 1869, so revived had really been paid in April, 1871, by an appropriation to it in full of debt, interest and costs under the sheriff’s special return of a <em>levari facias </em>at No. 121, April Term, 1871, in which Alexander Thompson, administrator of Daniel Morgan, was plaintiff, and Henry Weaver was defendant. The real estate sold under that writ was a different tract of land from that in controversy in the aforesaid ejectment, and is known as the Morgan farm. Mrs. Emily Weaver became the purchaser of that farm at that sale on the 24th of April, 1871, for about $5,300, and this judgment was credited as part of the purchase money in the sheriff's special return, so that though she never received payment of it in cash she got its equivalent in the property purchased.</p>

The Master is of the opinion that though this might have been a good defence to the revival of the judgments if Henry Weaver had seen fit to.avail himself of it, Reed cannot maintain such defence in this case, for even if it be conceded that Henry Weaver committed a fraud in permitting these judgments to be revived in favor of his wife after they had once been paid, Reed was not injured by the fraud; and, therefore, it was a matter of no concern to him whether they had been paid or not, or whether they were even founded on an original indebtedness. In consideration of the collection of his own judgment by means of her assistance, as well of the services of Mr. Bartoniher counsel as well as his, he agreed that the judgments so revived should be paid out of the proceeds ofthelandhe was then seeking to recover, if successful in the suit, and this, too, without any other condition ; and having been successful, why should not these judgments be paid accordingly. The evidence shows that the land recovered is worth, at least, $8,000.00, and has a yearly rental value of $400.00, so that by his success in the ejectment Reed lias not only -made his claim in full, but after paying all costs, fees and expenses of recovery, and the entire amount of Mrs. Weaver’s judgment, <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>he will still have made a handsome profit in addition thereto out of the litigation. It has been held that a fraudulent judgment like a fraudulent deed is good against all but the person intended to be defrauded by it: Meokley’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20Pa.%20586" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="102 Pa. 586">102 Pa. St., 586</a>; Munroe <em>v. </em>Smith, 79 Id., 459. And if the same principle is applicable to this case, as it surely is, it does not lie in Reed’s mouth to question the validity of Mrs. Weaver’s judgments.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b79-6" data-blocks='[["BL_79.6",79,[139,794,1202,1648]]]'>But while in the view of this question taken by the Master, it is not deemed material what, if any, consideration there was for the judgments in question, the Master finds that these judgments were originally given for money loaned and advanced by Mrs. Weaver to and on account of her husband, from time to time, for the payment of his debts, and that this money was part of her separate estate derived from her father and other relatives, and none of it from her husband. It also appears that, in addition to this, she also -paid for her husband since those judgments were given, and with money derived from the same sources, other debts of his for which he had given her ho obligations, amounting in all, according to Henry Weaver’s testimony in this case, to not less’than a thousand dollars. And it was further in evidence, that the Morgan farm which Mrs. Weaver purchased in 1871, though she then took possession of it, and with her family retained the possession till 1879, it was then swept from her by the. foreclosure of the Jane Wallace mortgage, which she and. her husband had given at the time she bought'it- at sheriff’s sale for the purpose of raising part of the purchase money. Possibly the anticipation of this event, in connection with the fact that he was indebted to'her for other moneys for which she held no security, may have moved Henry Weaver tó make no defence to the revival of his wife’s judgments, for though paid irr one sense, they were never paid to her in cash, and though she had not been'deprived of the possession of the Morgan farm when these judgments were confirmed, he doubt-* less knew that she would be compelled to give it up sooner or later, and, in fact, it was sold from her only the next year. If .lie had seen fit to give her new and original judgments to make good to her these losses he would have been bound bv them morally and legally. Why could he not have treated the.old judgments as sufficient for .that purpose, notwithstanding they had been paid, for a judgment though paid in full may by agreement between the parties be kept alive to secure new loans and advances: Pierce <em>v: </em>Black, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20W.N.C.%20295" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 W.N.C. 295">14 W.

That paper directed Mr. Barton, as attorney for the defendant in an ejectment case then pending, in case of recovery, to pay out of the proceeds, first the costs, fees and expenses of recovery, the'n the judgment of the defendant against Henry Weaver, and next the judgment of Mrs. Weaver, the plaintiff, also against her husband, out of the, balance in Mr. Barton’s hands. Had the land been converted into money by Mr. Barton, it would have been his duty to apply the proceeds in accordance with the directions contained in the paper, but that was not done, and the title to the land recovered still remains in the defendant who refuses to pay the plaintiff any part of the judgment held by her. If he was bound to make such payment because of the recovery of the land in question, when the recovery was had he held the title not only for his own benefit, but also for the benefit of the plaintiff, the present appellant, to the extent of the amount of her judgment, and to that extent he was a trustee of the title for her. No serious question, however, is raised as to the jurisdiction in equity. The important contention of the appellee is that the paper of April 4th, 1879, is not <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>a binding obligation because it was without consideration, and also because the judgments of Mrs. Weaver had been paid, and that fact was not communicated to Reed before or at the time he executed the paper. On both these subjects we find ourselves constrained to agree with the Master in his findings and conclusions, and to differ with the learned court below.</p>
    <p id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.5",84,[245,664,1192,1782]],["BL_85.1",85,[186,396,1187,517]]]'>It was found by the Master and was made very clear by the testimony of Mr. Barton that he, Mr. Barton, was counsel for Mrs. Weaver before any steps were taken to recover the land from Stewart, and before he had anything to do with Reed or even knew him. Mr. Barton’s son was more particularly concerned for Mrs. Weaver in the matter of her judgments against her husband, and it was he who first called his father’s attention to the facts which it was supposed would invalidate Stewart's title. It 'was then and in the interest of Mrs. Weaver, that-Mr. Barton advised that if the facts in question could be established the Stewart title could he defeated, but he at the same time advised that the proceedings to sell out Henry Weaver’s interest had better be commenced on some other judgment than his wife’s. Reed being a judgment creditor, it was thought best to sell under his judgment. He was accordingly communicated with and assented to the arrangement when it was explained to him. Mr. Barton testified, “ up to that time I had not been attorney for Martin Reed, but shortly after Mr. Reed called.” He also said, “the idea was to proceed originally on Mrs. Weaver’s judgments. That was Ed’s idea and Smith’s. Then Mr. Reed came and saw me and I heard his statement, which corroborated what I had heard before, except there was a paper outstanding which had been executed, but we did not know where it wras. We were anxious to get possession of it.” He also said that the paper of April 4th, 1879, “was executed to show what should be done with the proceeds of the property in case it should be recovered,” that he had a conversation with Reed because Mrs. Weaver had inquired what was to become of her, or what was to be done with her judgments in case he recovered, and that Reed said “he intended to have his own judgment out of it, and if there was any surplus left after paying expenses and his claim, he had no objection to her getting her claim out of it.” Then he wrote the paper of April 4th, 1879, read it to Reed, who signed it and the proceedings went on. He also testified that he “ said there was no impropriety in two creditors joining together to attack the sale, but to avoid reflections we •would not call her as a witness. It was fully understood between him and me that the paper in Mrs. Weaver’s possession would be important on the trial, which it was. Mr. Reed also had the understanding that we represented Mrs. <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>Weaver’s claim as well as his own. This was understood the first time we talked it over, when Reed first came. I gave him the reason also why we did not want to- sell on- Mrs. Weaver’s judgments. I do not remember on which of the judgments we issued the <em>scire facias </em>first, but we had hers served as well as his, and kept her claim and Reed’s moving along together. This agreement in writing was made because Mrs. Weaver had asked if her matter was all right. When she saw the paper, she complained that she was not on an equal footing with Mr. Reed, but when I explained that he had taken the burden of costs on himself she seemed satisfied.” '</p>

When it is considered also that the counsel for one of the creditors, being desirous of collecting his client’s judgments, and discovering that for certain reasons it was desirable to proceed on some other judgment, advised that the other judgment creditor be brought in, and this was done, and the latter consented to join in the effort, having his own benefit in view, and then knowing that the first creditor’s judgments were also being enforced and her interest carried along with his own, and with this knowledge agrees in writing while the proceedings are pending, and before the results could be known that she should be paid out of the proceeds the amount of her judgments, in’case of success, it is not possible to say that such agreement was void because there was no consideration to support it. So far as Reed is concerned he obtained the benefit of the services of Mrs. Weaver’s counsel to do that for him which neither he nor any other person for him had ever thought of or advised to be done. He obtained highly important testimony which was in her possession, and which she permitted him to use in order that a recovery might be had, not for his benefit alone, but for their joint benefit — he obtained her acquiescence in a proceeding on his judgment only for the.sale of the land, when she might have refused her permission or insisted upon the proceeding being conducted on her own judgments exclusively ; she allowed him to use her own counsel throughout the proceedings as his counsel also, being under no obligation to do so, but for their joint advantage only, and not for his own sole advantage — and far more than this, she accepts from him an agreement in writing that she shall be paid out of the proceeds as well as -himself, and on -the. faith <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>of that agreement desists from all further action on her own judgments, and permits him to acquire for $50 the title to a tract of land worth at least $8,000, which, but for his conduct and his agreement was accessible to her as well as to him. The consideration for the agreement was ample and entirely sufficient to sustain it, in any point of view.</p>
    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.6",86,[229,650,1191,1396]]]'>But it is also objected, and was held by the court below, that because the judgments of Mrs. Weaver had been paid in some other manner and by virtue of other proceedings, she can not have payment out of these proceeds. If this were a case of conflicting claims upon a common fund, and the payment of the Weaver judgments would be in prejudice of the Reed judgment, there would of course be the greatest force in this objection, and it would certainly prevail. But no question of that kind arises. The judgments of Mrs. Weaver against her husband were regularly revived, and as against him they were perfectly good. Reed, with a knowledge of the revival and of the amounts of the judgments, agrees that they shall be paid out of the proceeds of the recovery if, after paying all costs and expenses his judgment is first paid in full. The proceeds are far more than enough to pay all costs and expenses, his judgment in full and the judgment of Mrs. Weaver in full, and still leave a considerable profit to Reed. How, then, is he injured or defrauded by the enforcement of his agreement? Of course he is not defrauded because he is only asked to pay what he expressly agreed to pay, and he is not injured in the slightest degree, because there is an ample fund in his possession with which to pay both himself and the plaintiff. In other words, he gets every benefit from the contract which he stipulated to get, and more besides, after paying Mrs. Weaver the whole of her claim. He is in no position to say that the judgments were paid in some other manner. It is no concern of his. He sustains no injury by being obliged to pay the plaintiff’s claim. He is simply prevented from making, at her expense, a considerable sum of money which he never bargained for,, which he was not entitled to upon any aspect of his contract, and which, in our opinion, it would be highly inequitable and unjust to permit him to keep.</p>
