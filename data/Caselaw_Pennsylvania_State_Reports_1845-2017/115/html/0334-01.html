McClelland’s Ex’r <em>v. </em>West’s Ex’r, 20 P. F. S., 183. Hence the presumption is that Mrs. Patterson is competent generally. Her incompetency as to matters occurring in the life-time of Mrs. Connell must, therefore, be made clearly to appear, before the court would be warranted in withdrawing her testimony from the jury.</p>

      <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>It is true that the plaintiff claims by gift from Mrs. Connell in her life-time, and that the defendant grounds his defence upon Mrs. Connell’s title, but it is submitted that these facts do not make Mrs. Connell the assignor of the thing in action within either the letter or spirit of the law. The rights of the decedent must be affected, and the contest must be between parties claiming such rights by devolution on the death of the owner. Cawley, Adm’x <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Phila.%20676" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Phila. 676">7 Phila. 676</a>. Dushane does not possess or enjoy the rights of the decedent by devolution, or otherwise. In this respect this case differs materially from the adjudicated cases. In Diehl <em>v. </em>Emig, 15 P. F. S", 320, the point determined was that the vendee of a decedent was incompetent to prove facts occurring in the life-time of the decedent <em>against his devisee. </em>In Earns <em>v. </em>Tanner, 16 P. F. S., 297, the survivor to a controversy was held incompetent as against the <em>owner of the deceased party's title. </em>In Hess <em>v. </em>Gourley, 8 Nor., 195, the devisee of a wife was held incompetent to prove the wife’s title against the <em>heir of the deceased husband. </em>And of like character are the points decided in all the cases which have arisen since the pass-age of the Act of 1869. In every one of them the action was by or against the <em>representative </em>of a decedent or the <em>owner of the decedent's </em>title, neither of which is the case here. '</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b350-5" data-blocks='[["BL_350.5",350,[251,1450,1180,259]]]'>Upon a question of the submission of a case to the jury “ the court must take the testimony as true, with every reasonable inference favorable to him who has the burden of proof:” Blakeslee <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Leg.%20Int.%20474" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 Leg.

The question involved in the case is purely one of fact, which it is the duty of the jury alone to determine, and the plaintiff’s proof was positive, direct and ample. The credibility of the witnesses could not be decided by the court, for that is peculiarly the province of the jury. Heister <em>v. </em>Lynch, <a href="/yeates/1/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Yeates 108" data-case-ids="6772138" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0107-01">1 Yeates, 108</a> ; Massey <em>v. </em>Buck, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phila.%20215" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Phila. 215">1 Phila., 215</a> ; Prowattain <em>v. </em>Tindall, 30 P.

    <p id="b351-5" data-blocks='[["BL_351.8",351,[176,632,1183,302]]]'>At the close of the trial below, the learned judge withdrew from the jury so much of the evidencé of both the plaintiff and defendant, as related to matters which occurred in the-life time of Sidney Connell. It is hardly necessary to say, that if he was right in withdrawing the testimony of the plaintiff; it was his plain duty to exclude that of the defendant. .No distinction can be made between them upon principle. 1</p>
    <p id="b351-6" data-blocks='[["BL_351.9",351,[176,935,1183,872]]]'>The action was trover, and the plaintiff claims to- recover the value-of $10,500 of government bonds which she alleged she deposited -with defendant for safe keeping. She 'claims! title by virtue of an oral gift from Sidney Connell, who died shortly after the alleged gift, and prior to the commencement; of this suit. The defendant sets up title- in the said Sid-s ney Connell; denies the gift to plaintiff, and alleged, and clearly proved that he accounted to the estate of Mrs. Connell for the bonds, and that the same have been distributed to her next of kin upon the settlement of her estate. This is not a suit by or against the estate, nor does the estate appear to have any interest in this controversy. I do not see, however,’ that the latter fact can properly affect the question. If the executor has turned over the bonds to the estate in the performance of his duty and in the belief that they belonged to said estate, it seems clear that when sued for the bonds personally, he would be entitled to raise any question by way of defence, that could have been raised by or for the estate, had the suit been against the executor or administration of Sidney Connell, deceased.</p>

If she had made out her title without reference to Mrs. Connell, she would have been competent. This she did not do, nor do I see how it would have been possible under the evidence to have done so. Both parties claimed title through Sidney Connell, and she was the assignor of the thing in controversy, within the meaning of the Act of 1869. In Diehl <em>v. </em>Emig, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20Penn%2C%20320" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="65 Penn, 320">65 Penn, 320</a>, it was held that in an ejectment by a daughter grounded on a lost deed of gift from her deceased father, she and her husband were not 'competent witnesses as to what occurred prior to her father’s death. There is- nothing in Karns v. Tanner, and the line of cases followings that in any degree impairs the rule in Diehl <em>v. </em>Emig, and á further discussion of this branch of the case would be unprofit<a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>able. We are of’ opinion that the learned judge was right in excluding the testimony referred to.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[219,496,1180,260]]]'>This took out of the case pretty much all there was in it. The court below evidently thought there was nothing left, and gave a binding instruction to find for the defendant. The plaintiff complains of this and says there was evidence outside of her own testimony to entitle the case to go to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.7",352,[218,758,1181,743]]]'>' I have examined, the testimony with care, and while it is weak, there is more than a scintilla. Clark Brundridg swears that he was present at an interview between the plaintiff, the defendant, and Mrs Connell; that the plaintiff handed the defendant a small box containing the bonds in controversy; that Mrs.Connell-told him to count them to Minerva (the plaintiff); that they belonged to her; . . . that the plaintiff told him to take care of them; that-they were hers; that if she lost them she would be compelled to get married, and Temperance King said she saw the bonds in the possession of the plaintiff; that the latter kept them in her room at Mrs. Connell’s house. W. PI. Dinsmore said that Mrs. Connell told him how that she had given some bonds to the plaintiff. All this, if believed, might lead to the conclusion that Mrs. Connell had given the bonds to the plaintiff, and if accompanied by delivery would make a good title. We are of opinion that it should have been submitted to the jury.</p>
