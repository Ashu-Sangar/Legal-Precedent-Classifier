It is essential, not only that the relation of landlord and tenant shall be established by competent evidence of an express contract, but also that a rent, fixed and certain in its terms, was reserved in and by the contract.</p>

After setting forth a lease for one year from April 1st, 1885, the record, as to the rent, reads thus: “ at the yearly rent of the interest and taxes accruing thereon.” The inquiry naturally arises, what interest, and how is.it to be ascertained? Is it interest on the value of the demised premises, or on the amount paid therefor by the landlord, or on the incumbrances that were then or might thereafter be charged on the property; or, is it interest ou debts owing by the landlord, or interest on something else ? While the contract relation of landlord and tenant is perhaps set forth with sufficient certainty, the <em>quantum </em>of rent reserved is conspicuously indefinite and uncertain. As to that, there is not the slightest approach to precision or certainty ; nor is there anything on the record that would even assist a jury, if the question was before them, in endeavoring to ascertain the amount of rent reserved. Such certainty, or rather uncertainty, as this was never contemplated by the framers of the statute. Moreover, we are not without judicial construction of the words in question. The Act of 1772 contains a similar jurisdictional requisite. The language there employed, in connection with the demise etc. is, “ paying certain rents.” In McGee <em>v. </em>Fessler, <a href="/pa/1/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Pa. 126" data-case-ids="949846" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0126-01">1 Pa., 126</a>, and several other cases, it was held that the words mean what is ordinarily understood bv the expression, and that the Act applies only to leases in which a certain rent is clearly and distinctly reserved, and not <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>to cases where the rent reserved is so uncertain as to require the intervention of a jury to render it certain.</p>

As the law now stands, with all the safeguards that have been provided to prevent injustice and unnecessary oppression, it is to be feared they are too frequently practiced under color of enforcing the remedy given b]r the statute. It is certainly not demanding too much to require that magistrates invested with such summaiy and limited jurisdiction should, clearly and distinctly set forth in the record of their proceedings everything that is required to give them undoubted jurisdiction.</p>
