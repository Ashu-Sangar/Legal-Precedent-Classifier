That the verdict is good for the land described in the writ or declaration, is clear. Had there been claim and proof of- mesne profit, judgment could have been entered on the verdict as rendered. We are of opinion that the court properly entered judgment for the land, which implies amendment of the verdict by striking off “ $1,435.79 ” as surplusage.
