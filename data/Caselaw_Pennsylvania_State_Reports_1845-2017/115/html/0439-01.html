The declaration at the close of each bond that it “ will be redeemed, if desired, twelve years after date,” is evidently intended for the benefit of the holder alone, giving him the option of demanding payment of the principal at expiration of twelve years. If he then desired payment, the school district was bound, on his demand, but not of its own motion, to redeem <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>the bonds by paying the principal and accrued interest. If it were not for the word “iu,” before the words, “twenty-five years after date,” Üiere would be nothing on which to hang even a doubt as to the meaning of the last quoted expression. It is contended .the word “ in ” is used in the sense of “ within,” or “at any time during,” &amp;c. While it may be sometimes employed in that sense, we do not think it was so intended in the bonds under consi4eration; but, if there should be any uncertainty as to the sense in which it was used, the doubt should be resolved in favor of the obligee: Whart. on Cont. § 670; White <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/pa/33/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="33 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="988401" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0186-01">33 Pa., 186</a>; Beeson <em>v. </em>Patterson, 36 Id., 24; Klaer <em>v. </em>Ridgway, 86 Id., 529. But, we do not think the meaning of the bonds, as to time of payment, is in any manner affected by the use of the word in question. “Payable in one and two years,” is not an uncommon form of expression in <em>memoranda </em>of agreements and other writings, and is always understood to mean at the 'expiration of one and two years respectively. Speaking of the usual form of negotiable instruments in England and elsewhere Mr. Chitty in his valuable work on bills, &amp;c., says : In America, a common form is, “ I promise to pay A. B. or order, one thousand dollars in four months.” Mr. Parsons also gives the form of a foreign bill of exchange, thus : “ New York, January 5th, 1857. Value received, please pay A. or order, one thousand pounds in sixty days after sight,” &amp;c.: Chitty Bills, 516; 1 Parsons Notes and Bills, 21, 63.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[256,1557,1181,293]]]'>It was undoubtedly the duty of the court to construe the bonds. There was no conflict of evidence ; and we are satisfied the learned judge was right, not only in refusing to charge as requested by defendant below, but also in directing the jury to find in favor of plaintiff for amount of the past due coupons and interest thereon. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.</p>
