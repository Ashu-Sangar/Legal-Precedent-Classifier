The defendant now moves to strike off the judgment of revival of lien, alleging that the Act of 1883 is unconstitutional. Several objections to the constitutionality of that Act were made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b306-10" data-blocks='[["BL_306.13",306,[268,2038,1183,298]]]'>1. The objection that the title of the bill does not clearly indicate its contents, we do not think is well founded. It is not intended that the title of an Act should be a complete index of its contents: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Green, <a href="/pa/58/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="58 Pa. 226" data-case-ids="1013202" data-case-paths="/pa/58/0226-01">58 Pa., 226</a>. The legislation in the bill is germane to the title, and that is a.11 the constitution requires. See Craig <em>v. </em>The First Pres. Church, <a href="/pa/88/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="88 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1061165" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0042-01">88 Pa., 42</a>.</p>

The Act is confined to cities of the first class, and this, it is alleged, offends against Article III., § 7, clause 1, of the constitution, which declares that “ The General Assembly <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>shall not pass any local or special law authorizing the creation, extension, or impairing of liens,” also Article III., § 7, clause 17, which declares that “ The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law providing or changing methods for the collection of debts.” We think this objection is well taken. Laws creating liens, and providing methods for the collection of debts, must be general and apply to the whole commonwealth. Uniformity of legal procedure was the object aimed at by the people in framing the organic law. The evils of special or local laws on general subjects had long been felt, The extent to which they were carried may be seen in the Act of April 29th, 1867, P. L., 1316, extending the laws authorizing the filing of liens for paving and repairing footways, to the first precinct of the Twenty-fifth ward, the smallest political division of territory known to the law. The absurdity of such legislation led the framers of the constitution to put an end to it forever; and the Supreme Court, carrying out the mandates of the constitution, has said: “There is no dividing line between a local and general statute. It must be either the one or the other. If it apply'to the whole state, it is general. If to a part only, it is local. . . ’. The exclusion of a single county from the operation of the Act makes it local:” Per Mercup„, Chief Justice, in Davis <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/citations/?q=106%20Pa.%20384" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="106 Pa. 384">106 Pa., 384</a>. Hence the Supreme Court held that an Act providing for filing-liens in counties which should not have a population of over two hundred thousand inhabitants, is unconstitutional. But the Act of 1883 does not of necessity embrace the whole of a county even, but only a city of the first class, which may be less than a county. Should the city of Pittsburgh become a city of the first class, there would be one law in that city for the collection of municipal claims, and another for the rest of the county of Allegheny. Two things would be required to bring the whole state within the operation of the Act of 1883, a city of the first class in every county, and that city co-extensive -with county; in other words, that the whole commonwealth should be a city of the first class. This would require a possibility to happen upon a possibility, and that is to require too much to save the Act from being local. See Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Patton, <a href="/pa/88/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="88 Pa. 258" data-case-ids="1061212" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0258-01">88 Pa., 258</a>, and Scowden’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/96/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="96 Pa. 422" data-case-ids="494621" data-case-paths="/pa/96/0422-01">96 Pa., 422</a>. It is my opinion that classification of cities and laws confined thereto, are permissible only in matters relating to their municipal, government, but the rights of persons and property must be secured by general laws, which must be uniform and in force everywhere throughout the state.</p>

Another objection alleged against the Act of 1883 is, that it vests judicial power in the attorney of the plaintiff, thereby violating Article V., § 1, of the constitution, which provides <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>that the judicial power shall be vested in the courts therein named. Without discussing this point aneAV, I refer to what was said upon it in The City <em>v. </em>Pepper, 16 W. N. 0., 334, contenting myself with repeating that the power to enter a judgment of revival of lien, notwithstanding a defence has been interposed, ought to have been conferred upon the courts, where it properly belongs, and not upon the attorne}' of all interested party. No court would enter a judgment of revival in a case in which there has been such gross laches as is shown in this case. Here the <em>set. fa. </em>Avent out on January 27th, 1881, and from that day down to the present, the plaintiff has done nothing to secure the enforcement of its claim by a trial on the merits of the case. It has not even ruled the defendant to plead. No excuse of a crowded trial list can be alleged. There has not been any effort made to try the case. The consequence of such laches must be visited upon the plaintiff, and not on the defendant. There has been an unreasonable delay; the claim has not been prosecuted with due diligence, and the plaintiff must suffer the consequences thereof: Ward <em>v. </em>Patterson. <a href="/pa/46/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="46 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="420670" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0372-01">46 Pa., 372</a>.</p>

What has been said upon the second, third and fourth objections to the Act of 1883, applies Avith equal force to the fifth and sixth objections to the constitutionality of the Act. Article V., § 26, of the constitution declares, that “all laws relating to courts shall be general and of uniform operation,” etc.; and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, provides, “nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Due process means notice; notice precedes trial, trial leads to judgment, and judgment is the sentence of a court.</p>

On September 6th, 1881, a <em>sci.fa. </em>was issued,, and on October 21st, 1881, an affidavit of defence was filed. On the 5th of June, 1885, the claim not having been reduced to judgment, a judgment of revival was entered under the Act of June 27th, 1883. On September 25th, 1886, a rule was entered to strike off the judgment of revival, entered as above stated, and on the 9th of the following October, the rule was made absolute. November 8th, 1886, the case was called for trial, and on the same day the jury, by direction of the court, found a verdict for the defendant. The contention on part of the plaintiff was that the expiration of the lien was prevented b.y the operation of the Act of June 27th, 1883, which Act is in the following language, to wit:</p>

Be it enacted, etc., that every writ of <em>scire facias, </em>which has been issued within the past five years, or which may hereafter be issued upon a municipal claim for the recovery of any sum of money, the subject of a municipal lien in cities of the first class, shall have the additional force and effect of a writ of <em>scire facias </em>to revive and continue the lien of said claim for a period of five years from the date of said writ, and when said writ of <em>scire facias </em>shall have been served by the sheriff, by a posting and advertising, or otherwise, as now provided by law, the prothonotary of the court shall, at any time, on the order of the plaintiff’s attorney filed in the cases, enter a judgment that the lien of said claim shall be revived and continued for the further period of five years from the entry thereof; which said judgment'may be entered thereon, pending the determination of the issues raised in such case, and shall have the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>same force and effect as if entered on a distinct <em>scire facias </em>to revive tlie lieu of such claim.</p>

Without dwelling on the various points at which, as the learned judge shows, this Act directly conflicts with fhe constitution, we content ourselves with pointing out one of them. Article 8, sec. 7, clause 1: “The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law authorizing the creation, extension, or inpairing of liens.” That the Act above set forth is local we need not spend time in proving, for this will, no doubt, be admitted. So, that it is designed to extend the liens of municipal claims that otherwise would have expired by force of previous statutory provisions, is not a matter of question, as that is the special and sole intention of the Act; the very purpose for which it was passed. It thus appearing that this statutory measure is, in the particular stated, in direct conflict with the supreme law of the commonwealth, nothing more need be said in justification of the judgment of the court below.</p>
