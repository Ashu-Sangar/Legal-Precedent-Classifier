    <p class="summary" id="b446-5" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[247,521,1181,304]]]'>Case by Thomas Anthony against Nelson Krum and Franklin Peters to recover damages for the loss of a horse, occasioned by the alleged negligence of the defendants in not making and keeping in repair a fence between tire lands of the plaintiff and the defendants, through which neglect the plaintiff’s horse had strayed into the defendants’ field and fallen into a stone quarry and was killed. Plea, not guilty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b446-6" data-blocks='[["BL_446.6",446,[249,823,1177,78]]]'>The following are the facts of the case as they appeared on the trial:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.7",446,[247,909,1179,1522]]]'>About twenty years before the accident, Nathan Kern and Harry Williams were the owners of two adjoining farms in Lehigh county. They agreed in parol that a certain fence then existing between parts of the two tracts should be kept up by Williams at the lower end, and by Kern at the upper end. The fence was made by Nathan Kern forty years before, when his father was the owner of the Williams tract. Shortly after the agreement between Kern and Williams the former sold his tract, and at the time of the injury complained of it was in the possession of Anthony, the plaintiff. Williams died several years before the accident and a part of his tract was leased by his heirs to the defendants for the purpose of working a slate quarry on .the property. As this quarry was worked it extended farther and farther towards the plaintiff’s line until it reached within six or eight feet of it. The fence between the two tracts was a worm fence, and gradually became worn out — part of it was removed, but not by the defendants — and part of it, extending along the edge of the quarry was down and had been for a long time previous to the accident. The plaintiff admitted at the trial that he knew the fence was down and had been for a long time — that he saw it every day — that it was down the whole length of the quarry —and that he was fully acquainted with its condition. He put a horse to pasture at night-time in the field adjoining the quarry. There were two open quarries in this field on the plaintiff’s tract that were unfenced and no fence between that held and the defendant’s quarry. During the night this horse, while pasturing in this unfenced field, strayed on the premises of the defendants and fell into the quarry and was killed. It was contended by the defendants that they were not obliged to fence in their quarry or to keep up the fence already there, and that they were not bound by the parol personal contract between Kern and Williams; and that if they were bound by this understanding they were not liable in this action, because the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>

His view seems to have been that if the defendants were subject to a contract duty to maintain the division fence between them and the plaintiff, at the place of the accident,-had neglected to perform that duty, in consequence of which the plaintiff’s horse was lost, the liability of the defendants was fixed whether the plaintiff’s negligence contributed to the injury or not. We so understand the part of the charge covered by the fourth assignment and the answer to the defendants’ third point. We are unable to agree with that view of the subject. It ignores entirely the consequences of the plaintiff’s negligence contributing to the injury <em>for which the suit is brought. </em>Just here we think is the point in respect of which the learned judge was mistaken.</p>
    <p id="b449-12" data-blocks='[["BL_449.14",449,[147,2122,1178,348]],["BL_450.1",450,[257,428,1180,567]]]'>The action was not brought to recover damagés for the breach of a contract to maintain a fence. On the contrary it was an action of case sounding in tort to recover damages for the loss of a horse, resulting from the <em>negligence </em>of the defendants. This negligence is the very <em>gist </em>of the action. So far as the subject of contributory negligence is concerned it is precisely the same as if the action had been brought to recover damages for a personal injury. As we understand the law in <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>any case where an injury by the negligence of the defendant is the basis of the action, the right to recover may be resisted by proof that the plaintiff’s own negligence contributed to the injury. If such negligence was in part the occasion of the injury, which the plaintiff alleges he has sustained, the law will not discriminate between the negligence of the plaintiff which contributed to the injury and the negligence of the defendant which also contributed to it. It simply will not allow a recovery in such a case. The facts presented byway of hypothesis in the defendants’ third point were such as, if found by the jury, undoubtedly constituted contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and as there was evidence in support of them, the point should have been affirmed.</p>
