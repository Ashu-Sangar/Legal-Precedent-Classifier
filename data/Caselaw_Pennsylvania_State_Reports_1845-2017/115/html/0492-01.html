    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[133,1251,1186,481]]]'>If it were the misfortune of the plaintiff in the attempt to establish its claim, to put in evidence a fact which would defeat recovery, that does not change the law of evidence. The defendant may avail himself of that fact, or evidence tending to show it, but whatever the evidence relied on to establish fraud, or other matter, affirmed to defeat the claim, the burden is on the defendant. The presumption that the officers whose duty it was to make the assessment, acted with due care and fidelity, stands until overcome by sufficient proof. The rule is the same when the defendant relies on the testimony on part of the plaintiff as when upon his own.</p>

    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.9",513,[136,1908,1181,87]]]'>The tenth assignment is to the ruling of the court that the action, No. 153, was not supported by any evidence.</p>

All members whose policies have expired, and are not in force at the time such assessment is declared, shall, nevertheless, be liable to assessment for all unpaid losses and other liabilities which existed at the time of the expiration of such policy or policies, pro <em>rata </em>with those then in force, and the amount thus ascertained and levied upon such policies to be deducted from <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>the gross amount of liabilities of the company, for which such assessment is to be made, and the balance of liabilities remaining to be assessed upon the policies then in force.”</p>
    <p id="b514-5" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[255,556,1183,651]]]'>This by-law is part of the contract of insurance and plainly designates what members are liable to be assessed for losses at the time the assessment may be declared. All are liable whose policies are in force, and all are liable whose policies have expired, for unpaid losses which existed at the time of the expiration. It is competent for the members to so contract, and the directors have no right to make an assessment on another basis. Decisions in cases where the contract contained no similar provision, do not apply. Were this by-law not in the contract, the authorities cited by the plaintiff would sustain the contention that members are liable “ to assessments for the payment of all losses and debts incurred by the company during the time their policy was in force, but not for any losses or liabilities incurred either before they obtained their policy or after its expiration or cancellation.”</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[255,1208,1185,345]]]'>The plaintiff concedes that the policies in force at the time the assessment was declared, which were not in force at the time the losses and liabilities were incurred, were not included in the assessments. Its secretary, called to prove the claim, testified that there were a large number of such policies, and that they were not included. It follows that assessment “No. 9” was invalid, and that the court rightly ruled that the plaintiff could not recover.</p>
    <p id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.7",514,[254,1555,1187,351]]]'>The ruling may have been based on other ground, yet being free of error, it must be affirmed. In effect, the jury were instructed that the plaintiff had failed to adduce evidence to establish its claim. That the court erred in refusing the plaintiff’s first and second points, as propositions, did the plaintiff no injury, for the court could properly have ordered a nonsuit, or have directed a verdict for the defendant, without answering any proposition.</p>
    <p id="b514-8" data-blocks='[["BL_514.8",514,[252,1904,1186,389]]]'>In two of the cases no assignment of error raises the question, whether the plaintiff’s evidence was sufficient to submit to the jury. The defendants urge that if it be conceded that the court erred in answering the plaintiff’s points, it does not follow that the judgment should be reversed. But no precedent is cited for going outside the assignments, which must be sustained, for a cause to ground a refusal of reversal. Where an assignment reveals a fatal defect in the case of the plaintiff in error, he shows cause for affirmance of the judgment.</p>
