The evidence shows, also, that complainants .suffer special injury and damage, because of the construction and use of this track, not common to the public, who simply travel along said street. One of the complainants is a practicing physician, and convenience of access to his office, and the safetj»- of persons calling upon him there, and of their horses,, is lessened.</p>

The legislature have ample power to authorize a railroad company to appropriate a public street for the purpose of laying their track thereon (Philadelphia &amp; Trenton Railroad Company’s case, <a href="/whart/6/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Whart. 25" data-case-ids="1836978" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0025-01">6 Wh., 25</a>; Danville, Hazleton &amp; Wilkesbarre Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 28 P.

But without such authority, given expressly or by necessary implication, such a use of a public street constitutes a public nuisance (Harvey <em>v. </em>Lackawanna &amp; Bloomsburg Railroad Company, 11 Wr., 428; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Erie &amp; North-East Railroad Company, 3 Casey, 339). And if given by implication, it must be a necessary implication, because it cannot be lightly presumed that the legislature intended to divert land, already dedicated to one public use, to another and different use.</p>

It is not seriously contended that the charter of the Company respondents, nor any of its supplements, which relate to its main line between Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, have any bearing on the question. Nor can we see that the Act of May 7, 1841, relating to the Marietta, Bainbridge, Falmouth &amp; Portsmouth Road Company, set up in the answer, affects the case in any <em>way.</em>

Again, provision is made in the Act for the purchase of the property taken from the owners, or for compensation to be ascertained by legal proceedings. This could not apply to streets. Manifestly by “lands, tenements and property,” the legislature intended to designate what belonged to private owners.</p>

The track or siding, which is a continuation of the siding that existed before, extends along Brown street a distance of 1000 feet, from the railroad to Canal street, and to within 150 feet of the canal, where the street terminates. It relieves the crossing at Union street from hindrances and delays, facilitates business and transfers it to a handier and safer point. There is but one track, which is five feet to the outside of both rails, and it is laid, not in the center of the street^ but nearer by about one half to the side of the street on which the property of the,Few heirs fronts, than to that on which the property of Dr. Mish fronts, which is just opposite the other. The track follows the grade of the street, is well laid, and is intended to be finished so that the top of the rail shall be no more than two inches above the surface of the street. The borough authorities consented to the laying of the track as it now is, with the understanding that the company would grade part of the street and bring it up to the level of the grade of the street as established, and this they were doing when the evidence was taken. This street never was in as good condition as it was then (i. <em>e., </em>when witnesses testified), so far as the work was finished. The Few and Mish. properties are private residences. The Raymond &amp; Campbell property is a foundry, is along the side of the track, and is close to the Few and Mish properties. There are other business establishments on the north side of the railroad, on Brown street and vicinity, that derive advantage from the use of this siding. Snavely’s flour and feed store, Kendig &amp; Lauman, lumbermen, Landis’s grist mill, S.amuel Singer, cabinet maker, the Middletown Furniture and Manufacturing Company, Coolbaugh &amp; Hendrickson, lumbermen, Rife Brothers’ steam tannery and tobacco warehouse, are instances.</p>

But the decision in this case was the result of an examination of the various Acts of Assembly relating to this road, two of which by clear implication give the right to use the streets, lanes and alleys in any town, borough, or city through which the road may pass. These two Acts, one of them passed March 27th, 1818 (P. L., p. 275), and the other April 12th, 1851 (P. L., p. 518), are both referred to in the opinion of Judge Read, and are amply sufficient to sustain the ruling of the court.

They stand, therefore, precisely in the shoes of the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mt. Joy and Lancaster Railroad Company, and unless additional powers are given by subsequent legislation, can exercise only' those conferred upon their lessors. We look in vain through the charter of the former company, and its supplements, for any grant of power to occupy the bed of a public highway; and the appellants themselves do not claim to have discovered any. They set up, therefore, the Act of April 10th, 1867, and ailege that it invests them with full authority to build this branch road or siding along the bed of Brown street. If it does, our bill must be dismissed; if not, the injunction must stand. We méefc them on this ground, and contend that the Act of 1867 will bear no such construction.</p>

It may be very convenient for them to build feeders <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>for their mainline along public highways, and. thus save money whilst they trample upon the rights of citizens, but they do it without color of law. Says Judge Gordon, in this same Company’s Appeal, 12 Norris, 150, already cited: “We thus discover that this necessity by which the unlawful acts of this company appellant are sought to be excused is one of its own making — a matter of economy. It 'is cheaper to use Dock street and the appellee’s franchise than to bujr the property above mentioned. A defence more weak, or one more barren of equity could scarcely be imagined.” These words so full of meaning, may well close this part of our argument.</p>

By that Act courts of equity are expressly authorized to inquire, at the instance of private parties, whether corporations have the legal right to do the acts by which it is alleged complainants are injured, and to enjoin the corporation if it is exceeding its power. This is probably simply an affirmance of a right already existing, but it makes the matter perfectly clear. In Western Peun’a R. R. Co’s Appeal, 8 Outer-bridge, 399, Judge Gordon says, in commenting upon this Statute: “ The powers of this, as of every other corporation, must be found in its charter, and under the provisions of the Act of 1871, the plaintiff has the undoubted right to call upon the defendant to show by its charter that it has the power to do what it proposes to do.”</p>

    <p id="b540-6" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[239,820,1188,1517]]]'>The course of legislation in Pennsylvania, relative to railroads, shows continuous care to proteot the public roads from the grasp of railroad companies except upon terms that they render an equivalent to the public. A fair example is the legislation upon this point for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. At first, the Act of April 13th, 1846, provided that when necessary to cross or intersect any established road or way, said company should so construct their road as not to impede the passage or transportation of persons or property along said established road or way. This being the only provision in the Act of Incorporation relative to public roads, in face thereof, it would have been exceedingly difficult, in accordance with the rules of interpretation, to have construed the general terms authorizing the taking of land, to authorize the taking of an established road and laying the track thereon longitudinally. Therefore, supplemental Acts were enacted providing that when said company should find it necessary to change the site of any turnpike or public road, or any street, lane or alley, in any town, borough or city, they should reconstruct the same forthwith, on the most favorable location, and in as perfect a manner as the original road. In this connection it may be remarked that the charter authorized the making of such lateral railroads or branches, leading from the main line to such points in the counties through which the main line may pass, as the president and directors may deem advantageous, subject to the conditions and provisions relative to the main line; and hence when it was ruled in Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/48/0355-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="48 Pa. 355" data-case-ids="422220" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0355-01">48 Pa.

That case is no precedent for enlarging corporate grants by construction.</p>

Nothing in the Statutes relating to the powers of the Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy and Lancaster Railroad Company, shows'an intendment that the company should have right to lay its tracks lengthwise on other public highways. Of course it would be necessary in the construction of the railroad to intersect and cross other highways and the charter compels the company to make and keep in repair good and sufficient passages at such crossings.

By the letter of the Statute lands and property may be taken for workshops as well as railway tracks. This is reasonable when applied to private property. But if public roads and streets are included as property which may be taken for workshops, the Act is unique, and a wide departure from the line of legislation relative to these railroad companies.</p>

    <p id="b542-7" data-blocks='[["BL_542.7",542,[267,860,1181,337]]]'>This case differs widely from Getz’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20453" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 453">10 W. N. C., 453</a>. In that it was denied that the railroad had the right to construct the siding at all. The plaintiff’s chief complaint was the injury doné by taking part of his lot, destroying his dwelling house and obstructing his way to the street; but it was not contended that, if the charter gave the right to construct the siding, it did not give the right to construct it on the street.</p>
    <p id="b542-8" data-blocks='[["BL_542.8",542,[261,1208,1183,1171]]]'>In Cleveland &amp; Pittsburgh R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Speer, <a href="/pa/56/0325-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="56 Pa. 325" data-case-ids="1009177" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0325-01">56 Pa. St., 325</a>, upon the grant in the charter, and the route authorized therein, it was said that the implication was irresistible, that the company could use Preble street for the tracks of its railroad. Stress was put on the fact that the railroad had been constructed for years before the beginning of the suit, and it was said, “ Whatever private remedies individuals might have had to prevent the location there, and to compel a change of site before consummation, it is now too late to treat the location as a mere nullity.” And, if the act of location was “voidable because other ground ought to have been taken, none but the commonwealth can now call the company to account for it.” That suit was when a party had no remedy for injury to his property, if none were taken, by the laying of a railroad at grade on a street in front of his dwelling. And it was before the Act of June 19th, 1871, which provides that in all proceedings, at law, or in equity, in which it is alleged that the private rights of individuals aie injured or invaded by any corporation claiming to have the right to do the act from which such injury results, it shall be the duty of the court to inquire and ascertain whether such corporation possesses the right to do the act, and if such right has not been conferred, if the suit be in equity, the court shall restrain such injurious acts by injunction; if at law, the party may recover damages for such injury. In that case, the switches complained of were within the lines of Preble street until they reached the land owned by the railroad company.</p>

This would be sound if the defendants had right to lay the track on the street. But, having no such right, the case is different. Where railroad companies or individuals exceed their statutory powers in dealing with oilier people’s property, no question of damage is raised when an injunction is applied for: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/24/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="24 Pa. 159" data-case-ids="9503622" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0159-01">24 Pa. St., 159</a>. True, they have not taken the plaintiffs’ property, and, if the plaintiffs have not been specially injured, they are not entitled to injunction. But if the defendants, without authority from the state, create a nuisance on the street, one who is specially injured is entitled to relief without proving the amount of damage. In such case, the defendants are not in the position of a person who carries on a business, lawful in itself, of which a neighbor complains. They are not on their own land. If not empowered to use the street, they have no more right to construct a railroad on it than any other person. A wrongdoer may not set oft benefits to prevent the injured party obtaining relief. A man is not to be driven from his home by offensive structures, or compelled to sell it even for more than its value by one who is not invested with power to injure or take it for public purpose. As this case comes, it is wholly immaterial whether the railroad has increased the market value of the plaintiffs’ dwellings. They are not claiming damages.</p>

But he who has his dwelling fronting on the street who cannot turn his carriage between the front of Ins lot and the rails, who must drive around a block because he cannot turn in the street, whose business as a physician is interfered with, or who is subject to the smoke, noise and other incidents of railway trains passing near his door, suffers a special injury which differs in kind as well as degree from that done to the mere traveler. Were the road lawfully constructed, the only question would be whether the plaintiff's lots were worth less by reason of the construction, and, if so, how much.</p>
