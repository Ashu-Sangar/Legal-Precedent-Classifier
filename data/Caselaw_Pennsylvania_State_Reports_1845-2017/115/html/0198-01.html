The account, fortified with th <em>e jurat </em>of the accountant, is <em>prima facie </em>correct, and the <em>onus </em>is upon the party alleging its incorrectness. A surcharge is of serious moment to an accounting fiduciary, and implies dereliction of duty by omitting to answer for assets actually received, or which ought to have been received, and with the exercise of ordinary care and diligence might have-been collected. The result is personal liability''. But this penalty is not imposed in the first instance, except where gross negligence or fraud is manifest. The usual practice is to afford the accountant opportunity to convert unrealized assets, or collect by suit or otherwise, property alleged to belong to the decedent, and render a future account thereof. In the present instance the executor is surcharged with alleged assets, not because of default or misconduct, but more as a matter of form than substance, in order to ascertain the shares of the distributees and without increasing tjre liability of the <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>executor; and for the reason that the investments and securities, although in the possession of the accountant, as trustee for the children of the testator, were his property, and to be included, together, with his other personal estate, in the account.</p>

But we have reached the opposite conclusion. The testator declared, with the greatest accuracy and minuteness, that he held the bonds and shares as trustee for his children. Actual delivery to them, which was unnecessary, alone was wanting, and nothing remained to be done by him to vest in them more completely the title and full beneficial ownership. As to the bank stock, it is conceded by the Auditing Judge, that the trust is valid and the surcharge is refused.</p>

But it is argued, that it appears from the will, they remained the property of testator from the fact that he thereby declares the trust upon which he held the investments, appointed his successor in the trust, prescribes its uses and purposes, and directs final disposition, and therefore the investments became the subject of a testamentary trust. And further, as the trust cannot operate except upon property of the testator, the investments must be considered as belonging to his estate, and for which the executor is accountable. But this is <em>&amp;petitioprin~ </em>
      <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>
      <em>oipii. </em>The point to be determined is not whether testator could rightfully declare a testamentary trust, but whether the shares of stock and loans are to be treated as his property. If not, the trusts declared as to the property of others cannot, in any event, affect the title of the actual owner. That is what the testator attempted to do, and without authority. The investments were not his individual property ; although once his, the moment he assigned them to a trustee for his children they became their property, and except in the case of the bank stock, they were also entitled to the interest and income. Testator having parted with his ownership, could not subsequently, by will, declare a trust as to their property, any more than he could bequeath the loans and stock to his children or to a stranger. Had he done so the title of the former would not depend upon the bequest, but upon the previous assignment to their trustee. And in the event of a bequest to a stranger, not only would the title of the children be undisturbed, but had the legacy been specific, the legatee would be disappointed of his legacy. For .these reasons, we think the will has no bearing upon the vital question before us. It is, however, furthermore contended that the executor and the children of testator are concluded by the appointment of the accountant as trustee under the will, by the Court of Common Pleas, to hold the loans upon the trusts declared in the will. But that is not material. Instead of claiming the leans absolutely, the children can elect to recognize the trusts! It is optional with them. But it does not thereby follow that the loans and shares of stock were the individual property of their father, subject to all the incidents of ownership, such as liability for his debts, commissions of the executor, etc. And this result cannot be avoided if the claim of the widow is sustained. But such violence to the intention of her husband, and injustice to his children, should not be permitted. The widow is entitled to her share, according to the intestate law, of the balance of the personal estate of her husband at the date of his death, and no more. Her interest in the real estate is not material to the present inquiry.</p>

At the same time, he had the bonds themselves registered on the books of'the company, in his own name as trustee for each of his sons by name. He also indorsed on each of the bonds, and had same approved by the company, that they had been thus duly transferred and assigned on the books of the corporation by him to himself as trusted for his sons. In addition to all this, the five bonds thus impressed with a trust in favor of his son Charles were placed in an envelope on which testator made this indorsement: “ These bonds belong to John Dickerson in trust for Charles Thompson Dickerson, and were purchased for him from a fund created by the saving of small sums of money from the day of his birth and set apart for his special benefit.” Signed, “John Dickerson.” The five bonds in trust for his son Thomas Jef-' ferson were in like manner placed in ánother envelope simp1 larly indorsed. Afterwards testator frequently spoke of these bonds to several persons, including appellant, as investments made for his children. After his death the bonds enclosed in' the envelopes, as above described, were found among his papers in the safe which he had rented from the “Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Company.” On the books of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company they remained, unchanged, in his name as trustee for his sons respectively.

To do that, was not necessary to the creation of valid trusts. It is well settled that the owner of personal property may impress upon it a valid present trust, either by a declaration that he holds the property in trust, or by a transfer of the legal title to a third party upon certain specified trusts. In other words, he may constitute either himself or another person trustee. If he makes himself trustee no transfer of the subject matter of the trust is necessary; but, if he selects a third party, the subject of the trust must be transferred to him in such mode as will be effectual to pass the legal title : Bispliam’s Equity, 78; Perry on Trusts, Sects. 96, 98 ; Hill on Trustees, 117, <em>et seq. </em>Where, as in this case, the facts show an executed intention or purpose, coupled with an express trust in the donor, for the benefit of the objects of his bounty, unrevoked by him at the time of his death, such a trust is clearly valid against everybody except creditors. A reserved right of revocation is not inconsistent with the creation of a valid trust. If the right is not exercised during the lifetime of the donor, and according to the terms in which it is reserved, the validity of the trust remains unaffected as though there never had been a reserved right of revocation : Stone <em>v. </em>Hackett, <a href="/mass/78/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="12 Gray 227" data-case-ids="2086067" data-case-paths="/mass/78/0227-01">78 Mass., 227</a>.

On the contrary everything that was done by him points to an intention to create a present trust in favor of each of his children. If he had died intestate, they would have been clearly entitled to the securities set apart by him and impressed with trusts in their favor. Even in his will he recognizes the existence of previously created trusts, in favor of his children, in which, as he says, “ no terms of trusts were declared,” and speaks of his intention to set forth the same in his will; and we find that in that he does not attempt to revoke the trusts previously <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>created, but merely to qualify tbe terms thereof to some extent. If it be true then that he did create absolute and unconditional trusts in favor of his children, respectively, and designate himself as their trustee, the trusts thus created could not be revoked by his undertaking to annex thereto special terms or qualifications not expressed in the original declarations of trust. If the <em>eestuis que trust </em>choose to respect the testamentary wish of their father, and accept the qualified terms specified in his will they do not thereby renounce their right to the securities which were the subjects of the respective trusts, and thus preclude themselves from claiming the same as valid gifts <em>inter vivos. </em>In other words they may accept the additional or modified terms of trust expressed in the will and still retain their right to the securities as valid gifts from their father to them in his lifetime, subject however to such self-imposed qualifications.</p>
