Subsequently, from time to time, portions of this lumber were shipped as ordered by the defendant, and payments were made by him of the notes which he had given as part payment of the same.

If at that time the lumber was the property of the plaintiffs they must bear the loss. If it was the property of the defendant, he must bear the loss. The loss follows the title.</p>

Where there is a sale of goods, generally, no property in them passes till delivery,because until'then the very goods sold are not ascertained. But where by the contract itself the vendor appropriates to the vendee a specific chattel, and the latter thereby agrees to take that specific chattel and to pay the stipulated price, the parties are then in the same situation as they would be after a delivery of goods in pursuance of a general contract. The very appropriation of the chattel is equivalent to delivery by the vendor, and the assent of the vendee to take the specific chattel and to pay the price is equivalent to his accepting possession. The effect of the contract, there<a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>fore, .s to vest the property in the bargainee.” In the same volume, p. 330, the rule deducible from the American decisions is thus stated: “ In the absence of an express agreement, the intent that title shall pass at once by the contract, although the seller is to deliver, is inferred where the buyer is to give notice of time and place of delivery, where payment in full is made, where the buyer employs the seller to remove the property, or where there is other evidence that the continued possession of the seller is merely for the convenience of the buyer-, or that the removal of the goods is made by the seller as agent for the buyer.”</p>

Weighing and marking goods and setting them aside are evidence of a perfect sale, so as to vest the title in the vendee, but not proof of it nor essential to it. As between vendor and vendee it is specification and not delivery that is necessary to the vesting of the title.

Weighing and marking goods and setting them aside are evidence of a perfect sale, so as to vest the title in the vendee, but not proof of it nor essential to it. As between vendor and vendee it is specification and not delivery that is necessary to the vesting of the title. That the bargain is by words in past or present time, is not conclusive evidence of a perfect sale; for if it appears that the vendor did not then own the article contracted for, or that it was not yet in existence or not selected out of a lot of similar articles, then the subject matter of the contract remains undefined, and it is incompatible with the very nature of things to call it a perfect sale. Where a contract of sale is in lawful form the vesting of the title depends upon the intention of the parties, to be derived from the contract and its circumstances.</p>

Collins, 2 Nor., 359, that a writ of error to a reference under the Act of 22d April, 1874, brought up only questions of law arising on bills of exceptions to the rulings of the judge, and that his conclusions on the facts of the case must be regarded <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>in the same manner as the verdict of a jury. This case has since been followed by Brown <em>v. </em>Dempsey, 14 Nor., 243, so that we may regard it as established that this court will not reinvestigate the facts as found by the judicial referee. Such being the case, our task in the matter in hand is an easy one.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[280,645,1184,697]]]'>According to the finding of the learned judge we understand that the plaintiffs were the owners of the lumber sold; that this lumber was actually manufactured and placed in separate piles; that it was selected by the defendant, and distinctly marked and designated. As the exact quantity was unknown, an estimate was made by the parties for the purposes of sale ; that bills of sale were prepared by the vendee, and were signed by the vendors, in which appropriate words were used to specify aud designate the subject matter of the sale, and to perfect the sale and title to the vendee. The defendant paid the earnest money ; gave his notes for the estimated amounts, and paid them as they became due; that portions of the lumber were shipped, from time to time, on his orders, and that he exercised, and continued to exercise, unquestionable rights of ownership over the lumber up to the time it was destroyed by fire.</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[268,1343,1192,958]]]'>What we have here stated is the substance of the findings, and an examination of the evidence satisfies us that they were warranted by the testimony. Now, if there be any doubt as to the law governing this case it may be dissipated by reference to Winslow, Lannier &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Leonard, <a href="/pa/24/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="24 Pa. 14" data-case-ids="9502928" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0014-01">24 Pa., 14</a>, where it was held, that though the right of a vendor to rescind a sale, because of the failure of the vendee, or his refusal to pay, continues so long as any weighing, measuring or other thing remains to be done on his part, yet this test does not apply to the question of the vesting of the title in a case where the vendor has no cause of rescission. It is further said in this same case, that where the lawful form of contracting is pursued, the vesting of the title always depends on the intention of the parties to be derived from the contract, and its circumstances, and that actual delivery, weighing and setting aside are only circumstances from which the intention may be inferred. When these undoubted rules of law are applied to the defendant’s contention it is found to have no substantial foun/fiation. Not only selection and marking of the lumber, but the bills of sale, and the delivery of the defendant’s notes expressed the fixed intention of the parties to make the sale a present, and positive one.</p>

That the plaintiffs may have had the right to have refused to allow the boards to be. taken from their yard, had the defendant neglected to comply with his contract, is possible, but as there was no such neglect, and therefore, no necessity for the exercise of such right, we need not discuss what might have been under different circumstances. From what we have before us, we are free to say that the rulings and judgment of the court below were in all particulars correct.</p>
