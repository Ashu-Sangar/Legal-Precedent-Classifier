The company, however, received said proofs of loss, referred them to its adjuster and retained them without objection or complaint for five months. In an action on the policy by the assured tlie company defended <em>inter alia </em>on the failure of: the assured to furnish proofs of loss as required by the terms of the policy. <em>Held, </em>That the company had waived any objections to the proofs of loss they might have made.</p>

It was a house and not personal property or merchandise that was burned, and the house was burned down ; the question as to whether the loss was total or not we leave to .you. All the witnesses say the house burned down and was a total loss; but the defendant alleges that there was some value in the stone foundation. The plaintiff denies this, and all the witnesses say that for the purpose of replacing the same property the foundation was worthless.

When the policy issued, Hocking held a.policy of the Howard Insurance Company of New York for $2,000, dated 24th November, 1884, on the same building; and afterwards, on the 3d December, 1884, obtained a policy of the German American Insurance Co., in the sum of $1,000, making the total insurance $4,000, all of which was in full force on the fourth day of December, 1884, when the building was destroyed by fire.</p>

Notice of the loss was promptly given as required, but the proofs were not furnished within sixty days. The plaintiff's contention was that as there was but a single subject of insurance, the loss, total, and the notice to that effect, no further proof was necessary. But applying the principles laid down in German Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Hocking, which was argued with the case at bar, it is plain that the company, under the special terms of their policy, had the undoubted right to have furnished to them proofs of certain matters, according to the conditions of the contract. These proofs were furnished, and there is no substantial objection made, we think, either to their form or substance, but it is contended that as the loss occurred on the 4th December, 1884, and the proofs were not furnished until 28th March, 1885, more than sixty days intervening, they were not in time, and the company was not bound to receive them. But the company did receive them, referred them to their adjuster, and retained them without objection or complaint on that or any other ground, from the 28th March, 1885, until the 18th August, 1885. If the company acted upon these proofs as having been received in time, and made no objection whatever until the trial, they would be presumed, we think, to have waived the objections which they now make: Lycoming Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Schreffler, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20188" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wright 188">6 Wright, 188</a>. The policy is not printed, but as we understand it from the portions which are printed, the proofs of loss were but conditions precedent to the bringing of an action, and not of the insurance, and if the delay in furnishing them was waived, the remedy still remained. It was the duty of the company, if the proofs were imperfect, or out of time, if objected to on that ground, to make their objection known. It is true the policy provided that “no examination of the assured, nor investigation by the company, nor reference to, nor award of arbitrators, shall operate as a waiver on part of the company of any of the provisions, conditions or requirements of the policy, respecting the making or filing of a particular account of loss,” as therein provided; but the act of waiver to which we have given effect, is not embraced in this provision.</p>

Co. <em>v. </em>Fenlon, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 205" data-case-ids="1856244" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0205-01">4 W. &amp; S., 205</a>; Connor <em>v. </em>Simpson, 8 Out., 440; Hostetter <em>v. </em>City of Pittsburgh, 11 Out., 419. But it is equally true, that where the agreement in question does not provide for submitting matters in dispute to any particular person or tribunal named, but to one or more persons to be mutually chosen by the parties, i't is revocable by either party; and such a provision is not adequate to oust the jurisdiction of the courts having cognizance of the subject-matter of the dispute: Gray <em>v. </em>Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%2041" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 41">4 Watts 41</a>; Mentz <em>v. </em>Armenia Fire Ins.

We are of opinion therefore that the second assignment of error cannot be sustained.</p>

The company, as we have said, had a right to insist upon the provision in the policy for the proofs of loss; they were not furnished until the 28th March, 1885. The company had thirty days thereafter in which to give notice of their intention to rebuild, and the loss was not payable in <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>money, should the option not be exercised, for sixty days, whereas the suit was brought on the 17th April, 1885.</p>
