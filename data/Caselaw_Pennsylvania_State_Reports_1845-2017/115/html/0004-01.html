AH the remainder of that section, beginning with the words, “and shall be laid under his supervision,” etc., is unwise and unreasonable. It is unwise to have the city engineer control the work, place men in charge of it, supervise and direct it, to the exclusion of the company, for that would make the city directly responsible for all acts of negligence in prosecuting the work.

If a company uses improper pipes or improper methods, the city has a right to, and should, interfere.

These provisions and requirements of the ordinance are in no sense “regulations.” They do not relate to the use of-the streets, the character of pipes or the manner of laying them, or anything touching the public safety or convenience. In several respects they contravene the Act of Assembly. Section 1 of the Act says that, when 10 per cent, of the capital stock has been paid in, the company may obtain a charter and is invested with all the rights and privileges conferred in the Act. “ B •” of section 2 of the ordinance says that, unless 50 per cent, has been paid in, the company shall have no rights in the city of Pittsburgh.</p>

Third, That the ordinance requiring the removal of steam engines after notice from the mayor, did. not-prescribe regulations for- their construction, location or use, but committed to the unrestrained will of a single public officer a power over the use of steam within the limits of the city practically absolute, so that he might prohibit the use altogether. Fourth, That an ordinance which clothes a single individual with such power, the exercise of which may proceed from enmity or prejudice, from favoritism and other improper influences and motives, easy of concealment and difficult to be detected and exposed, hardly falls within the domain of law, and is void and inoperative; Yiek Wo <em>v. </em>Hopkins, 13 Am. &amp; Eng.

Some of these, as expressed in the first section, are, “to-produce, .mine, own, deal in, transport, store and supply natural gas for either light, heat or both, or other purposes, and have all the rights and privileges necessary or convenient therefor.”</p>

Indeed, they would be absolutely independent of the action of councils if it were not for the provision contained in the llth section making “ the right to enter upon any public lane, street, alley, or highway for the purpose of laying down pipes, altering, inspecting or repairing the same,.....subject to such regulations as the Councils of an.y city may by ordinance adopt,” and that of the 18th section, declaring that companies, of the class to which appellee belongs, “ shall not enter upon or lay down their pipes or conduits on any street or highway of any borough or city .....without the assent of the councils of such borough or city by ordinance duly passed and approved.” So far as the limited authority to legislate on these peculiar subjects has been delegated to Councils, and to that extent only, can the corporate powers, rights and privileges of natural gas companies be qualified or limited. Councils are authorized to give or withhold their assent, without more. They have no right to couple* their assent with any condition or restriction not imposed by the Act, unless the company agrees to accept the same and be bound thereby; and even then, the conditions or restrictions, so accepted by the company, must harmonize and in nowise conflict with the provisions of the Act. The assent of Councils being given, the regulations they are authorized to adopt are such only as relate to the manner of laying pipes, altering, inspecting and repairing the same, and the character thereof with respect to safety and public convenience. These regulations must also be reasonable and not in conflict with any .of the <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>provisions of the Act. In 'all other respects, the powers of such companies are clearly defined and their duties and liabilities prescribed by the Act under which they are incorporated. In view of the limited authority delegated to councils, it is a grave mistake to assume, as they appear to have done in this case, that they have the power to legislate on any and everything dix-eetlyor indirectly connected with the general subject.</p>

It shall be the duty of the court to have the hearing and make its decree with all convenient speed and promptness.

    <p id="b37-8" data-blocks='[["BL_37.7",37,[193,1505,1194,957]],["BL_38.1",38,[231,399,1183,130]]]'>The grant of assent, it is true, is expressly subject to all the provisions of the ordinance of August 10th, 1885; but, this means nothing more than that the provisions of the ordinance, so far as they are reasonable and proper regulations, shall be binding on the companies in the exercise of their corporate rights within the city. The second section of the ordinance of December 29th, declaring that “the privileges granted shall be enjoyed.....only upon the following conditions,” means substantially the same thing. While the word, “assent,” is not use'd in the first section of the ordinance, the language employed necessarily implies the assent required by the 13th section of the Act, and hence the phrase “privileges granted” can refer to nothing else than the assent of councils given by necessary implication in the first section of the Ordinance. The word “ conditions ” in the second section is used in the sense of regulations and not conditions precedent. This is further shown by the language employed in paragraphs A, B, C, and D, of same section which is pi'edicated of assent previously granted in the first section. But, if this is not .so, and the provisions contained in these paragraphs and. other sections of the ordinance are to be regarded as conditions precedent, they are inoperative and void, except in so far as <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>they are reasonable and proper regulations, such as Councils, under the limited authority delegated to them, are authorized to adopt.</p>
    <p id="b38-4" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[227,530,1187,696]]]'>The City Councils have no power to legislate upon condition. If authority to deal with the entire subject of natural gas and its introduction into the city for heating and illuminaing purposes had been delegated to them by the legislature, there might be some room for the contention that Councils might couple their grant of assent with conditions.- But no such authority was given. As we have seen, it -is obvious on reading the Act in question that two things only were delegated to Councils: first, the power to give or withhold assent to enter upon the city streets; and second, the right to adopt regulations, the reasonableness of which is virtually declared to be a judicial question. Any attempted legislation on the subject, outside of these matters, is <em>ultra </em>vires, a mere usurpation of authority never delegated to them. We conclude therefore that the grant of assent is valid, but. the so called conditions precedent, if they be so regarded, are null and void.</p>
    <p id="b38-5" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[222,1226,1186,336]]]'>Councils having given the required assent, the next question is, whether in view of the facts found by the learned master, the court erred in deciding that some of the provisions of each ordinance are <em>ultra </em>vires, and others are unreasonable and improper. On that branch of the subject the report of the Master and opinion of the learned judge of the Common Pleas are so satisfactory and conclusive that the decree complained of needs no further vindiction. .</p>

It is difficult to account for them on any theory that is not incompatible with the public welfare and the duty which councils owe to their constituents. One. of them is the provision evidently designed to deprive natural gas companies of the right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas, expressly given, by the Act of Assembly. This is attempted by making. Councils themselves a court of final resort, and exacting from the companies a bond,iu; $100,000, binding them to submit to the judgment of that self-constituted tribunal. It requires .no argument to. show that <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>snob a provision as this is a palpable usurpation of authority. But, it is not our purpose' to notice, in detail, those provisions of the ordinances, which have been adjudged illegal and void.

This position is untenable, especially in view of the revisory jurisdiction given to the Court of Common Pleas by the Act of May 29th, 1885. As we have already seen, there is no such necessary connection between the title and granting section of the ordinance, and the provisions that are declared illegal and void, that the former must fall with the latter. One section of an ordinance may be declared reasonable and valid, while another-section of the same ordinance may be pronounced unreasonable and void: Commissioners <em>v. </em>Gas Company; <a href="/pa/12/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 Pa. 318" data-case-ids="963741" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0318-01">12 Pa.
