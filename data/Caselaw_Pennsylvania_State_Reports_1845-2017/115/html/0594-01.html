    <p class="summary" id="b609-6" data-blocks='[["BL_609.6",609,[118,518,1191,828]]]'>The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant on March 20th, 1879, and filed his statement of his cause of action March 22d, 1879. The summons was. served on the defendant March 24th, 1.879, and judgment by default taken April 3d,' 1879, for $663.71. The Act of Assembly relating to the commencement of actions in Chester county, passed April 5th, 1862 (P. L., 270), provides, that all writs for the commencement of actions in said county shall be made returnable in ten days after the service thereof, and that if the plaintiff shall file his statement, where the ease is a proper one for a statement, as prescribed by said Act, at least five days before the return day, he may enter judgment by default against the defendant at any time after the return day, unless the defendant shall, on or before the return day, file an affidavit of defence, stating the nature thereof. The return day of the writ in the case was April 3d, 1879, that being the tenth day after its service, and judgment by default could not, therefore, be regularly taken until the next day — the 4th. It was, however, doubtless through inadvertence, taken on the 3d.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b609-7" data-blocks='[["BL_609.7",609,[118,1346,1185,1134]],["BL_610.1",610,[284,428,1192,1042]]]'>On August 10th, 1885, six years and four months after the judgment was thus taken, the defendant took this rule, to show cause why the judgment thus entered should not be stricken off, based wholly upon the fact that it was thus taken one day too soon. This is resisted by the plaintiff, on the ground that the defendant, by his delay, has waived his right to have the judgment stricken off, and that he has also acquiesced in the entry thus made, and cannot, at this late day, interfere with the judgment and with rights acquired by the plaintiff thereunder. It appears from the records, that an attachment execution was issued on this judgment, attaching, in the hands of the executors of John Harper (grandfather of the defendant) a legacy or share coming to the defendant at a future day. This attatchment execution was issued April 7th, 1879, four days after the judgment was entered, and was served on the garnishee and the defendant on April 11th, 1879. The sheriff’s return shows that it was served on the defendant personally, by giving him a true and attested copy of the writ, and making known to him the contents thereof. This writ of attachment recites the recovery of the judgment on the 3d of April, 1879, and its amount. The defendant, therefore, on the 11th day ot April, eight days after the entry of the judgment, had notice of the date when the judgment had been entered. On April 18th, 1879, another attachment execution was issued on the judgment, attaching moneys in the hands of the other garnishees. This was served on the defendant <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>April 25th, 1879. This writ also recited the judgment as taken on the 3d of April; so that the defendant had again notice, some three weeks after the entry of judgment, of the day on which it was entered. No appearance was entered, or affidavit of defence filed, but the defendant, with knowledge thus brought directly home to him, of the entry of the judgment on April 3d, one day too soon, acquiesced in the judgment thus entered, and in the attachment execution issued thereon and served, and took no steps to interfere therewith, until the taking of this rule on August 10th, 1885, to strike off the judgment. • In addition to this a <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the judgment on March 13th, 1884, and duly served personally on the defendant, Harper. This writ recited the judgment on which it issued, as entered on April 3d, 1879. No appearance was entered, or defence taken, and judgment by default was subsequently entered before the taking of this rule. An attachment execution at the suit of another creditor, was issued on August 4th, 1885, and the same moneys attached; so that while the motion to strike off the judgment in question is made by the defendant, the controversy is really between two judgment creditors, as to which of them shall take the money attached — the creditor in the attachment .issued April 7th, 1879, or the creditors in the attachment issued August 4th, 1885.</p>

That a judgment entered as this was is not void but voidable, is, we think, clear.
