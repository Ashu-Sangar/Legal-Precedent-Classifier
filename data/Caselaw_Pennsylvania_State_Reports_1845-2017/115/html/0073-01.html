The burden is therefore on them to show that, upon the facts set forth in the Auditor’s.report, there is manifest error in the decree. This they have failed to do.</p>

This was done by changing the position of the old boilers from parallel with the “ Rod Mill,” and placing all the boilers at right angles thereto; the boiler-room and masonry being changed to conform tp this new arrangement of <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>the boilers.

The items in claims filed, which were charged before the fire amounted, as found by the Auditor, to $7,110.26, and those charged after the fire to $13,581.43, making in all $20,691.69, the aggregate of mechanics’ liens filed.
