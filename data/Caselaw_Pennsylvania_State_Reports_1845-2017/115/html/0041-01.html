Morrison are children of Mrs. Elizabeth Florence Morrison, one of the beneficiaries under the will of Edward Tyler, deceased, and Benjamin F. Hastings is the surviving husband of Elizabeth Morrison Hastings, who, by her last will and testament, devised her interest to him. The two actions were brought to recover the three individual interests in the land in dispute, and, being identical and for the same land, were tried together. Elizabeth Florence Morrison, after the death of Elizabeth Tyler, her grandmother, in 1852, together with her husband, James Morrison, went into possession of the land in dispute, under the terms of the will of Edward Tyler, and remained in occupancy of the same for Some time. About 1853, she, together with her husband and children, removed to Washington county, Pennsylvania, to live, where she died in 1855. On November 17th, 1858, Richard Donaldson, who had been appointed guardian of Richard B. Morrison, J. A. Morrison and Elizabeth Morrison, by the Orphans’ Court of Washington county, presented his petition to the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county, praying for.permission to sell the land in dispute, setting forth in his petition that it would be to the interest of said minors that the land should be sold at private sale, for $800.00. It was also stated in the petition that James Morrison who held said'land as tenant by the curtesy should receive the interest on the mortgage of $700.00 given for the purchase money, so long as he should live. This petition was presented to the court, and an order was made authorizing the said sale. It did not appear in said order that it was made by the President Judge of the said court. There was no application made to the Orphans’ Court of Washington county, Pennsylvania, for permission to mortgage or sell said real estate, nor was any permission granted by the said court for any such purpose. ■ There was no schedule of de,bts exhibited to the Orphans’ Court of either county showing the’ necessity for said sale, nor was there any averment that the court of Washington county had authorized said sale as prayed for, nor was any reason assigned for the said <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>sale, except that it would be to the interest of those interested that said sale should be made.</p>

The land by subsequent conveyances became vested in the defendants. The sole question in the case is, did the sale so conducted vest any title in the purchasers?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-8" data-blocks='[["BL_57.8",57,[149,1077,1187,689]]]'>In the general charge the court instructed the jury, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows: — Edward Tyler owned the lot, and in 1828 died, leaving a will, in which he devised one half of it to his wife with power to dispose of it at her death. She undertook to dispose of it during her lifetime, and sold it to one William Cowan ; he went into possession of her portion of it in October, 1837, and has been in possession ever since, which would apparently give him title under the Statute of Limitations. The plaintiffs themselves have shown no title to that one half; they are not heirs of Edward Tyler. If Mrs. Tyler took a fee simple in that half and was entitled to convey it away, she has conveyed it. If she did not, and took but a life estate, then at her death that half went to the heirs of Edward Tyler, her husband. The plaintiffs do not claim to be heirs of Edward Tyler. They were heirs of his wife who, it seems, was a second wife.</p>

She died, in 1855, owning the half of this lot that had been devised to her bjr Edward Tyler. She left five children living, two of whom are since deceased, unmarried and without children ; another is dead, having married, and devised her interest, or her estate, whatever she had, of all sorts to her husband, Mr. Hastings. The other two áre living and are plaintiffs in these suits. The three then represent whatever interest was left in the heirs of Mrs. Morrison, formerly Miss Florence. Richard Donaldson, of Washington county, was by the Orphans’ Court of Washington county appointed guardian of those minor children. This was done in 1855. In 1858, he applied to the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county for authority to sell the interest of his wards in this property on the ground that it would be for the interest of his wards to have <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>it sold. The Orphans’ Court granted him that authority and directed him to sell at a fixed price of $800, which was done, and deed made by Morrison, acknowledged in open court and delivered to Mr. Cowan, who then owned the other half of the property conveyed by Mrs. Tyler. It seems he paid $100 and gave his mortgage for $700, the interest payable to Mr. Morrison during his life, and the principal to the children at their father’s death; and that money has been paid to Mr. Donaldson. [The plaintiffs claim that the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county had no jurisdiction to decree that sale, and that the sale is void. We are of the opinion that the deed by Mr. Donaldson as guardian under the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county conveying the interests of these minors gave a good title to the purchaser, William Cowan. As Cowan’s title it now held by the defendants, your verdict should be for the defendants in each case.] (Assignment of error.)</p>
