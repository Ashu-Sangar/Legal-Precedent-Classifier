The character of its business was the mining of coal and manufacturing of coke. The company leased certain coal lands on the Southwest Pennsylvania Railway, about three miles southeast of Unioutown, and in the summer of 1881, soon after its organization, began the business for which the company was organized. The mine was worked through two slopes, called upper and lower — about fourteen hundred feet apart. In addition to these, there were two other openings, one near each slope, called a man-way or air course. These mines were originally opened late in the fall of 1880, and but little mining had been done prior to the time plaintiff in error leased them. They were ventilated, as others in the coke region were at that time, by a steam pipe, which extended from the mouth of the lower pit to its bottom. The air in this slope was by this means heated, and, being rarified, passed out, while the air coming in through the upper openings passed into the lower slope, thus producing a current of air through the mine. The air was driven into the headings, or rooms, by a brattice, or door. This was the approved mode of ventilation in that mining region at the time, and is still used there in many places. The uncontradicted testimony-showed that the pipe used in this mine was sufficient to ventilate a “ mine as extensive again.”</p>

Roby, the defendant in error, had been working as a coal miner in this mine for the plaintiff in error. About five and one half o’clock on the morning of May 28th, 1883, Mr. Roby went to his work as usual in that part of the mine known as Flat Heading, No. 4, which was about seven hundred and sixty feet from the mouth of the upper slope. He testified that when within forty feet of the face of the heading an explosion occurred and he was burned. At that time there were three flat-headings connecting the two slopes. The company employed from seventy to one hundred men.</p>

Reasonable care must be exercised in selecting a competent person for such position, but when such care has. been exercised the cases are clear that the company employing him is not liable for his negligence. This results necessarily from the Act of April 28th, 1877, P. L., 58,-which imposes upon the company the duty of providing a mining boss. This Act was passed, as its title shows, to protect the health and safety of the persons employed in the bituminous coal mines, and is a wise and just measure. The one great danger of such mining operations has always been the accumulation of foul air and gases, and it was to avoid this and secure 'proper ventilation that the fifth section of the Act requires the mine owner, <em>no-lens volens, </em>“ to employ a competent and practical inside overseer to be called a mining boss,” etc. The section then proceeds to define his duties, the principal of which is to see that the mine is kept properly ventilated. The mining boss is therefore a creature of the legislature, selected by the mine owner in obedience to the command of the law, and in the interest and for the protection of the miners themselves. It has therefore been properly held that where the mine owners have • exercised reasonable care in the selection of a competent mining boss, they are not liable for injuries resulting from his negligence. His co-employees take the risk of his negligence, precisely as in other cases. If he is incompetent or careless, they can at once discover it and notify the superintendent, while the owners, with every wish to protect the miners,have no such opportunities of information. It is very plain, as was held in Waddell <em>v. </em>Simoson, supra, that the operator of a coal mine fulfills the measure of his duty to his employees if he commits his work to careful and skillful bosses and superintendents, who conduct the same to the best of their skill and ability. More than this he cannot do, and with such duty performed, whatever of risk or danger remains must rest upon the miners themselves. Their work is always hazardous with the best appliances and the highest degree of care. Their own safety requires that in measuring responsibility for accidents care should be taken to determine it justly, with due regard to the respective rights and duties of the parties, employers and employed.</p>

The ventilation of the mine was his especial duty, made so by the express language of the Act of Assembly. At the time of his injury the plaintiff was driving a flat-heading from the slope and had driven it about 350 feet. It was alleged that <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>there was no way of getting air to this place where he was working except what might be produced from the burning of his torch or the passage of a mule wagon. The explosion was caused by the open lamp of the plaintiff coming in contact with the “ black damp ” that had accumulated in the mine. It was alleged that no examination of the mine was regularly made with a safety lamp, and that no proper measurements were made of the air currents. If we regard these allegations as established by the verdict, it only proves the mining boss to have been negligent, of which fact the miners themselves had ample means of knowledge, while the owners had none.</p>
