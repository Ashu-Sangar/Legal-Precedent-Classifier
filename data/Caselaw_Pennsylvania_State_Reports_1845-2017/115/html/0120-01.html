In vol. 2, page 60, he says: “ It is established that (where it is clear on the face of a will that the testator has not accurately or completely expressed his meaning by the words he has used., and it is also clear what are the words which he had omitted, those <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>words) may be supplied in order to effectuate his intention as collected from the context.” “ To effect the clear intention as apparent upon the whole will, words and limitations may be transposed, supplied, or rejectedWilliams on Executors, 1085. See also Ward on Legacies, 213. “ But words are to be supplied only when the intention of the testator is clear and the words necessary to his meaning. There must be manifest and convincing proof that the omission was contrary to the intention of the testator:” Jarman on Wills, vol. 2, page 60, note <em>a. </em>“We cannot,” said Lord Mansfield, in Chapman <em>v. </em>Brown, 3 Burr., 634, “from arbitrary conjecture, though founded on the highest degree of probability, add to a will or supply an omission in it. But we may construe a will, and from what is expressed necessarily imply an intent not particularly specified in the words,” cited with approval by Chief Justice Gibson in Long <em>v. </em>Labor, 8 Barr, 229 — 232. “ You cannot by mere construction incorporate distinct provisions into the will, however it may be that they were omitted by mistake; but the defects to be supplied by construction must be such as necessarily suggest themselves from the words used, as the only reasonable and sensible meaning fairly deducible from the whole instrument: ” Redfield on Wills, 465.</p>

Mr. Justice Thompson in McKeehan <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 P. F. S., 74, said, “It is a cardinal rule in the construction of wills that the intention of the testator as developed by the will must control. If this were not true the paper would not be the will of the decedent. It sometimes happens, however, that through ignorance or mistake of the testator or drawer of the will, words are omitted or inserted which have left unexpressed or wrongfully expressed what clearly appears to have been the intention of the devisor from the whole tenor of the will, and which are necessary to carry it out. The rule in such cases is well settled that the courts will permit the will to be read as if the words omitted were inserted and those wrongfully inserted omitted, and in the place or places where they were intended -to have been inserted or omitted. Having given the views of the learned authors upon the subject and of the judges of the courts who have had occasion to examine into it, the Master now takes up and considers some of the cases in which the principle has been enunciated, in oi;der to see practically to what extent the courts will go in applying the rule as to which the authorities cited above all agree.</p>

In these cases, as was said by Lord Ellenborough in Doe d. Leach <em>v. </em>Micklen, 6 East, 494, the structure of the sentence was perfect without any alteration or addition of words, yet, as the intention of the testator clearly indicated that they were omitted by mistake, the court supplied the words. In the ease last cited the words “ and after her death ” were inserted in order to carry out the intention. In Abbot <em>v. </em>Middleton, 21 Beav., 143, there was a bequest to testator’s widow for life and on her decease to his son for life and on his demise the principal to become the property of any children he might have. Then followed a gift over in case the son died before his mother (omitting the words “ without leaving children ”). The son died before both his father and mother, leaving an only child, who survived them. It was held, that such child was entitled to the principal sum after the grandmother's death, and that to effectuate the intention of the testator the words “without leaving any child” were implied, Sir John Romilly saying: “It may be stated as a general rule that wherever the context requires it, words may be supplied, changed, and transposed.”</p>

And it was certainly7 understood so to be by William Hellerman, the devisee, who, for six consecutive years after .testator’s death, paid the said annuity to his mother. Upon any other construction, the words of the devise, “for and during all the term of her natural life,” would have no meaning whatever.</p>

    <p id="AEP" data-blocks='[["BL_142.6",142,[762,569,676,42]],["BL_142.7",142,[259,615,337,39]]]'>delivered the opinion of the court March 21st, 1887.</p>
    <p id="b142-5" data-blocks='[["BL_142.8",142,[260,656,1181,384]]]'>The language of the will must be interpreted according to its proper acceptation, or with as near approach to that acceptation, as the context and state of the circumstances existing at the time of its execution will admit. A mistake in the wilL cannot be corrected, unless it clearly appears by fair inference from the whole. In this court the appellant has not contended that parol evidence is admissible of the actual intention of the testator for the purpose of controlling or influencing the construction of his will.</p>
    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.9",142,[251,1047,1189,740]]]'>This will contains seven “items,” and only the fifth contains no bequest to the testator’s wife. He first bequeaths to her all his personal estate, except a specified portion. The second and fourth items contain devises of real estate, each “ subject to the payment of the sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars per annum unto my widow, Catharine, for and during the term ,of her natural life.” In the third item real estate is devised to William Hellerman, “ subject to the payment of the sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars unto my widow, Catharine, for and during all the term of her natural life.” In the sixth item the testator provides that in case his daughter Caroline should die before his widow, that his widow shall have the rents and profits of certain land “during the term’of her natural life.” And in the seventh item the testator devises his homestead farm, subject to the right of his widow, Catharine, to reside on the same “ during the term of her natural life,” and to receive'one third of the rents and profits “ during her life.”</p>
    <p id="b142-7" data-blocks='[["BL_142.10",142,[256,1788,1178,510]]]'>After having made five annual payments of one hundred and twenty-five dollars to the widow, the appellant discovered that the words “per annum” had been omitted in the clause creating the charge on the land devised to him. Being interested, he naturally inferred that the words in said clause, “during all the term of her natural life,” were meaningless, though so often used in their proper sense in other parts of the will where money and rents are directed to be paid to her during said period. That he did not sooner discover the omission is not surprising. It seems plain that he took the land, subject to an annual payment during the life of the widow.</p>
    <p id="b142-8" data-blocks='[["BL_142.11",142,[256,2309,1176,173]],["BL_143.1",143,[119,466,1181,218]]]'>The testator used apt words to express his intention, and the several devises, subject to annual payments to the widow, are in similar phrase as respects the duration of the charge. Had the testator intended to charge one devise with a single small <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>payment, he would have simply directed its payment to his widow, and not have repeated that phrase, omitting a word, thereby rendering the phrase senseless. It is a fair inference from the whole will that the words “ per annum” were omitted from said clause by mistake.</p>
    <p id="b143-6" data-blocks='[["BL_143.6",143,[118,682,1184,177]]]'>It is unnecessary to repeat the reference to the authorities, made by the Master and court below, which establish the principle that a word may be supplied when it is a clear inference from the whole will that it Avas omitted by mistake.</p>
    <p id="b143-7" data-blocks='[["BL_143.7",143,[380,860,918,87]]]'>Decree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at costs of the appellant.</p>
