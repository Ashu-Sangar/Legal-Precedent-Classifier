In deciding the question Piebson, J., said: “ prior to the adoption of the present constitution, there were numerous statutes pointing out the method of dividing wards, boroughs and townships into election precincts, which required all of the paraphernalia pointed out by the petitioners in their argument, and no such <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>division could ordinarily be made in less than six months— two terms of the sessions, and frequently more, where the same was contested.
