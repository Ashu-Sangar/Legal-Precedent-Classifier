The boilers were to be set in solid masonry, with steam pipes to be placed through the building, connecting the boiler with twenty-three radiators, with all necessary fittings, etc. All horizontal pipes were to be suspended in welded coil chain, or with rings or rods, so as to be secure from expansion. For furnishing and setting this heating apparatus plaintiffs were to receive the sum of $1,704.

Some time after making the agreements above mentioned, Mr. Dimmick contracted with the plaintiffs to put in a steam pump and pipes for the consideration of $492. The date of this contract does not appear. Mr. Hartung, who superintended the work upon the hotel, testifies that “ the pump was put in after; it was not part of the original contract; we knew nothing about it until Mr. Dimmick had made the arrangement.” Mr. Dimmick testifies, “ The contract for putting this pump in was done after all the other contracts were entered into. It was an after consideratioii entirely.” This pump was located at a spring, some 800 to 1200 feet from the hotel, and was to fee operated by steam conducted by pipes from the hotel, and its purpose was to force water from the spring to the hotel. Connections were so far made that the pumps were put in operation and forced the water into or near the house. Some part of these connecting pipes were laid under ground, and some were only temporarily laid, it being considered unadvisable to have permanent connections made to remain through the winter, and before winter the pipes were disconnected.</p>

It is a brass kettle. It sets right in the corner of the kitchen, for the purpose of cooking soup. It is heated either by steam or from the range. I really don’t know whether it is heated by the range or from the steam.” This statement indicates that this kettle is permanently located in the corner of the kitchen, and it necessarily follows that whether heated from the range or the steam apparatus, it must be connected with one or the other of them by pipes, or by some arrangement conveying heat.</p>

By the first section of said Act it is provided that “ Every building erected within the several counties of this commonwealth.....shall be subject to a lien for the payment of all debts contracted for <a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>work done or materials furnished for or about the erection or construction of the same.”</p>
    <p id="b594-6" data-blocks='[["BL_594.6",594,[274,523,1182,306]]]'>It has always been conceded that for engines and machinery, constituting a part of a new mill, there was a lien under the Act of 1836 ; but if placed in the mill, or about it, and no constituent part of the erection, they were not within the lien laws: Summerville <em>v. </em>Wann, <a href="/citations/?q=37%20Penn.%2C%20182" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="37 Penn., 182">37 Penn., 182</a>. The test is whether they are a part of the original erection, and necessary for the purposes for which the building was intended.</p>
    <p id="b594-7" data-blocks='[["BL_594.7",594,[274,829,1184,650]]]'>This was a large hotel, capable of accommodating two hundred guests. For such a building permanent apparatus for heating, washing and cooking are as essential as are engines and boilers in a mill. , It is true you can eat, wasli and cook without them. So you can grind flour and saw lumber by hand, but the world has outgrown such a mode of doing business and it is proper that both legislative and judicial decision should keep abreast of the times. A building with only walls and a roof is neither a hotel nor a factory. It is a building, nothing more. When a man constructs a building for a hotel, everything of a permanent character, which will pass as a part of the freehold, and which is reasonably necessary to equip it for the purpose for which it is erected, is a part of such building and therefore comes within the Act of 1836. This has often been said before and we now repeat it.</p>
