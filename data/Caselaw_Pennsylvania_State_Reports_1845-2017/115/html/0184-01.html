In section 9 of that Act it was provided “that at least twenty feet of the road was to be made an artificial road-bed, with wood, stone, gravel or any other hard substance, well compacted together, and of sufficient depth to secure a solid foundation for the same; and the said shall be faced with gravel or stone pounded, or other small hard substance, in such a manner as to secure a firm and even surface,” etc., and the company was required to keep the same in good and perfect order, and allowed to collect tolls from travelers thereon. Under this authority the road was built.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b199-7" data-blocks='[["BL_199.8",199,[160,1192,1195,698]]]'>By Act of Assembly of March 26th, 1865 (Pamphlet Laws, 570), certain rights and privileges, which had been reserved by the state by the original charter, to wit, to resume possession of the road upon paying a valuation, were transferred to and vested in the city of Philadelphia. And, by that Act, it was provided that, as soon as the appraised value should be paid by the city, all tolls upon the road should cease. Subsequent statutes were passed on the subject of the method of making the appraisement, the last one of which was the Act of 27th May, 1871 (Pamphlet Laws, 1250). In the manner pointed out by this last statute, the appraisement of the road was made, the amount was paid by the city, and the road relieved from toll. The city took possession of this road under these Acts of Assembly on the twenty-eighth day of October, 1874, and by them the duty of keeping the road in proper condition for travel was laid upon the city.</p>

It was proved by many witnesses that the road, especially in the winter time, was in very bad condition during the whole period which elapsed from the taking possession by the city until the day of beginning this suit, the summons in which was issued March 4tli, 1882. It cannot be said that the road was impassable at any time, for the fact is that at the worst times persons did go through; but it was proved beyond dispute, and I find as a matter of fact, that the defendant neglected its duty with respect to this road, that it was in a condition which made it inconvenient and' unsafe for ordinary travel, and that with respect to it the defendant was guilty of negligence.</p>

Gold, <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>who kept an inn fronting on this road, in Chestnut Hill, for many years prior to his death. He died in 1874, and, from that time to the day of bringing suit (and since), the same inn has been kept up by the plaintiff, who was his widow and succeeded him in the business. During the whole occupancy of the plaintiff and her deceased husband, they were tenants, under a lease from year to year, of the premises.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b200-4" data-blocks='[["BL_200.5",200,[254,743,1183,698]]]'>Prior to the year 1874, the business at this inn was prosperous. It was the only inn on that road for the accommodation of farmers and drovers. It was the habit of certain cattle dealers to go through the grazing districts of Bucks and Montgomery counties to buy and collect cattle, and drive them down this road to the city of Philadelphia to market. It was considered very desirable by these drovers to arrive at market, in Philadelphia, in the morning; and, as the inn was situated at a convenient distance from the cattle market, they were in the habit of stopping there over night with their droves of cattle and their servants. This was a regular business for which preparations had been made by the building of extensive cattle sheds and other conveniences, and which had been carried on for many years, and was a source of constant profit to the persons keeping the inn. It was also frequented by farmers and clothing dealers.</p>

Many complaints about the bad condition of the road were made to the proper departments of the city of Philadelphia, not only by the plaintiff herself, but also by policemen, neighbors, persons traveling along the same and the assistant commissioner of highways of that district. But all these complaints were without avail to induce the city to do its duty and put the road in proper repair. In addition to this, in the fall of 1880, the defendant graded Growen avenue, at Mount Airy, some distance below the inn of the plaintiff, and, from the cuttings made necessajy by that grading, had obtained a quantity of red or yellow earth or loam, which was spread upon portions of the road in question with the intention of grading it. During the winter after this red or yellow earth or loam was put upon the road, the condition of it was very bad. The ruts and holes, which had been allowed to grow deeper in the old artificial bed of the road, were covered and hidden from sight by the soft earth thus put on top of them; and, when the rains came, and this soft earth was turned into mud, these old holes served as pitfalls for travelers, who, by reason of the covering of mud, were unable to see them. Still, I am not able to say that, even during this winter, the road was impassable for teams. The fact is that, even at the worst, some <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>persons did habitually <em>go </em>over the road; but its condition was such that it was avoided by many who had been in the habit of going over it, and the stream of travel past the plaintiff’s inn was undoubtedly greatly decreased on account of the condition of this road.</p>

No doubt the annoyance and Injury to the plaintiff by the acts alleged in the declaration were much greater in amount than those which were caused to any other person having occasion to use the same highway. But it was á similar sort or species of damage. His near proximity to the bridge and the nature of the business in which he was engaged did not change the kind of damage to which he was subjected, but only increased the extent of the injury. Every traveler having occasion to pass the bridge or to transport goods or merchandise across it, incurred in some degree additional trouble and expense, as well as a loss of time, by being compelled to seek another and more circuitous route. These elements of damage are the same as those claimed by the plaintiff, and are not special or peculiar to him, so as to furnish a good cause of action. The same is true of the alleged loss of rents. Every person owning property on the highway leading to the bridge, near to or remote from the place of the alleged obstruction, sustained a similar injury: Sm. <em>v. </em>Boston, <a href="/mass/61/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Cush. 257" data-case-ids="1967596" data-case-paths="/mass/61/0257-01">7 Cush., 257</a>.

If every man who lives upon a street has a right of action against the city every time some portion of the street, more or less distant from his residence, shall fall intoan unsafe condition, and be so allowed to remain for any length of time, it is impossible to say what number of suits against the city might be brought upon cases more or less trifling.</p>

    <p id="b210-11" data-blocks='[["BL_210.13",210,[261,1799,1183,525]]]'>The plaintiff is the proprietor of an inn at Chestnut Hill, fronting on the main road, or Germantown avenue, at which a large and prosperous business had been carried on for a long time. Germantown avenue was a turnpike road for many years and while such was kept in reasonably good condition. The city took the road in 1874, and since that time until this suit was brought, said street has been neglected by the city authorities to a degree that rendered travel upon it exceedingly inconvenient, if not dangerous. The plaintiff alleges and the referee finds that in consequence of the ill condition of the road, her business fell off to a considerable extent and the profits of her inn were correspondingly diminished.</p>
    <p id="b210-12" data-blocks='[["BL_210.14",210,[263,2322,1182,173]],["BL_211.1",211,[167,430,1188,173]]]'>The learned referee finds, and this finding is the subject of the first assignment of error, that “I am of the opinion that although the evidence establishes the duty of defendant to keep the street in repair, and that the defendant has neglected <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>to perform that duty, and that consequential damage has been suffered by the plaintiff as the result of that negligence, I do not think she has the right to maintain this private action. I therefore find and report in favor of the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.6",211,[168,605,1191,261]]]'>This finding raises the pivotal question in the cause. It is one of very considerable public importance, being substantially whether a municipal corporation, charged with the duty of keeping the highways in repair, is liable to the owner or occupier of property fronting thereon for the loss to his business resulting from the neglect of such duty.</p>
    <p id="b211-7" data-blocks='[["BL_211.7",211,[170,865,1187,174]]]'>The referee does not find that access was cut off from plaintiff’s property, nor that the highway aforesaid was impassable. It was, however, in such bad condition, that travel sought other ways when practicable.</p>
    <p id="b211-8" data-blocks='[["BL_211.8",211,[169,1040,1185,264]]]'>It was decided by this court in Com. <em>Ex. Rel. </em>Attorney General <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20485" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 485">11 W. N. C., 485</a>, that the authorities of the said city, after taking possession of this turnpike road, were not bound to keep it up as a macadamized road ; that it was required only to keep it in fit condition for ordinary travel, the same as other county roads.</p>
    <p id="b211-9" data-blocks='[["BL_211.9",211,[169,1304,1184,263]]]'>The learned referee ruled this case upon the familiar and well settled principle, that one who is injured by a public nuisance, either in his person or in his property, cannot have his remedy by action, unless he can show a damage which is peculiar to himself, and different in kind and degree from and beyond that which is sustained by the general public.</p>
    <p id="b211-10" data-blocks='[["BL_211.10",211,[169,1564,1182,262]]]'>The plaintiff contends that the referee erred in his application of this principle to the facts of her case. We do not think so. The injury was one common to all persons who traveled on the road and who resided thereon. The annoyance and inconvenience to some may have been much greater than to others, but it was of the same kind and differed only in degree.</p>
    <p id="b211-11" data-blocks='[["BL_211.11",211,[168,1827,1183,470]]]'>It is significant that no Pennsylvania case has been called to our attention, nor am I aware of any, in which a recovery has been sustained under similar circumstances. The authorities cited for plaintiff, though numerous, do not meet the case. A large number of them were instances in which a traveler had been injured as a consequence of a neglect to keep the highways in repair. No one doubts that a traveler so injured has his remedy against the defaulting municipality for the obvious reason that he has sustained a special injury, not common to others. This principle has been settled by hundreds of decisions in this state and elsewhere.</p>
    <p id="b211-12" data-blocks='[["BL_211.12",211,[168,2304,1183,175]],["BL_212.1",212,[245,421,1185,652]]]'>Nor must we be misled by cases referring to business or trading corporations. They differ from municipal corporations in this that the former are organized for private purposes and for <em>gain; </em>whilst municipal corporations are organized <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>solely for the general good of the people. When a duty is imposed upon a municipal corporation for the benefit of the public, no consideration or benefit is received by such municipality, as in the case of a trading corporation, hence no implication arises of liability to the individual citizen for any injury which he has suffered in common with other citizens resulting from a neglect of such duty. To sustain a contrary doctrine would be disastrous to municipalities, and consequently to the general public. If we once throw open the door to a recovery in such cases, how are we to measure the extent to which a public highway may be out of repair to entitle owners of property abutting thereon to recover damages ? Such questions would have to be referred to a jury whose standard of duty would be as shifting as their verdicts would be uncertain and in many instances oppressive.</p>
    <p id="b212-5" data-blocks='[["BL_212.6",212,[244,1073,1183,395]]]'>The case of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20W.N.C.%20418" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="18 W.N.C. 418">18 W. N. C., 418</a>, cited by the plaintiff, has no application, for the reason that it arose between a private corporation and a citizen. The former was attempting to lay a switch in front of plaintiff’s property, having, as this court held, no authority to do so. The plaintiff claimed and proved a special injury, and the company was enjoined. I refer to this case only as one of many of the .same class, cited by plaintiff, and which are not in point.</p>
