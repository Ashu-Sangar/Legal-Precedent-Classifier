    <p class="summary" id="b167-7" data-blocks='[["BL_167.7",167,[121,713,1192,917]]]'>8. So far we have considered the answers as they stand, but we are also of opinion that the defence set up by them, even if clearly made out, could not be permitted in a court of equity. The Act of 29th April, 1874, grants certain privileges to five or more persons, associated for any of the purposes named in the Act, and the certificate of the respondents alread3r referred to sets forth the names, etc., of six persons, as actually associated for the formation of the defendant corporation. The answers aver boldly that this was done “in order to comply with the requirements of the Act of Assembty,” and go on to say, that complainant (and the three others in like situation) “ had no right or interest in the said shares ” subscribed for, and “simply consented to the use of his name.” The use of his name for what? To make a sham compliance with the requirements of the Act. This defence, if true, was a plain fraud on the law. If the facts as now alleged by the respondents had been truly set forth in their application, the Governor would not have granted them a charter. By joining in an application which set forth the complainant and others, as corporators according to law, the respondents estopped themselves from contesting the truth of that fact.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b167-8" data-blocks='[["BL_167.8",167,[118,1631,1191,695]]]'>It is of no avail to say that many corporations are formed where a few leading corporators hold practically the whole stock. The law does not fix the amount of stock which each must hold, but it does fix explicitly the number who shall unite in the association. By the Act of 13th May, 1876, three persons may form a banking company; by the Act of May 1st of the same 3rear, it requires ten to form an insurance company. The Act of 1874, under which defendant company was chartered, requires five. It is not for the court, still less for these respondents, to say that these requirements are mere formalities, and that a mere nominal compliance will be sufficient. The law fixes the number plainly and imperatively, and, though the interest of some of them may be small, it must be real. Even, therefore, if the agreement set up in the answers were fully proved, the respondents could not be permitted, against the policy of the law, to make it available as a defence.</p>

If this were the law, it would not be difficult for any defendant in equity proceedings to appropriate to himself every advantage of pleading by simply using a little care to frame his answer in confession and avoidance in such a way as to make it appear that it constituted his own version of the same facts as the plaintiff alleged.

The bill ignored it, and the testimony of the appellee denied it. The bold demand of these appellants, then, is, after acknowledging themselves parties to a fraud, that they be permitted to establish by their testimony the fact of the fraud, in order to avail themselves of the benefit of it, as a defence to an honest and legitimate claim of the appellee. They practically concede the righteousness of the appellee’s demand by their assertion that “ each one of the six is liable to the full amount of his subscription.” For it is elementary corporation law that when the corporation may enforce the subscription, the subscriber has a right to his shares — this right of the subscriber constituting in the main the consideration by virtue of which the corporation may enforce his subscription : Taylor on Corporations, section 40, note.</p>
