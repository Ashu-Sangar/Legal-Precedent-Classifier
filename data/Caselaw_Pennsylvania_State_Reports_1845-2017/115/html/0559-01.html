That after she had taught four months she was prevented from teaching the remainder of the term by the defendants informing her, that she had not been employed to teach longer and by their locking the school house against her. The defendants offered evidence to show that her employment was for but four months. The minutes of the defendants did not show any appointment of the plaintiff as a teacher for any term, nor was there any evidence that the plaintiff had been appointed a teacher by the affirmative votes of a majority of tlie whole number of directors, as required by the Act of April 11th, 1862.</p>

Everything proceeded as if she had been regularly employed, and every director would unquestionably have said, if inquiry on the subject had been made, that she had been employed by an authority which the board regarded as sufficient, in fact and in law. Mr. Pethick, through whom the business was conducted on the part of the board, certainly understood that he had authority to employ her — as much authority, in fact, as there was for the employment of any teacher in the district. • ■</p>

Her contention was that she had been duly appointed teacher of the “ Glass Factory ” school for the full term of seven months, and after serving four months, for which she was paid, the School Board unjustly refused to permit her to teach any longer. The refusal of the Board to retain her as a teacher, after the expiration of the first four months, was not controverted; but it was denied that she had ever been employed for the last three months. It was therefore incumbent on her to prove that she had been so employed; and, for that purpose, testimonjq consisting chiefly of loose declarations of members of the School Board, was introduced and submitted to the jury. It is unnecessary to refer specially to the testimony on which she relied. There was nothing in the minutes of the School Board to show that she had been duly appointed teacher for the three months in question. Tested by the ruling of this court in Dennison School District <em>v. </em>Padden, <a href="/pa/89/0395-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="89 Pa. 395" data-case-ids="1063207" data-case-paths="/pa/89/0395-01">supra,</a> the evidence, bearing on the controlling question of fact in issue, was wholly insufficient to warrant the jury in finding any such contract as that alleged by plaintiff below; and defendant’s third point for, charge, viz.: “Under all the evidence in the case, the verdict must be for defendant,” should have been affirmed.</p>
