        "text": "Mr..Justice Sterrett\ndelivered the opinion of the court, March 14th, 1887.\n. Two questions are presented by this record: 1st. Whether the contract, on which suit was brought, is an instrument for the payment of money within the meaning of the affidavit of defence law of March 28th, 1835? 2d. If it is so, does the-affidavit of the company defendant disclose any defence that entitles it to a jury trial?\nThe second section of the Act provides-that, \u201cIn all actions .....on bills, notes, bonds and other instruments for the payment of money and for the recovery of book debts, in all-actions of scire-facias on judgments and on liens of mechanics- and material men,.....it shall be lawful for the plaintiff to enter judgment by default, notwithstanding an appearance by attorney, unless the defendant shall previously have filed an affidavit of defence, stating therein the nature and character\u00f3f the same: provided that, in all such cases, no judgment shall be entered by virtue of this section unless the said plaintiff shall.....have filed, in the office of the prothonotary, a copy of the instrument of writing, book entries, record or claim on which action has been brought.\u201d This is the first legislation on the subject, but the practice of requiring affidavits of defence in certain cases originated as early as 1795, and, under rules of court, adopted with various modifications in nearly every judicial district, has become a most important feature of our civil jurisprudence. An interesting account of the origin and progress of the affidavit of defence system in this state is given by Mr. Endlich in his excellent treatise on \u201cThe Law of Affidavits of Defence\u201d 1, 2 \u00ab\u00ed seq. With comparatively slight modifications in the direction of progress, the practice in the first judicial district, city and county of Philadelphia, has remained in statu quo for over half a centurju During that period, a vast amount of litigation has arisen, under the Act above quoted, not so much as to what constitutes a sufficient affidavit of defence, as in relation to what are \u201cinstruments of writing for the payment of money.\u201d Some of the decisions, adopting a very strict construction of the Act, hold that no' instrument is within its purview that does not, upon its face, exhibit a, prima facie case in favor of plaintiff, \u2014 an instrument which without facts dehors the writing itself would warrant a jury in rendering a verdict in his favor. The logical sequence of this principle would exclude all past due notes except in suits between the payee and maker. If would exclude a negotiable note in suit against an indorser unless a waiver of protest is indorsed thereon by the latter. To avoid this consequence, resort has been had to a \u201c presumption that all-steps have been duly taken which are necessary to fix liability, such as due presentment, demand of payment at the proper time and place, and notice of dishonor:\u201d McConegly v. Kirk, 68 Pa., 200. But why presume rather than aver the existence of facts, dehors the instrument, essential to plaintiff\u2019s right of action ? The latter has certainly all the effect of the former,, with the superadded advantage of express notice to defendant of what he is required to. meet.\nIn other cases, more in harmony with its remedial purposes, the Act has received a more liberal construction. They hold, in substance, that an instrument, if it be for the payment of money, as contradistinguished from one for the performance of any collateral undertaking, though not exhibiting on its face a prima facie right in plaintiff to recover, may be helped out by proper averments of fact, which, coupled with the instrument itself, will warrant a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor. One of these is Bank v. Thayer, 2 W. & S., 443, in which Mr. Justice Rogers, speaking of the provision for entering judgment in default, etc., says: \u201c The instrument of writing has relation to the payment of money, and the paper itself, without extraneous evidence, imports a direct and absolute undertaking to pay. It is true, without the averment or proof of extraneous facts, simple interest could only be recovered; but this cannot alter the case, for otherwise, in certain cases, as suits against indorsers, the holders of bills of exchange and promissory notes would lose the benefit of this provision. In eveiy adjudication on the Act, which is a remedial and a very beneficial one, we have always held that it should be liberally construed. If it be necessary to make averments dehors the instrument on which suit is brought, whether it be note, bill or any other instrument for the payment of money, the fact so set forth may be denied in the affidavit. If not denied, it is admitted, and the court can say with certainty whether, taking the statement with the affidavit, the defendant has any defence to the action.\u201d Again, in Dewey v. Dupuy, Id., 556, Mr. Justice Sergeant, speaking of the instrument sued on, says: \u201cThe contract, on its face, shows a liability to pay money, and it is in the power of the defendant to deny all indebtedness upon it, or to explain the nature of the defence against all and any claim that might arise from the face of the instrument. It would seem as if the legislature intended that the propriety of entering a judgment was to be tested, not so much by the plaintiff\u2019s claim as by the defendant\u2019s affidavit, which is, on that account, required to state specifically the nature and character of the defence.\u201d In Sutton v. Athletic Club, 4 W. N. C., the learned president of Common Pleas, No. 4, of Philadelphia, in a well considered opinion, held in substance that every written agreement, by which a man binds himself to the payment of a certain sum of money, is within the Act, if, when suit is brought, the time of payment is elapsed, and the defendant will be put to his affidavit of defence, although the payment of the money was, when the contract was made, dependent on the future performance of acts by the plaintiff. In same case he also remarks: \u201cIt has been sometimes said, perhaps without sufficient consideration of the progress of the law, that executory agreements are not within the affidavit of defence law, but an examination of- the eases will show that such a proposition is altogether untenable : \u201d and cases are there cited in support of his position.\nIn Matthews v. Sharp, 99 Pa., 560, the point was made that the agreement in suit was executory and, therefore, not within the affidavit of defence law, and could not be helped out by plaintiff\u2019s averment that \u201che was ready and offered to perform his covenants in the said agreement,\u201d etc. But the position was treated by this court as untenable, and the judgment in favor of plaintiff was affirmed. That case arose under rule of the Common Pleas of Chester county adopting the affidavit of defence Act under consideration. Other cases might be cited in support of the more liberal and, as we think, proper construction of the Act, but it is unnecessary to refer to them. The Statute is undoubtedly remedial, \u2014 intended to prevent vexatious and useless delay and expense in the administration of justice, and thus facilitate the collection of pecuniary claims, founded on written instruments, in cases where the defendant has no meritorious or available defence. In view of this, it should be liberally construed..\nThis action was brought on a contract between the city of Philadelphia, acting through the commissioners for the erection of the public buildings, of the first part, and the legal plaintiffs, of the second part, in connection with the contract of defendant company indorsed thereon. By the terms of the principal contract, the legal plaintiffs agree to grade and pave the roadways surrounding the new city hall, including Broad street from south curb on Penn square to north line of passenger railway track on Chestnut street, for a specified sum per yard, one fifth thereof to be paid by defendant company as per its contract, and the residue by the city. 'Defendant company\u2019s indorsed contract is as follows: \u201cThe Philadelphia Traction Company assent to the terms and conditions of the within contract, and agree to wholly assume, be responsible for and pay to the parties of the second part the one fifth of the cost of grading and paving the whole of the roadways surrounding the new city hall, and the one fifth part of the cost of grading Broad street from the south line of the curb on Perin square to the north line of the passenger railway track on Chestnut street, as within provided.\u201d Among other things, it is therein provided that the- architect of the commis.sioneVs shall be the arbiter \u201cas to the character of the work done,' or materials furnished\u201d under the contract, his decision \u201cin every event to be final, binding and conclusive on- the parties hereto.\u201d Copies of the foregoing contracts were duly filed by plaintiffs in connection with their averment to the effect that the total cost of grading and paving the roadways surrounding the Hall, at $3.5Q per square yard, was $62,571.32, and the total cost of grading Broad street, at 62 cents per cubic yard, $771.59, in all, $63,342.91; that defendant company agreed to pay one fifth thereof, $12,668.58, but refused to do -so, and the same has been paid to said legal plaintiffs by the city of Philadelphia.\n' The first ground of defence presented in defendant\u2019s affidavit is that the contract, a copy of which was filed, \u201cis not such an instrument of writing as entitles the plaintiff -to have and require of the said defendant an affidavit of defence thereto.\u201d\nIn his opinion, discharging the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, the learned judge says: \u201cThe instrument sued on in the present case is an agreement to pay for work to be done thereafter. On the face of the paper there is no proof that the work was ever done at all, and the proof cannot be supplied by an averment.\u201d\nAs we have seen, the application of this rigid rule would exclude bills of exchange, negotiable notes, etc., in suits against parties secondarily liable thereon. There is nothing in the phraseology of the Act, requiring that every fact necessary to entitle plaintiff to recover, should appear on the face of the instrument. The \u201cpractical formula,\u201d referred to by the learned judge, viz.: \u201c Whether the instrument itself makes so complete a case that a jury can give a verdict upon it alone without other evidence,\u201d is wholly unwarranted; and, if sanctioned, would so curtail and cripple the operation of the Act as to render it comparatively valueless. It follows that the reason assigned for discharging the rule is erroneous.\nThe only remaining question is whether the affidavit of defence contains any averment of fact that entitles defendant to a jury trial.\nIt is not denied that the work of grading and paving, referred to in the contract, was done, nor that the contract price and amount thereof are correct^ stated in plaintiff\u2019s averment, nor that the character of the work done and materials furnished were duh' approved b3r the architect of the commission, and the proper certificate issued to the legal plaintiffs, nor that defendant company refused to pay its proportion of the cost of the work, and that the same was thereupon paid by the use plaintiff; but the affidavit does aver that the work was not \u201c completed in accordance with the said contract and specifications,\u201d and then proceeds to say that five samples of asphalt, taken from said pavement, were left with \u201c an expert to determine if the pavement was laid of the quality and kind required by said contract and specifications.\u201d This is followed by a copy of the expert\u2019s analysis of three of the specimens submitted to him, showing a deficiency of carbonate of lime and an excess of sand. To that is added an averment that defendant believes and expects to be able to prove the facts set forth in.the analysis are true. The affidavit then concludes as fol\u2022lows: \u201cDefendant is advised that, as said roadway is not substantially conformable to said contract and specifications and does not constitute an equivalent, no liability to pay for the same arises on the contract entered into by said defendant.\u201d In this connection, however, defendant\u2019s belief \u201cthat no liability to pay\u201d arises, etc., is not averred. It is one thing for a defendant to say he is advised or informed that certain facts exist, and that they create no liability; but it is quite a different thing for him to swear that he believes and expects to be able to prove they are true and constitute a valid defence.\nIt will be observed that the alleged defence on the merits is grounded solely on the allegation of deficiency in one of the ingredients and excess in another, as reported by the expert. But of what consequence is that, if the work done and materials furnished were approved by the architect? As we have seen, the architect of the commission is made sole arbiter as to the character of the work done and materials furnished, and his decision is expressly declared, \u201c under all circumstances and in every event to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties.\u201d This being one of the \u201cterms and conditions\u201d to which the company defendant assented, how can it expect to evade the consequences of its covenant without such an averment of facts as will entitle it to go behind the approval of the architect and acceptance of the work, as having been performed according to the terms of the contract? It had no right to silently wait until the work was finished, approved by the party designated for that purpose, and taken off the hands of the contractors, and then, on some frivolous pretext, refuse to pay its proportion of the cost.\nIn view of the provisions of the contract to which defendant is a party, there is nothing in the affidavit of defence, assuming it all to be true, that entitles the company to a jury trial.\nJudgment reversed, and record remitted to the court below with directions to enter judgment against defendant, as to right and justice may belong, unless other legal or equitable cause be shown to said court why such judgment should not be entered.",

A written contract to do certain work, according to plans and specifications which are made a part thereof, for a definite sum \u2014 in this case paving at a fixed price per square yard \u2014 filed in an action thereon, with averments of the plaintiff specifying that the work has been done according to the contract, the amount of such work, and the sum due the plaintiff therefor, entitles the plaintiff to judgment for want of an affidavit of defence.\n2. Where one of the conditions of a contract is, that the decision of the architect shall be final and conclusive on the parties, and he has decided that the work done under the contract, was done according to the terms of the same, an affidavit of defence averring that the work was not so done, without specifying any reason requiring the decision of the architect to be set aside, is not a sufficient affidavit of defence to prevent judgment being entered.\n3. An instrument in writing is within the affidavit of defence law, if it be for the payment of money, as contradistinguished from one for the performance of any collateral undertaking, though not exhibiting on its face a, prima facie right in the plaintiff to recover, if supplemented with such averments of facts as with the instrument itself would warrant a verdict for the plaintiff.\nJanuary 26th, 1887.\nBefore Mercur, C. J., Gordon, Paxson, Trunkey, Sterrett, and Green, JJ., Clark, J., absent.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas, No. 2, of Philadelphia county: Of January Term 1887, No. 72.\nThis was an action of covenant brought by The Vulcanite Paving Company of Philadelphia, and The Barber Asphalt Paving Company of Washington, D. C., to the use of the city of Philadelphia against the Philadelphia Traction Company.\nThe following are the facts of the case as they appeared in the court below :\nOn October 15th, 1884, the city of Philadelphia by their agents, the commissioners for the erection of the public buildings, made a contract with The Vulcanite Paving Company, of Philadelphia, and The Barber Asphalt Paving Company, of Washington, D. C., by which said paving companies agreed to \u201cgrade and pave the whole of the roadways surrounding the.new city hall, furnishing all the materials and labor complete, including Broad street from the south line of the curb on Penn square to tbe north line of the passenger railway track on Chestnut street.\u201d\nThe said pavement was to be of Trinidad asphalt, upon a hydraulic concrete base eight inches in thickness, with gutters eighteen inches in width of Ne\u00fcchatel asphalt, and the work and materials were to be done and furnished according to certain specifications annexed to the contract.\nBy the terms of the contract the work to be done and the materials furnished were to be subject to the approval of the architect and the superintendent of the public buildings, and payments made for the said work upon bills certified by the architect and superintendent and the chief commissioner of highways, as shown by the following paragraph of the contract :\n7. All the said work is to be done and materials furnished under this contract to the entire satisfaction and acceptance of the architect and superintendent; and either the said architect or superintendent is to have full and absolute power and authority, from time to time, and at any time, to reject any work done or materials furnished under this contract, which they or either of them may think not properly done or unfit; and the said parties of the second part agree forthwith, at their own cost and expense, to do over again any and all such work, and replace all such materials so rejected; and in case of neglect or refusal by the said parties of the second part to do over again and replace the same respectively, the said architect or superintendent are hereby authorized and empowered, upon or after the third day after notice of any such rejection, to cause the same to be done over again and replaced respectively, and to charge the cost and expenses of and attendant upon such doing over and replacing to the said parties of the second part; and the amount so charged is to be retained and deducted from the payment and payments due said parties of the second part under this contract, next after any and every such doing over again and replacing.\nThe decision of the architect, as to the character of the work \u2022 done or materials furnished, as above provided, and his consequent rejection thereof, is, under all circumstances, and in every event, to be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.\nFor this work the city of Philadelphia agreed to pay The Vulcanite Paving Company and The Barber Asphalt Paving Company at the rate of three dollars and fifty cents per square yard.\nThe Philadelphia Traction Company, desiring this pavement to be laid around the buildings, agreed to pay the one fifth part of the cost thereof, and accordingly, on the sixteenth day of - October, 1884, executed a contract indorsed upon the contract between the city and the paving companies as follows:\nThe Philadelphia Traction Company assent to the terms and conditions of the within contract, and agree to wholly assume, be responsible for, and pay to the parties of the second part-the one fifth part of the cost of grading and paving the whole of the roadways surrounding the new city hall, and the one fifth part of the cost of grading Broad street, from the south line of the curb on Penn square to the north line of the passenger railway track on Chestnut street, as within provided. In witness whereof, they have hereunto, by their president affixed their corporate seal, attested by their secretary, this sixteenth day of October, A. D. 1884.\nThe plaintiff filed in the case a copy of the contract and the following averment:\nThat the total cost of grading and paving the whole of the roadway surrounding the new city hall was 17,877.52.square yards, at $3.50 per square yard, $62,571.32.\nThat the total cost of grading Broad street, from the south line of the curb on Penn square to the north line of the passenger railway track on Chestnut street, 1244^- cubic yards, at 62 cents per cubic yard, $771.59.\nThat the defendant, the Philadelphia Traction Company, by its contract, agreed to pay to the Vulcanite Paving Company and the Barber Asphalt Paving Company the one fifth part of the cost of grading and paving the whole of the roadway surrounding the new city hall, and the one fifth part of the cost of grading Broad street, from the south line of the. curb on Penn' square to the' north line of the passenger railway track on Chestnut street, the said one fifths amounting to twelve thousand six hundred and sixty-eight dollars and fifty-eight cents ($12,668.58), which said sum the Philadelphia Traction Company refused to pay, and the said sum was paid by the city of Philadelphia to the said Vulcanite Paving Company and the Barber Asphalt Paving Company.\n. That the said work has been entirely completed, in accordance with the said contract and specifications.- And the said Vulcanite Paving Company and the Barber Asphalt Paving Company having assigned their claim against the Philadelphia Traction Company to the city of Philadelphia, the said the city of Philadelphia brings suit to recover the said amount, to wit, twelve thousand six hundred and sixty-eight dollars and fifty-eight cents ($12,668.58). . .\nThe defendant filed the following affidavit of defence.\n\u2022 That said defendant is advised that said copy is not such an instrument of writing as entitles the plaintiff to have and require of the said defendant an affidavit of defence thereto, but without waiver of this objection on behalf of said defendant this deponent saith,\nThat it is not true, as in said averment set forth, that said work referred to in said contract has been entirely completed in accordance with the said contract and specifications, but on the contrary, this deponent avers that after said alleged completion of said work defendant had five samples \u25a0 of asphalt taken from said pavement around the city hall. These samples were left with Charles M. Cresson, an expert, to determine if the pavement was laid of the quality and kind required by said contract and specifications.\nThe said Cresson made a report in writing, of which the following is a copy:\nHere follows the report at length concluding as follows:\nThere is, then, a deficiency of over 66 per cent, in the amount of carbonate of lime required and an excess of over 11 per cent, in the amount of sand allowed, based upon the maximum percentage set out in the specification. It is evident from this statement that the three samples of asphalt surfacing analyzed vary materially in composition from that one which would result from the use of the formula; that is, they are not compounded in the manner specified, and do not constitute an equivalent asphaltic surfacing with that required by the specification. Charles M. Cresson, M. D.\nAnd deponent saith he believes the facts set forth in the above and foregoing analysis to be true, and that the defendant will be able to prove the same to be true on the trial of this case.\nAnd deponent further saith that the defendant is advised that as said roadway is not substantially conformable to the said contract and specifications, and does not constitute an equivalent, that no liability to pay for the same arises on the covenant entered into by the said defendant.\nA rule was entered to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nThis rule the court, Mitchell, J., discharged, filing the following opinion:\nIn view of the number of separate courts in this county and the consequent difficulties of practitioners, it becomes specially important that settled practice should not be departed from. For that reason, this court has uniformly resisted the efforts to enlarge the operation of averments supplementary to copies of instruments filed, to obtain judgment for want of affidavits of defence.\nAs said by Chief Justice Sharswood, in Ins. Co. \u00b6. Brierly (10 Weekly Notes 45), \u201cIt doubtless would be very convenient for plaintiffs to obtain judgment by filing averments \u201d in addition to the instrument itself. But it is always to be remembered that the question is not whether the plaintiff has a good cause of action, but whether he has a complete case on the face of the instrument. It was accordingly settled many years ago in Imhoff v. Brown (6 Casey, 506), that averments are not permissible to enlarge or complete the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the practical formula established in the late District Court, where nearly all such questions arose, was whether the instrument itself makes so complete a case that a jury can give a verdict upon it alone without other evidence.\nThis general rule has been repeated in many cases, of which, however, ifc is sufficient to refer to only a few. In Lasb v. Von Neida (42 Leg. Int. 172, 16 Weekly Notes 93), it was held that averments of payment of interest within twenty years would not make out a case against the presumption of payment, Paxson, J., saying, \u201cThe credits are no part of the bond, and are not evidence of such payments until proved.\u201d In Ins. Co. v. Brierly, above quoted, the practical rule of the District Court is cited with approval by the Supreme Court as a settled rule. This ought to be conclusive of the present case. Calhoun v. Monongahela Building Association (8 Out., 392), though upon a somewhat different'class of instruments, is a very strong illustration of the limits in the office of an averment, as the rule of court allowed the copy of the instrument to be supplemented by an averment, notwithstanding which the Supreme Court reversed the court below on the application of its own rule.\nThe instrument sued on in the present case is an agreement to pay for work to be done thereafter. On the face of the paper there is no proof that the work ever was done at all, and this proof cannot be supplied by an averment.\nRule discharged. Exception by plaintiffs to ruling and decision of the court.\nThe plaintiff thereupon took this writ assigning for error the action of the court in discharging said rule.\nSamuel Peltz, solicitor of Commissioners for the erection of the Public Buildings, for plaintiff in error.\n\u2014 In stating that the instrument was for the payment of money in future, and, therefore could not require an affidavit of defence, the court evidently took the ground that the instrument was an executory contract, and, therefore, not within the affidavit rule.\nThis certainly was error, for it has been laid down by Judge Thayer, in a very thorough and exhaustive opinion in the case of Sutton v. Athletic Club, 4 W. N., 90 (which case has been considered a leading one and has been affirmed by the Supreme Court in Matthews v. Sharp, 3 Outerbridge, 560), that just such cases as the present one did come within the affidavit of defence law.\nHe also cited Dewey v. Depuy, 2 W. & S., 556; Montgomery v. Johnson, 1 Miles, 324; Rile v. Worl, 1 Phila., 45.\nThe averment sets forth compliance with the contract by the plaintiffs, i. e., the completion of the work and default by the defendants, i. e., the refusal to pay for the work done, and liquidates the sum which the defendants agreed to pay, by setting forth the exact amount of the one fifth of the cost of the work. And that is all that the averment does; it does not attempt to enlarge the plaintiff\u2019s claim or to allege any facts against the defendants, outside of the contract sued on. It simply follows tlie law laid down in other, cases, in which averments, alleging the same matters, have been allowed, and does not in any manner attempt to establish any liability of the defendants, for the liability was fixed by the contract itself, independent of any averment which was or could have been filed in this case: Fertig v. Maley, 5 W. N. C., 133; Johnson et al. v. Cowan, 9 P. F. S., 275; Bank v. Thayer, 2 W. & S., 443; Ourhoff v. Brown, 6 Casey, 504; Dickerson v. MoCausland, 3 W. N. C., 327; Kerns v. Life Ins. Co., 86 Pa. St., 171; Journal of Commerce v. Reever, 17 W. N. C., 222; Leonhardt & Son v. Curtiss, 18 Id., 63.\nThe only defence which the defendant attempts to make is to a part of the pavement; that is, to the asphalt surfacing. There is nothing in the affidavit of defence, nor in the analysis, which alleges that either the grading on Broad street, south of the curb line on Penn square, or the grading, or the hydraulic concrete base of the roadways around the buildings, was not properly done; in fact there is nothing said in the affidavit about the grading or concrete base, which, formed a. very large part of the work and material, under the contract for the one fifth of the cost of which defendant promised to pay.. And. it cannot be inferred' that it was not done in accordance with the contract, but, on the contrary, it is to be presumed that it was properly done. Whatever is not said in an affidavit of defence is taken not to exist': Lord v. Ocean Bank, 8 H., 381: Gould v. Bush, 13 W. N. C., 29; Watson v. Galloway, 1 W. N. C., 109.\nDavid -W. Sellers, for defendant in error. \u2014 Submitted no paper-book, but relied upon the opinion of the court below."
