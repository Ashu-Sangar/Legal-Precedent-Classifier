        "text": "Mr. Justice Sterrett\ndelivered the opinion of the court, January 3d, 1887\u00bb\nAppellants are not in a position to question the correctness of the learned auditor\u2019s findings of fact, or to claim the existence of facts which they allege the testimony would have warranted him in finding, for the reason that they have not excepted to his report on either of these grounds. It is not our province to examine the .testimony in search of facts, if any there be, which should have been found by him and incorporated in his report. The burden is therefore on them to show that, upon the facts set forth in the Auditor\u2019s.report, there is manifest error in the decree. This they have failed to do.\nAfter describing the premises against which the mechanics\u2019 liens were filed, the improvements thereon, and the relation that each of these sustains to the others, as essential parts of the plant operated by \u201c The Sieman\u2019s-Anderson Steel Company,\u201d the Auditor finds that,-in July, 1881, the corporation \u201c in contemplation of a second train of rolls and increased capacity, and not having sufficient power, determined to put in four new boilers, which, with the four old ones, made a battery of eight boilers. This was done by changing the position of the old boilers from parallel with the \u201c Rod Mill,\u201d and placing all the boilers at right angles thereto; the boiler-room and masonry being changed to conform tp this new arrangement of the boilers. The boilers were then used to generate steam to run the whole works.\u201d\n\u201c In September, 1881, \u2018 Open-Hearth Furnace, No. 2,\u2019and building covering it, a portion of roof of \u2018 Open-Hearth Furnace, No. 1,\u2019 and part of the roof of the \u2018 Rod Mill,\u2019 were destroyed by fire. The corporation commenced immediately to rebuild the parts destroyed by fire, and to make other alterations, repairs and additions, which are mentioned and described in the mechanics\u2019 liens filed therefor.\u201d\n\u201cAfter the fire the \u2018New Hose-carriage House\u2019 and a new \u2018 Electric Engine House \u2019 were built, and a portion of building Mused for \u2018Open-hearth Furnace, No. 2,\u2019 was rebuilt.\u201d The changes and alterations undertaken with the view of increasing the capacity and power of the mill, and the repairs rendered necessary by the' fire,' appear to have been both in progress after the fire. The items in claims filed, which were charged before the fire amounted, as found by the Auditor, to $7,110.26, and those charged after the fire to $13,581.43, making in all $20,691.69, the aggregate of mechanics\u2019 liens filed. The dates of all the items in the respective claims are between July 1st, 1881, and January 10th, 1882.\nIt thus appears that prior to the fire extensive alterations and repairs were made for the purpose of> increasing the capacity of the mill, and after the fire \u201cother alterations, repairs and additions mentioned and described in the mechanics\u2019 liens filed therefor,\u201d were made.\nAfter stating what the \u201c Wire Mill,\u201d \u201c Open-hearth Furnace \u201d and \u201c Universal Mill \u201d consisted of, etc., the Auditor, in view of what had been done in the way of alterations and repairs to several parts of the plant, came to the conclusion \u201cthat there was no such change in the general appearance of the buildings as they were before the fire, as would authorize a lien for a new construction or erection \u201d ; but he found that the alterations, additions and repairs, made to the building and motive power, were such as to render new machinery and alterations in old machinery necessary, and as a whole entitle most of the mechanics\u2019 lien claimants to participate in the fund.\nIn that connection he also came to the conclusion \u201cthat it would 'be sticking in the bark to say that a battery of boilers, embedded in brick, stone and mortar, a furnace-chimney or stack forty-eight feet high, built on firm foundation and extending up through the roof, the engines, cranes, wire mills, furnaces, trains and other fixtures firmly attached, and all part of the realty, and all together constituting one plant, are no part of the building, the word \u2018 building \u2019 meaning only the iron-clad frames and sheds which cover the plant.\u201d In this we fully concur with the Auditor; and also think he was correct in holding that the alterations, additions and repairs which were made were such as entitled the parties who furnished materials and labor therefor to a lien.\nIn accordance with his previous conclusions, the Auditor proceeded to consider separately each of the mechanic\u2019s claims. Only three of these are involved in this contention.\nAs to the claim of W. H. Riddle, he finds it is \u201c for cast-iron floor plates which were used for making floors in said plant,\u201d amounting to $764.65 with interest from January 17th, 1882.\nHe further finds that the claim of A. Fulton\u2019s Son & Co. is for \u201c pipes, gas fixtures, valves, brass steam and gas fittings, and other machinery and materials, and work done on the same, the greater part of which, $1,295.24, was for new machinery, rendered necessary by change in the plant; $5.50 for repairs, and $200.83 for alterations.\nHe also finds the claim of Robinson, Rea & Co. is a joint and several apportioned one for materials furnished to \u201cWire Mill\u2019\u2019from July 18th to December 28th, 1881, $1,556.20; to \u201c Open-hearth Furnace,\u201d from August 13th to December 31st, 1881, $696.67; to \u201c Universal Mill,\u201d from July 2d, 1881 to January 3d, 1882, $4,971.78. He further finds that these materials consisted of brass fittings, shafting, furnace plates, damper and frames for furnace stack, rollers, plates and other articles furnished respectively to the wire mill, and other parts of the plant, and for work and labor in putting them in their proper places.\nWhile the learned Auditor is perhaps not as explicit as he might have been, we understand him to mean that the materials furnished and work done by each of the respective lien claimants above mentioned, were done and furnished in and' about the alterations, additions and repairs mentioned in previous part.of his report, and for which he concluded, as we think rightly, that the respective claimants were entitled to a lien.\nThere is no merit in the objection to the phraseology of Robinson, Rees & Co.\u2019s lien. The words \u201cerection and construction\u201d do not vitiate the lien. They may well be treated as surplusage. Utile per inutile non vitiatur.\nAs already intimated all the essential conclusions of the learned Auditor appear to be correct, and hence there is no error in the decree. \u25a0\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of appellants.",

    "head_matter": "Appeal of Dickey, et. al.\n1. A battery of boilers, embedded in brick, stone, and mortar; a furnace chimney or stack, built on firm foundations, and extending up through the roof; the engines, cranes, wire mills furnace trains, and other fixtures, firmly attached, all part of the realty, and all together constituting one plant, are 'part of the building the alterations, additions and repairs to which entitle the parties who furnished the material and labor therefor, to a mechanic\u2019s lien.\n2. One who fails to file exceptions to the report of an Auditor questioning the correctness of his findings, or claiming the existence of facts which \u25a0 he alleges the evidence would have warranted him in finding, cannot except to the report on these grounds on an appeal to the Supreme Court. It is not the province of that court to examine the testimony in search of facts if any there be, which should have been found by the Auditor, \u25a0 and incorporated in his report.\n3. A mechanic\u2019s lien filed for \u201c construction and erection, alteration of, and addition to,\u201d a building when the claim is for alterations, additions and repairs, is not vitiated by the words, \u201c erection and construction.\u201d Utile per inutile non vitiatur.\nNovember 16th, 1886.\nBefore Gordon, Paxson, Teunkey, Sterrett, Green and Clark, JJ. Mercur, C. J., absent.\nAppeal from the Court of Common Pleas, No. 1, of Allegheny county: Of October Term 1886, No. 215.\nAppeal by O. C. Dicke}7 and W. A. Shaw, judgment lien creditors of the Siemens Anderson Steel Company, from a decree of said court distributing the fund arising from the sheriff sale of the steel mills of said company to the mechanics\u2019 lien, creditors of said company, filed for alterations, additions and repairs to said mills.\nThe court appointed Archibald McBride, Esquire, Auditor, to make distributions of said fund. The question before him was, whether the mechanics\u2019 lien creditors, who were prior lien creditors in point of time to the judgment lien creditors, should participate in the distribution; the judgment lien creditors claiming that the work and material furnished by them in the alterations, additions and repairs of the stgel plant of the said company, did not entitle them to a lien. The Auditor reported inter alia:\nYour Auditor is of the opinion that such alterations, additions and repairs were made to the building and motive power,' which rendered new machinery and alterations in the old machinery necessary, as will entitle most of the mechanics\u2019 lien claimants to a lien under Act of May 1st, 1861, P. L., 550, Burden, 1161.\n.Your Auditor is of opinion tlmt it would be \u201csticking in the bark,\u201d to say that a battery of boilers embedded in brick, stone and mortar, a furnace chimney or stack 48 feet high, built oh firm found ationand extending up through the roof, the engines, cranes, furnaces, wire mills, trains and other fixtures firmly attached, and all part of the realty, and all together constituting one plant, are no part of the building, the word building meaning only the iron-clad frames and sheds which co.ver the plant.\nHe therefore reported distribution to the mechanics\u2019 lien creditors, and the remainder of the fund to the judgmentlien creditors in the order of their priority. The appellees were not reached in the distribution. They accordingly filed exceptions to such distribution. These exceptions were dismissed, and the report confirmed. They thereupon took this appeal, and assigned for error the decree of the court in dismissing their exceptions aud confirming the report. All other facts in the case sufficiently appear in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nGeorge Shims, Jr., for appellants.\n\u2014 This case falls within the decision of the court in Hasl\u00e9tt v. Gillespie, et al., 14 Norris, 371, where it was held that where new' machinery is furnished for and placed in an old mill, the party supplying the same is not entitled to a mechanics\u2019 lien against the building : Ely v. Wren, 9 Norris, 145. A mechanics\u2019 claim for work done and materials furnished in and about the erection, construction, improvement, and fittting up of the said buildings for the use for which they were constructed will not sustain a lien for repairs and additions: Wetmore\u2019s Appeal, 10 Norris, 276 ; Ryud v. Bakewell, 6 Norris, 468.\nAnd, again, the lien is filed against the entire premises, whereas it should have been specified against the erection for which the floor-plates were furnished, to wit: the \u201cwire mill and blooming mill \u201d : Wharton Bros. v. Douglas, 11 Norris, 66*\nThe judgment upon the scire facias issued by Riddle is not even prima facie evidence as against the other creditors.\nOn a question of distribution of the-proceeds'of a sheriff\u2019s sale, each claimant must establish his claim by proof as against the other: Dempel\u2019s Estate, 1 Pearson, 213.\nThe lien of \u00abRobinson, Rees & Co. is filed for \u201cconstruction and erection, alteration of and additions to\u201d the building in question. It cannot therefore be maintained.\nThomas Mellon (J. S. StrieJcler with him) for W. H. Riddle, one of the appellees.\nGeorge B. Gordon (John Balzelle with him), for Robinson, Rees & Co., one of the appellees.\nThere can be no question but what these items, covered by our lien, became, both in fact and . in contemplation of law, part of the building: Schenk \u00ab. Uber & Tees, 31 P. F-. S., 34; Voorhees \u00ab. Freeman, 2 Watts & S., 116 : pleaton \u00ab. Find-lay, 2 Jones, 304; Gray \u00ab. Holdship, 17 S. & R., 413; Morgan v. Arthurs, 3 Watts, 140; Wademan v. Thorp, 5 Watts, 115; Schenk \u00ab. Uber & Tees, 31 P. F. S., 34; Parrish & Hazzard\u2019s Appeal, 2 Norris, 111.\nThis being so, a lien will lie under the Act of May 1, 1861, P. L, 550.\nIt is argued that our lien is invalid because it is filed for \u201cthe erection and construction of the buildings, and the repairs, alterations thereof and addition thereto.\u201d We dJ not deny that it is law as. stated in the cases cited by them, that if jrou file a lien for erection- you cannot recover for repairs, because you have made no claim therefor, and there is a fatal variance between the allegata and the- probata. But it is just as true that if you decl\u00e1re on both, you can recover on whichever you prove. The court will treat the rest as surplusage : Fisher \u00ab. Rush, 21 P. F. S., 40; Appeal of Paul Faust, 2 Pennypacker, 199."
