The petition prayed the court to enter a decree discharging him at his own request. The trustee filed an answer averring that while he formerly desired to be discharged he had since been advised and believed that it was to the best interest of the estate that he should continue as executor and trustee. A replication was thereupon filed denying that it was to the best interest of the estate that the trustee should continue to act, and averring actual or prospective insolvency of the trustee, and also mismanagement. <em>Held, </em>(1) that this was bad practice; that instead of filing a replication averring new matter, the petitioners should have asked leave to amend their petition by inserting therein other grounds for the trustee’s discharge; (2) that the trustee, by acquiescing in the proceeding and by <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>taking testimony upon the consideration of which the court discharged him, could not after entry of the final decree against him take advantage of the irregularity in the proceedings; (8) that merely verbal objections to the irregularity without any objection filed of record would be of no avail to help him after final decree.</p>

T. Brooks, the executor therein named, she devised to her daughter Amanda for life and after her death to the children of said Amanda.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b383-11" data-blocks='[["BL_383.17",383,[158,1829,1171,439]]]'>Upon a sale of said property the will provides as follows: “ And after such sale my said executor shall invest the money so realized from the sale of the said real estate in other real estate, well situated or located — the location to be satisfactory to my daughter Amanda, and of the new property purchased with the proceeds of the old, my daughter shall have the use and income as of the one sold during her natural lifetime as aforesaid, and after her death the sale (same) shall descend to and vest in her child or children.”</p>

B.

[Upon the petition and answer alone the court would not be justified in dismissing the executor, but the replication which is responsive to the answer we think is sufficient to warrant us to consider the testimony bearing upon the question of mismanagement.] [8]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.7",384,[263,1155,1163,452]]]'>The testimony supports the facts above stated. The mismanagement of a testamentary trustee cannot be overlooked any more than that of a trustee appointed by the court. The loan on personal security of a part of the proceeds of the sale of the first house in violation of the directions in the will to invest in other real estate, the use of a part of the trust funds in his own business, and the somewhat hostile relations existing between the executor and the cestui que trust are matters that make it the duty of the court to intervene.</p>

    <p id="b385-7" data-blocks='[["BL_385.10",385,[163,740,1173,1116]]]'>In their petition for the discharge of appellant as trustee etc., the appellees aver that in his second and final account filed, appellant expressed his desire to be discharged etc., and pray the court to enter a decree discharging him at his own request. In his answer, appellant avers that while he then desired to be discharged, or intended making an application for his discharge, he has since been advised and believes that it is to the best interest of the estate that he should continue as executor and trustee. A replication was thereupon filed by the appellees denying that it is to the best interest of the estate that appellant should continue to act, etc., and, in support thereof, they aver actual or prospective insolvency of appellant, mismanagement, etc. This was bad practice. Instead of filing a replication, and averring therein new matter as ground for appellant’s discharge, they should have asked leave to amend their petition by inserting therein other grounds for appellant’s discharge; or the appellant might have moved to strike out the irrelevant matter. But, so far as the record shows, neither party attempted to correct the pleadings. On the contrary, they acquiesced therein, and proceeded to take testimony, upon consideration of which the court found such gross mismanagement, on the part of appellant, as clearly justified his removal from office.</p>

It is idle to say that he objected to the proceeding. If he had done so in the proper way, the fact should appear of record. Merely verbal objections, without more, would of course be of no avail.</p>
