My son shall be charged $4,500 for the farm, and $200 for the woodland. F. shall pay annually to my beloved wife the sum of $50.” He gave to his son C. certain land “ reckoned to him ” at $5,000 and directed him to pay the widow $50 annually. He further directed: “ The real estate bequeathed to my sons F. and C. shall be for their, use and support during their natural lives, and at their death shall descend to their children, if any; if no children, then to descend to the brothers and sisters and their children.” Devises to testator’s daughters, coupled with similar charges, were of absolute estates. <em>Held, </em>thatF. took an estate in fee simple in the land devised to him.</p>

D. 2103, P. L. 11, and because of the charge made for its value: Fahrney v. Holsinger, <a href="/pa/65/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="65 Pa. 388" data-case-ids="430650" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0388-01">65 Pa. 388</a>. That being so, and it being, of course, conceded that an absolute gift in one part of a will may be cut down to a life estate by a subsequent clause, Shalters v. Ladd, <a href="/pa/141/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="141 Pa. 349" data-case-ids="974870" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0349-01">141 Pa. 349</a>, evidencing a clear intention to do so, Micldey’s App., <a href="/pa/92/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="92 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="491071" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0514-01">92 Pa. 514</a>, the question arises, what, in view of the whole will, is the effect of the provision last above quoted ? It is the law of this state that any form of words sufficient to show that the remainder is to go by way of descent to those whom the law points out as the general or lineal heirs of the first taker will enlarge the estate for life of the first taker to an estate tail by implication: Potts’ App., <a href="/citations/?q=30%20Pa.%20170" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="30 Pa. 170">30 Pa. 170</a>; Yarnall’s App., <a href="/pa/70/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="70 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1028227" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0335-01">70 Pa. 335</a>, — a fee simple under our statute. The direction here is, that, upon Francis’ or Charles’ death, the lands devised to either shall “ descend ” to their “children,” and “if no children” to the brothers and sisters and their “ children.” Technically that word is one of purchase and not of limitation: Oyster v. Oyster, <a href="/pa/100/0538-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="100 Pa. 538" data-case-ids="498384" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0538-01">100 Pa. 538</a>. But that it may be construed as a word of limitation where there is anything in the language of the testator clearly inviting such construction cannot be doubtful, since the decision in Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>. The testator uses the word three times in the same clause. The third time he manifestly means issue, the whole line of succession; for there is no limitation over indicating anything short of that. Presumably, he used the same word in the same sense throughout the clause. Moreover, he says that upon the death of the first takers the lands devised to them respectively shall “ descend ” to their children. The word “ descend ” ordinarily denotes the vesting of an estate by operation of law in the heirs immediately upon the death of the ancestor: Dove v. Torr, <a href="/mass/128/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="128 Mass. 38" data-case-ids="726516" data-case-paths="/mass/128/0038-01">128 Mass. 38</a>, and its use is referred to in Haldeman v. Haldeman, <a href="/pa/40/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="40 Pa. 29" data-case-ids="478140" data-case-paths="/pa/40/0029-01">40 Pa. 29</a>, as indicative of the character in which the remaindermen are to take, viz: by <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>inheritance from the first taker and not as a new stock, — thus pointing to the first taker as vested with an estate of inheritance and to the construction of the word “ children ” as a word of limitation. If, however, that word is used in the sense of heirs of the body, or issue, then the phrase, “ and if no children,” imports an indefinite failure of issue: Armstrong v. Michener, <a href="/pa/160/0021-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="160 Pa. 21" data-case-ids="852173" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0021-01">160 Pa. 21</a>, and the first takers have the entire fee. This interpretation of the provision in question, it may be added, is not only strengthened, but seems to be required by the declared intention of the testator, that all of his children shall take equal shares under his will, read together with the direction designed to serve that purpose, charging the sons, in the distribution, with the value 'of the fee of the land devised to them. The devises to the daughters, coupled with similar charges, are all of absolute estates, and the scheme of equality requires that those to the sons should be likewise so regarded.</p>
