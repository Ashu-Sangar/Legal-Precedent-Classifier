You will have to decide it, gentlemen, in the light of all the evidence that has been given here bearing-upon it, in the light of this reservation in the deed which I have read to you, in the light of that further clause in the deed which I have read to you, in the light of the receipt which was-indorsed upon this deed, and also in the light of all the other-<a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>circumstances that have been shown. But you will not forget, gentlemen, that, according (as I understand it) to the undisputed evidence in this case, when this deed was made, that is to say, on September 9, 1869, there was no money passed from Samuel Herbein to Benneville Herbein. As I understand it, it is the undisputed evidence in this ease that no money whatever was paid for this conveyance until somewhat over a year later, when ’Squire Buskirk had become the assignee in bankruptcy of Benneville Herbein, and then the money was paid to him. .</p>

It seems he did the latter. The question, therefore, for you to determine is, what was the understanding of the parties at the' time the money was paid, what was the understanding between Samuel Herbein and ’Squire Buskirk as to the effect this deed had in passing the interest of Benneville in the dower pf the widow ? You are, of course, to consider also what was the understanding when the deed was made, but the decisive point of inquiry is, when the money was paid, when the transaction was consummated between Samuel Herbein and ’Squire Buskirk, what was the effect the transaction had then ? And upon that question, gentlemen, it is your business to consider everything that was said and done at the time, you will consider what the evidence is as to what passed between Mr. Herbein and Buskirk, and you are also to consider the subsequent acts of both the parties to this transaction, the subsequent acts of ’Squire Buskirk and also the subsequent acts of Samuel Herbein, and in the light of all this evidence, remembering everything testified to on both sides, you will decide which of these versions is the correct one, and according, as you find, return your verdict in favor of the plaintiffs or defendant.] [4]</p>

Brown, <a href="/pa/46/0197-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="46 Pa. 197" data-case-ids="420652" data-case-paths="/pa/46/0197-01">46 Pa. 197</a>; Kister v.

It is also true that the clause in Benneville’s deed to Samuel which is relied upon as making that reservation is not found in that portion of the deed where a reservation would properly be looked for, and that the language in which it is couched is not the most apt for such purpose. But where a deed is inartificially drawn, as this one manifestly is, too much stress is not to be laid upon the terms employed, or, as is evidenced by the decision in Ivory v. Burns, <a href="/pa/56/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="56 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="1009183" data-case-paths="/pa/56/0300-01">56 Pa. 300</a>, upon the position of any clause indicative of the intention of the parties, the cardinal rule being that the latter is to be effectuated, if lawful, by construing the instrument as a whole and giving force to every part of it: Wager v. Wager, 1 S. &amp; R. <em>374; </em>Means v. Presb. Church, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 303" data-case-ids="1854624" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0303-01">3 W. &amp; S. 303</a>; Phillips’s App., <a href="/pa/93/0045-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="93 Pa. 45" data-case-ids="442194" data-case-paths="/pa/93/0045-01">93 Pa. 45</a>, and the receipt appended to a deed, as well as the recitals contained in it, being part of it: Pryor v. Wood, <a href="/pa/31/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="31 Pa. 142" data-case-ids="985012" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0142-01">31 Pa. 142</a>. But this case does not depend solely upon the terms of Benneville’s deed to Samuel. It is very clear from the evidence elicited at the trial that no part of the consideration mentioned in it was paid at the time of its execution and delivery, and that the purpose of it was to keep at bay Benneville’s creditors. Upon Benneville’s adjudication as a bankrupt, it became the right of his assignee to annul the transaction : Bump on Bankr., 323, 338, et seq. He did not do thi§, but held Samuel to his bargain. The real question in this case then is, what was the bargain as understood by the parties at that time? Upon this question, of course, the acts of Samuel, as well as those of Benneville’s assignee within the knowledge of Samuel and unobjected to by him, were competent evidence. From all of them, the jury found that the parties understood that there was a reservation in favor of Benneville of a one-third interest in the principal of the dower originally charged upon the land, and that that interest was assets in the hands of his assignee, capable of being passed from him, by sale, to his vendee. Now, courts will not assume to understand the interests of con-<a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>trading parties better than the parties themselves: Phillips v. Blatehford, <a href="/mass/137/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="137 Mass. 510" data-case-ids="757793" data-case-paths="/mass/137/0510-01">137 Mass. 510</a>. The construction, therefore, which the defendant himself, in his dealings with the assignee, placed upon the deed from Benneville to Samuel, and in accordance with which he permitted the assignee and the plaintiff’s testator to act, is certainly the construction which the court ought to adopt, especially since to reject it would do distinct injury to the plaintiffs, whose testator, if it was wrong, was justifiably misled by defendant’s own apparent acquiescence in it.</p>
