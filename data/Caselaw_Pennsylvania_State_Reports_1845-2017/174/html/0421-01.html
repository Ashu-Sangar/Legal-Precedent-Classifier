The evidence showed that when the deceased was within from thirty to forty feet of the railroad he could have seen along the track at least a quarter and perhaps half a mile in the direction from which the engine came which struck him. <em>Held, </em>that a nonsuit was properly granted, inasmuch as the deceased would have seen the approaching train if he had stopped and looked.</p>

He was not again seen alive. His dead body was found about twenty minutes after six o’clock of the same evening upon the pilot of an engine, at a public grade-crossing of defendant’s railroad, known as the South Branch crossing. The buggy was found broken to pieces near the crossing. No person saw the accident. The evidence was that as the public road approached the crossing in the direction in which the decedent came, the land was level, and that at a distance from thirty to <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>forty feet from the crossing a person had an unobstructed view down the track, or in the direction from which the train came which killed the deceased, of from a quarter to half a mile. The court in granting a compulsory nonsuit said:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b442-5" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[268,597,1163,494]]]'>Now the rule of law is unbending, absolute and imperative that before a person, a wayfarer upon a public highway, crosses a railway, it is his duty to stop, not hold up, but to stop, look and listen for approaching danger or trains. The law presumes that where there is no evidence, that out of regard for a man’s own life he would do Iris duty, and stop, look and listen. There is no positive evidence in this case that the man did stop, look and listen, or that he did not. The witnesses who say that they saw the accident do not say whether this man stopped or not.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b442-6" data-blocks='[["BL_442.6",442,[264,1109,1165,807]]]'>Now, there is another rule that has recently been laid down by the Supreme Court in this state in regard to matters of this kind, that if a wayfarer or traveler about to cross a track has an unobstructed view of a quarter or half a mile, say, so that he could see or hear approaching danger, — if he does stop, look and listen, he could see what is approaching, and if, disregarding what he sees — the danger then approaching — he takes the chances of getting across the track before the engine or train reaches the crossing, it is his own negligence, and his survivors cannot recover. Now, in this case the court enters the nonsuit, not upon the theory that the company was not negligent, for the evidence here shows that tbe company was negligent in this, that it failed to give any signal of the approach of that train to that crossing. It was the duty of the company’s servants to give proper signals at the proper time and place. The evidence here shows that the company’s servants did not do that.</p>

Now, if as shown here and not disputed, it seems to the court, clearly, that Mr. Seamans could have seen down this track at least a quarter of a mile, and perhaps a half, when he was within from thirty to forty feet of the track, he had an opportunity to look, to listen. If he did he would have seen, must have seen, the approaching train, because the evidence here is the only evidence on the subject which seems <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>to the court worth considering, that the headlight was burning at the time. I say if he stopped and looked, he must have seen, even if he did not hear. If he did not stop, and passed on, the rule of law would defeat this action, and as I said to you, gentlemen, it is not a rule made by this court, it is a rule made by the highest court of the state, and the trial judge is bound to observe that, as he is all other law laid down by the Supreme Court. For that reason we feel it to be our duty to grant a compulsory nonsuit in this case.</p>
