The appointment was not made to bridge over an emergency and continue-<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>the business of the company, but that the assets of an insolvent concern might be held, preserved and distributed in an equitable manner to and among those entitled thereto. The business of the corporation was the manufacture of charcoal iron. It owned a furnace and a landed estate from which it derived its supply of ore and coal. When the receiver was appointed, it had on hand a considerable quantity of mined ore and charcoal. There was no adequate or compensating market for the raw materials, and it was apparent to the court that if these were to avail the creditors at all, it would have to be by employing them in the manufacture of iron at the company’s furnace. The receiver under authority obtained from the court, continued to operate the furnace until these supplies were exhausted. It is now nearly four years since the receivership began, and as appears by the second account, which is now before us for consideration, nearly all the assets, not including the real estate, have been converted. The fund for distribution arises from the sale of iron, farm products and other personal property, and the main controversy is between the general creditors of the company and the holders of certain bonds amounting to $150,000, which are secured by a mortgage on the real estate. The effort on the part of the general creditors is to exclude the bonds from participation, on the ground that, inasmuch as they do not mature until 1909, their payment is not now demandable. This position mistakes the nature and character of the receivership, and the character of the fund for distribution as well. It may be that where a receiver is appointed to avoid a temporary suspension or interruption of the business, which would likely prove disastrous to all interests, as in case of a railroad, general creditors would be allowed preference over the bondholders, in the net proceeds realized by the receiver from the conduct of the business, on the principle, that the status of all parties in interest is to be preserved with a view to a restoration of the concern to its own proper management. In such cases no injustice is done the bondholders by excluding them from participation in the distribution of the income. But that is not this case. Here the corporation was confessedly insolvent, without, possibility of rehabilitation, and there was but one thing to do, convert its assets and equitably distribute them. The fund for distribution can in no sense be called income or earnings; it <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>results from sales of materials, manufactured iron, products from the land or general personal property, all indicating a final winding up of the business of the concern. In said case, the functions of the receiver are hardly distinguishable from those of an assignee, except that the receiver acts at all times under the immediate direction and authority of the <em>court; </em>and indeed the whole proceeding assimilates itself to an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Were this an assignment by the Mont Alto Iron Company, no question could have arisen as to the right of the bondholders to come in upon the fund, notwithstanding their bonds were not due. We fail to see why they should be in less favorable position under a receivership.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[279,1099,1166,456]]]'>Holding to this view, we can see no reason why the receiver should make any distinction between what was derived from sales of personal property, and what was derived from the land; between what was expended for the conversion of the one, and what was expended in the maintenance and preservation of the other. It is not a case of two distinct funds, each belonging to a distinct class of creditors, but a common fund from which all expenses are to be taken, leaving a remainder in which all creditors are to participate ratably.</p>
