The entrance to the yard was through the house of the plaintiff and by a descent of five or six steps. The plaintiff owned a bitch, which had a litter of pups in a box under these steps. The bitch was snappish and on the day mentioned she snapped at and bit or scratched a child of the defendant, which was about three years old. The child cried at the time, and after it was taken home its parents became alarmed. The defendant requested the plaintiff to kill the dog, and upon his refusal, made a complaint before a magistrate, charging the plaintiff with keeping a ferocious dog. On this charge the plaintiff was arrested, detained an hour before he obtained bail, and after hearing was discharged by the magistrate, because, as the magistrate said, “ the dog was not running at large,” and for the additional reason that the magistrate thought defendant’s child was a trespasser on the plaintiff’s property.</p>

There is no law which punishes a man for failing to convict a person of a charge which he makes before a magistrate. He is only to be punished when he makes an unfounded charge, and is actuated' by malice and ill will. [In tins case it is manifest that the boy was bitten. The plaintiff’s case shows that. The father, in consequence of the bite, <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>lodged information against the owner of the dog for keeping a ferocious dog, which is an offense.] [3] The magistrate, however, thinking that the case was not one of enough importance to go to court, discharged defendant.

Where it appears that there is a reasonable ground for the belief of guilt, without regard to what induced that belief, it ought to be regarded as a justification of the defendant’s action, for the question turns not upon the actual state of the case, but upon the honest and reasonable belief of the party prosecuting.
