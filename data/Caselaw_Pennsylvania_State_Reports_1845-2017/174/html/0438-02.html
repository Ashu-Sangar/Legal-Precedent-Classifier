The policy, by its written terms, was to insure Mr. Kinney “ against all such immediate loss or damage sustained by the assured, as may occur <em>by fire </em>or <em>lightning </em>to the property above specified, but not exceeding the interest of the assured in the property, and <em>except </em>as hereinafter provided, for the term of five years from the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and 89 at 12 o’clock noon, to the first day of December, one thousand eight hundred and 90 at 12 o’clock noon,” etc., subject to numerous conditions as contained on the face of the policy.</p>

Shortly after the fire, Mr. Kinney forwarded, a proof of loss to the company. The company admits that the amount of loss sustained by Mr. Kinney is $4,182.22. On September 8,1891, M. S. Eby, secretary of the company, addressed a letter to Mr. Kinney referring to the nonpayment of assessments, and intimating that the company was not liable on its policy to him. At the time the policy of the Alliance Company issued to Mr. Kinney, he was carrying other insurance on this property to the amount of $4,000, viz: $2,000 in the Quaker City Mutual; and $2,000 in the Lehigh Mutual.</p>

In the policy of The Alliance' Company, condition 1, clause 2, is as follows : “ This policy shall become void unless consent in writing is indorsed by the company hereon, in each of the following instances, viz: .... If the assured have or shall hereafter obtain any policy or agreement for insurance, whether valid or not, on the property above mentioned, or any part thereof.” No written consent is indorsed on the policy permitting any additional insurance. After Mr. Kinney’s fire he called upon Mr. Van Heed, receiver of the defendant company, and admitted that his reason for not paying the assessment, of which he had notice, was this : that, not considering The Alliance Company reliable, he had taken out policies in other companies upon which he relied, in place of that issued to him by The Alliance Company. But failing to receive sufficient money from these substituted companies, and being informed that this failure to pay the assessment was no forfeiture of his policy in The Alliance Company, he decided to present his claim. The by-laws and constitution of The Alliance Company are not attached to or made part of the policy.</p>
