The position of a married woman under the common law is well understood by the legal profession. Her rights and powers were very much circumscribed and she could scarcely be considered to have a legal existence separate from that of her husband. The unity of the persons of the husband and wife, under the common law, is the source of the disability which prevented her from maintaining a suit against her husband or against strangers, without the consent of her husband, and this disability is at the foundation of the exception in the statute of limitations protecting her from its operation.</p>

Agnew, J., says that upon the plea of equity the courts set aside legal unity wherever, by its rank injury, it became legal folly. He gives several instances of departures from the common law rule. They may be found in 'Williams’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/47/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="47 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="485590" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0307-01">47 Pa. 307</a>.</p>

Nevertheless the passage of this act was an advance step in the emancipation of married women from the disabilities of coverture. From time to time, the legislature, by successive enactments, has enlarged the powers of married women over their separate estates, adding to their liabilities and responsibilities at the same time. The most sweeping change is to be found in the act of 1887. Under the provisions of this act a married woman acquires enlarged control over her separate estate; she can make contracts necessary to the enjoyment of her estate, as if she were unmarried, and she can sue and be sued without her husband joining or being joined. There are some things she cannot do. She cannot convey or mortgage her real estate without her husband joining; she cannot become accommodation indorser or surety for the debt of another, and she cannot bring a suit against her husband. While the act of 1893, P. L'. 344, specifically enumerates the cases in which a married woman may sue her husband, the act of 1887 is silent on this question, and the reason we say that under the latter act she cannot sue her husband is because it is so decided in the case of Small v. Small, <a href="/pa/129/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="129 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="568072" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0366-01">129 Pa. 366</a>. In the case at bar we are not concerned with the act of 1893. The construction given to the act of 1887 by the Supreme Court in Small v. Small, deserves our close attention. Section 4 of the act reads : “ Husband and wife shall have the same civil remedies upon contracts in their own name and right, against all persons, for the protection and recovery of their separate property as unmarried persons.” It was held in the court below that, on account of' the general and unlimited language of this section, husband and wife could sue each other. But Mitchell, J., says : “ It (sec<a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>tion 4) makes no exception of actions against each other, and, taken by itself, its natural meaning is, perhaps, broad enough to include them without straining. But no rule of judicial interpretation is wiser or better settled than that which prohibits the taking of a single sentence, even though it form a separate section of a statute, and construing it apart from the context, or without regard to the subject-matter, and the general purpose sought to be accomplished. The present act gives notable warning of the danger of such a course. Though not long, it is extremely intricate and confused, if not contradictory.” After discussing, comparing and analyzing the several sections of the act, Mitchell, J., proceeds : “ It is impossible to suppose that so important a branch of the subject as the right of action between husband and wife should not have been thought of, or being thought of should not have been granted in unequivocal terms, if intended to be granted at all. To legislators, versed in the principles of the common law, it would immediately suggest itself as a distinct and momentous departure from the legal policy of centuries, which ordinary phraseology, however general, would not commonly be understood to intend, and it is inconceivable, that under such circumstances, it should be granted obscurely and by implication. . . . This view is confirmed almost to a demonstration by the legislative history of the act of 1887. The fourth section follows closely the English married woman’s property act of 1882, and as originally introduced in the senate, it provided, as that act does, that ‘husband and wife shall have the same civil remedies upon contracts in their own name and right against all persons, including each other,’ etc.: Legislative Record, 1887, Pa. 896. This specific provision which put the change in the previous law into that precise, definite, and unquestionable form which its importance demanded, was struck out, and the section passed without it. The inference from this section is irresistible, that the legislature did not intend that actions between husband and wife, while living together, should be authorized.”</p>

The argument is that while a person is under a disability he is powerless to act; but that when this disability is removed either by law or by the act of the parties, and the legal right given him to do the act which he could not do before, he is bound to enforce his right in the same manner as if the disability never existed.</p>
