The rule that such contracts are not usually enforced specifically, as are contracts which relate to real property, does not rest on the ground of any distinction between the two classes of property other than that which arises from their character. Contracts which relate to real property can necessarily be satisfied only by a conveyance of the particular estate or parcel contracted for, while those which relate to personal property are often fully satisfied by damages which enable the party injured to obtain elsewhere in the market property precisely similiar to that which he had agreed to purchase. The distinction between real and personal property is entirely subordinate to the question whether an adequate remedy can thus be afforded. If from the nature of the personal property it cannot, a court of equity will entertain jurisdiction to enforce the contract: 2 Beach on Modern Equity Jurisprudence, sec. 598; Adams v.

There can be no adequate compensation in damages at law for the breach of such a contract. Its profits depending upon future events cannot be correctly estimated by a jury, but must be a matter of mere conjecture. Besides it is reasonable to suppose that the plaintiffs who are owners of a tannery purchased the bark by reason of its proximity to their plant, and this would be quite an advantage to them, and it is questionable whether they could go into the market and purchase bark as an ordinary article of merchandise.</p>

      <a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>The case of Buxton v. Leiter and Cooper, 3 Atlr. 383, was on a bill filed for the specific performance of the following agreement : “ M. L. and J. C. have agreed with J. B. for the purchase of all those several large parcels of wood, consisting of oaks, ashes, elms and asps, which are numbered, figured and cyphered, standing and being within the township of K. for the sum of ¿63,050, to be paid at six several payments, every lady-day, for the six following years, and L. and C. to have eight years for disposing of the same; and that articles of agreement shall be drawn and perfected, as soon as conveniently can be, with all the usual covenants therein to be inserted concerning the same.” It was determined that while, as a general rule, the court will not entertain a bill for a specific performance of contracts for chattels, or which relate to merchandise, but leave it to law, where the remedy is much more expeditious, yet in that case the agreement not being final, but to be made complete by subsequent acts, a bill to carry it into execution would be allowed. Lord Habdwicke, in giving his opinion, cited the case of Taylor v. Neville, which was for performance of articles for sale of eight hundred tons of iron, to be paid for in a certain number of years, and by installments; and a specific performance was decreed. He remarked that such sort of contracts as these differ from those that are immediately to be executed. He mentioned several eases as illustrating the exception to the general rule. A man may contract for the purchase of a great quantity of timber, as a ship carpenter, by reason of the vicinity of the timber, and this would be a great advantage on the part of the buyer. On the part of the seller, there may be a peculiar convenience and advantage in the bargain, as suppose a man wants to clear his land, in order to turn it to a particular sort of husbandry; there nothing can answer the justice of the case but the performance of the contract in specie. Lord Habdwicke also cited a case of the Duke of Buckinghamshire v. Ward, where a bill was brought for a specific performance of a lease relating to alum works and the trade thereof, which would be greatly damaged if the covenant was not performed on the part of Ward. The covenants lay there in damages; the court decreed a specific performance, because they considered if they did not make such a decree, an action would not afterwards answer the justice of the case: Fur-man v.

    <p id="b608-6" data-blocks='[["BL_608.8",608,[261,1032,1170,596]]]'>The subject-matter of the contract set out in the bill is within the jurisdiction of the court; and, if some of the defendants, nonresidents of the county, have not been regularly served with process, it is not too late to correct the error, if any there be. In the present undeveloped condition of the case we are not prepared to say there was any error in continuing the injunction. In view of this, and of the further fact that new parties defendant have been added, we think a reversal of the decree would be unwarranted. We purposely abstain from any expression of opinion as to the technical questions raised by appellants. In the present state of the case it is neither necessary nor proper that we should do so.</p>
