Thomas afterwards served a notice of revocation on the parties and refused to abide by the award upon the ground that the award did not cover all matters in dispute and that the arbitrators had acted improperly in not compelling Heger to appear before them, and in receiving his statements not in presence of Thomas. Thomas then instituted the present suit, and trial by jury was waived. On the hearing it was agreed that the question as to whether the award was binding should first be passed upon.

They received statements of accounts from both parties and endeavored to reconcile conflicting items and statements. Where a writing was attempted to be changed or waived by oral statements the writing was taken as the best evidence unless otherwise agreed to by the principals. It was evident to the arbitrators that to have the principals before them would simply widen the breach and be a hindrance rather than a help. Thomas asked <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>that they compel Heger to appear, but he knew that this was not done and that the settlement would be made without meeting him before the arbitrators.

It was not part of the submission. On October <em>24, </em>1893, Thomas notified Heger that for certain reasons assigned he had revoked the submission, and he subsequently brought the present suit.

Trial by jury having been waived and the case submitted, it was subsequently agreed that the court should first determine whether the award was binding and conclusive, and if they found it was not, then the accounts of the parties, together' with the evidence relating thereto, should be submitted. The court found that the arbitrators made their award October 20, 1893, finding balance in favor of the defendant, and that no attempt was made by the plaintiff to set aside the award or revoke the submission, under which it was made, until the 24th of October, four days after the award was made. In view of this finding, it was rightly held that plaintiff could not thus take his chances of a favorable result, and then, after ascertaining that the award was against Mm, attempt to avoid its effect. By his silence and acquiescence in the mode of proceeding until the award was made, he was estopped from questionMg its validity. There is notMng in the record that requires further notice.</p>
