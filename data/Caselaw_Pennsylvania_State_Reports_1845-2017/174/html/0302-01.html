Tbe Rose Yalley Mills, a corporation of the state of Pennsylvania, under tbe act of 1874 made an assignment, in trust, for tbe benefit of its- creditors, on March 7, 1892, to Horace P. Green, Esq., wbo accepted tbe trust and proceeded to settle up tbe assigned estate. Tbe heirs of Antrim Osborne bad a preferred claim against tbe assigned estate for rent, and, as all tbe other creditors bad been given security or were about to release their claims on tbe estate and consent to a reassignment, proposed on April 24, 1893, to release their claim and consent to a reassignment of tbe property to tbe Rose Yalley Mills, provided tbe Rose Yalley Mills would pay them all their claim for rent except $2,500 to May 1, 1893, and accept a lease for tbe Mills from May 1, 1893, to January 1, 1896, at $3,000 per annum and after a reconveyance, to secure tbe remaining $2,500 due tbe owners of tbe property by a mortgage on tbe machinery. On April 29, 1893, before tbe reassignment, this proposition was accepted by tbe stockholders of tbe Rose Yalley Mills, at a special meeting called for the purpose, wbo authorized and directed tbe officers of tbe company to execute and deliver a lease for tbe Rose Yalley Mills, and to execute and deliver a mortgage to the beirs of Antrim Osborne, deceased, for $2,500 on tbe leasehold and machinery of tbe Rose Yalley Mills to be thereafter reconveyed from tbe assignee. On June 5, 1893, a decree of reconveyance was filed and on June 6, 1893, a deed of reconveyance from Horace P. Green, assignee to Rose Yalley Mills, was executed, and on June 12, 1893, it was recorded in deed book H, No. 8, page 517. On tbe same day, in pursuance of tbe resolution of tbe stockholders of April 29,1893, tbe Rose Yalley Mills leased from the heirs of Antrim Osborne, deceased, tbe mills, with the machinery, water power, etc., from May 1, 1893, to January 1, 1896, at $3,000 per annum, payable quarterly, tbe first payment to be made on August 1, 1893, which lease was recorded on June 12, 1893, in deed book H., No. 8, page 519. On tbe same day tbe Rose Yalley Mills, in pursuance of the above mentioned resolution, executed and delivered a mortgage for $2,500 to Wm. H. Osborne, attorney in fact for tbe widow and beirs of Antrim Osborne, deceased, on tbe leasehold, fixtures and machinery belonging to tbe Rose Yalley Mills, which mortgage <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>was, on June 12, 1893, recorded in mortgage book R., No. 7, page 187, etc. Mr. Henry Riddle was appointed receiver of tbe Rose Valley Mills on August 28, 1893. Tbe sale by tbe receiver of the mortgaged leasehold, fixtures and machinery raised the money, now being distributed, which is more than sufficient to pay the mortgage, all preferred claims and the costs. The mortgage was given for the purpose of procuring a release and having the property reassigned, so that the Rose Valley Mills could resume business, and was not given for the purpose of forcing the Rose Valley Mills into insolvency. Had the Rose Valley Mills been called upon to pay its debts at the time the mortgage was signed, it could not have paid them. Its debts at that time were practically as great as when the receiver was appointed. There was paid to the heirs of Antrim Osborne by the receiver under a decree of the court made on February 12, 1894, the sum of ($1,749) seventeen hundred and forty-nine dollars, ($1,000) one thousand of which was paid for the time the receiver was in possession of the property and the balance for rent distrained for before the receiver was appointed, together with the costs. This sum was paid for rent accrued since the mortgage was signed, and not on account of the mortgage, or on account of the rent secured by the mortgage. The receiver remained in possession of the Rose Valley Mills until December 1, 1893, although there was no agreement for rental and compensation between him and the heirs of Antrim Osborne. The receiver did not operate the mill, but had the keys and full possession of it and had the property of the Rose Valley Mills stored in it, and possession was not taken by the landlord until December 1,1893, except á possession incident to a distraint for rent. Having the machinery stored in the mill was of advantage, both to the landlord and to the Rose Valley Mills. The machinery is still in the mill, having been purchased at receiver’s sale by John L. Grim, whose wife is one of the heirs of Antrim Osborne.</p>
