The evidence showed that plaintiff was to receive one third the amount recovered in an action which the defendant had brought against a former employer for injuries received in the course of his employment. Defendant testified that he had been induced to leave his former employer and bring that action by the repeated solicitations oí the plaintiff, who promised to take him into his service and pay him wages until the termination of the litigation. When plaintiff was asked whether he had a financial interest in the damage suit he evasively answered, “I did not attend the courts, I was not down there.” To the direct question whether he was present at the trial, he stated that he did not testify in the case; that he had not been a witness. The record showed that he had been in attendance as a witness on a number of occasions when the case had been continued and had claimed witness fees. <em>Held, </em>that it was not error for the court to call the attention of the jury to the plaintiff’s testimony, and to express an opinion as to its truthfulness.</p>

The defendant testified that he had been induced to leave his former employer and bring the action by the repeated solicitations of the plaintiff, who promised to take him into his service and pay him wages until the termination of the litigation. The plaintiff evidently desired to suppress the fact of <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>his connection with and interest in the action. To the question whether he had a financial interest in the suit he gave the evasive answer : “ I did not attend the courts.” When asked what he had to do with the case he answered: “ I was not down there.” To the direct question whether he was present at the trial he answered: “No, sir, I did not testify in that case.” And to the question whether he had been a witness he replied: “ No, sir.” It was shown by the record, the accuracy of which was not disputed, that he had been in attendance as a witness on a number of occasions, and that a claim for his fees as a witness had been made for four days’ attendance. It is admitted that he attended court as a witness in the case, but it is argued that as he was not present at the trial, but only on occasions when the case was not reached, his statement that he had not testified and was not present at the trial was literally true. He said however that he had not attended the court, and all his answers were intended to create the impression that he had not been in attendance as a witness. If not literally untrue, all these answers were evidently designed to create a false impression. The plaintiff, whose duty as a witness it was to tell the whole truth, has little ground for complaint if the court failed to observe the distinction between conveying a false impression and telling an untruth. It was not error to call the attention of the jury to this testimony, and to express an opinion concerning it. In doing so the learned judge withdrew no fact from their consideration. It was distinctly left to them to determine what had been said and what inference should be drawn.</p>
