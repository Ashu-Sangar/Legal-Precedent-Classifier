As to the second prerequisite, section 28 of the act provides for obtaining “ an order that the .... appeal shall be good,” without payment of costs, in certain cases wherein the judge making the order is satisfied that the party applying therefor is, “ by reason of poverty, unable to pay the costs; ” but, there is no provision in the act, or elsewhere, authorizing the court or a judge thereof to make an order, in forma pauperis, relieving appellants of the class to which defendants belong from complying with the third necessary prerequisite above mentioned.</p>

In the 31st section, a further exception is made in favor of executors, administrators, minors, etc. As to that class, it is declared, “ the appeal shall be good without payment of costs, or entering into recognizance, if such appellant shall not have taken out the rule of reference.” In Morton’s Admrs. v. Morton, <a href="/pa/11/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="404670" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0398-01">11 Pa. 398</a>, it was held that this exception did not relieve the administrators from complying with the first prerequisite of the 27th section of the act.
