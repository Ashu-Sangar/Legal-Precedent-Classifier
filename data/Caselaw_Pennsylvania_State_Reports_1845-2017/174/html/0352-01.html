In attempting to return home without relighting his lamp, he fell into a mine breach or hole which was left without guard rails, along the side of this road, and not in the traveled portion of it.</p>

It appeared that on the night in question plaintiff, hearing the cries of dogs and goats, the goats being his own property, lighted a miner’s open lamp which he placed on Ms hat and started out on the road in front of his house, until he came to a public cross road, and proceeded along this road for some distance, when his light blew out. He attempted to-return along this road without relighting his lamp. In doing so he fell into a mine breach or hole about twenty feet deep, along the side of the road, but not in the traveled portion of it.</p>

It was obstructed by a coal dirt bank a short distance from the point where the accident occurred, but it was used by the public to approach six houses on the road which were west of the obstruction. The court left the question of the defendant’s negligence and the plaintiff’s contributory negligence to the jury. The defendant submitted this point.</p>

    <p id="b373-9" data-blocks='[["BL_373.18",373,[147,1765,1163,144]]]'>The court’s refusal to charge, “ That under all the evidence in the case the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant,” is the only assignment of. error-on this record.</p>

Neither of these conditions existed in this case. On the contrary, the testimony tended strongly to prove that the township authorities were grossly negligent in not keeping the road, — from the edge of which plaintiff fell into the pit, — in a reasonably safe condition <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>for public travel, and that their negligence, in that regard, was the proximate cause of his injury. There was also some testimony tending to show that plaintiff himself was guilty of negligence which contributed to the injury of which he complains. These questions of negligence on the one hand, and contributory negligence on the other,- were both questions of fact for the exclusive determination of the jury; and to them they were fairly submitted by the learned trial judge with instructions of which the defendant, at least, has no just reason to complain. The controlling questions of fact, upon which alone the plaintiff’s right to recover depended, were thus definitively settled, in the regular and orderly way, by the verdict of the jury. Subject to the power of the trial court to set aside or provisionally reduce a plainly excessive verdict, or to set aside a verdict that is manifestly contrary to instructions, or against the weight of the evidence, etc., a verdict should be the end of litigation, as to questions of fact; and, ordinarily it would be so, if disappointed parties did not too often unwisely expect this court to usurp the functions of the constitutionally ordained triers of fact, and retry questions which are within their exclusive province.</p>

It would be a waste of time to do so. The record discloses no substantial error in the course of the trial, — certainly none that would justify us in disturbing the judgment.</p>
