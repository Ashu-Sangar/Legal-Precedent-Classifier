Plaintiff was a large stockholder of the corporation, and also a creditor, who had entered into the agreement. The committee purchased the plant at public sale for $4,000 and assumed other liens thereon for'about $5,000 more, and proposed to raise $20,000, by issuing mortgage bonds and distributing them among the creditors at the rate of 50 per cent of their claims, to pay off certain liens on the property, reimburse themselves and provide a fund for working the plant. This proposal was defeated through the objection of plaintiff and other creditors, and instead the committee was ordered by a majority of the creditors, against the objection of plaintiff, to sell the property and reimburse themselves. Plaintiff was not present at the meeting which authorized the committee to sell the property, but he had notice of the meeting, and was represented by his brother. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was not entitled to have the sale set aside and specific performance of the agreement.</p>

Instead of doing so, he sent his brother there, who informed the committee that the plaintiff could not fulfill his share of that contract, and later sent a letter inserting objections to the plan of the committee and proposing a futile scheme of his own. Under the circumstances it seems plain that he must be held to have assented to what the committee did, and is estopped, therefore, from insisting on the performance of that original contract.</p>

Could Mr. Froment insist that the agents of these creditors — the committee — must go on, incur liabilities, begin suits against their own principals and compel these principals to do that which the principals had unanimously resolved should not be done ? Before such a thing could be ■asked of the committee, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to tender to the committee a performance of not only his own part of the contract, but he must also tender a performance for all the others.

The question, therefore, whether the plaintiff’s prayers are to be granted or not, is not answered by the mere establishment of an original right on his part, as against the other creditors of the Blandón Iron and Steel Company, to performance of the agreement of November 18, 1891, nor by that of a relation of cestui que trust and trustee as between him and the committee appointed by the creditors to carry out its provisions. Conceding his position upon each of these points, it still remains to be considered, whether, under all the circumstances admitted by the pleadings and shown by the proofs, the result he contends for is consonant with equity and fair dealing. That result, it must not be forgotten, would involve the setting aside of what was desired by the majority'and acquiesced in by nearly all of the creditors, presumably acting upon an adequate understanding of their own interests, -in favor of one of them confessedly both unwilling and unable to comply with his part of the joint undertaking. <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>It would involve the imposition upon gratuitous mandatories of the burden of continuing the pledge of their individual.responsibility for considerable sums of money taken up by them for the benefit of others, and of engaging, at their own expense in the first instance and possibly at their own ultimate risk, in costly and extensive litigation in order to compel performance of that undertaking by each of the parties to it. And it would involve all this under a condition of affairs excluding the possibility of replacing the parties in the same situation in which they originally were. The demand for a decree having such an effect ought to be supported by powerful and undisputable equities. Are they apparent in this record?</p>

For the purpose of carrying out the agreement, each of the parties thereto constituted the committee his “ attorney in fact, with full power to do any and every act which it may be deemed expedient to do in order to carry out the object contemplated ” thereby. Part of this object was to raise by a new mortgage, or by the issue of bonds under an existing one, “ the working capital which the committee may decide necessary.” When, however, the committee, after having expended a considerable amount of its own money and incurred individual responsibility for still more, declared the necessity of raising by mortgage $20,000 to pay off existing incumbrances, to indemnify themselves and to obtain a couple of thousand dollars working capital, and, pointing out the impracticability of finding outside investors willing to take the bonds to be secured by said mortgage, suggested the apportionment of them among the creditors at the rate of 50 per cent of their claims — it turned out that the grant of plenary power to it by the agreement was a promise made in the night, and that the majority, including the plaintiff, was unwilling to abide by it. In a word, the plan of action determined upon by the committee, the authorized agent of the creditors, and according to the agreement of November 13,1891, conclusive upon them, was rejected by the principals, who had given it power to act for them. In that action of the creditors <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>the plaintiff participated; and since it involved a departure from the agreement, it necessarily implied a submission on the part of those opposing the recommendation of the committee to such substitute for the original agreement as should thereafter be determined upon. This substitute was provided in the resolution of February 17, 1892, directing the committee to dispose of the properly on the best terms available so as not to entail personal loss upon them. The committee had received its original mandate from the creditors’ meeting; it might lawfully accept, so far as itself was concerned, a modification of it from the same authority. It does not lie in the mouth of one who refused to stand by the compact as originally made, and who, by such refusal, aided in bringing about its modification, subsequently to insist upon its literal performance. The fact that its execution was, to him, the consideration upon which he surrendered what may or may not have been an advantageous position has nothing to do with this question. He was one of those who made it impossible to carry out its stipulations. In the face of that impossibility, it is idle to say that the committee ought nevertheless to have carried it out. The law exacts no impossible or unreasonable things : Keeley v. Shanley, <a href="/pa/140/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="140 Pa. 213" data-case-ids="972550" data-case-paths="/pa/140/0213-01">140 Pa. 213</a>; nor will courts presume to ■ understand the interests of contracting parties better than they themselves understand them: Phillips v. Blatchford, <a href="/mass/137/0510-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="137 Mass. 510" data-case-ids="757793" data-case-paths="/mass/137/0510-01">137 Mass. 510</a>. The refusal of the creditors, including the plaintiff, to carry out their agreement of November 13, 1891, upon the lines laid down by the committee appointed to determine upon such, shows that the carrying out of it was not conducive to their interests. The resolution of February 17, 1892, is strong evidence to indicate that, in the opinion of those who passed it, there was no other practicable method of accomplishing the original purpose of that agreement. In the absence of proof of fraud on part of the committee, or of the existence of some feasible way of effecting the object of the agreement of November 13, 1891, without imposing upon the committee burdens and responsibilities not contemplated by the same, those elements become conclusive to establish the impracticability of literal or even approximate performance. It is doubtless true that the offer of the property to the plaintiff at the figure requisite to lift its incumbrances and reimburse the committee was neither the one nor the other. But <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>it was, under the circumstances, at least all the plaintiff was entitled to, and the nearest possible approach to putting him into the position he occupied in the beginning. That he was not in a situation to accept it is his misfortune, not the fault of these defendants. There is nothing in the evidence to make it reasonable to infer that there would have been any difficulty in the way of giving plaintiff a good title. Of course, his liability to pay would have depended upon its procurement. I am at a loss, therefore, to understand by what theory of equity the relief here sought could be justified.</p>
