There is nothing before me but the articles of agreement, by which this decedent contracted to purchase the real estate for a certain consideration — ten per cent of which she paid in her lifetime. Her liability at her decease was a purely personal one for the balance of the purchase money. The fact that under the law she, as widow of Benjamin Eiegelman, was entitled to have one third of the purchase money charged on the property as her dower during her lifetime did not vary her personal liability to pay the whole purchase money, in the event of her decease before the transaction was completed by a deed to her, charging the dower; and I do not think it would make any difference, as between the devisee and residuary legatees, under the circumstances of this case, if it had been so completed. It is true, as contended by the learned counsel of the exceptant, that the law charged the dower at the death of Benjamin Riegeknan, but it is also true that Anna Eiegelman entered into a personal covenant to pay the whole purchase money of $1,900 ; and that the transaction stood in that form at her decease. In the view I take of this case, Anna Eiegelman was, at her death, indebted to the administrator of Benjamin Eiegelman, on her contract, in the sum of $1,710. The personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of all debts of a decedent, and this rule is so rigid that “ the charging the real estate, ever so anxiously, for payment of debts, is not of itself sufficient to exempt the personal estate. In order that the personal estate may be exonerated the intention must appear not only to charge the real estate, but to discharge the personal: ” Hawkins on Wills, 287. And this is not only true as to debts, but it is also true as to legacies. In Hanna’s Appeal, 31- Pa. 57, Lewis, C. J., said: <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>“ The personal estate is the primary fund for the payment of legacies. It is not relieved from liability in the first instance by a direction in the will making the legacies a charge on the real estate, unless that intention be indicated by the testator. When assets are received by the executor sufficient to cover the expenses of administration, satisfy debts and pay legacies the real estate is discharged from further liability.” In Mc-Glaughlin v. McGlaughlin, <a href="/citations/?q=24%20Pa.%2022" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="24 Pa. 22">24 Pa. 22</a>, Lowry, J., said: “ On a question of marshaling assets under a will, the residuary clauses necessarily furnish most important evidence of the intention of the testator: because they dispose of the surplus that remains after satisfying all the other directions of the will. On this account it is very natural to presume that the testator intends to charge upon them all the deficiencies in the other portions of his estate in paying debts and legacies ; and hence it is very generally decided that debts and legacies not otherwise effectively or specially provided for fall upon the residuary devisees and legatees.” The law places upon the personalty not only the primary duty of paying general debts and legacies, but of exonerating the realty devised from mortgages and other liens of the testator; and so rigorous is this rule that if lands be devised expressly subject to a mortgage, the personalty is still primarily liable, and the recourse to the land is only secondary: Hawkins on Wills, 278, 279. It was strenuously argued by the learned counsel of the exceptant that Anna Riegelman bought the premises charged with her dower, and that the rule that personalty must relieve real charges, does not apply to any such charges existing on the estate at the time it was acquired by the testator. But in this case we have the written covenant of Anna Riegelman to pay the $1,900; and where that is the fact there is a liability to exonerate from prior charges. This conclusion is clearly deducible from Hoff’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/24/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="9503873" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0200-01">24 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/24/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="24 Pa. 200" data-case-ids="9503873" data-case-paths="/pa/24/0200-01">200</a>; </em>Lennig’s Estate, <a href="/pa/52/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="52 Pa. 185" data-case-ids="1002233" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0185-01">52 Pa. 185</a>; Metzgar’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/71/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="71 Pa. 330" data-case-ids="1031255" data-case-paths="/pa/71/0330-01">71 Pa. 330</a> ; Merriman v.

The fact that the decedent held a mere equitable title under articles of agreement does not effect the .duty of exoneration by the personalty. It would certainly seem very strange if it should. Under articles the vendee is the substantial owner, and the vendor is a mere trustee of the legal title for him. But the authorities are plain upon this subject. <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>In McCracken’s Estate, <a href="/pa/29/0426-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="29 Pa. 426" data-case-ids="982913" data-case-paths="/pa/29/0426-01">29 Pa. 426</a>, it was decided that a balance due a vendor upon articles of agreement for tbe purchase and sale of land, assigned by the vendee to the testator, subject to the payment of the unpaid purchase money, is a debt against the estate of the latter, although the testator had entered into no express contract to pay it; and in Lamport v. Beeman, 34 Barbour’s Sup. Court Reports, 247, Johnson, J., said: “ This case, so far as the defendant Beeman is concerned, must turn wholly, I think, upon the question whether it is incumbent upon the executor or the devisee to pay the purchase money remaining unpaid upon the lands purchased by the testator and held by him by contract at the time of his death. It has been repeatedly, and I believe uniformly, held that the heir or devisee could compel the executors or administrators to pay off such a debt for his benefit, out of the assets in the hands of the latter: ” [Dart on Vend, and Purch. 125; Broome v.
