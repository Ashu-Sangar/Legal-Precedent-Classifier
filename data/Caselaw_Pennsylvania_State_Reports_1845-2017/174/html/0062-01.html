    <p class="syllabus" id="b82-8" data-blocks='[["BL_82.6",82,[269,737,1167,980]]]'>A carload of horses was received by the defendant, a railroad company, at a point in Ohio. The plaintiff was named in the bill of lading as the consignee, and Frankford, Philadelphia, as the destination of the car. The defendant’s railroad does not extend to Frankford. Its terminus for the delivery of freight is at a point in Philadelphia, several miles from Frankford. When the horses reached the defendant’s terminus in Philadelphia, a delivery of them was tendered to the plaintiff’s agent, and upon his request that they be carried to Frankford the car was delivered to another railroad company to be taken to Frankford. The written contract of shipment was to carry the horses “to the freight station, Phila., Pa., ready to be delivered to the consignee or his order, or to such company or carrier (if the same is to be forwarded beyond such station) whose line maybe considered a part of the route to the destination of said stock,” and it provided that the responsibility of the defendant as a carrier should cease at the freight station where delivery was made, or ready to be made, to the consignee, owner or carrier. <em>Held, </em>(1) that prima facie the duty of the defendant as a carrier ended when the horses were tendered to the agent of the consignee at the freight station, and from that time its responsibility was that of a forwarder only; (2) that if the contract was so modified by agreement of the agents of the parties at the time of the shipment as to impose on the defendant a liability as carrier beyond its station in Philadelphia, it was for the plaintiff to establish this fact by proof, and the testimony relating to it was for the jury.</p>

It is only responsible for such injuries as have been caused by its neglect. The neglect charged in this case is that the car was not forwarded promptly, and that in consequence of the delay, which the plaintiff says was unnecessary and excessive, the horses became sick, and some of them died.</p>

This submission included but one of the questions raised at the trial. The car had been transferred to the tracks of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R.

The question of the defendant’s responsibility beyond the terminus of its line was thus raised at the trial, and it is now presented by the ninth assignment of error.</p>
    <p id="b85-4" data-blocks='[["BL_85.5",85,[145,843,1171,1478]]]'>The car load of horses was received by the defendant at Belpre, Ohio. The plaintiff was named in the bill of lading as the consignee, and Frankford, Philadelphia, as the destination of the car. The defendant’s road does not extend to Frankford. The eastern terminus of its line for the delivery of freight is 24th and Race streets, several miles from Frankford. At this point delivery of the horses was tendered to the plaintiff’s agent, who was in charge of them, and upon his request that they be carried to Frankford the car was delivered to the Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. The written contract of shipment was to carry the horses “ to the freight station, Phila., Pa., ready to be delivered to the consignee or his order, or to such company or carrier (if the same is to be forwarded beyond such station) whose line may be considered a part of the route to the destina^ tion of said stock,” and it provided that the responsibility of the defendant as a carrier should cease at the freight station where delivery was made or ready to be made to the consignee, owner or carrier. Prima facie the duty of the defendant as a carrier ended when the horses were tendered to the agent of the consignee at 24th and Race streets, and from that time its responsibility was that of a forwarder only: Camden &amp; Amboy R.

If this contract was so modified-by agreement of the agents of the parties at the time of the shipment as to impose on the defendants a liability as carriers beyond its station in Philadelphia, it was for the plaintiffs to establish that fact by proof. The testimony relating to this was for the jury. It could not be assumed that it had been established, and in the absence of satisfactory proof upon the subject the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>
