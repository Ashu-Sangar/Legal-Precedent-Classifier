The treasurer of the company, J. H. Cochran, resides in Williamsport, Lycoming county. On the 21st of April, 1894, plaintiff, while a passenger on one of defendant’s trains, was seriously injured in a collision; averring her injury was caused by the negligence of defendant, she brought suit in the common pleas of Philadelphia, and procured service on Mr. Cochran, the treasurer, when he was temporarily in the city. The defendant’s counsel, without entering appearance, on affidavit of the facts and allegation that the service gave the court no jurisdiction, obtained a rule on plaintiff to set aside the summons. The court, on hearing, decreed the rule absolute,, and we now have this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b136-4" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[260,1100,1173,505]]]'>Appellant argues that a railroad company, chartered under the laws of Pennsylvania, can be sued in any county of the commonwealth by service of summons on the treasurer of the corporation. It is sought to sustain this contention by the language of the act of March 22,1817, the first section of which enacts: “ That suits may be brought against corporations by their corporate names before any court or magistrate of competent jurisdiction by summons which may be served on the president or other principal officer, or on the cashier, treasurer, secretary or chief clerk or such corporation.”</p>
    <p id="b136-5" data-blocks='[["BL_136.6",136,[262,1612,1173,505]]]'>It is obvious two constructions can be placed upon the language, “before any court or magistrate of competent jurisdiction.” Is it the intention to enlarge the common law jurisdiction of courts, by giving them cognizance of all suits against all corporations in the commonwealth, without regard to the corporation’s place of business or the location of its property, restricting the right to sue in any common pleas court only by the ability to serve a writ on one or other of the officers named ? Or does it define in what courts, within the different counties of the commonwealth, suits may be brought against corporations ?</p>

That a corporation, in all its business essentially local, shall be compelled to appear with its witnesses for trial in a court three or four hundred miles distant, ought not to be so decided unless the declaration be express or the implication unavoidable. Standing by themselves, we would be inclined to hold that the legislature intended no enlargement of the jurisdiction of the courts, by the words “ Court or magistrate of competent jurisdiction; ” that it was only intended to indicate what courts having jurisdiction of like amounts and like causes of action between natural persons should have jurisdiction in actions against corporations. But, further, the whole course of subsequent legislation on the same subject sustains this view.</p>

This court held, that although the cause of action arose before the abandonment of the corporate property, the suit must be brought' in the courts of a county where the corporate property was wholly or in part situated at the institution of the suit. The point before us did not arise in that case; we cited it only to show that counsel, the court below and this Court assumed that a proper construction of the act compelled the institution of suit in a county where the corporate property was wholly or in part situated, before a service on an officer outside the county would give the court jurisdiction over the corporation. Here the service was not in a county where any part of the corporate property was situated; it was on an officer temporarily within the territorial limits of the court, where the corporation had neither office nor agent, and where, so far as appears, it transacted no business.</p>
