Schoneman, No. 441, dated March 25,1876, for the sum of $4,000, with interest from the 10th day of October, 1881, under the following circumstances : Mr. Schoneman was, on the 10th day of October, 1881, a member of the firm of James Thompson &amp; Co., dealers in and manufacturers of twines and similar articles, doing business at No. 86 Leonard street, in the city of New York, and at that time living at Fort Washington, in that city. He left his home on the morning of Monday, October 10, 1881, at about half-past 7 o’clock, to go to his place of business, with the expectation of taking the 4 o’clock train on that afternoon for Boston, and of returning therefrom on Wednesday, October 12, and took with him a small satchel with some collars and cuffs and necessary toilet articles for such an expected absence. He did go to his place of business, and left there about 8 o’clock in the afternoon, having first drawn $25.00 in currency for his expenses and having with him, so far as known, no more than $50.00, with the announced intention of taking the elevated railroad to the Forty-second street station, there to take the 4 o’clock train to Boston, and from that time to this has not been heard of, nor has any trace of him been discovered. Mr. Schoneman was a man of regular habits, whose relations with his wife and child were of the happiest and most affectionate kind, his business was fairly successful, and his financial affairs, after his disappearance, were found to be perfectly regular, and in entire accordance with the appearance held out to the world, namely, that of a man not only abundantly solvent, but possessed of some means beyond his liabilities.</p>

Mr. Schoneman had made no designation of the beneficiary entitled to receive the insurance in case of his death, and, therefore, under the rules of the association, it became payable to his wife, and about that no question is made.</p>

By agreement copies of the affidavits of Simon H. Stern, Rosa B.

A. Schoneman was alive on May 1,1883. If so, he was clearly in default, and his name properly stricken from the roll of membership, and therefore no claim can be made against the company on account of his death; but if, on the other hand, he was dead at that time, then the right of his beneficiary had already matured, and the company had no right to strike him from the list of its members.</p>

This presumption arises from unexplained absence in connection with the surrounding circumstances, such as the failure of his family and friends to hear from him when his absence is under such circumstances as that it would be naturally expected they should hear from him, and in such case the presumption of death arises without other proof than the mere fact of absence unexplained and inexplicable; but in such case the presumption of death does not arise until the expiration of seven years, which period has been adopted by the American courts in conformity to the rule adopted by the English courts in analogy to the statutes of 1 Jac. 1, and 19 Car. 2, as to bigamy and leases.

None of the party was ever heard of afterwards, and after the expiration of seven years the Supreme Court of the United States held that under such evidence it was not bound to accept as absolutely controlling the legal presumption in respect to the seven years, but should determine the case upon the hypothesis that Davie had died in or about November, 1851: Davie v.

Obviously, the presumption of the death of a particular person within any time short of that fixed as the period at the expiration of which the presumption of death arises is mere guesswork, unless some circumstances other than the unexplained absence are shown, and while it may be said on the one hand that where a man leaves wife, family, and friends, business and property, without any known reason, it is so likely that he has died as to justify the finding of his death as a fact, yet on the other hand the same circumstances would equally preclude any idea of suicide, and it is at least equally improbable that he should have died suddenly from accident or disease, or been kidnapped and murdered without leaving some trace behind as that he should have voluntarily gone away; and this is especially so where, as in the case under consideration, the insured was last seen in a perfectly safe part of a city like New York and about to undertake a journey to a city like Boston, and where no accident could have occurred on any of the means of conveyance he intended to use without the knowledge of many persons.</p>

Indeed that is a necessary conclusion from viewing it, not merely as a limitation but as a countervailing presumption, which, as it does not supplant its predecessor before the end of the period, assumes no more than that the individual and the period expired together; and the predecessor being still in force to rule the case in respect to the time covered by it, is sufficient to maintain an inference of intermediate existence throughout. Thus the presumption of life continues till it is displaced by a more potent one, which, however, has no retroactive force; and indeed it would be of little use if it had, for to leave the time of the death still uncertain would leave a perplexity which it was its purpose to remove.”</p>

The burden of establishing the fact of his death on the last mentioned date was on her; and for that purpose testimony was introduced to prove circumstances attending his disappearance on that day, and that, notwithstanding diligent efforts were made to ascertain his whereabouts, etc., nothing has ever been heard of him. It was also shown that his relations in life, —business, social, domestic, etc., — -were all of such a character as to refute the theory of abandonment of family, friends, business, and everything calculated to conduce to his comfort and happiness.</p>

Indeed that is a necessary conclusion from viewing it, not merely as a limitation, but as a countervailing presumption, which, as it does not supplant its predecessor before the end of the period, assumes no more than that the individual and the period expired together; and the predecessor still being in force to rule the case in respect to the time covered by it, is sufficient to sustain an inference of intermediate existence throughout. Thus the presumption of life continues till it is displaced by a more potent one, which, however, has no retroactive force; and <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>indeed it would be of little use if it had, for to leave the time of the death still uncertain, would leave a perplexity which it was its purpose to remove. It is undoubtedly true that additional circumstances of probability may justify a presumption that the death was still sooner; but these, where they operate, introduce a distinct and dissimilar principle.” To justify the introduction of that dissimilar principle, and its application in any Case, there must be, as was afterwards said, some “ evidence that the individual was, at some particular date, in contact with a specific peril as a circumstance to quicken the operation of time.” In the case now under consideration that element is entirely absent. There is nothing in the testimony to show that appellant’s husband, when last seen or heard of, was exposed to any such specific peril, or to any peril sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the general rule above stated. Mere general perils are not sufficient.</p>
