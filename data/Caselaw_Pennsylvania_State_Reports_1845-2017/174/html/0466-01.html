Under the procedure act of 1887, the affidavit of defense is made to the statement, not to the copy of the cause of action filed, and whatever averments contained in the statement are not denied by the affidavit must, upon a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, be taken as admitted: Ashman v.

Not being denied by the affidavit, this averment must be taken as admitted. ' If it is true, however, it seems the plaintiff may sue the corporation in her own name, says the act, May 28, 1715, 1 Sec. 90:</p>

Ortlieb, 1 W. N. 576. On the other hand, if it was <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>intended to intimate that the recipients had departed from the lawful purposes of the incorporation, its force as a defense is disposed of by what has been said above.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[263,534,1167,1216]]]'>(5) The fact that there was a report of a less indebtedness of the defendant corporation than that here sought to be enforced, can scarcely be of any significance. It would hardly be supposed that the statement of a debtor to a third party that he owed the plaintiff nothing upon, or less than the face of, obligations of the debtor held by the plaintiff, would be evidence in the former’s favor upon a trial. And if' it is not, it is of no avail in an affidavit of defense: Hendel v. Assur. Co., 2 Distr. R. 116, and cases there cited. A conspiracy, however, between the makers of the notes in suit and the plaintiff, to subject the defendant corporation to a liability which does not, in law and equity, exist, is not averred in the affidavit. The only thing that is averred is an intention on the part of the plaintiff and the former officers of the coloration, in accepting service of the summons, to bring about a sheriff’s sale of the defendant’s property, etc. But, in the first place, that does not go to the consideration of the notes, or the right to enforce them; in the second place, it may be avoided by payment of what is due upon them, and in the absence thereof is an undoubted right of the plaintiff; and, finally, the objections to the service are withdrawn if, indeed, the filing of an affidavit to the merits is not, in itself, a waiver of such objection, because that is an actual appearance: Hickernell v.
