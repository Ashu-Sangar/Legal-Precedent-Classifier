No affidavit of defense having been theretofore filed, the judgment thus entered was undoubtedly regular and valid, and plaintiffs were entitled to all the incidents thereof, such as lien, etc., until it was legally reversed or satisfied: Weigley v. Teal, <a href="/pa/125/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="125 Pa. 498" data-case-ids="563987" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0498-01">125 Pa. 498</a>; Newbold v.

While the court, for sufficient cause shown, could, under its equitable power, open such a judgment and let the defendant into a defense, it was powerless to strike it from the record, because it was not only regular on its face, but perfectly regular and valid in point of fact. Judgments cannot be legally stricken from the record save for irregularity or illegality: O’Hara v. Baum, <a href="/pa/82/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="82 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="1047856" data-case-paths="/pa/82/0416-01">82 Pa. 416</a>; Allen v.

In the case first cited it is said, “ a motion to set aside or strike off a judgment must be on the ground of irregularity appearing on the face of the record; a motion to open it is an appeal to the equitable power of the court to let the defendant into a defense; ” and the others are substantially to the same effect.

The rule granted on that petition appears to remain undisposed of, and of course we intimate no opinion as to its merits; but, for reasons heretofore given, the decree of January 21, 1895, from which this appeal is taken, must be reversed and the judgment reinstated; and that will clear the way for such disposition of the pending rule to open etc. as the court below may consider proper.</p>
