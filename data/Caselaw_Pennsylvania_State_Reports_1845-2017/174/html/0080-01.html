The evidence of plaintiff tended to show that the intention was to include both in the sale. The evidence of the defendant and his witnesses tended to show that it was the intention of the defendant to sell only one of the tracts. The master found that the minds of the parties never met. Exceptions to his report were overruled, and a decree entered dismissing the bill. <em>Held, </em>(1) that it was proper to ascertain the intention of the parties by facts dehors the writing; (2) that the master’s finding of facts based upon sufficient evidence, and sustained by the court below, would not be reversed by the Supreme Court.</p>

Afterwards, on the 16th of September of same year, the orphans’ court confirmed the sale, and deed was made accordingly by the administrator to Guatschi. In the return of sale and in the deed the two properties are described as Nos. 7 and 8, as specified in the appraisement of McCoy’s estate.</p>

As Gautschi owned two distinct yet adjoining lots on the corner of two streets, a description of the “ premises Chestnut Avenue and Bethlehem Pike ” was applicable to the corner lot alone, or to the corner lot and its adjoiner, depending on the intention of the parties. As they flatly contradicted each other in their interpretation of the instrument, their intention must be ascertained by facts dehors the writing.</p>

In all its essential features, the case is similar to Cortelyou’s Appeal, 102 Pa. 5T6, where the written description was applicable to one lot or two. The master and court below were in doubt as to the intention of the parties. This court, in affirming the decree dismissing <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>the bill, held, that under such circumstances, specific performance ought not to be decreed.</p>

But these findings to a great degree are founded on the credibility of the witnesses, Gautschi, his daughter, son, and Stemple and Reilly, as to what took place before and subsequent to the contract, when the application for title insurance was signed, and the deed describing but one lot handed to and read by Reilly. He certainly was not manifestly wrong in crediting the testimony of defendant’s witnesses; taking their statements as true, Gautschi never intended to sell the two lots, and there is even some doubt as to whether plaintiff thought he was buying more.</p>
