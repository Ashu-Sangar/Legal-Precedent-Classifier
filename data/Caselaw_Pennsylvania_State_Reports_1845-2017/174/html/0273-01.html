L. 217, a turnpike company whose road has been occupied by the tracks of a street railway is entitled to recover from the street railway company compensation for the use and occupation of its road, and such compensation includes all injury done to the property which is the immediate and direct consequence of the occupation' and use. The damage is not measured by the additional cost of maintenance of the roadway only, but by the depreciation in value of the property as a whole resulting from the occupation and use, and caused by the presence of the tracks and cars. If these are such a menace to travel as to cause those who would otherwise have driven on the road to abandon its use in whole or in part, they directly affect its earning capacity, diminish its revenues and depreciate its value as a property, and the turnpike company may be permitted to show the decrease in revenues and depreciation in the market value of its capital stock as evidence of the damage sustained.</p>

Schuylkill Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/110/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="110 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="543724" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0054-01">110 Pa. 54</a>, that the property taken was of a peculiar character, and can hardly be said to have a market value. If the court were to limit the plaintiff to proving the value of the turnpike before and after the taking by the railway, it might be that plaintiff could not present the case it has, because the turnpike is not such property as admits of a market value being shown. Therefore the court is of the opinion that the plaintiff must be permitted to show, as was the Schuylkill Bridge Co., in the case referred to, the income of the turnpike company for a limited and reasonable period before the taking; however, there must be excluded from the diminution of earnings, if there was a diminution, that which is represented by the diversion of traffic from the turnpike to the railway company, for that the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>

[Now so far as the travel and the income of the turnpike is •affected by the traction company’s road on the turnpike it is a proper consideration for damages. But so far as the difficulty .and danger outside of the turnpike company’s property, to wit, ■on Lehigh street in Allentown is concerned, that must be thrown •out and must not be allowed to weigh with you when you come •to ascertain the plaintiff’s damages, because this jury and this •court cannot try the right of the traction company to occupy Lehigh street in Allentown. The right to do that is vested by law in the governing powers of the city of Allentown, the town •council and the mayor, and they have the permission; and so far as the danger and difficulty of travel within the city of Allentown tends to keep people off the turnpike and thus diminish •the income of the turnpike company, that must be thrown out ■because we must take it for granted that the use of Lehigh street in the city of Allentown as it is used now is lawful.] [11]</p>

The damages you award the turnpike company will be all they will ever receive. If the turnpike exists for one hundred or one thousand years they can never recover damages for what you are considering now. It must be once for all time. And you are to give the turnpike company such damages as will amount to compensation. By compensation is meant the measure of the actual loss — a sum equal to the loss of the turnpike company.

And if the loss was $300 a year it would be three times that sum of $1,666 or $2,000. And if the loss was $500 it would be five times that sum. • In other words, and that is the plaintiff’s argument, that you shall give them such a sum that the interest or income of it a year would.be equal to that which they have lost in tolls. You can view it in that light, but you must bear in mind that the sum you will award to the turnpike company will not be the interest, but it will be the whole sum itself; and that would have to be considered in making the sum less than the sum which would produce the annual interest.] [15]</p>

Is that true that there was a fall in the price of the stock ? If there was, then you are not to take it for granted that the injury done by the traction company for which it is responsible alone affected that; but you are to consider the argument made on the part of the defendant and the evidence elicited that the fall might have been owing to some other cause, to the dullness of the times, or to the fact that turnpikes are getting out of favor and that people travel by other methods, or that people change their means of travel; some may have died, or not have had horses, and all that.

    <p id="b302-4" data-blocks='[["BL_302.7",302,[294,424,1163,606]]]'>By virtue of authority conferred upon it by the seventeenth section of the act of May 14, 1889, the Lehigh Valley Traction Company entered upon and used a part of the road of the Allentown &amp; Coopersburg Turnpike Company by laying a double track and running its cars thereon. This use was subject to the duty to make compensation therefor to the owners of the turnpike in the manner fixed by the fourteenth section of the act. The parties in interest being unable to agree, a jury was appointed to assess the damages. The case came to trial in the common pleas on an appeal from the award of the jury of view, and is here upon exceptions to the rulings of the court in relation to the measure of damages.</p>
    <p id="b302-5" data-blocks='[["BL_302.8",302,[294,1037,1169,1270]]]'>The defendant’s contention is that it is liable only for the damage caused by the laying of the tracks, and not for the loss of profits resulting from the diminution of tolls, and that the full measure of damage is the additional expense which the plaintiff has .incurred or may hereafter incur in keeping its roadway in repair by reason of the tracks being laid upon it. The contention of the plaintiff is that it is entitled to recover compensation for all losses which are the direct and immediate result of the act of the defendant in taking possession of a portion of the road and laying its tracks and running its cars thereon, and that the measure of damages is the difference in value of the property of the turnpike company as a whole before and after the construction of the railway. The learned judge adopted substantially the plaintiff’s view, but he carefully excluded from the computation of damages any loss of revenue from tolls occasioned by the fact that new and improved facilities for travel were furnished, and that persons who would otherwise have driven over the turnpike rode in the cars to and from points on the line of the railway. Nor was the jury allowed to consider as an element of damage the loss of tolls-caused by the diversion of travel from the turnpike by reason of the increased danger on the city street with which it connected and with which it formed a continuous route for travel. The measure of damages was limited to the direct and immediate consequences of the occupation and use.</p>

The compensation secured by the act is compensation for the occupation and use of the property of the turnpike company by the railway company, and it includes all injury done to the property which is the immediate and direct consequence of the occupation and use. The damage is not measured by the additional cost of maintenance of the roadway only, but by the depreciation in value' of the property as a whole resulting from the occupation and use and caused by the presence of the tracks and cars. If these were such a menace to travel as to cause those who would otherwise have driven on the road to abandon its use in whole or in part they directly affected its earning capacity, diminished its revenue and depreciated its value as a property.</p>

The admission of this testimony was in harmony with the rulings in Montgomery County v. Schuylkill Bridge Co., <a href="/pa/110/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="110 Pa. 54" data-case-ids="543724" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0054-01">110 Pa. 54</a>, in which it was said: “ The property taken was of a peculiar character, and can hardly be said to have a market value. It was a bridge and the corporate franchises of the company owning it. There are no sales by which it can be compared, and a market value in the fair sense of the term ascertained. . . . The property and the franchises of the bridge company are represented by its stock, and the market value of the stock may be said to represent the market value of the property taken, as nearly as it can be ascertained.” This is as true where there has been a partial taking as where the whole has been taken. The nature of the property made it difficult to apply the rule for the assessment of damages, and especially difficult as a part of the loss of income <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>was doubtless due to competition, and a part to the increased danger to travel within the city limits, but the rights of the parties were fully explained and guarded in the very clear and able charge of the learned judge before whom the case was tried.</p>
