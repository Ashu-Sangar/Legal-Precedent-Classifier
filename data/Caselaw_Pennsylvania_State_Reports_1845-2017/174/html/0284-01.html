On this day the plaintiff appeared by its counsel, William B. Broomall, Esq., and its president, George B. Lindsay, Esq., and the defendant appeared by counsel. S. C. Long, an engineer of said defendant company, was present as a witness. There were no depositions taken or read at said hearing, nor were any witnesses heard, although the defendant’s counsel offered the said S. C. Long as a witness, but the court declined and refused to hear him. After the reading of the bill and answer, and without hearing any testimony, the court made the decree complained of in this case. On March 6,1895, the defendant took this appeal. The bill was not sworn to, and there was no injunction affidavit filed, and the record as filed in the Supreme Court in this case does not show any such affidavit. There was no opportunity given to file excejstions to the decree.”</p>

It did not tend to preserve the status of the parties pending the litigation, but to destroy it. In its character and effect it was final, for it gave to the plaintiff the right for which it contended in advance of the regular determination of that right. But the decree was made and the crossing has been <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>completed under its authority. The authority to make the crossing is yet to be determined on final hearing. Upon that subject we express no opinion. It will be time enough to consider it when regularly presented. Meantime there is no reason apparent why we should disturb the operation of the plaintiff’s road by reversing the order appealed from until the subject can be fully and intelligently disposed of by a final decree. It is for this reason that we affirm the action of the court below. This must not be taken as an expression of opinion upon the question of the plaintiff’s right to cross at grade, but as due to disinclination to disturb the present status until that question may be settled by a final decree.</p>
