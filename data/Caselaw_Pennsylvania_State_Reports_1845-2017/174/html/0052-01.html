Plaintiffs’ suit was based on an absolute sale of the yam to defendant; the pleadings were adapted to it, and all the evidence submitted was offered and received for the purpose of establishing it. Defendant on cross-examination stated that after some of the yam had been delivered to B. one of the plaintiffs asked him, (the defendant,) if he would guarantee the account, and that he replied that he would if the yarn was up to sample. <em>Held, </em>(1) that under the pleadings there could be no recovery upon a guaranty, if one existed; (2) that the important controlling question in the case was whether the defendant was a purchaser of the yarn; (3) that in determining whether the defendant was the purchaser of the yam, it was proper for the jury to take into consideration bills rendered by the plaintiffs to the defendant and the latter’s failure to make any objection to them, letters written by B. to defendant, and immediately forwarded by him to the plaintiffs, and interviews between plaintiffs and B. in regard to the quality of the yam, and the loss to the latter in working it up.</p>

That is, I mean to say, that upon the basis of what Mr. Fleming says, he went there in the latter part of January and asked them to take this order. That would be over seven years ago. So that, in the nature of things, when you come to consider the testimony, you must not expect it to be so fresh in the minds of the witnesses as though it had been something which occurred a year ago or two years ago.</p>

You are to consider that in the light of the credibility of the witnesses, if you do find such a thing. I do not recollect myself that there has been any such thing in this case.</p>

They have put in evidence the bills which they furnished to Mr. Fleming, from time to time, and they also say there was no special agreement to furnish three thousand or five thousand pounds of yarn. That is, so far as this transaction for which they are suing now, it is simply for the balance of goods that had been sold by them and not paid for. That is the position they take, that there was no change between this yarn relative to the previous yarn sold; that there was no special order for this <em>yarn; </em>that it was simply a running account between Mr. Fleming and them and that a certain amount of yarn was paid for, and this amount was not paid for.</p>

In fact, they are diametrically opposite. They are as far apart as the poles. If one of these stories is true, the other necessarily must be false. That is as apparent as it is possible for anything to be, and it is upon the finding that you will make as to those two, which of the two you will find, that you will find your verdict.

You have his testimony, that he made an arrangement with one of the plaintiffs to go up and see Mr. Brook at the mill, at Pomeroy, and they went there. There seems to be no dispute in the testimony that both Mr. Shaw and Mr. Fleming went to the mill at Pomeroy. Mr. Shaw says he went there because Mr. Fleming wanted him to go there and press the payment of the bill, in his presence, from Mr. Brook. You are to say what credence you will give to that. If you recall it, that is all the reason Mr. Shaw gives for going up to Pomeroy. He went there, not to talk about' yarn, not to talk about anything with regard to the contract, but simply to press Mr. Fleming, in the presence of Mr. Brook, for the payment of the bill. Now, I say, you will determine whether or not that is to be believed.</p>

You have the testimony of Mr. Brook, that at one of these conversations — and there may be some doubt, as to which one it was — Mr. Shaw told him to go oh and weave the yarn, and whatever the loss, if there was a loss, he could make good. You have the testimony of Mr. Shaw that he did say at a conversation something to that effect, but you must understand that any loss that Mr. Brook sustained you cannot give to the defendant in this case an allowance for, because, if the contract was between Mr. Brook and the plaintiffs, then <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>that must be fought out in a case between the plaintiffs and Mr. Brook. If Mr. Brook was the actual purchaser of the yarn, that could be readily determined in a suit brought by the plaintiffs against Mr. Brook for the price of the yarn, or in such a suit as Mr. Brook says he has brought against the plaintiffs to recover damages. But so far as this case is concerned, that conversation is to be considered by you simply as throwing light upon the transaction as between Mr. Fleming and the plaintiffs. That is, does it go to corroborate Mr. Fleming to show Mr. Fleming was actually only a broker or doés it go to show the other thing, that Mr. Fleming was the actual purchaser. I think from the plaintiffs’ standpoint you will find some little difficulty to give a reason why Mr. Shaw went there on the other two occasions. Mr. Shaw does not show the reason he went there. One time, according to his own testimony, he took Mr. Thorp, the superin.tendent of his own mill, and went through that mill. Of course there must have been some reason for his going there, and when he did go there he talked about yarn, talked about the character of the yarn. Mr. Shaw says the yarn at that time had already been delivered. Mr. Fleming says when he first went there it had not all been delivered, but that there was some conversation, and that is corroborated by Mr. Osmond, who seems to have been the superintendent of the mill of Mr. Brook, also by Mr. Brook, that the yarn thereafter should be up to sample and that the yarn which had already been delivered and was in the looms was not up to sample. That, I say, is the testimony of Mr. Fleming, Mr. Osmond and Mr. Brook. Mr. Shaw does not directly deny that. Mr. Shaw does not recall exactly what he' did say, but he does recollect there was something said about Brook going on and weaving the yarn, and if any loss could be shown under him he would make it good.</p>

I do not so charge you. You should consider those bills in considering the main question, which is as I have put it to you, Was Mr. Fleming a broker or was he a purchaser ? But I decline the point as presented. [7]</p>

I do not so charge you; but, as I said before, you may consider the facts stated in this point'in considering the case, but you are not concluded by them. [8]</p>

Whether the yarn was sold to Fleming direct or whether it was consigned to Fleming upon a guaranteed account, the plaintiffs, Kershaw &amp; Co., are entitled to recover the contract price, and if the yarn was not merchantable under the order, plaintiffs are still entitled to recover the market value of the yarn delivered, and the defendant must prove the value in the market with reasonable accuracy and liquidate his damages accordingly. <em>Answer: </em>Gentlemen, I refuse that point. On the question of the guarantee, the defendant, Mr. Fleming, testifies that he did at one time in the transaction offer to guarantee the account and said he would guarantee it. The plaintiffs, however, repudiate that and say no such conversation ever occurred. You can see, gentlemen, if Mr. Fleming did guarantee the account, his guarantee repudiates the idea of his having purchased it; if he was a purchaser he was liable, if he was a broker he might guarantee the account. He did say he guaranteed, but there is no action in this case upon the guarantee. The plaintiffs have not here sued on the guarantee, they have sued Mr. Fleming as purchaser, and they must stand or fall according to their position, and he cannot be held upon his guarantee in this action. If they wish to recover on the guarantee they should sue on that, and then other questions will arise for the jury’s determination. Then the question would be before you as to whether or not Mr. Brook has a defense. All through the case we have pending, you are not considering whether or not Mr. Brook has a defense. That is to be considered in a contest between the plaintiffs and Mr. Brook, if there ever is one. When a man guarantees an account he guarantees the solvency of the purchaser; it is a secondary liability and not a primary liability. [9]</p>

    <p id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.7",80,[276,427,1163,1818]]]'>It is not necessary to consider separately the fifteen specifications of error filed in this case. When it was here before, Shaw v. Fleming, <a href="/citations/?q=148%20Pa.%20104" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="148 Pa. 104">148 Pa. 104</a>, we held that as it was an action for the price of yarn sold and delivered, it was essential to a recovery by the plaintiffs that they prove a sale and delivery of the yarn in accordance with their claim. We also held that <em>“ </em>the evidence of what passed between them and Brook respecting the quality of the yam, and their responsibility to him for a loss, was admissible on the question whether Brook or Fleming was their vendee, but that it was not sufficient to relieve the latter from his obligation to pay for the yarn if he was the purchaser of it,” and further that the loss Brook sustained by reason of the alleged inferior quality of the yarn was not available as a set-off in or defense to the action. It was because of the rulings of the learned court below, adverse to these views, that the judgment was reversed and a new trial was ordered. The case now comes to us on the appeal of the same parties from a judgment recovered on a trial in which the objectionable rulings referred to have no part. While the result on the first trial was the same as on the last, it may have been due on the former to either of the rulings that were adjudged to be erroneous, or to a finding by the jury that the defendant was not a purchaser of the yarn. It is reasonably certain however that the judgment now appealed from is based upon a finding in accord with the defendant’s contention that the plaintiffs did not sell to him the yarn they delivered to Brook and for the price of which they brought this suit. The evidence to warrant such a finding was ample and the instructions in regard to it were impartial and clear. On the first trial as on the last the plaintiffs submitted a point to the effect that the bills they rendered to the defendant became, by his failure to object to them, accounts stated, and estopped him from denying that he was a purchaser of the yarn. The point was denied on both trials but in the last one the jury were instructed to consider the bills in determining the question whether Fleming was a purchaser or a broker in the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b80-6" data-blocks='[["BL_80.8",80,[278,2262,1163,146]],["BL_81.1",81,[176,384,1169,865]]]'>The plaintiffs appear to have thought on the last trial that they had discovered something in the testimony of the defendant which might authorize and support a verdict in their favor. <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>The substance of this testimony is that Fleming said on cross-examination that after some of the yam had been delivered to Brook, Shaw asked him if he would guarantee the account, and that he replied that he would if the yarn was up to sample. In considering this conditional offer of guarantee it is well to note that from the time this litigation commenced until the present stage of it the plaintiffs have stubbornly persisted, and still persist, in claiming that they made an unconditional sale of the yarn to the defendant and that there was no conversation between them at any time in reference to a guaranty. Their suit is based on an absolute sale of the yam to him, the pleadings are adapted to it, and all the evidence they have submitted was offered and received for the purpose of establishing it. Under the pleadings there could be no recovery upon a guaranty if one existed. The text-book and cases cited in aid of this branch of their contention afford no support to it, and the learned court below properly disposed of it.</p>
    <p id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[176,1258,1169,663]]]'>The important and controlling question in the case was whether the defendant was a purchaser of the yarn. It was a question of fact determinable on due consideration of all the evidence pertinent to it. The bills rendered by the plaintiffs to the defendant and Ms failure to make any objection to them, the letters written by Brook to Fleming and immediately forwarded to the plamtiffs by the latter, the interviews between the plaintiffs and Brook M regard to the quality of the yam and the loss to Mm M worMng it up, were all relevant to the question and proper matters for the jury to consider M deciding it. It was also exclusively for the jury to determine what credit should be given to the testimony of the witnesses respect-Mg these and all other matters affectmg the issues M the case.</p>
