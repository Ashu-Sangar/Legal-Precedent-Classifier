    <p class="summary" id="b186-12" data-blocks='[["BL_186.10",186,[257,1653,1170,809]]]'>Sometime in August, 1892, Mr. S. Price Stevenson, of the firm of Stevenson Company, Limited, called upon Mr. Thomas W. Scott, who was then in the real estate business in Chester, and asked Mr. Scott, among other matters, if he expected to go into any speculative building operations. After several interviews, Mr. Scott and Mr. Stevenson agreed to go into a partnership agreement, to build four houses upon a lot at the corner of Seventh and Hayes streets, in the borough of South Chester. Mr. Stevenson went so far as to call upon the Hon. William Ward to consult him with regard to the matter, and get him to write articles forming a limited partnership, but from the evidence it seems that Mr. Ward discouraged this plan, because it was simply for one transaction. No articles were written, but the lot was purchased from the Delaware County Beal Estate-Company, the title being put in the name of Walter S. Sample, the deed being dated October 18, 1892. ,</p>

      <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>Upon this lot was a mortgage of $3,000, held by Amos Gartside, of Chester. Operations were not commenced until the lattei part of the year; indeed, it seems from the testimony of the witnesses, material men, that at the time the operations were under way, the credit of Mr. Scott was not good, and for that reason some of them declined to make a contract for work with <em>him; </em>they preferred to go to Mr. Stevenson, and he promised on behalf of the Stevenson Company, Limited, to be responsible for their claims, and indeed, after the buildings were completed, and the creditors were clamoring for their money, Mr. Stevenson bought some of their accounts, most of them at a discount, paying generally partly in cash and partly in trade. It' was expected that enough money could be raised on mortgage to pay off the accounts and sell the houses, but after repeated attempts by Mr. Scott, to raise the money required he found he was unable to do so, and consequently the venture was a failure. Mr. S. Price Stevenson denies that any agreement was entered into, or that he or his company were a party to the operation as a partner, and that no consummation of the agreement was ever made and that he is simply a creditor of Mr. Scott and Mr. Sample, precisely as the other material men.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b187-3" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[203,1446,1168,812]]]'>The testimony, however, leads your auditor to believe and to find that Mr. S. Price Stevenson and his company were in fact engaged with Mr. Scott in the project. Stevenson for himself, and representing his company, was at the buildings almost daily, as has been testified to, during their construction, and they certainly had an interest in the building operations as well as in the premises originally purchased. After matters got into such a shape that all were sure it was a losing venture, Mr. Stevenson called upon Mr. Walter S. Sample, in whose name the title to the property was (and let me state here Mr. Scott testified that it was, in the name of Sample because of his, Scott’s, financial embarrassment), and desired Sample to sign a judgment note in favor of the Stevenson Company, Limited, for the amount of their claim against the houses. Eventually this was done, the judgment note entered, the writ issued, and the property sold under a fi. fa. on January 20, 1894.</p>

Price Stevenson to Mr. Thomas Bohannon, a merchant doing business in the city of Philadelphia, with whom Mr. S. Price Stevenson was connected in mercantile pursuits. The consideration for this assignment was paid by Mr. Stevenson, and although he was at the time indebted to Mr. Bohannon on other accounts, Mr. Bohannon gave him a note for this amount of the mortgage, and from the testimony it appears that the note has not been paid, though long overdue, and no demand has ever been made for the payment. On the day of the sale, January 20, 1894, which was held in the city of Chester on Market square, a lawyer by the name of Kendall B. Stokley, with an office at Walnut street, Philadelphia, appeared, and gave notice as a fact that the vacant lot alongside of the house had been released from the lien of the mortgage, and that the houses were hable for the whole amount of the mortgage. This, placing a larger incumbrance upon the houses, deterred bidders, and the houses were knocked down to a man by the name of Charles Morgan, who resides in Trinidad, Colorado.</p>

Morgan was asked by Mr. Harry Stevenson if he desired to invest some money in real estate in Chester. Acting upon this suggestion he came to Chester to look at the properties; he directed Harry Stevenson to purchase it for him. Mr. Morgan had never been here before.
