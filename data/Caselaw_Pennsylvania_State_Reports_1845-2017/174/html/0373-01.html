Pending the litigation, the attorney, a comparative stranger to the testator, without consultation with or having present any of testator’s friends or relatives, privately prepared and had executed by testator two wills, in both of which the attorney was named as one of the legatees and sole executor, and both of which were witnessed by him. When testator stated to the attorney as a reason for making him a legatee that he wished' to provide compensation for his contemplated services in the lunacy proceedings, the attorney did not inform the testator that, if successful, his property, ample wherewith to remunerate the attorney, would be restored to him, and if unsuccessful, that a fee would be allowed by the court out of testator’s estate. He also neglected to inform testator that the amount of the legacy was out of all proportion to the services he would be called upon to render. <em>Held, </em>that the legal presumption of undue influence arising from the condition of the testator and the confidential relations of the parties must be removed by evidence on the part of those asserting the validity of the will.</p>

From tMs principle I take leave to enter my dissent. This principle is founded on the notion, contrary to the current of the decisions, that a lucid interval is presumed to continue; whereas it is well known that a man insane may <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>-be well to-day, insane to-morroAV, better tbe next day and hopelessly diseased the third. To allow the jury to make snch an inference would be most unsatisfactory, and may lead to great imposition on that unfortunate class of persons who need so much the protection of the courts. Fraud would be the inevitable result, as the artful and designing would seize the proper time, when the mind was prostrated by disease to obtain from them a disposition of their estate. The very fact that no evidence is given bearing on the act of execution is sufficient to expose its dangerous tendency and its certainly to mislead. It certainly imposes no hardship to require that, under such circumstances, evidence of the most unexceptionable kind and character, bearing on the very act of disposition, and confined to the time of execution, should be given. Stringent rules only can protect persons placed in this melancholy condition. It is much better, in this country at least, where the law makes an equal distribution of estates, that a person should die intestate, than to expose them to the risk of imposition and fraud at the instance of persons interested to deceive them.”</p>

I took occasion to read the will over to him (Joshua) in the presence of ’Squire Russell, after he had given me other directions concerning the execution of it. He stated he wanted the name of Robert Hoopes added and all the different parties to be given an equal part; the first will would make seventeen parts, which he divided Ms estate into, and the second eighteen parts he divided Ms estate into. I finished writing the will there in Ms presence, saw him sign it; he asked me to sign as a witness, wMch I did, and also ’Squire Russell.” . . . “ When the second will was executed I took occasion to ask Mm the same question, what he thought his property was worth, in the presence of ’Squire Russell, and I tlfink George Harris was in, too, after the will was executed; he was not in until it was executed. He said in the presence of the ’squire and George Harris that his real estate was worth $10,000, and he thought he was worth altogether about $40,000. I explained to him that my legacy with the others was one eighteenth of $40,000, and he said he knew that, that he understood that; I think I said to him ‘You knew that means about $2,000? ’ Yes, he understood what he was doing. He seemed to be in good health, reasonably good health for an old man.” Upon cross-examination he testified: “ Q. When he told you he was worth $40,000 did you ask him how he made it up? A. No, I did not undertake to ask him how he made it up at the time the will was executed. Q. Did you at any time ask Mm how he made it up? A. No, I only discussed these various matters with Mm and left it in that shape. Q. Did not you tMnk it was a singular matter for a man to say he was worth $40,000 on the basis you have given us now as his property? Didn’t it occur to you that it was? A. No, not under the circumstances, because he said he had been told by a lawyer he was worth that much.” His testimony as to what took place the day the will was executed was: “We shook hands with Joshua about the first thing when we got into the room. I took him to one side and said to Mm that I <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>had the will partly written and had the old will with me, and asked him who he wanted added; I told him I had written the will over and had left out the provision concerning Ingram. He said that was all right. I told him that it was the same and he said that was right, that he wanted one name added and that was Robert Hoopes, of West Chester. Robert, he said,had been kind in his attentions and called to see him occar sionally, which some of his cousins did not do, and he would like to favor him a little, too. I finished the will before it was signed, I asked the ’squire to listen, and I read the will over to J oshua in the presence of the ’squire. The ’ squire heard me read the whole will, I gave J oshua and the ’squire my reasons why I was named in it as a legatee, and wanted to remove anything like suspicion. After I read the will over, I asked him if that was all right; he said, ‘ Yes, that is my will, I will sign it,’ and he went and got his own pen and ink, and sat down and signed the will. I asked him in the presence of the ’squire about his property, what he considered himself worth, so that the ’squire might hear that. He said his real estate was worth $10,000 andhe considered himself worth about $40,000. Geprge Harris was in that time, he came in immediately after the will was signed.
