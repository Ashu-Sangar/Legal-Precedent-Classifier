The contingency, upon the happening of which the gift over takes effect, might not occur during any number of successive lives — might never occur. It is “ if at any future time.” The rule is that a limitation over is too remote if it must not take effect within a life or lives in being and twenty-one years and nine months thereafter. The question is not whether it may take effect within that period, but whether it must. If it must not, ex necessitate, then it is void as too remote and tending to a perpetuity: Smith v.

That case can, however, be distinguished from this, in that a time was fixed within which the contingency was to happen, when the gift over was to take effect. Be that as it may, we have a recent act of assembly in this state, act of May 9, 1889, P.

It is true the individuals interested therein may, but how can a corporation, as such, be said to give “ sympathy or countenance ” to any cause, or to commit any act of “ proscription against any person engaged in the business of manufacturing or selling liquor,” and who is to decide whether the liquor so manufactured “ will intoxicate when used to excess,” or whether the person engaged in the manufacture is “ of good moral character.” It seems to the auditing judge that this clause of this will can never be construed by what appears within it.</p>

It is not aimed at an opinion on a question of morals, but at the unmistakable acts which such opinion usually prompts. It is well known that more than one third of the legal voters of the commonwealth approve the so-called “pernicious fallacy” which the testator detested, and they actively aided and tried to give it effect by law; we know this, because they voted for constitutional prohibition; in their respective precincts, their opinion was in most cases known to their neighbors and friends, because in many ways they announced their purpose to vote that opinion. Churches and societies held meetings at which speakers advocated prohibition; and the same churches and societies adopted resolutions favorable to it. And since that election, those holding that opinion, in their sincere conviction as to its rightfulness, have not ceased <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>to promulgate it by all lawful means. Is there any more uncertainty in determining who are prohibitionists and that they aid, encourage and support prohibition than in pointing out republicans, democrats, Catholics, Presbyterians or Methodists, or those who support, aid, sympathize with or countenance these respective political parties and religious creeds? Nor does the fact that the legatees are corporations necessarily render it doubtful whether they have brought themselves within the terms of the forfeiture. The members of the corporations can hold and advocate individual opinions on this question wholly at variance with those of the testator; this fact would not in the least degree affect the right of the corporation to the legacy. But a majority of the members of a corporation may act through the corporation’s agents, officers and managers. If these last, by authority of the corporation, aid or' encourage what the testator calls the “ pernicious fallacy,” the legacy is forfeited.</p>

Certainly their candor is commendable, as this virtue must always be under such circumstances. It cost them something, the amount of these legacies, to say, in effect, that they were prohibitionists, and would aid and sympathize with the view apparently so obnoxious to the testator.
