    <p class="summary" id="b37-8" data-blocks='[["BL_37.8",37,[190,1309,1165,1064]]]'>Notwithstanding the able report of the auditor we are of opinion that he has reached an erroneous conclusion as to the disposition of the fund in dispute. In plain language the proposition may be thus stated. The testator bequeathed $5,000 to a trustee. The interest to be paid to A and after her death the principal to B. The fund passed into the hands of the trustee and from that time it was no longer part of the testator’s estate. But two persons were then interested in it, the tenant for life and the remainder-man, and to them alone was the trustee answerable. He held the fund for their use alone. Its increase or decrease affected no one else. The remainder-man could have purchased the life estate and thus become absolute owner of the fund, and surely if this had been done no one after the death of A could have claimed an interest in the accretions. The fallacy of the argument consists in treating the bequest as of the interest to Mary Axe of $5,000 only and to the hospital of only that amount. It was a “ fund ” that the testator referred to when speaking of “ the five thousand dollars ” and not of that particular sum. After it had once been separated from the principal of the estate it vested in the two beneficiaries who might suffer if it decreased or be benefited by its increase.</p>
