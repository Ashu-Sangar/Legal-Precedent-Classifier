L.' 626. Let it be granted for present purposes, that that proviso stands unrepealed by act April 9, 1867, secs. 11 and 12, and applies to certificates issued since that enactment. It is clear that any certificate, granted to a teacher is a “ license ” (see sec. 12) to him to pursue- a certain avocation and to seek a certain public employment, which, with-. out it, he cannot pursue or seek. That right, during the period for which the certificate is granted to him, is a valuable property in his hands, just as a right to practice as an attorney of a court is property in the hands of him who has been admitted to it; Ex parte Steinman, <a href="/pa/95/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="95 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="492909" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0220-01">95 Pa. 220</a>. The annulment of a teacher’s certificate is the destruction of his property. No man, in this state, can be deprived of Ms property except by a proceeding judicial in its nature, and as such mvolving as an indispensable requisite an opportunity of being heard: Brown v.

That opportunity the act of May 18, 1854, P.

McVeigh, <a href="/us/93/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="93 U.S. 274" data-case-ids="5646733" data-case-paths="/us/93/0274-01">93 U.

Where, however, a thing to be done is a condition precedent to the exercise of a power granted, it is essential to the existence of the power, and being of the essence thereof, must be strictly observed: Norwegian Str., <a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%20849" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="81 Pa. 849">81 Pa. 849</a>; Reading v.

If it is not, the attempt to exercise the power cannot be otherwise than ultra vires.

L. 626, empowers the superintendent to annul the certificate treated of in the preceding part of the section, “ giving at least ten days’ previous notice thereof, in writing, to the teacher holding it,” etc. The unmistakable meaning of this language is, that the teacher whose certificate it is intended to annul shall have notice of that intention preceding its consummation, and ten days from the giving of the notice within which to be heard in his defense.
