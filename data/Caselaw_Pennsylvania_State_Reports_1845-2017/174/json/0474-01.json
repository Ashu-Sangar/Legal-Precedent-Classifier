Before EndLICH, J.\nAt the trial it appeared that the plaintiffs are the owners of a lot of ground in the city of Beading, running from Penn street to Cherry street, upon which buildings are erected. On the Cherry street end stand two small brick houses, Nos. 609 and 611 Cherry street. Adjoining on the western side is the lot of the defendants, about 60 feet in width. In 1892 the defendants constructed a large building on the Cherry street end- to correspond with the store already standing on the Penn street end.\nThe evidence tended to show that the defendants\u2019 excavations were carried very considerably beneath the level of plaintiffs\u2019 foundation; that some of the soil underneath plaintiffs\u2019 foundation fell out; that no measures whatever looking towards the support of plaintiffs\u2019 wall were taken by defendants until part of the soil supporting it on defendants\u2019 side had been removed, nor indeed, until the wall showed signs of giving way, and the chimney attached to the kitchen had actually fallen; that afterwards two horizontal props were run in under the brick part of the wall, upheld on defendants\u2019 property and in plaintiffs\u2019 cellar by perpendicular posts; that at some time, other props, two or three or more in number, were placed against the wall slanting upwards from defendants\u2019 property; that neither of these expedients taken alone, nor both of them applied simultaneously, were reasonably sufficient, according to described customary methods, to protect the structure from injury by sinking, and that it was so injured.\nDefendants presented, among others, the following point:\n2. Under all the evidence in the case the verdict should be for the defendant. Answer: Declined. [2]\nVerdict for plaintiffs for $850.
