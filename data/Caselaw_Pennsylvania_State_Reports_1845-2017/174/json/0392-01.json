It was plaintiff\u2019s duty to sit between the screen and a sheave wheel, revolving parallel with and eighteen inches or two feet from\u2018it, and as the coal came up to pick out from it the pieces of slate and refuse and throw them into a box at his side. In the immediate vicinity other screens and wheels were revolving, ears were being run and dumped, and an elevator was hoisting coal. Plaintiff had been employed at this screen for about a day, when in making a turn his arm was caught by the spokes of the sheave wheel, and he was carried around the wheel and severely injured. Held, that the case was for the jury.\nArgued Feb. 24, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 394, Jan. T., 1896, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Wayne Co., March T., 1894, No. 202, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum and Mitchell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Purdy, P. J.\nPlaintiff in his statement averred that he was injured on November 20,1883, while employed by the defendant as a slate picker, and placed at work in a small space either between a canvas screen and a revolving wheel, or by the side of the canvas screen and close to the wheel by its side or in front of the said wheel; with averment that \u201c said injuries were occasioned through the fault and negligence of the said defendant in placing the plaintiff in so hazardous a position, and in not cautioning him or explaining to him the dangers attending his labors, and in not placing fenders or some protection between plaintiff\u2019s position while at duty and the said wheel, and in not otherwise attending to the safety of the plaintiff while in the performance of his said duties.\u201d\nAt the trial it appeared that at the time of the accident plaintiff was about ten years old. He was placed by tbe foreman of the defendants at a revolving canvas screen to pick coal, but was not given any special instruction. The canvas screen was used as a carrier on which coal was carried from a point below a dock diagonally up through an open space in the dock floor to a point above, where it emptied into a feeder from whence it passed to boats below. Plaintiff occupied a position between the canvas screen from which he was to pick the slate, and a sheave wheel revolving parallel with the revolving screen. It was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to sit on a bench by the side of the canvas screen facing down the carrier, and as the coal came up to pick out from it the pieces of slate and refuse and throw them into a box at his side. The distance of the sheave wheel from the canvas screen was variously stated at from one and one half feet to two feet. In the immediate vicinity other screens and wheels were revolving, cars were being run and dumped, and an elevator was hoisting coal. Plaintiff had been employed at this screen for about a day, when in making a turn his arm was caught by the spokes of the sheave wheel, and he was carried around the wheel, and severely injured.\nDefendants\u2019 point among others was as follows:\n4. Under all the evidence in this case the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. Answer: That is refused.\nVerdict add judgment for plaintiff for $2,000. Defendants appealed.\nError assigned was above instruction, quoting it.\nHomer Greene, for appellants.\nA person of tender years accepts the risk of his employment in the same way as an adult, and it is only when the dangers connected with his employment are those that are not open and obvious to him that any warning is required: Brewer v.

Keim, 151 Pa. 117; Lineoski y. Susquehanna Coal Co., 157 Pa. 153.\nUntil the plaintiff has eliminated the possibility of other causes by giving sufficiently explicit evidence of the real cause of the accident, to show that it was due to the defendant\u2019s negligence, he cannot recover: Pittston Coal Co. v.
