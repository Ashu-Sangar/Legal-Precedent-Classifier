I also give my son C. a tract of woodland on MonocacyHill.....rated and valued to my said son at $200. The farm to be reckoned to him at $4,800. My said son C. shall pay annually to my beloved wife the sum of fifty dollars.\u201d Similar devises with similar charges were made to F. \u201c The real estate bequeathed to my sons F. and C. shall be for their use and support during their natural lives, and at their death shall descend to their children, if any; if no children, then to descend to the brothers and sisters and their children.\u201d Devises of absolute estates were made to the daughters with similar charges.
