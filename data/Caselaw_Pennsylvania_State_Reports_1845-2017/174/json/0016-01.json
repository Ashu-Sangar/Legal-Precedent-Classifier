Appeal of John Boyer et al.\nWill \u2014 Life tenant \u2014 Remainder-man\u2014Principal and income \u2014 Trust.\nWhere a fund is given to a trustee to invest and pay the income to a person for life, and after the death of such person to pay the principal to another, any increase in the value of the securities in which the fund is invested accrues to the remainder-man.\nTestator gave a fund of $5,000 to a trustee to be invested and to pay the income thereof to Mary Axe; after whose death the fund was to fall into the residue.of his estate. By a codicil he directed as follows: \u201c And the five Thousand Dollars of which Mary Axe receives the interest etc. during her natural life, I give and bequeath after her decease to The Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, to be paid to the said hospital one year after her decease without interest.\u201d Held that any accretion to the value of the fund belonged to the hospital.\nArgued Feb. 5,1896.\nAppeal, No. 88, Jan. T., 1896, by John Boyer et al., residuary legatees under will of John Boyer, deceased, from decree of O. C. Montgomery Co., sustaining exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nBefore Sterjrett, C. J., Gbeen, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of auditor, John W. Bickel, Esq.\nThe material portion of testator\u2019s will was as follows:\n\u201c Second: I give and bequeath to my said friend Daniel Longaker, in Trust Ten Thousand Dollars, to be by him funded or vested either in one, or two equal sums, in some safe fund, or funds, stock or stocks, mortgage, or other security and pay annually to my nephew John Boyer, and to Mary Axe, (who is now living with me) in equal sums, the interest, dividends, or profits thereof first deducting out of said interest or dividends &c., the cost charges or commission, and the receipt of Mary Axe only whether sole or married shall be a valid discharge of the payment of her part, during their natural lives, respectively:\n\u201cAnd upon the decease of either of them, then the Principal sum of 5000 Dolls., of which such dece-\\ V dent received the interest &c. while living, shall be 1 1 taken as, and constitute, part of the balance and,/ / residue of my estate.\u2014 \u201d\n^Destination altered see Codicil dated Nov. 15,1864.\nThe codicil was as follows:\n\u201c The Five Thousand Dollars of which my nephew John Boyer receives the interest &c. during his natural life I give & bequeath after his decease to the \u2018 Divinity School of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia \u2019 to be paid to the said Divinity School, one year after his decease without interest:\u2014 And The Five Thousand Dollars of which Mary Axe receives the interest &c. during her natural life, I give and bequeath after her decease to \u2018 The Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia,\u2019 to be paid to the said Hospital one year after her decease without interest, and do hereby revoke my foregoing will, so far as it may interfere with the final destination of the said 10,000 Dollars. \u2014 \u201d\nAccretions to the value of the fund of $5,000 invested for Mary Axe and the hospital were awarded by the auditor to the residuary legatees.\nExceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were sustained by the court. Weand, J., filing the following opinion:\nNotwithstanding the able report of the auditor we are of opinion that he has reached an erroneous conclusion as to the disposition of the fund in dispute. In plain language the proposition may be thus stated. The testator bequeathed $5,000 to a trustee. The interest to be paid to A and after her death the principal to B. The fund passed into the hands of the trustee and from that time it was no longer part of the testator\u2019s estate. But two persons were then interested in it, the tenant for life and the remainder-man, and to them alone was the trustee answerable. He held the fund for their use alone. Its increase or decrease affected no one else. The remainder-man could have purchased the life estate and thus become absolute owner of the fund, and surely if this had been done no one after the death of A could have claimed an interest in the accretions. The fallacy of the argument consists in treating the bequest as of the interest to Mary Axe of $5,000 only and to the hospital of only that amount. It was a \u201c fund \u201d that the testator referred to when speaking of \u201c the five thousand dollars \u201d and not of that particular sum. After it had once been separated from the principal of the estate it vested in the two beneficiaries who might suffer if it decreased or be benefited by its increase.\nNo one questions the right of A to receive the income of the original amount and its accretions, and for the same reason the remainder-man is entitled to the whole fund after the death of A. This of course is based upon the conclusion that there was no intestacy as to any part of the fund, upon which finding we agree with the auditor.\nAnd now September 16,' 1895, the exceptions filed by Holland & Dettra for the heirs at law of the testator are dismissed, and the exceptions filed by the Hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia are sustained, and distribution is made as follows:\nAmount for distribution, . 16,881.55\nExpense of audit; advertising, \u00a1 5.00\nClerk O. C.,...... 10.00\nAuditor and type writing, 150.00\nTrustee accountant for overdraft and int., 698.T5 \u2014 86S.75\n$6,017.80\nTo the hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia, or Montg. Evans, Atty., $6,017.80\nError assigned was above decree.\nN. H. Lamiere, B. P. Ohain and Irvin P. Knipe, with him, for appellants.\nA bequest of the residue, or remainder of personal estate, or words of similar import, gives to the legatee everything which may accrue by accident or contingency, and which may not appear to be specifically disposed of: Nyce\u2019s Est., 5 W. & S. 254.\nThe question in expounding a \u201c will, is not what testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words: \u201d Hancock\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 582; Reck\u2019s App., 78 Pa. 432; Middleswarth v. Blackmore, 74 Pa. 414.\nMontgomery Evans, Joseph B. Townsend and Louis M. Qhilds with him, for appellee.\nThe rise in the value of trust investments, like a rise in the value of lands held in trust, has always been regarded as an accretion of the principal, and, therefore, belonging to the remainder-man: Schofield v. Mackinlay, 32 L. J. Ch. 627.\nFebruary 17, 1896 :"
