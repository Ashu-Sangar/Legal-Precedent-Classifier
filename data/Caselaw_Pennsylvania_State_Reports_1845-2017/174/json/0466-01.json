Appended to the affidavit are copies of the charter of the defendant corporation and of the opinion of the Supreme Court in Krecker v. Shirey, 163 Pa. 534. The objection taken in the affidavit to the service of fhe summons was, at the argument, admitted by defendant\u2019s counsel to be untenable.\nDo any or all of these allegations constitute such an answer to the plaintiff\u2019s demand as to disentitle her to judgment at this time?\n(1) As respects third parties, the acts of de facto officers of a corporation are binding upon it: Angel\u00ed & Ames, Corp. sec. 287; Field, Corp. sec. 180; and equally binding are executed contracts entered into by a corporation de facto: 2 Morawetz, Priv. Corp. sec. 750-752. Neither do the illegal acts nor the misbehavior of the members or officers of a corporation affect the validity of lawful contracts made with it: Reg. v. D\u2019Eyncourt, 4 B. & S. 820 (nom. Hughes v. D\u2019Eyncourt, 116 Engl. C. L. Rep. 819); Hoboken B. Assn. v. Martin, 18 N. J. Eq., 428. One who had given the defendant corporation his obligation could not escape liability thereon by reason of the acts charged against the officers and members of the same in this affidavit. Neither can the corporation avoid liability on that ground to one to whom it has given its obligation. There was nothing unlawful in the giving of them, so far as appears from this affidavit; and what is not alleged in an affidavit is taken not to exist: Lord v. Ocean Bank, 20 Pa. 384.\n(2) The allegation of want of opportunity for examining into the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claim is unavailing. Even where there has been a demand and a refusal of permission .to inspect books or accounts in the possession or control of plaintiff (which can scarcely be said to be here alleged), the only proper course for a defendant to pursue is to show his inability to make an affidavit of defense without such inspection, and to ask for a suspension of the rule for judgment until an opportunity properly to inform himself is afforded: Lord v. Ocean Bank, supra; Leibersperger v. Sav. Bank, 30 Pa. 531; Allen v. Bank, 10 W. N. 188; Kelly v. Livingston, 1 W. N. 95.\n(3) That defendant is advised that the notes in suit appear to be upon their faces the individual notes of the makers thereof, and that the corporation cannot be held upon them, is not a denial of the fact averred in the statement that the money they represent was loaned to the corporation, and that the notes were made in its behalf by persons duly authorized thereto. Under the procedure act of 1887, the affidavit of defense is made to the statement, not to the copy of the cause of action filed, and whatever averments contained in the statement are not denied by the affidavit must, upon a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, be taken as admitted: Ashman v. Weigley, 148 Pa. 61; Ins. Co. v. Groff, 154 Pa. 200. I do not understand this to apply to averments so inconsistent with the cause of action as to be legally incapar ble of proof. But the fact that a note is so executed by an agent as not to disclose his principal, and therefore to make it prima facie his individual note (and it seems clear to me that such is the appearance of these notes: Campbell v. Baker, 2 W. 83; Sharpe v. Beilis, 61 Pa. 69; Quigley v. DeHaas, 82 Pa. 267), does not, rights of parties misled by such appearance being ont of the way, preclude proof that it was intended to bind, and was in reality the note of the principal: Seyfert, Mc-Manus & Co. v. Lowe, 7 W. N. 39 ,\u2022 Markley v. Quay, 8 W. N. 145; 1 Rand., C. P. sec. 136; for parol evidence is admissible, in case of doubt, to show that the corporation, and not its agent, was to be bound: Field, Corp. sec. 198. That is the averment of plaintiff\u2019s declaration here. The notes are said to have been executed, etc., \u201c in behalf \u201d of the corporation. That means \u201c for \u201d it: Anderson\u2019s Law. Diet., ad verb \u201cfor.\u201d A note, however, .executed by one \u201c for \u201d another is executed by the former as agent for the latter: Campbell v. Baker, supra; Wright v. Weakly, 2 W. 89; and see Hoffa v. Building Assn., C. P. Berks County, No. 1, Jan. T., 1891, M. L. D. And if it was done by one \u201cduly\u201d \u2014 that is \u201clawfully:\u201d (Ins. Co. v. Groff, supra, cases at p. 201) \u2014 authorized and empowered, it is the note of the principal, and not of the agent. Not being denied by the affidavit, this averment must be taken as admitted. ' If it is true, however, it seems the plaintiff may sue the corporation in her own name, says the act, May 28, 1715, 1 Sec. 90:\n\u201c All bonds, specialties and notes in writing .... may by the person or persons to whom the same .... are made payable, be signed .... to such person or persons as shall think fit to accept thereof; \u201d and \u201c it shall .... be lawful for the person or persons to whom the said bonds, specialties or notes are assigned .... in his or their own name, or names, to commence and prosecute his, her or their actions at law for the recovery of the money mentioned in such bonds, specialties or notes,\u201d etc.\nThe provision of sec. 8, that the assignment shall be under seal and before two or more credible witnessess,t applies, in terms, only to bonds and specialties.\n(4) Understood as intended to question the fact that the money represented by the fl,200 note was loaned to the corporation, the allegation that, if loaned at all, it was loaned to the seceding, and not to the loyal members, is insufficient as being an hypothetical, instead of a positive statement, under Damm v.' Ortlieb, 1 W. N. 576. On the other hand, if it was intended to intimate that the recipients had departed from the lawful purposes of the incorporation, its force as a defense is disposed of by what has been said above.\n(5) The fact that there was a report of a less indebtedness of the defendant corporation than that here sought to be enforced, can scarcely be of any significance. It would hardly be supposed that the statement of a debtor to a third party that he owed the plaintiff nothing upon, or less than the face of, obligations of the debtor held by the plaintiff, would be evidence in the former\u2019s favor upon a trial. And if' it is not, it is of no avail in an affidavit of defense: Hendel v. Assur. Co., 2 Distr. R. 116, and cases there cited. A conspiracy, however, between the makers of the notes in suit and the plaintiff, to subject the defendant corporation to a liability which does not, in law and equity, exist, is not averred in the affidavit. The only thing that is averred is an intention on the part of the plaintiff and the former officers of the coloration, in accepting service of the summons, to bring about a sheriff\u2019s sale of the defendant\u2019s property, etc. But, in the first place, that does not go to the consideration of the notes, or the right to enforce them; in the second place, it may be avoided by payment of what is due upon them, and in the absence thereof is an undoubted right of the plaintiff; and, finally, the objections to the service are withdrawn if, indeed, the filing of an affidavit to the merits is not, in itself, a waiver of such objection, because that is an actual appearance: Hickernell v. Bank, 62 Pa. 146, 148; Morton v. Hoodless, 1 Miles, 46.\nIn the absence of any positive denial that, in good conscience, the defendant owes the plaintiff the money she is seeking to recover, I am of the opinion that there is nothing in this affidavit that can amount to an available legal or equitable defense; and therefore the rule to show cause is made absolute.\nError assigned was order making absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nQyrus Q-. Derr, Ritchie $ Esher, and Aug. S. Sassaman with him, for appellant.\nWhere a contest as to corporate identity between two parties, each of whom claims to be the corporation, has been decided in favor of one or the other of them, the suecessful party cannot npon any reasonable theory be compelled to pay the debts incurred by the unsueeessful party, excepting perhaps, in so far as the debts may have been contracted for the necessary maintenance or preservation of the corporate property: Krecker v. Shirey, 163 Pa. 534; 4 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 198.\nNo recovery can be had against a corporation upon a promissory note which has nothing upon its face indicative of an intent to bind the corporation, and this, though the suit be brought by the original payee, unless perhaps where it is alleged and shown by a proper measure of extrinsic evidence that the note was intended to have been that of the corporation, and that fitting words to so make it were omitted by accident or mistake: Stackpole v. Arnold, 11 Mass. 27; Pentz v. Stanton, 10 Wendell, 272; Packard v. Nye, 2 Metc. 47; Chick v. Trevett, 20 Me. 464; Powers v. Briggs, 97 Ill. 493; Tassey v. Church, 4 W. & S. 346; Seyfert, McManus & Co. v. Lowe, 7 W. N. C. 39; Roberts v. Austin, 5 Wharton, 313; Phillips v. Meilly, 106 Pa. 536.\nWhere an action is based upon a promissory note which upon its face evidenced an indebtedness not by, but to, the defendant, or which is at least equally consistent with an indebtedness to, as with and indebtedness by the defendant, no judgment can be entered as to the note for want of an affidavit of defense, unless the plaintiff\u2019s statement contains helping averments showing the indebtedness upon the note to be that of the defendant.\nJefferson Snyder, of Baer \u00a3 Snyder, Philip S. Zieber with him, for appellee.\nA contract made by one on behalf of another prima facie imports that the former made the contract only as agent: 2 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 164; Lewis v. Nicholson, 18 Q. B. 502.\nA corporation acts only through its agent and its officers who are its agents. It is a well established rule of law, that when an agent names his principal, the principal is responsible, not the agent: Roberts v. Austin, 5 Whart. 314.\nQyrus Gr. Derr, William Bitohie and JEdward B. Usher with him, for appellant, in reply.\nThese notes on their face disclose no liability on the part of this defendant. Plaintiff has not supported her \u201chelping\u201d averments with her oath, and yet such averments are absolutely necessary to connect defendant with the alleged cause of action. Under these circumstances, no affidavit of defense is required to prevent judgment: Vulcanite Co. v. Phila. Tr. Co., 2 Pa. C. C. 375; Ins. Co. v. Brierly, 10 W. N. C. 45; Bradford v. Bradford, 1 Clark, 209; Pennypacker v. C. & A. R. R., 3 Penny. 402; Wall v. Dovey, 60 Pa. 213 ; Hummell v. Singer, 1 Pearson, 17.\nMarch 7, 1896 :"
