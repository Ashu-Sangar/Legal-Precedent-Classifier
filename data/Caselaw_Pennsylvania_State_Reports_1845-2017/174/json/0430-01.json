T., 1896, by the National Bank of Chambersburg and other general creditors of the Mont Alto Iron Company, from order of C. P. Franklin Co., in equity, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Williams, McCollum, Mitchell and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nThe auditor, G. D. McDowell, reported:\nFINDING OF FACTS.\nThat David Knepper was appointed receiver of the Mont Alto Iron Company on the 31st day of December, 1891, and as receiver filed his first and partial account on the 9th day of August, 1892; that an auditor was appointed to make distribution of the balance in said first and partial account and his report was confirmed November 14, 1892.\n'That the Mont Alto Iron Company is a corporation duly incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania with a capital stock of $150,000, divided into one hundred and fifty shares of the par value of $1,000 each; having been incorporated September 6, 1889.\nThat its business and for which it was incorporated is the manufacturing of steel or iron, or both, or any article of commerce from metal or wood; to purchase, lease, mortgage or sell real estate or mineral rights; to construct buildings, and, in fact, all things necessary for the manufacture of iron, steel, and other metals in any shape or form and its shipment to market.\nThat the realty of the Mont Alto Iron Company consists of eighteen thousand three hundred and twenty-eight acres, three hundred and twenty acres of which are used for farming purposes; the remainder consisting mostly of timber land and upon which are located the buildings, mines, etc., necessary for the production of iron,' steel, and the other purposes included in its charter.\nThat on the 4th day of April, 1890, the said Mont Alto Iron Company executed a mortgage to Hastings Gehr and Charles E. Coffin, trustees to secure the full and final payment of one hundred and fifty bonds of the value of $1,000 each; that this mortgage is a lien on all the real estate of the said company and covers all its personalty as well.\nThat the aforesaid bonds have coupons attached, and bear interest at the rate of five per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the first days of February and August of each and every year, and are redeemable August 1, 1909.\nThat none of the coupons attached to the bonds have been paid since August 1, 1891.\nThat the mortgage, given by the Mont Alto Iron Company to Hastings Gehr and Charles E. Coffin, trustees to secure the payment of its bonds, is made payable August 1, 1909; that foreclosure could be had on this mortgage for default of payment on the bond coupons but no effort has ever been made to do so.\nThat there are unpaid state and county taxes, also unpaid school and road taxes owing by the Mont Alto Iron Company; their respective amounts, kinds, and the years for which they were assessed are fully set forth in the schedule of distribution. All of said taxes were assessed since the appointment of the receiver.\nThat in reference to these said taxes the master and examiner in his report found as a conclusion of law \u201c that none of the unpaid county, school and road taxes are liens upon the real estate of the Mont Alto Iron Company; and further, that as they all have been assessed since the appointment of the receiver, they are incidental and unavoidable expenses connected with the conduct of the affairs of the Mont Alto Iron Company by the receiver, and incurred during his efforts to wind up its affairs, and that the personal property in the hands of the receiver is liable for their payment.\u201d\nThat Henry Daniels offers a claim against the company for threshing grain and asks that the same be paid in full as a preferred labor claim. That the said claim was presented to the auditor in the distribution of the first and partial account and disallowed by him as a preferred labor claim.\nThat the Mont Alto Iron Company is largely insolvent.\nCONCLUSIONS ON LAW.\n1st. The audit costs should first be paid.\n2d. The state and county, school and road taxes assessed since the appointment of the receiver should be paid in full.\n8d. That as the mortgage given to secure the bondholders embraces both the real and personal property of the Mont Alto Iron Company, the face value of the bonds as also the unpaid coupons due upon said bonds, should be entitled to a pro-rata distribution of the fund as well as the general creditors.\nExceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were dismissed -by the court, Stewart, P. J., filing the following opinion :\nThe insolvency of the Mont Alto Iron Company was alleged and admitted when the receiver was appointed. The appointment was not made to bridge over an emergency and continue-the business of the company, but that the assets of an insolvent concern might be held, preserved and distributed in an equitable manner to and among those entitled thereto. The business of the corporation was the manufacture of charcoal iron. It owned a furnace and a landed estate from which it derived its supply of ore and coal. When the receiver was appointed, it had on hand a considerable quantity of mined ore and charcoal. There was no adequate or compensating market for the raw materials, and it was apparent to the court that if these were to avail the creditors at all, it would have to be by employing them in the manufacture of iron at the company\u2019s furnace. The receiver under authority obtained from the court, continued to operate the furnace until these supplies were exhausted. It is now nearly four years since the receivership began, and as appears by the second account, which is now before us for consideration, nearly all the assets, not including the real estate, have been converted. The fund for distribution arises from the sale of iron, farm products and other personal property, and the main controversy is between the general creditors of the company and the holders of certain bonds amounting to $150,000, which are secured by a mortgage on the real estate. The effort on the part of the general creditors is to exclude the bonds from participation, on the ground that, inasmuch as they do not mature until 1909, their payment is not now demandable. This position mistakes the nature and character of the receivership, and the character of the fund for distribution as well. It may be that where a receiver is appointed to avoid a temporary suspension or interruption of the business, which would likely prove disastrous to all interests, as in case of a railroad, general creditors would be allowed preference over the bondholders, in the net proceeds realized by the receiver from the conduct of the business, on the principle, that the status of all parties in interest is to be preserved with a view to a restoration of the concern to its own proper management. In such cases no injustice is done the bondholders by excluding them from participation in the distribution of the income. But that is not this case. Here the corporation was confessedly insolvent, without, possibility of rehabilitation, and there was but one thing to do, convert its assets and equitably distribute them. The fund for distribution can in no sense be called income or earnings; it results from sales of materials, manufactured iron, products from the land or general personal property, all indicating a final winding up of the business of the concern. In said case, the functions of the receiver are hardly distinguishable from those of an assignee, except that the receiver acts at all times under the immediate direction and authority of the court; and indeed the whole proceeding assimilates itself to an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Were this an assignment by the Mont Alto Iron Company, no question could have arisen as to the right of the bondholders to come in upon the fund, notwithstanding their bonds were not due. We fail to see why they should be in less favorable position under a receivership.\nThe auditor allowed them to participate, and in this we think he was right.\nHolding to this view, we can see no reason why the receiver should make any distinction between what was derived from sales of personal property, and what was derived from the land; between what was expended for the conversion of the one, and what was expended in the maintenance and preservation of the other. It is not a case of two distinct funds, each belonging to a distinct class of creditors, but a common fund from which all expenses are to be taken, leaving a remainder in which all creditors are to participate ratably.\nThe auditor has allowed the taxes in full which were assessed during the period covered by the receivership. In this we think he was correct also. If the labor and other expenses incident to conducting the business of the furnace and the farms is to he paid by the receiver, why not the taxes ? All are alike debts incurred by the court in the administration of the trust.\nException is taken to several findings of facts by the auditor which, in view of what we have already said, it is not necessary to inquire into. Whatever the truth be with respect to them, the conclusions indicated would in no wise be affected thereby. In other words, the disputed facts are not material.\nWe therefore overrule all the exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, not including however that which relates to the claim of Henry Daniels. The presentation of this claim before the auditor who distributed the balance on a former account, and the acceptance of a pro rata distribution, should not preclude the claimant from now insisting upon his right to a preference of wages. The auditor should have passed upon his question of right of preference.\nWe think his claim fully established by the evidence; but to send the report back for correction in this matter, would delay the distribution of a larger fund. This can be avoided by allowing this claim to await the next or final distribution, and this we propose to do. [And now, March 12, 1895, all exceptions to the report of George D.' McDowell, Esq., auditor, appointed to pass upon exceptions to the second account of David Knepper, receiver of the Mont Alto Iron Co., and make distribution of balance, are dismissed, saving however to Henry Daniels the right to submit his claim for wages as a preferred claim before the auditor who may he appointed to make another and further distribution of the assets of the Mont Alto Iron Co. without prejudice, and the report of the auditor is now confirmed, and the receiver, David Knepper, is ordered to pay out the funds in his hands, in accordance therewith.] [7]\nErrors assigned among others were (7) decree of the court as above, quoting it; (8) in allowing the mortgage and coupons to participate in the distribution; (9) in allowing the taxes assessed against the real estate to participate in the distribution.\nWalter K.
