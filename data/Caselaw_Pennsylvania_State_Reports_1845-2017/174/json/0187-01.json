It gave to a married woman the power to dispose of her property by will \u201c in writing signed by her or manifested by her mark or cross made by her at the end thereof in the same manner as if she were unmarried.\u201d Mrs. Grubb, the late wife of the appellant, made her will and signed it at the end thereof. Her signature has been duly proved, and the will admitted to probate. This was authorized by the act of 1887 and the act is both constitutional and wise. The will was written in three chapters or sections on three different pieces of paper, each of which was signed by the testator. All of the sections are necessary to a complete testamentary disposition of her property and taken together they constitute her will. While the statements or some of them found in the third section of the will do not show the highest development of wifely affection, they cannot be set aside for that reason.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

D. Grubb of the Borough of West Chester, County of Chester, and State of Pennsylvania, do make this my will, being of sound mind and body, influenced by no one,\n\u201cTo Laura D. Owen, I leave the house No. 600 South High St. to be clear of all debt and all the contents belonging to me, just as it stands, also to her the sum of $10,000, in her own name, to be kept in her own name. She can use it to the best of her advantage. Signed\n\u201c WILLIAMANNA H. D. GRUBB.\u201d\n\u201cWest Chester, June 7th, 1892.\n\u201c To Carrie D. Speakman, Chauneey Darlington, Harry L.

All debts and funeral expenses to be paid promptly, peaceably, without trouble or delay soon after my death, honestly and right.\n\u201c Chauncey to receive no pay for settling up my estate. This is written in my own hand writing, of sound mind and body, influenced by no one.\n\u201c Witness my hand and seal this 7th day of June, A. D., 1892.\nSigned\n\u201c Williamanna H. D.

Grubb do make this my last will and wishes to he strictly carried out regardless of law or man. Wilson Grubb I cut short of everything belonging to me, personal or real for their falsehoods, abuse and disrespect generally to me. He never kept me in anything, I was no expense to him in any way. If there was any keeping done I kept him and his son Frank a good home and no expense to them and in many other things. I wish this strictly carried out to the very letter.\n\u201c Wilson Grubb always considered he had married in such a low family and low woman and very often told me so, also my sister Carrie. The family being so low and the money coming from the family to me is also contaminated with the familys impurities. I do not wish to injure his excellence or contaminate his pure, refined, noble, truthful character by receiving anything so impure as the low Darlington money.\n\u201c If the law should go contrary to my will and wishes, may it do them no good as they have no right to it under the circumstances. Wilson Grubb and son Frank were so abusive and disrespectful to me I was compelled to leave my own home No. 220 West Chestnut St. and them April 6th, 1892. All other wills or testimony of any description found or brought forth by any one are null and void and positively false. This is my own hand writing in my soler, cool senses, healthy lody and mind, advised and influenced by no one, only their abusive actions to me. Signed by myself in my right mind and senses this day June 7, 1892.\n\u201cWilliamanna H. D.
