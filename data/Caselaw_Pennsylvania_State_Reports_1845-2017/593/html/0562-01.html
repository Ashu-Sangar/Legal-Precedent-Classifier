However, the Supreme Court’s <em>Palmer </em>decision, on which the dissent principally relies, was one of statutory interpretation. While it did note that the "probability of trustworthiness" of ordinary business records "because they were routine reflections of the day to day operations of a business” was tire basis of the rule adopted by Congress, <em><a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="91" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">at 113-14</a>, 63 S.fct. at 480, it did not suggest that every form of document prepared in anticipation of litigation is attended by <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>circumstances indicating an affirmative <em>lack </em>of reliability, as required for exclusion under Section 6104(b). This is not to say that the courts should necessarily attach special trustworthiness to documents created by a police crime lab. It is worth noting, however, that a police forensic lab is not a “business” in the traditional sense, but rather, exists to promote the interests of justice. Thus, like the majority, I am equally unwilling to attach the label of untrustworthiness to crime lab reports merely because of their source. In short, absent some evidentiary support I see no reason to presume that a report issuing from such a lab in the regular course of its activities is likely to be unreliable for purposes of the Section 6104(b) exclusion.</p>

Business rec<a id="p579" href="#p579" data-label="579" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*579</a>ords prepared for the purposes of pending litigation can never be “in the regular course of business” for purposes of Rule 803(6). <em>Pompa v. Hojnacki, </em><a href="/pa/445/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="101" data-cite="445 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="1940030" data-case-paths="/pa/445/0042-01">445 Pa. 42</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=281%20A.2d%20886" class="citation" data-index="102" data-cite="281 A.2d 886">281 A.2d 886</a> (1971); <em>see State of Wisconsin v.

Turning again to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Palmer, </em>the Court explained that the basis for the exception was “to facilitate the admission of records which experience has shown to be quite trustworthy.” <a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="105" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">318 U.S. at 113</a>, <a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="106" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">63 S.Ct. 477</a>. Documents prepared in anticipation of litigation do not share this same trustworthiness. <em><a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="107" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">at 114</a>, <a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="108" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">63 S.Ct. 477</a>. Therefore, as the state police lab report in question was prepared for the sole purpose of prosecution, I cannot conclude it falls within the ambit of Rule 803(6).</p>
    <p id="b631-4" data-blocks='[["BL_631.4",631,[178,1142,1156,576]]]'>I also cannot join the majority’s alternative analysis, since I disagree that the report falls within Section 6104 of the Judicial Code. That section provides that “official records” shall be admissible . .. “unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.” 42 Pa.C.S. § 6104. Records prepared in anticipation of litigation are excluded from the business records exception because of their lack of trustworthiness. <em>Palmer, <a href="/us/318/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="109" data-cite="318 U.S. 109" data-case-ids="364179" data-case-paths="/us/318/0109-01">supra.</a> </em>Accordingly, I do not see how the result can be any different under § 6104, which similarly requires that the documents reach a certain level of trustworthiness in order to be admissible.</p>
