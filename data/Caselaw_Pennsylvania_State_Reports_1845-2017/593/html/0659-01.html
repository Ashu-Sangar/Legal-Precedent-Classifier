Appellant devised a plan to rob the Gateway Lodge, where both he and Bair previously worked as night watchmen. Due to their prior employment, <a id="p671" href="#p671" data-label="671" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*671</a>Appellant and Bair were familiar with the Gateway Lodge and knew that there was a safe and an ATM machine, both of which contained substantial amounts of cash. The participants intended that during the robbery, nobody would get hurt.</p>
    <p id="b723-5" data-blocks='[["BL_723.4",723,[174,576,1153,629]]]'>Appellant and Bair believed that the current night watchman, Christopher Lauth, would be inside the building when they arrived, either doing laundry or rounds. Once they gained entry to the building, the group planned to take control of Lauth and direct him to call Ann Lipford, assistant innkeeper and the daughter of the owners of the Gateway Lodge, who resided on the premises, to obtain the key or pin number in order to open the ATM machine. The group further planned to take the safe and open it upon returning to Appellant’s trailer. After completing the robbery, they planed to place Lipford and Lauth inside the kitchen’s walk-in freezer with a sign indicating they were in there.</p>
    <p id="b723-6" data-blocks='[["BL_723.5",723,[172,1231,1153,417]]]'>Although Appellant and Stan were ready and willing to carry out this plan, Bair needed further convincing. Due to Bair’s reluctance, Appellant instructed Bair to contact Raymond Fishell (Fishell) to help. Bair called Fishell, who was at a bar in Punxsutawney. Stan, Susan, and Bair drove to the bar to retrieve Fishell and include him in the plan. When they found Fishell at the bar, he was already quite intoxicated. The group tried to sober him up with coffee.</p>

This convinced Bair, who agreed to participate. At Appellant’s direction, Stan armed Fishell with a butcher knife. Appellant armed himself with a gun, concealed in his pants.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Susan agreed to stay behind and babysit <a id="p672" href="#p672" data-label="672" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*672</a>Appellant’s children, who were already in bed. The group, consisting of Appellant, Stan, Bair, and Fishell pulled stockings over their faces, put on gloves, and departed for the Gateway Lodge with Stan driving his distinctive 1989 Buick Century, which was badly in need of bodywork.</p>
    <p id="b724-5" data-blocks='[["BL_724.5",724,[309,589,1152,740]]]'>From the moment they arrived at.the Gateway Lodge the plan went awry. Upon driving to the parking area, the group noticed that Lauth was not inside as expected, but outside, and, in fact, had watched them drive up, park, and turn off the lights. Because Stan’s car was so distinctive and Lauth had watched them pull into the parking lot, the group immediately began to panic. Appellant decided that everyone should jump out of the car at the same time, because Lauth was approaching the car. All four doors opened at once, and everyone jumped out. Bair walked around the car and got into the driver’s seat. Appellant, with his gun drawn, Stan and Fishell approached Lauth and took him into the kitchen of the Gateway Lodge. Bair stayed behind in the car, with a two-way radio to keep in contact with Appellant.</p>
    <p id="b724-6" data-blocks='[["BL_724.6",724,[307,1354,1151,789]],["BL_725.1",725,[188,292,1150,94]]]'>Once they had Lauth in the building, Fishell held Lauth at knifepoint while they directed him to call Ann Lipford, the owners’ daughter living at the Gateway Lodge, as planned. Lauth’s first attempt to call Lipford resulted in a wrong number to Stacy Oakes, a stranger to the parties who eventually testified at trial.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Lauth asked Oakes where Ann was, and hung up once he realized he dialed the wrong number. Fishell threatened Lauth not to make any more mistakes. Lauth tried again, this time dialing the correct number, but Lipford did not answer. Instead, Lauth reached her answering machine, and his voice was captured on her answering machine at 1:48 a.m. Appellant then used the two-way radio to ask Bair whether he saw Lipford’s car in the parking lot. Bair looked around, and informed Appellant that he did not see her car. Realizing that she was not home, the group <a id="p673" href="#p673" data-label="673" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*673</a>gained entry to her apartment and ransacked it, apparently looking for the key to the ATM.</p>
    <p id="b725-5" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[186,411,1151,458]]]'>The group proceeded to the room where the safe was kept. After locating it under a desk, Stan and Fishell began to move it while Appellant held Lauth at gunpoint. Appellant radioed Bair to tell him to pull Stan’s Buick up so they could load the safe into it. As Fishell and Stan carried the safe to the car, Appellant fired several shots at the ATM in an unsuccessful attempt to break into it. The group also cut various wires in the office because they were concerned about police being notified somehow.</p>
    <p id="b725-6" data-blocks='[["BL_725.5",725,[185,902,1151,791]]]'>After failing to gain entry to the ATM and then cutting the wires in the office, Appellant moved Lauth into the kitchen at gunpoint. Fishell and Stan joined Appellant and Lauth. Upon Fishell and Stan’s appearance in the kitchen, Appellant hit Lauth with his flashlight and then handed it to Fishell, instructing him to hit the victim. Fishell hit Lauth one time. Appellant then fired the gun at the freezer door in an attempt to open it. To escape any potential ricochet, Fishell returned to the car. At the same time, Stan found Lauth’s vehicle in the parking lot and drove it over the hillside down an embankment, and then he returned to the car. Bair was still in the car, acting as a lookout. While Stan, Fishell, and Bair waited in the car, they heard a gunshot, a scream, a gurgling sound, and then another couple of gun shots. Appellant ran out of the building, got into the car, and directed Bair to drive.</p>
    <p id="b725-7" data-blocks='[["BL_725.6",725,[182,1718,1153,631]],["BL_726.1",726,[289,291,1150,358]]]'>While in the car, Appellant asked Stan whether he thought Appellant did the right thing. Stan indicated that he did. On the way back to Appellant’s trailer, Appellant stated “I think I killed him.” After arriving at Appellant’s trailer, they used a grinder to open the safe. The group, along with Susan, separated the items from the safe and split the money four ways, about $5000 each. Appellant then instructed the group to put all credit cards and papers they found in the safe back into it, and took it to the car. They stuffed a kerosene soaked blanket into the safe, lit it on fire, and dumped it down an embankment. They then drove Fishell to his house. The group, minus Fishell, returned to Appellant’s trailer, where <a id="p674" href="#p674" data-label="674" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*674</a>Bair stayed for the night. Stan and his wife returned to their own home. Before Stan and Susan.left, Appellant handed them a bullet and told them it would be for them if they opened their mouths. Later in the day on December 22, 2000, Appellant gave his gun, wrapped inside a bag, to Stan. Stan put the wrapped gun in his car, drove away with his' wife Susan, and threw the gun into a creek.</p>
    <p id="b726-5" data-blocks='[["BL_726.4",726,[288,673,1152,244]]]'>Employees of the Gateway Lodge arrived for work at 6:30 on the morning of December 22, 2000', and discovered Lauth’s body. The employees also saw that the office and kitchen were in total disarray, with papers everywhere and tables overturned. The ATM had bullet holes in it.</p>
    <p id="b726-6" data-blocks='[["BL_726.5",726,[290,947,1152,467]]]'>When police arrived on the scene, they discovered that the safe was gone, and, because the safe was very heavy, surmised that a group of individuals were involved. Police also recovered Lauth’s flashlight, which had blood on it. Because the group had not entered any part of the Gateway Lodge that did not need to be entered to complete the crime, and because Lipford’s apartment had been ransacked as if the perpetrators had been looking for something, the investigators believed that they were employees of the Lodge.</p>
    <p id="b726-7" data-blocks='[["BL_726.6",726,[288,1437,1155,307]]]'>At the time the crime was committed, Appellant’s girlfriend was a Gateway Lodge employee. She kept Appellant abreast of the police investigation, at one point informing Appellant that the police were taking pictures of employees’ shoes. Responding to this information, Appellant instructed everyone involved in the robbery and shooting to dispose of their shoes.</p>
    <p id="b726-8" data-blocks='[["BL_726.7",726,[289,1768,1154,416]]]'>The police investigation soon focused on Appellant because of his pafet employment as the night watchman. The police conducted interviews with people close to Appellant, including Bair, Stan, and Stan’s wife, Susan. When the police interviewed Susan, she informed police that Appellant had told her that he had to kill Lauth because someone’s name had been mentioned during the robbery, potentially revealing their identity to the victim.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

      <a id="p675" href="#p675" data-label="675" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*675</a>While police were investigating the crimes, Appellant approached Michael Sharp and asked him to provide an alibi. Sharp shared a criminal history with Appellant, regarding a van the two had stolen together. The theft of the van occurred two weeks prior to the Lauth murder, and resulted in charges brought against Sharp for receiving stolen property and criminal conspiracy to receive stolen property. Appellant instructed Sharp to tell anyone who asked that Sharp was with Appellant at Appellant’s trailer on the night of December 21, 2000. Sharp complied with Appellant’s request, occasioning him to lie to police on two separate occasions. Unfortunately for Appellant, however, Sharp was unable to keep his story straight, and eventually confessed that Appellant had asked him to provide an alibi and that he had not, in fact, been with Appellant on December 21, 2000.</p>
    <p id="b727-5" data-blocks='[["BL_727.4",727,[169,1100,1157,732]]]'>On January 8, 2001, Trooper Louis Davis interviewed Appellant. Appellant revealed to Trooper Davis that at the beginning of December 2000, he was completely broke. He was unable to purchase a van, pay his debts, or regain the collateral that was held for these debts. However, Appellant inadvertantly revealed that at the end of December 2000, after the Gateway Lodge robbery, he purchased a Dodge Neon, for $1750 in cash. He also paid for the transfer of title in cash, and paid $650 in cash for a new paint job. At the same time that the police were interviewing Appellant, they were also questioning Bair. When Bair and Appellant passed each other in the hallway of the police station, Appellant instructed Bair not to say anything. This instruction was overheard by police, who testified regarding it at trial.</p>
    <p id="b727-6" data-blocks='[["BL_727.5",727,[169,1857,1153,306]]]'>Two days later Trooper Davis again interviewed Bair, who admitted what transpired at the Gateway Lodge on the night of December 21, 2000. Shortly after Bair revealed what had happened and who was involved, Stan also confessed to the police, implicating Fishell. Eventually, all of Appellant’s co-conspirators identified him as the shooter.</p>

At that point, Appellant was <a id="p676" href="#p676" data-label="676" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*676</a>very concerned with what Bair and Stan had been saying about him. He attempted to convince Trooper Davis to reveal to him what Bair and Stan had told police. When Trooper Davis refused to reveal this information, Appellant attempted to barter in an attempt to reach a deal. He said that he could tell Trooper Davis everything he wanted to know about the previous twenty days, and acknowledged that the information would be incriminating. Accordingly, Appellant conditioned his willingness to talk on Trooper Davis promising him that he would not be charged based on what he revealed. Trooper Davis refused to give Appellant any assurances, and Appellant deliberated, saying that he was playing out in his head what was going to happen. Appellant decided to reveal nothing else at that time.</p>
    <p id="b728-5" data-blocks='[["BL_728.4",728,[304,1063,1153,1014]]]'>Appellant was arrested on January 9, 2001, and charged with homicide and related offenses for the events that occurred at the Gateway Lodge on December 21, 2000. After being charged with criminal homicide, Appellant was again interviewed by police. At this January 10, 2001 interview, Appellant attempted to explain away his sudden infusion of cash by saying that his sister had loaned him the money. Appellant then revealed a tremendous amount of detail about the homicide and the events surrounding it, but he asserted that his role was limited to assisting Bair and Stan after the fact, by allowing them to use his grinder to open the safe, after they had robbed the Gateway Lodge. He described where the gun could be found, which he described in detail, and where the two-way radios were. During this interview, Appellant became aware of Susan’s cooperation with the police and that she had told them that she watched Appellant’s children on the night of the murder. He became very angry at this news. Later that day he telephoned Susan and threatened her, calling her a snitch.</p>

In another letter he instructed his mother how she should testify.

Although the record is not clear on this point, we surmise that this suspicion arose from the recorded conversations between Appellant and his mother regarding their attempt to plant a family member on the jury. The judge took the unusual step of accompanying Appellant’s counsel to Appellant’s cell, and waited outside while counsel reviewed files with Appellant to determine whether he possessed jury lists. As will be discussed later in this opinion, no evidence was found in Appellant’s cell.</p>

Dr. Vey concluded that Lauth had been shot three times and that the angle of the bullet trajectory indicated that Lauth had been on his knees when he was shot. The Commonwealth also adduced testimony and evidence regarding Appellant’s lack of funds before the robbery of the Gateway Lodge and his infusion of cash after-wards. His purchases after the robbery included $540 towards a bill at a music store, $540 for a car stereo, $162 for car tires, $258 for a ring for his wife, $400 for toys for his children, and the Dodge Neon and its paint job mentioned above.</p>

The Commonwealth presented expert testimony from a forensic pathologist, Dr. Vey, concerning his examination of the victim’s body and his opinion that the cause of death was homicide, specifically, three gunshot wounds to the head and trunk, which caused death immediately. Testimony from Appellant’s co-conspirators directly implicated Appellant as the killer, and was corroborated by circumstantial evidence regarding Appellant’s financial position before and after the murder, the theft of the gun used in the murder, and his role in opening the safe, distributing the money, and disposing of the evidence. Further, Appellant’s behavior after his arrest <a id="p681" href="#p681" data-label="681" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*681</a>demonstrates Appellant’s consciousness of guilt. For example, Appellant threatened Susan, conspired with his mother to tamper with the jury, attempted to concoct an alibi with Sharp and, when that fell through, sought the help of his mother to buy another alibi.

Upon counsel’s averment that Appellant did not possess any jury lists, the trial judge took no further action. Under these particular circumstances we find that the judge’s actions had no impact whatsoever on the trial, and, accordingly, Appellant was not prejudiced. The cases cited by Appellant stand for the proposition that when a judge improperly acts as advocate, and his actions have an undue effect on the judicial process, a defendant may be entitled to relief.

This argument is essentially the same as the general allegation attacking victim impact testimony as a “super aggravator” that, in the case law recited above, we have repeatedly rejected. Plank-er’s testimony was not offered to support any of the enumerated aggravating factors found in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d). In fact, the sentencing verdict slip shows that the only aggravators the jury considered were two of those specifically listed in Section 9711. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. §§ 9711(d)(6) and (9) (that Appellant had committed the murder while in the perpetration of a felony, and that he possessed a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence).

Affording an advanced and additional layer of collateral attack to select defendants necessarily occasions delay in those cases. Moreover, in the absence of a procedural rule or other guidance from this Court, it is difficult to explain why certain defendants have been afforded two collateral attacks upon request, while others are not, but instead are consigned to the single collateral review statutorily authorized under the PCRA.
