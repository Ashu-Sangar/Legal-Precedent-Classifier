      <a id="p591" href="#p591" data-label="591" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*591</a>The issue that DGS raises presents a matter of statutory construction. Therefore, the Statutory Construction Act of 3972 (“Statutory Construction Act” or “Act”) controls. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1501 <em>et seq. </em>Under the Act, it is fundamental that “[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly[,]” and that “[ejvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). In this regard, the Act instructs that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b). When, however, the words of the statute are not explicit, the General Assembly’s intent is to be ascertained by considering matters other than statutory language, like the occasion and necessity for the statute; the circumstances of its enactment; the object it seeks to attain; the mischief to be remedied; former laws; consequences of a particular interpretation; contemporaneous legislative history; and legislative and administrative interpretations. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c).</p>
    <p id="b643-4" data-blocks='[["BL_643.4",643,[171,1439,1157,904]]]'>The Act provides that “[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage”; and that “technical words and phrases and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning . .. shall be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1903(a). Further, if the General Assembly defines words that are used in a statute, those definitions are binding. <em>Commonwealth v. Kimmel, </em><a href="/pa/523/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="523 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1820349" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0107-01">523 Pa. 107</a>, <a href="/pa/523/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="523 Pa. 107" data-case-ids="1820349" data-case-paths="/pa/523/0107-01">565 A.2d 426</a>, 428 (1989). The Act allows a court to presume that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable; that the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be certain and effective, and intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(1),(2),(5). Moreover, the Act sets forth rules for a court to follow when provisions in or among statutes are in conflict and cannot be reconciled. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1933-1936.</p>

DGS asserts that when the Code’s definition of contract is incorporated into Section 513(a), the statute effectively states that “[w]hen [DGS] determines in wilting that the use of competitive sealed bidding is either not practicable or advantageous to the Commonwealth, a contract [which means a written agreement ... for the procurement or disposal of supplies, services <em>or </em>construction] may be entered into by competitive sealed proposals.” 62 Pa.C.S. §§ 103, 513(a) (emphasis added). Thus, Section 513 clearly and explicitly includes construction contracts within its scope. 62 Pa.C.S. §§ 103, 513(a).</p>
    <p id="b644-4" data-blocks='[["BL_644.4",644,[308,1027,1152,574]]]'>Reflecting the Commonwealth Court’s analysis, ABC counters that even though the Code’s definition of contract in 62 Pa.C.S. § 103 includes three alternative agreement types, there is more to the definition for purposes of construing the Section 512’s exceptions. ABC argues that inasmuch as several of the exceptions, like Section 517,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_13" id="ref_footnote_1_13">13</a> contain the word “construction,” while others, like Section 513 do not, the word “contract” is to include the contract for construction alternative only when the exception also mentions the word “construction.” Since Section 513 does not, it does not cover construction contracts.</p>

ABC is, however, mistaken as to what more there is. In addition to defining Code terms, 62 Pa.C.S. § 103 opens with a passage that states in relevant part, that “the following words and phrases when used in this part shall have the meanings given to them in this section <em>unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.” </em>62 Pa.C.S. § 103 (emphasis added). From these words, it follows that the General Assembly contemplated that there might be instances in the Code when a term defined in <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>62 Pa.C.S. § 103, like “contract,” has a meaning that differs from the definition given it, and directed that attention be paid to what surrounds the term in order to determine whether or not the Code’s definition applies.</p>

Moreover, in our view, this definition of contract is clear and explicit in including contracts for construction.

The first was the Commonwealth Court’s reliance on contemporaneous legislative history to construe Section 513 and decide that it did not apply to construction contracts. Under the Statutory Construction Act, it is only when the words of a statute are not explicit that factors extraneous to statutory language may be consulted to ascertain the General Assembly’s intent. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c); <em>Commonwealth v. Packer, </em><a href="/pa/568/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="568 Pa. 481" data-case-ids="163625" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0481-01">568 Pa. 481</a>, <a href="/pa/568/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="798 A.2d 192" data-case-ids="163625,9428700" data-case-paths="/pa/568/0481-01,/a2d/798/0192-01">798 A.2d 192</a>, 196 (2002) (observing that only when the language of the statute is ambiguous does statutory construction under 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c) become necessary). Because the words of Section 513 are clear with respect to the question before us, the Code’s contemporaneous legislative history, one of the extraneous factors listed in the Act, should not have been consulted. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(c)(7).</p>

Under the Act, a court is not to anticipate and avoid a conflict between statutory provisions <a id="p594" href="#p594" data-label="594" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*594</a>by disregarding a statutory definition or other statutory language or by choosing to give effect to one provision, but not to another. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). Rather, the solution to a conflict in statutory provisions, should one occur once the provisions have been properly construed, lies in the several sections of the Act that provide the analysis for a court to follow when there are conflicts between statutory provisions or statutes. 1 Pa.C.S. §§ 1938-36.</p>

DGS asserts that if we were to read the Code as a whole and study its legislative history, we would see that the General Assembly sought to enlarge the methods of public contract procurement, and from this we would conclude that Section 322(6) incorporates the mandate of separate specifications, bids, and contracts for plumbing, heating, ventilation and electrical work from the Separations Act into the Code, but not its mandate that awards be made to the lowest responsible bidder. <em>See </em>71 P.S. § 1618. Therefore, Sections 322(6) and 513 are harmonious. ABC responds that DGS’s position has no merit because the words in Section 322(6) and Section 6(d) of Act 57 of 1998, P.L. 358, Act 57’s repealer section, reveal that all of the Separations Act’s requirements apply to DGS’ procurement of construction contracts under the Code.</p>
