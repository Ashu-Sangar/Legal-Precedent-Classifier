Weaver made no such request and was embarrassed. On more than one occasion, appellant invited the three women to look at pornographic images on his computer. In one instance, the image was evidence from a child pornography case before his court. When Moot refused to view the image, appellant described it to her in graphic detail, despite her protests.</p>

Appellant admitted the notes’ purpose was to “get votes.” Although appellant’s retention election was several years away, this practice effectively constituted a continuous re-election campaign.</p>

Judicial officers should satisfy themselves with the knowledge that this salutary restriction is offset by the fact that a sitting district judge has the distinct advantage of incumbency. In violation of Rule 15C, appellant campaigned for retention throughout his term of office. Appellant’s improper electioneering provides further support for the sanction of removal.</p>

I agree that Appellant’s conduct towards his staff involving the use of improper and offensive language warrants his removal from office. I write separately in response to the concurring opinion by Justice Castille, which addresses the second charge lodged against Appellant. This charge relates to Appellant’s practice of sending congratulatory notes by mail to constituents who were mentioned in the local newspaper for an accomplishment. Justice Castille characterizes this practice as an on-going reelection campaign, and upon that premise correctly deems this activity improper. While I agree that the Court of Judicial Discipline’s factual findings dictate such result, I feel compelled to write separately to state my view that other instances of community outreach, which are not for the sole purpose of electioneering, are entirely permissible and even laudable.</p>

I caution, however, that the conclusion reached in this case based upon such a finding should not be read as a blanket prohibition of the range of benign activities that judicial officers routinely engage in as public officials who sincerely desire to interact with the community for its betterment as well as that of the judiciary. Some of these activities, such as personally welcoming jurors beginning their service, thanking jurors, either personally or by letter, at the conclusion of their service, dropping notes of thanks or congratulations to individuals who achieve some significant success or milestone in our society, delivering remarks to community groups, accepting a small award, and the like, are entirely permissible so long as they are undertaken without ulterior <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>motive, regardless of the potentiality of some ephemeral benefit that one might speculate could inure to a judge.
