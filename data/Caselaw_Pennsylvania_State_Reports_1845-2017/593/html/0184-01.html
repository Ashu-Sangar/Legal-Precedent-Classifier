Included among its powers under the act, the Authority may “make agreements with the purchasers or holders of the bonds or with others in connection with any bonds, whether issued or to be issued, as the authority shall deem advisable.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 5607(d)(12).</p>

This program, known as “School Pool I,” was funded by $200 million in proceeds from the public sale of 40-year tax-exempt bonds set to mature in 2026. The governing agreement for this project made Dauphin Deposit Bank (later Allfirst Bank) the trustee of the funds, and Appellee, Program Administration Services, Inc., the program administrator. The Authority began a similar program in 1997, known as “School Pool II,” with $250 million from the public sale of tax-exempt 35-five year bonds set to mature in 2032. A similar agreement made Commerce Bank the trustee and, again, made Appellee the program administrator.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

      <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>Under both of these arrangements (the “Program Administration Agreements”), the bonds were purchased by private investors and the proceeds were used to create a “pool” of money that was available for the Authority to lend to qualifying school districts. The Authority lends money from these pools to school districts for dedicated purposes such as construction or reconstruction of school facilities, or debt refinancing. As school districts repay the principal and interest on their loans, interest is paid to the bondholders and principal is returned to the pool, from which it is available to be re-loaned. The Authority thus provides “conduit” financing, as it is positioned between school-district borrowers and the private-investor lenders. As program administrator, Appellee is responsible, <em>inter alia, </em>to market the programs to prospective school districts, assist school districts with their applications, calculate note payments, bill the school districts, and assist the Authority in securing investment of funds with the trustee banks. The Program Administration Agreements provide that they shall continue in force until one of the following three conditions occurs: (1) no portion of the bonds remains outstanding and unpaid; (2) continuing failure of Appellee to perform in any material respect; or (3) mutual consent of the parties to terminate.</p>

Appellee initiated a declaratory judgment action in the trial court seeking a judicial determination that the contracts may not be terminated outside the terms specified by the agreements.

The majority reasoned that the central question was whether the Program Administration Agreements involved a governmental function or a proprietary function, because contracts involving governmental services may be terminated by a successor governing body, without cause, irrespective of the termination date or other procedures for termination set forth in the contract. <em><a href="/a2d/874/0722-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="874 A.2d 722" data-case-ids="8955572" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0722-01">Id.</a> </em>at 725 (citing <em>Lobolito, Inc. v.

The majority then stated that, in deciding whether the activity at issue was governmental or proprietary in nature, it should employ the test set forth in <em>County of Butler v. Local 585, Service Employees Int’l Union, AFL-CIO, </em>158 Pa.Cmwlth. 519, <a href="/pa-commw/158/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="631 A.2d 1389" data-case-ids="1450985" data-case-paths="/pa-commw/158/0519-01">631 A.2d 1389</a> (1993). Under this test, a court considers whether the activity: 1) is one that government is not statutorily required to perform; 2) also may be carried on by private enterprise; or 3) is used as a means of raising revenue.</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[196,1245,1155,1090]],["BL_242.1",242,[285,284,1152,88]]]'>Applying this test to the present case, the majority held that the Authority’s activity of lending money to school districts was proprietary in nature since the Authority was not statutorily required to perform the activity and it is one that is carried on by many private lenders. The majority explained that the “mere fact that the Authority lends money to a school district for school construction does not make the act of lending governmental in character any more than it would be if the loan was made by a private bank.” <em>Program Admin. Services, </em><a href="/a2d/874/0722-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="874 A.2d 722" data-case-ids="8955572" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0722-01">874 A.2d at 728</a>. Furthermore, the majority distinguished this Court’s decision in <em>Lobolito, </em>on the basis that <em>Lobolito </em>involved the decision of whether to build a school building — a clear governmental function. In this case, however, the Authority is not involved in any decision to build schools, but only in financing such projects once the decision is made by another body. Likewise, the majority distinguished another Commonwealth Court case, <em>State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/a2d/712/0811-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="712 A.2d 811" data-case-ids="11820028" data-case-paths="/a2d/712/0811-01">712 A.2d 811</a> (Pa.Cmwlth.1998), on the basis that the funds being lent in that case were assets of the state, whereas here they are assets of the bondholders, akin to <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>the holdings of private depositors.

Further, the ultimate borrowers are the school districts, the ultimate lenders are the bondholders, and unlike a private bank, the Authority earns no profit. She further noted that, in <em>Lobolito, </em>this court considered the “crux” of the agreement in resolving the governmental versus proprietary question, and <em>Lobolito </em>concluded that the “crux” of the agreement was the construction of a new school, and that the “services aspect of the agreement [i.e., that portion pertaining to water and sewage treatment] would be devoid of meaning without the school board’s predicate promise to build the school.” <em>Program Admin.

He noted, in this regard, that the purpose of the rule allowing government entities to be free from long-term contracts entered into by their predecessor boards is to avoid such “capture” by private interests at the potential expense of public interests as ultimately expressed by the electorate through the ballot box. <em>See <a href="/a2d/874/0722-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="874 A.2d 722" data-case-ids="8955572" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0722-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/874/0722-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="874 A.2d 722" data-case-ids="8955572" data-case-paths="/a2d/874/0722-01">at 730-31</a> (Pellegrini, J., dissenting).</p>

The Act permits Authorities to incur long-term indebtedness for up to 40 years through the issuance of bonds, and to contract with private entities in connection with these bond issuances. The purpose of the Act is to further the public policy of making low-cost, long-term funds available to government entities for public projects; and the contracts that it contemplates are those with bond investors. This is clear from the legislative statement that a purpose of the statute is to “provide for the security of the bonds and the rights of the bondholders.” 53 Pa.C.S. § 5607(d)(12) (Purposes and Powers).</p>

I believe that this provision applies to contracts with bond investors, or trustee banks, which would be consistent with the purpose of the statute to ensure the security of bondholder’s rights. The majority subscribes to an overbroad interpretation of this language to apply it to any contract that the Authority executes relating to School Pool program administration. This interpretation would be anathema to the expressed legislative purpose that long-term contracts are permitted to ensure the security of bondholders, and is not consistent with the frequently expressed public policy of permitting governmental entities to disavow contracts relating to governmental functions that their predecessors have enacted.</p>

I cannot subscribe to the majority’s view that the program administration agreements are equivalent in importance to the financing or security documents that are contemplated by the language of the Act, as they are not connected with the issuance or servicing of bonds.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a>

The rationale for the rule is that newly appointed or elected governmental figures should be responsive to their electorate or appointing bodies, rather than to their predecessors’ contractual partners. I would hold that the “conduit financing” bond program at issue in this case is a governmental function, and that the Authority is thus permitted to terminate its contract with the Appellee.</p>

The purpose of School Pool I and School Pool II was to assist school districts within Dauphin County to obtain financing for capital improvements or new construction of schools. The bondholders, or lenders, received tax-exempt interest on the bonds. The borrowers, or school districts, received the benefit of lower cost borrowing than if they issued the bonds themselves because of shared economies with regard to the administration of the program. The Authority acted as a conduit between the two for the benefit of the school districts, and did not earn a profit from the operation of the program. Notably, as an instrumentality of state government, the bonds issued by the Authority are tax exempt. Tax-exempt financing can also be accomplished if individual school districts issued the bonds themselves, but cannot be accomplished by a private bank, bond underwriter or other non-governmental entity. Lending money that comes from the purchase of tax-exempt bonds to school districts to build schools is simply not a proprietary function, as it could not be carried out by private businesses. Moreover, the bond revenue was being used exclusively for public purposes.</p>
