In 1998, appellees began assessing real estate taxes on subsurface minerals including oil, gas, and limestone. Appellant appealed to the Board challenging the validity of the tax on limestone. Meanwhile, a group of oil and gas producers filed a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the taxes applied on oil and gas. Appellant’s appeal was deferred pending the outcome of the oil and gas producers’ case in <em>IOGA. </em>Ultimately, this Court decided that Pennsylvania statutory law does not authorize the imposition of <em>ad valorem </em>taxes on oil and gas interests. <em>IOGA, </em><a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="814 A.2d 180" data-case-ids="716451,9336482" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01,/a2d/814/0180-01">814 A.2d at 180</a>.

      <em> </em>The trial court noted that limestone is similar to coal and may be found on the surface of land, as well as beneath it. By contrast, gas and oil are fugacious and may not constitute the surface of land. Moreover, the court found that the definition of “lands” in Section 201 of the General County Assessment Law included solid-state inorganic minerals beneath the surface.

R.A.P.1925(b) challenging the trial court’s reasoning in its opinion. The trial court filed a supplemental opinion to address appellant’s challenges that: (1) the court misapprehended the portion of the <em>IOGA </em>decision addressing Section 201; (2) the court erred in relying on case law to find that limestone is included within the definition of lands; and (3) the court erred in citing the fugacious nature of oil and gas to find <em>IOGA </em>did not prohibit taxes on limestone. The trial court emphasized that the scope of <em>IOGA </em>was limited and stated only that none of the forms of real estate permitted to be taxed under Section 201 included oil and gas. The trial court noted, furthermore, that the rules- of statutory construction require a finding that limestone is included within the definition of “lands” because case law prior to the passage of Section 201 made it clear that the definition of “lands” included stone. Finally, the trial court cited former-justice Russell Nigro’s concurring opinion in <em>IOGA, </em>which stated that oil and gas are fundamentally unlike real estate, to support the court’s proposition that the character of limestone is relevant to the disposition of the instant case.

Judge Dante Pellegrini, writing on behalf of Judge Bernard L. McGinley and Senior Judge Jess S.

The panel also quoted this Court’s early decision in <em>Lillibridge v.

Specifically, appellant argues that the <em>IOGA </em>decision instructs that: (1) no statute expressly authorizes the taxation of subsurface minerals other than coal; (2) subsurface minerals are not explicitly listed in Section 201; and (3) subsurface minerals do not come within a layperson’s understanding of the term “lands” and thus do not fall within the meaning of “lands” as used in Section 201. Appellant contends that <em>IOGA </em>prohibits taxation of all subsurface minerals other than coal, which is distinctly authorized by statute, and <em>IOGA </em>must be followed under the principle of <em>stare decisis.</em>

Appellant’s Brief at 7. Appellant states that <em>Lillibridge </em>and <em>Caldwell </em>do not interpret the term “lands” as used in Section 201. If subsurface minerals were lands, appellant asserts that the Legislature would have had no need to enact separate legislation to authorize taxation on coal. Since <em>IOGA </em>interprets Section 201 and no other statute authorizes the taxation of limestone, appellant argues it must be deemed controlling in this case.</p>

Appellant’s Brief at 8. Appellant asserts that although limestone may exist on the surface of land, so too may oil and gas, which may not be taxed. Appellant also notes that Section 201 authorizes taxing fisheries, which are obviously not solid lands, indicating that the physical differences between limestone, oil, and gas are irrelevant. Finally, in anticipation of appellees’ arguments, appellant argues that Section 419 of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. § 5020-419 (“Section 419”), does not provide authority to tax limestone interests, but states only that the interests may be taxed to the extent that other provisions of the Assessment Law provide authorization.</p>

Appellees argue that oil and gas do not fit within a layperson’s conception of lands, while limestone does. <em>IOGA </em>stated, according to appellees, that oil and gas were unlike any of the objects listed in Section 201 and the decision did not mention limestone. Appellees also note that <em>IOGA </em>did not address Section 419, which indicates stone may be taxed, and Section 201 provides for the taxation of mines and attendant shelters. Moreover, limestone stays fixed and naturally appears on the surface of land, but oil and gas do not appear on the surface. If left on the surface of land, oil would evaporate over time and gas would escape into the atmosphere.

I write only to note that, in the <em>IOGA </em>case, I joined Mr. Justice Nigro’s concurrence, which relied on the special characteristics of oil and gas to support the conclusion that such minerals were beyond the reach of Section 201 of the General County Assessment Law. I appreciated that oil and gas have been termed “real estate” in various decisions, but applying a strict construction of the statute most favorable to the taxpayers, I found sufficient ambiguity in Section 201 with regard to these minerals, in light of their vagrant and fugacious character, to support the taxpayers’ position. However, with regard to solid minerals attached to the earth, on or beneath its surface, there seems to me to be no room for any similar ambiguity-these are almost universally understood to be real estate. <em>See generally </em>58 C.J.S. Mines and Minerals § 141 (2007) (“Minerals in place are generally held to be a part of the real estate with all the attributes and incidents peculiar to the ownership of land, but after their removal from the land they become personalty.”). Thus, I conclude that Section 201 was plainly intended to reach them. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 5020-201(a) (providing for taxation of “[a]ll real estate” and “all other real estate not exempt by law from taxation”).</p>

When faced with a question of statutory interpretation, this Court must adhere to the rules promulgated by the Statutory Construction Act in order to ascertain and effect the intent of the Legislature as conveyed by the statutory language. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(a). In this case, we are asked to construe the words promulgated by Section 201 of the General County Assessment Law, specifically the <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>word “lands” in the context of the imposition of taxation. 72 P.S. § 5020-201(a). Respectfully, this Court has done this once before. In <em>IOGA, </em><a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="572 Pa. 240" data-case-ids="716451" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01">572 Pa. 240</a>, <a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="814 A.2d 180" data-case-ids="716451,9336482" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01,/a2d/814/0180-01">814 A.2d 180</a>, 184 (2002), this Court held that when the Legislature used the word “lands” in Section 201, it meant “surface rights.” We then applied this construction to the facts of that case, to determine that oil and gas did not fit under the category of “lands” as surface rights. <em><a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="814 A.2d 180" data-case-ids="716451,9336482" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01,/a2d/814/0180-01">Id.</a> </em>Accordingly, the task in this case is already partially complete, as this Court previously construed the meaning of the word “lands” in Section 201. What remains is only to apply that construction to the issue at bar, which is whether or not subsurface limestone fits under the category of “lands,” i.e., “surface rights.”</p>
    <p id="b404-4" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[307,999,1152,517]]]'>As our inquiry here is focused on subsurface limestone, or limestone which is “below the surface,” it would seem unequivocal that a statute that only authorizes the taxation of “surface rights,” or that which is the “outermost or uppermost layer,” could not be read to extend the power to impose a tax on minerals which lie below the surface of the land. The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2nd ed.1987). I would thus hold that Section 201 does not authorize the taxation of subsurface limestone based on this Court’s construction of the word “lands” in <em>IOGA.</em>

But it observes that limestone exists both on the surface of the earth as well as below the surface. Therefore, the majority claims that it would be incongruous not to expand the definition of lands to include not merely the surface of the land, but also that which is below. The majority has chosen to expand our previous construction of the statute rather than to construe the statute in its narrowest sense, as our Court did in <em>IOGA. </em>I believe that this is inappropriate because when we construe provisions that impose taxes, our construction must be strict. 1 Pa.C.S. § 1928(b)(3).

The <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>first consideration measures the government’s power to tax, and the second mandates strict construction. <em><a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.2d%20640" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="70 A.2d 640">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=70%20A.2d%20640" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="70 A.2d 640">at 642</a>.

In <em>IOGA, </em>this Court found support for the proposition that the use of the word "lands” in Section 201 did not include oil and gas by noting the separate statutory provisions had been created for the taxation of coal at 72 P.S. §§ 5020-415, 5453.612 and 5453.616. <em>IOGA, </em><a href="/pa/572/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="814 A.2d 180" data-case-ids="716451,9336482" data-case-paths="/pa/572/0240-01,/a2d/814/0180-01">814 A.2d at 184</a>. This suggests that the Legislature believed that it was necessary to promulgate specific authority imposing the taxation of coal, because Section 201 did not contain that authority. If Section 201 does not grant the authority to tax coal, a subsurface mineral, than it follows that the same section does not grant the authority to tax subsurface limestone.</p>
