Doe was set to enter kindergarten for the 2004-05 school year when, upon his parents’ request, the District evaluated him to determine whether he was entitled to services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), <a href="/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400-1487" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487">20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1487</a>, or § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, <a href="/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="29 U.S.C. § 794">29 U.S.C. § 794</a>.</p>

Since he was not attending classes at its school, the District refused to provide the § 504 therapy, contending § 504 and IDEA have fundamentally different purposes; IDEA concerns providing public educational services, whereas § 504 deals only with access to those services. The District stipulated Doe “is an individual with a disability pursuant to [§ ] 504.... [Doe] would be eligible to receive occupational therapy services through the [§ ] 504 Service Agreement ... if he were a student attending school in the District.” Administrative Hearing Record, Joint Exhibit, at Tab 4, J-l.

The court pointed out the regulations which implement § 504 in Pennsylvania <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>require only that a child be <em>enrolled </em>in the district from which he seeks services; they do not require the student <em>attend classes </em>at a district school in order to receive those services. <em><a href="/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20104.33" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="34 C.F.R. § 104.33">Id.,</a> </em>at 929 (citing 22 Pa.Code §§ 15.1-15.11).</p>

Hence the § 504 services were either a means of accessing non-IDE A services <em>(i.e., </em>“regular” educational services), or they were an educational service unto themselves.</p>

There is little problem finding they are part of an appropriate education for Doe — indeed, the District offered them.
