At the time he terminated his Senate service on November 30, 1988, Appellant had accrued 14.5250 years of state service as a Class A member.

Four days later, on December 31, 2001, Appellant reached the mandatory retirement age and his service as an active judge ended. On January 1, 2002, Appellant applied to SERS for an annuity, specifying that his application was subject to a reservation of his claim for Class AA or Class D-4 credit for his Senate service. SERS calculated that Appellant was entitled to an annuity based upon 14.5250 years of Class A service and 11.5278 years of Class E-l service. On February 1, 2002, SERS informed Appellant that the Appeals Committee had denied his request to convert his Class A service as a Senator to Class AA or Class D-4 service. Thereafter, Appellant filed a timely appeal seeking to have his 14.5250 years of Senate service credited as either Class AA service or Class D-4 service, contending that the Act 9 amendments denied him equal protection of the laws in that they impermissibly granted unequal pension benefits to members of the General Assembly, and that they unconstitutionally impaired his contract for pension benefits.</p>

The Hearing Officer determined that Appellant’s total guaranteed annuity payment at the time of his retirement amounted to <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>$843,567.67.

Because he first pursued membership in Class D-4 on October 26, 2001, almost four months after the election period had expired, the Hearing Examiner concluded that his election for Class D-4 membership was untimely, and dismissed Appellant’s claim.</p>

SERB further agreed with the Hearing Examiner that Appellant failed to demonstrate that his equal protection rights were violated or that the Act 9 amendments unconstitutionally diminished his compensation and impaired his contractual rights.

      <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>In determining whether the Legislature’s exclusion of Appellant from membership in Class AA was rationally related to the state purpose of permitting employees to share in the higher-than-expected returns on their contributions, the Commonwealth Court agreed with Appellant that SERB violated his equal protection rights in precluding him from converting his Class A service to Class AA. The Commonwealth Court reasoned that sections 5306.1(b) and (c) of the Retirement Code specified that election to become a Class AA member must be made before January 1, 2002, but that membership in Class AA would become effective on the later of July 1, 2001 or the date on which the election was filed. Since Act 9 only required Class AA members to contribute at the increased rate beginning on January 1, 2002, if an employee elected Class AA membership and retired before January 1 2002, such an employee would be able to receive the enhanced benefits of Class AA service without ever making the increased employee contributions. The Commonwealth Court determined that Appellant was similarly situated with these individuals since he had been a Class A member, he had sought Class AA membership, and he had retired before January 1, 2002. Therefore, the court reasoned that Appellant was entitled to receive Class AA status for his years of Senate service, even without making the higher Class AA contributions on that service.</p>

The court observed that section 5306.2(a) which specified that members of the General Assembly were required to elect Class D-4 membership before July 1, 2001, became effective on May 17, 2001. Because Appellant was not a member of the General Assembly between May 17, 2001 and July 1, 2001, the Commonwealth Court determined that section 5306.2(a) was inapplicable to Appellant and could not be relied upon to find his application untimely.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.5",548,[309,1117,1149,519]]]'>The Commonwealth Court additionally reasoned that in finding that Appellant’s request for Class D-4 service failed to meet the section 5306.2(a) timeliness requirements, SERB overlooked the fact that Appellant’s equal protection argument extended to a challenge of the constitutionality of section 5306.2(a), since section 5306.2(a) limited the election of Class D-4 membership to members of the General Assembly. Therefore, the court determined the question of timeliness could not be resolved absent an analysis of whether Act 9 unconstitutionally excluded him from Class D-4 membership.</p>

The court noted that section 5306.2(a) required eligible state employees to elect Class D-M by July 1, 2001, with membership in Class D-4 becoming effective on that date. Consequently, the court reasoned there was no period of time during which Class D-4 members with prior Class A status could retire and share in the higher Class D-4 returns without paying the increased contributions associated with Class D-4 membership. Appellant however, if permitted to elect Class D^i membership, <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>would be able to receive the increased benefits associated with Class D-4 without having to make the required increased contributions.

    <p id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[199,644,1154,529]]]'>The Commonwealth Court also concluded that the Act 9 amendments did not impair Appellant’s contractual obligations. The Commonwealth Court reasoned that the relevant contract between the Commonwealth and Appellant was the 1974 Retirement Code which provided Appellant with Class A retirement benefits for his years of Senate service.

In reviewing Appellant’s equal protection argument to determine whether the classification was rationally related to a legitimate government interest, the Hearing Examiner observed, and SERB, agreed that membership in Class E-l permitted Appellant to acquire benefits in excess of those received by Class A members. See Hearing Examiner op. at 25; <em>Kelley v. SERB, </em>No.2002-02, slip op. of State Employees’ Retirement Bd. at 8 (SERB April 7, 2005) (SERB op.). Since Act 9 was also intended to offer enhanced benefits to certain state employees, we agree that the exclusion of Class E-l members, who were already entitled to separate benefit enhancements, constitutes a classification with a rational basis. The Legislature may rationally intend to restrict state employees who already enjoyed separate categories of increased benefits from Class AA benefits.

It is rational to predict that if the Act 9 membership classes were expanded as Appellant requests, the “fully funded” status of the employee pension funds could be compromised. Therefore, in setting limitations on the election of Class AA membership, the General Assembly may have legitimately concluded that an extension of Class AA membership to include Class E-l employees would have an adverse economic impact on SERS’ limited resources.</p>

The State Employees' Retirement Code of 1959 authorized judges to elect class E-l coverage which permitted them to contribute a higher percentage of their salaries and receive proportionately higher benefits than allowed by Class A. See Former 71 P.S. 1725 — 301 (1 )(a) and 1725-401(l)(e). In 1974, the Retirement Code was amended, eliminating the option for judges to elect class E-l coverage. We observed in <em>Goodheart </em>that judges who assumed office after the enactment of the 1974 Retirement Code received different retirement benefits than judges who assumed office prior to that date. Reasoning that this disparity in compensation was unconstitutional, we held that the post-1974 judges must be given the opportunity to pay into the system sufficient funds to permit the conversion of their retirement package into the same Class E-l benefits received by the pre-1974 judges. <em>Goodheart, </em>521 Pa. at 328, 555 A.2d at 1215-16.</p>

As a result, State and school district contributions have decreased dramatically to less than 1 of payroll for next year. At the same time, employee contributions range from 5 to 6.25 of payroll. The outstanding investment performance has resulted in the pension funds being over 123 funded, compared to current needs. The 4 statutory interest rate the employees receive on their pension accounts has consistently been eclipsed by the actual average returns of the funds over the last two decades and also has been less than available private market interest rates. The fact that employees have been and are projected to continue to contribute at a rate that is materially greater than the employers due to the more than 100 funded status of the plans raises the issue of the <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>extent to which employees should be provided additional benefits. The increase in benefits for State and school employees provided herein will in effect allow them for the first time to share in the outstanding investment performance of the funds. To date, that experience has only benefited the employers through reduced contributions to the funds. Even with the increases in benefits provided herein, both pension funds are projected to maintain minimal employer contribution rates and at the same time maintain a fully funded status. For at least the next decade, members are projected to continue to contribute at a rate substantially in excess of that required from the employers.</p>

We agree with the Commonwealth Court that the Legislature has an interest in requiring class members to make the contributions associated with that class. However, the Legislature in enacting section 5306 opted to forgo that interest, and, to a limited degree, permit membership in Class AA without the payment of increased contributions by permitting members to elect Class AA membership and retire before January 1, 2002 when membership in Class AA became effective. In excluding Appellant, as a Class E-l member from Class AA, the Legislature, as we have explained, possessed sufficient separate and distinct rational bases to overcome his constitutional challenge that he was impermissibly barred from Class AA.</p>
