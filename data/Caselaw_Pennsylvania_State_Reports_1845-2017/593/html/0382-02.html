In this case, however, at the time Appellant filed his PCRA petition, the Superior Court followed the “extension theory.” Under the “extension theory,” the Superior Court construed in limited circumstances an untimely, serial PCRA petition as if it were an “extension” of a timely, but previously dismissed, first PCRA petition. <em>Commonwealth v.

The practice was common in cases like Appellant’s, in which an appeal was taken from the denial of the first petition, but the Superior Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice when PCRA counsel failed to file a brief. Appellant relied on and took advantage of this process by alleging and proving the extension theory in his original and amended petitions. The <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>PCRA court agreed that Appellant was entitled to relief and reinstated his appellate rights <em>nunc pro tunc.</em>

The problem that we encountered in <em>Chester </em>and <em>Lantzy </em>stems from the fact that the Post Conviction Relief Act subsumes incompatible objectives. On the one hand, the Legislature expressly intended for all forms of post-conviction relief, including relief available under traditional habeas corpus doctrine, to be included within the PCRA’s jurisdictional and procedural framework. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9542. On the other hand, under the plain language of the <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>PCRA, the ■ statute narrows the categories of claims as to which relief is available, excluding, for example, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to file a direct appeal (or, more directly relevant to the present case, ineffective assistance of PCRA counsel for failure to file a brief). <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9543(a)(2). The two objectives cannot be wholly reconciled, because claims cognizable on traditional habeas corpus review may not be substantively foreclosed by legislation, since the Pennsylvania Constitution provides, with limited exceptions not applicable in this context, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus “shall not be suspended.” Pa. Const., art. I, § 14. <em>See generally Lantzy, </em><a href="/pa/558/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="116" data-cite="558 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="838560" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0214-01">558 Pa. at 222-23</a>, <a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="117" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">736 A.2d at 569</a>. Thus, the Court was presented with a choice of sanctioning a bifurcated system of post-conviction review (in which claims expressly covered by the PCRA would be administered under the jurisdictional and procedural framework of the statute, but the balance of claims not covered by the statute but cognizable under traditional habeas corpus review would be resolved under the common law) and the prevailing construction that harmonized the incompatible objectives of the PCRA by channeling the broader category of claims into the general jurisdictional and procedural framework of the PCRA. <em>See Lantzy, </em><a href="/pa/558/0214-01" class="citation" data-index="118" data-cite="558 Pa. 214" data-case-ids="838560" data-case-paths="/pa/558/0214-01">558 Pa. at </a>222-23 &amp; n. 4, <a href="/a2d/736/0564-01" class="citation" data-index="119" data-cite="736 A.2d 564" data-case-ids="11575941,838560" data-case-paths="/a2d/736/0564-01,/pa/558/0214-01">736 A.2d at </a>569-70 &amp; n. 4.</p>

It should be noted, however, that, in terms of their culpability, Appellant and Wyatt are not identically situated relative to the underlying robbery-homicide, since Wyatt did not supply the accomplice with the handgun used to perpetrate it, as Appellant did. <em>See </em>Majority Opinion, at 1266. Moreover, as the Commonwealth develops at length in its brief, the <em>Huffman </em>issue is a discrete type of claim that goes solely to a conviction for first-degree murder. <em>See Huffman, </em><a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="140" data-cite="536 Pa. 196" data-case-ids="1843201" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01">536 Pa. at 198</a>, <a href="/pa/536/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="141" data-cite="638 A.2d 961" data-case-ids="1843201,7374211" data-case-paths="/pa/536/0196-01,/a2d/638/0961-01">638 A.2d at 962</a>. Given Appellant’s conviction for the associated robbery and the jury’s express finding that the killing was perpetrated in the course thereof, the crime of second-degree murder is a lesser included offense to his first-degree murder conviction. <em>See Commonwealth v. Roberts, </em><a href="/pa/484/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="142" data-cite="484 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1753705" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0500-01">484 Pa. 500</a>, 503, <a href="/pa/484/0500-01" class="citation" data-index="143" data-cite="484 Pa. 500" data-case-ids="1753705" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0500-01">399 A.2d 404</a>, 405 (1979). Since Appellant’s challenge does not impact on this lesser included offense, I believe that the most that Appellant should be able to expect from his <em>Huffman </em>claim, if it were to prevail, is a modification of his sentence from first — to second-degree murder. <em>See generally </em>James A. Shellenberger and James A. Strazzella, <em>The Lesser Included Offense Doctrine and the Constitution: The Development of Due Process and Double Jeopardy Remedies, </em><a href="/citations/?q=79%20Marq.%20L.%20Rev.%201" class="citation" data-index="144" data-cite="79 Marq.

L.Rev. 1</a>, 183-89 (1995) (collecting cases relative to the appellate courts’ power to modify judgments of sentence in cases in which trial error does not affect lesser included offenses). Notably, such a change would have no impact on the life sentence that Appellant is serving. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 1102(b) (requiring the imposition of a life sentence upon a conviction for second-degree murder). Thus, as the Commonwealth argues, on its merits, this case can be viewed as presenting a largely academic exercise, and one that the Post Conviction Relief Act was not designed to address.</p>

    <p id="b462-8" data-blocks='[["BL_462.8",462,[285,718,1156,1225]]]'>Under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. § 9541 <em>et seq., </em>all petitions, including second or subsequent petitions, must be filed within one year of the date the judgment of sentence becomes final, unless one of the statutory exceptions applies. <em>Chester, </em>at 522 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1); <em>Commonwealth v. Yarris, </em><a href="/pa/557/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="150" data-cite="557 Pa. 12" data-case-ids="56747" data-case-paths="/pa/557/0012-01">557 Pa. 12</a>, <a href="/a2d/731/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="151" data-cite="731 A.2d 581" data-case-ids="11666446,56747" data-case-paths="/a2d/731/0581-01,/pa/557/0012-01">731 A.2d 581</a> (1999)). The PCRA’s time-bar is jurisdictional in nature. <em>Commonwealth v. Peterkin, </em><a href="/pa/554/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="152" data-cite="554 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="765982" data-case-paths="/pa/554/0547-01">554 Pa. 547</a>, <a href="/a2d/722/0638-01" class="citation" data-index="153" data-cite="722 A.2d 638" data-case-ids="11773538,765982" data-case-paths="/a2d/722/0638-01,/pa/554/0547-01">722 A.2d 638</a>, 641 (1998). Appellant argues this Court should consider his PCRA petition under the exception to the one-year time limitation in 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(ii). This subsection requires a petitioner to prove the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to him and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence. <em>Chester </em>recognized “for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(1)(ii), information is not ‘unknown’ to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record.” <em>Chester, </em>at 523 (citing <em>Commonwealth v. Lark, </em><a href="/pa/560/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="154" data-cite="560 Pa. 487" data-case-ids="95775" data-case-paths="/pa/560/0487-01">560 Pa. 487</a>, <a href="/a2d/746/0585-01" class="citation" data-index="155" data-cite="746 A.2d 585" data-case-ids="11471640,95775" data-case-paths="/a2d/746/0585-01,/pa/560/0487-01">746 A.2d 585</a>, 588 n. 4 (2000); <em>Commonwealth v.

Under <em>Chester, </em>it is clear information that is a matter of public record — like the dismissal of an appeal — is not “unknown” to a PCRA petitioner. Therefore, appellant cannot meet § 9545(b)(1)(ii).</p>
