As a result of these new convictions, the trial court, on May 21, 2001, revoked Holmes’s parole from the September 16, 1997 sentence of incarceration imposed for the violation of the probationary sentence imposed on May 17, 1996, concluding that Holmes had violated his parole “in re sentence of 9-16-97.” Rather than recommitting Holmes to serve the remainder of the sentence imposed on September 16, 1997, as would be proper for a parole violation, <em>see, supra, </em>at 59 n. 5, the court sentenced Holmes as if he had violated probation, imposing a new sentence of three to six years of incarceration to run concurrently with any other current sentence for unrelated crimes. Notwithstanding its impropriety, Holmes did not appeal this sentence. On April 9, 2002, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>vacated the sentence imposed on May 21, 2001, presumably realizing that the parole violation sentence imposing three to six years of incarceration was improper because it set a minimum sentence and because its maximum exceeded the eleven and one-half to twenty-three month sentence Holmes received when sentenced for the original probation violation on September 16,1997.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Thus, he could not have violated something that no longer existed. Consequently, he argues that the violation found in May 2001 related to his parole from the eleven and one-half to twenty-three-month sentence of incarceration imposed in September 1997. Accordingly, any sentence for that violation must be limited by the duration of the September 1997 sentence, twenty-three months. Citing <em>Cole </em>and <em>Jones, </em>Holmes contends that the trial court acted within its power to correct the obvious and patent mistake of sentencing him in excess of the original twenty-three-month sentence of September 1997 rather than recommitting him to serve the remainder of that sentence. Holmes also suggests that all illegal sentences are obvious and patent mistakes, citing numerous Superior Court cases for broad statements regarding courts’ power to address illegal sentences.</p>

It notes the distinction between the issue of waiver and jurisdiction, quoting our explanation of jurisdiction as “the power, right, or authority to interpret and apply the law.” Brief for Commonwealth (Holmes) at 12 (quoting <em>Commonwealth v.

While acknowledging that a claim of sentence illegality may never be waived and may be addressed by a court <em>sua sponte, </em>it argues that the court must first have jurisdiction over the case to address the issue. Citing this Court’s decision in <em>Fahy, </em>the Commonwealth contends that the only method for the trial court to have obtained jurisdiction to correct the sentence after the running of the thirty days would have been pursuant to the <a id="p610" href="#p610" data-label="610" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*610</a>PCRA, which Holmes had not invoked as of April 2002, when the trial court vacated the sentenóe.</p>

Consistent with our observation in note 8, <em>supra, </em>the Commonwealth observes that there was no jurisdictional question in <em>Jones, </em>when the court acted immediately to correct the erroneous sentence, and, accordingly, that case is easily distinguished from the case at bar.

The Commonwealth argues that not only had the thirty-day period for correction of orders under Section 5505 expired, but also that the court had been divested of jurisdiction when Whitfield appealed to the Superior Court. The Commonwealth further argues that the PCRA is the sole means for obtaining collateral relief. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9542 (“This subchapter provides for an action by which ... persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief. The action established in this subchapter shall be the sole means of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common law and statutory remedies .... ”).

Prior to the June 30 re-sentencing, the defendant filed a notice of appeal of the June 23 sentencing order, thus terminating the trial court’s jurisdiction. The trial court, on June 30, rejected the defendant’s claim that the court did not have jurisdiction, and amended the order to indicate only one day of time served.

Not all illegal sentences will be amenable to correction as patent errors. Moreover, the inherent power to correct errors does not extend to reconsideration of a court’s exercise of sentencing discretion. A court may not vacate a sentencing order merely because it later considers a sentence too harsh or too lenient. The cases at bar are not cases where a court reconsidered the application of its sentencing discretion or its interpretation of a nuanced or ambiguous statutory <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>provision.

As commonly defined, probation is "La] sentence imposed for commission of crime whereby a convicted criminal offender is released into the community under the supervision of a probation officer in lieu of incarceration.” Black’s Law Dictionary, 835 (6th ed.1991). Conversely, parole is the “[rjelease from jail, prison or other confinement after actually serving part of the sentence.

As is relevant, a court faced with a violation of probation may impose a new sentence so long as it is within the sentencing alternatives available at the time of the original sentence. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9771(b) ("Upon revocation [of probation] the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing, due consideration being given to the time spent serving the order of probation.”). In contrast, a court faced with a parole violation must recommit the parolee to serve the remainder of the original sentence of imprisonment, from which the prisoner could be reparoled. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fair, </em><a href="/pa-super/345/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="497 A.2d 643" data-case-ids="639152" data-case-paths="/pa-super/345/0061-01">345 Pa.Super. 61</a>, <a href="/pa-super/345/0061-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="497 A.2d 643" data-case-ids="639152" data-case-paths="/pa-super/345/0061-01">497 A.2d 643</a>, 645 (1985) ("The power of the court after a finding of violation of parole in cases not under the control of the State Board of Parole is ‘to recommit to jail.... ’ There is no authority for giving a new sentence with a minimum and maximum.” (internal citation omitted)).</p>

There is the possibility Whitfield may have been influenced by the trial court to withdraw his appeal after the court amended his sentence; if so, then the trial court's unauthorized action in vacating Whitfield’s sentence would have lulled Whitfield into forgoing direct and collateral review, allowing the time period for filing a PCRA petition to expire. Thus, the governmental interference exception to the PCRA’s one-year time-bar may apply. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9545(b)(l)(i) (failure to raise claim previously was result of interference by governmental officials with presentation of claim). Because it is unclear from the record what the circumstances leading to Whitfield's withdrawal of his direct appeal were, remand for consideration of such circumstances would be appropriate.</p>
