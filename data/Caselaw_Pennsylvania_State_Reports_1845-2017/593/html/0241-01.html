    <p id="b298-6" data-blocks='[["BL_298.5",298,[283,466,1157,1866]]]'>On December 20, 2006, under the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act (“Gaming Act” or “Act”), 4 Pa.C.S. § 1101 <em>et seq., </em>the petitioner, the Pennsylvania Gaming Board (“Board”), approved two slot machine licenses for Intervenors, HSP Gaming, L.P. (“HSP”) and Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners, L.P., (“Philadelphia Entertainment”) in the City of Philadelphia (“Philadelphia” or “City”). As part of that decision, the Board approved the location of the licensed facilities that HSP and Philadelphia Entertainment proposed respectively to establish. On March 29, 2007, the City Council of Philadelphia (“City Council”) enacted an ordinance (the “Ordinance”) that submits a ballot question to Philadelphia’s qualified electors, asking them whether the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter should be amended to prohibit City Council and the City’s Department of Licenses and Inspections from taking certain actions that would permit the use of gaming within designated areas of the City. The Board filed the above-captioned petitions against City Council, Patricia Rafferty, in her official capacity as the Chief Clerk of City Council, the Philadelphia County Board of Elections, and certain Acting County Commissioners in their official capacity as members of the Philadelphia Board of County Elections (collectively, “Respondents”), seeking to permanently enjoin them from submitting the ballot question to the Philadelphia electorate on election day. We conclude that the Ordinance is contrary to the Gaming Act because it allows the electorate to consider and nullify the decision the Board made as to the location of licensed facilities in Philadelphia and direct City Council and the City’s Department of Licenses and Inspections to disregard those local laws by which the Board’s decision is to be implemented. Accordingly, we hold that the Board is clearly entitled to the relief it seeks, and order that Respondents are permanently enjoined from placing the question on the ballot.</p>

In July of 2004, the General Assembly enacted the Gaming Act, a statute of statewide concern that provides for slot machine gaming at a set number of licensed facilities within the Commonwealth. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1102. The Act established the Board, and gives it the “general and sole regulatory authority over the conduct of gaming or related activities as described in this part.” 4 Pa.C.S. §§ 1201(a), 1202(a)(1). The Act defines the “[c]onduct of gaming” as “[t]he licensed placement and operation of games of chance under this part and approved by the [Board] at a licensed facilityf,]” and “[licensed facility” as “[t]he physical land-based location at which a licensed gaming entity is authorized to place and operate slot machines.” 4 Pa.C.S. § 1103. The Board is specifically empowered and obligated under the Act “to issue, approve, renew, revoke, suspend, condition or deny [the] issuance or renewal of slot machine licenses[,]” at its discretion. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1202(b)(12). The Act instructs the Board that the “location and quality of the proposed facility” is a factor that it may take into account when considering an application for a slot machine license. 4 Pa.C.S. § 1325(c)(1).</p>

Chapter 14-400 is intended “to encourage the orderly development of major entertainment facilities,” and provides a regulatory framework for the establishment of “Commercial Entertainment District[s]” (“CEDs”) in Philadelphia. (Exhibits to the Petitions for Review at 7) Under Chapter 14-400, City Council designates a CED by ordinance in appropriate areas of the City. Upon CED designation, all underlying zoning classifications are superseded, and the owner of a lot in the CED may submit a plan of development to the City’s Planning Commission. The plan is reviewed for compliance with the regulations set forth in Chapter 14-400, which cover permitted uses, boundaries, height, off-street parking, signs, off-street loading, and design. Upon approval of the plan by City Council, the City’s Department of Licenses and Inspections is authorized to issue the necessary building and zoning permits. As to gaming facilities, Section 14-405 of Chapter 14-400 provides that “[n]othing in this Chapter shall limit the right of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board under the [Gaming] Act to identify the property on which it will permit a Category 2 licensed facility within the City[,]” and that “[n]othing in this Chapter shall be construed to prohibit any use that is exclusively regulated and <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>permitted by the Commonwealth under the [Gaming] Act.” (Exhibits to Petitions for Review at 8).</p>

In the Adjudication of the Pennsylvania Gaming Hearing Board in the Matters of the Applications for Category 2 Slot Machine Licenses in the City of the First Class, Philadelphia the Board issued, the Board observed that the location of HSP’s proposed site is in an area of the City zoned for uses compatible with or analogous to gaming, and that the location of Philadelphia Entertainment’s proposed site is fully compliant with the requirements of a CED district. The Board also took note of the ordinances that Philadelphia adopted for the creation of CEDs where gaming facilities are permitted, and anticipated that the process outlined in the Philadelphia Code for creating them would move forward.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

Regarding these prerequisites to a merits determination, I agree with the majority that the board is aggrieved by Council’s passage of the ordinance and its implementation, as such presumes to provide the electorate with the opportunity to override the Board's decision regarding where licensed facilities are to be located. I agree also with the majority's conclusion that the Board possesses standing to seek to enjoin implementation of the ordinance, based upon the Board's statutory duty to locate licensed facilities within cities of the first class. <em>See 4 </em>Pa.C.S. § 1304(b)(1). Moreover, given my agreement with the majority's ultimate decision on the merits, that a permanent injunction is warranted because the Board has sole authority to locate the licensed facilities at issue, the resulting of the referendum would be a nullity. In my view, it is crucially important that we prevent an election that is void from the outset. <em>See Deer Creek Drainage Basin Authority v.

The <em>per curiam </em>order contained no citation explaining the jurisdictional basis for the Court’s order in prohibition, nor any merits citation or discussion to justify the extraordinary relief granted. The Court goes a step further today and grants a permanent injunction, ordering that the citizens of Philadelphia shall never be permitted to vote upon the Charter change referendum their local representatives would have them consider.

Blackstone says, Book III, *42: ‘The jurisdiction of this court (of King’s Bench) is very high and transcendent. It keeps all inferior jurisdictions within the bounds of their authority, and may either remove their proceedings to be determined here, or prohibit their progress below.’ By the Act of 1722 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was placed in the same relation to all inferior jurisdictions that the King’s <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>Bench in England occupied, and thus the power of superintendency over inferior tribunals became vested in this Court from the time of its creation: <em>Commonwealth v.

If the Majority believes the circumstance presented involves the latter scenario, or if it prefers that route as a way to back away from the patent jurisdictional error it made on April 13, it should identify that court and the basis for its jurisdiction, and then explain why it would ignore the parties’ jurisdictional arguments, perceive an issue of judicial supervision or administration, and <em>sua sponte </em>assume jurisdiction rather than transferring the matter to the court which should hear the “important” case in the first instance.</p>

The extraordinary anti-democratic relief sought — enjoining the vote of the citizens — likewise should weigh heavily against the Court becoming the Board’s supplemental advocate and creating a jurisdictional end-around to advance the Board’s objectives. Finally, the “harm” alleged by the Board has nothing to do with its cognizable bureaucratic “interests,” but at best is political, and that alleged harm is a mere piffle compared to the fundamental, extraordinary harm the agency seeks to visit upon the voters of Philadelphia by depriving them of the franchise.

The Majority purports to engage in a plain meaning construction of Section 1506 of the Act. But, that construction is implausible, and riot only for the reasons articulated by Justice Saylor in dissent. The Act speaks of appealing “final” decisions. The ordinance and referendum here are but a stage in the Philadelphia legislative process. The ordinance merely places a charter change question on the ballot; the City Charter would actually be amended if, and only if, the electorate responded in the affirmative. Until the People have spoken, there is no relevant final “order, determination or decision” at issue, under any plausible plain meaning approach. No doubt, the obvious absence of a final decision is what leads to the Majority’s repeated mischaracterization of the ballot question as giving Philadelphia voters an opportunity to override the Board’s licensing decisions. The actual ballot question, as phrased by Council, says no such thing. The ballot question does not even address the Board, its powers, or its licensing decisions; if adopted, it would apply only to Council which, unlike the Board, is answerable to the people of Philadelphia.</p>

Despite its insistence that the plain meaning of the statute commands its conclusion that the Board may air any political or trivial grievance directly in this Court, the Majority adverts to extraneous interpretative points, such as the statute’s overall purpose to facilitate the hasty implementation of gaming. In a particularly revealing passage, the Majority invokes another principle of construction and claims that it would be “absurd” to conclude that the General Assembly would allocate direct review jurisdiction over licensing appeals and constitutional challenges to this Court, but not also require direct review of injunctive challenges to ordinances approving ballot questions which, if answered a certain way, might (and only might) then “impact on” the decision of the Board’s licensing decisions concerning Philadelphia casinos.

Questions involving the Board’s attempt to interfere in local legislative processes, and to deny the people a right to vote upon proposed changes to local charters, no doubt, simply were not contemplated. The Gaming Act creates enough of a burden upon this Court, requiring direct review of constitutional challenges and licensing decisions. I would not torture the statute, the plain meaning of words such as “appeal” and “final determination,” and the actual content of the ballot question at issue, to pretend that the statute places these sorts of injunctive “appeals,” which seek to suspend the franchise, in this Court as well.</p>

Respecting immediacy, I cannot discern what harm the Board would suffer (assuming a bureaucracy can be said to suffer cognizable harm in this area, but more on that later). Any harm was entirely contingent. Harm allegedly would arise if the electorate’s right to vote had not been suspended by the Court, if a majority of Philadelphia voters then voted in favor of the Charter change, and if the City Council then acted on that change. The harm consisted in the alleged fact that implementation of the Board’s licensing decisions might then be affected in some vague way. I say vague because, according to the Board and the Majority, all the power is with the Board, so any action of Council would be a nullity. Null acts tend to cause little harm.

Since both the Board and the Majority feel that the Board has “sole authority” in this area, relief in the ordinary course is more than sufficient to vindicate the Board’s alleged interest — all without taking the extraordinary step of sacrificing the People’s sacred franchise. It would require sophistry of the highest and most disingenuous order to suggest that the public interest is more harmed by denial of the injunction than by granting it, or to suggest that it is a greater injury for the Board to have to await actual harm to seek relief than it is to suspend the right to vote in Philadelphia.</p>

This is an extraordinary, and extraordinarily dangerous, assumption in a democracy. Statewide legislation may occupy a field, it may displace a local expression, it may disapprove a local expression, but how can it operate to deprive the citizenry of the right to even pass upon a subject? If a local law, once actually enacted, proves to be unconstitutional, or to be inconsistent with some greater authority, there is time enough to remedy the matter in the ordinary course, after the law has been voted on and approved, and after considered deliberation.</p>

Again, the ballot question does not purport to tell the General Assembly or the Board what to do. The measure is purely local, aimed at the citizens’ local representatives. If adopted, the referendum would approve a Charter change which would restrain Council, not the Board or the General Assembly. It is one thing for a locality to acquiesce in, or to knuckle under to, state-imposed decisions with which the subdivision might disagree. It is quite another to warmly embrace and go the extra mile to advance the state-imposed directive. The Majority’s notion that expressions of restraint and dissent have no role in democracy in Pennsylvania is a strange one, indeed.</p>

It is particularly bizarre to conclude otherwise when there are actual interested parties, ie., the license applicants. I would not recognize bureaucracy standing just because the Board invokes different roles (now agency, now quasi-judicial, now aggrieved litigant), at different times. The fact that the Board has a position on the ballot measure (it inconveniences the Board) does not mean it has a cognizable legal interest in it. The Board’s interest is similar to that of an amicus curiae; but it hardly has the substantial, direct and immediate interest required to establish party standing, such that it can properly pursue an action to kill a ballot measure.</p>

Suppression of the vote may well be a political concern for the Board, but it is not a cognizable legal “interest” sufficient to establish standing. Why should the Board, unlike all other governmental entities, be deemed immune from the opinion of the citizenry and the ordinary processes of government and litigation? As an arm of govern<a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>ment, the Board should not be encouraged to seek to suppress the views of the public as expressed in the legislative process.</p>

Thus, the citizens of Philadelphia cannot be permitted to so much as voice their opinion on the location of gaming facilities in Philadelphia, but the fictional “person” which is the Board, we are to believe, possesses a “substantial, direct and immediate interest” in the licensing decisions, an interest so strong that it defeats the franchise and the ordinary legislative process. This is perverse: Bureaucracy has a “right” to be heard; the People do not. I would reverse the Majority’s skewed priorities and let the People vote!</p>
