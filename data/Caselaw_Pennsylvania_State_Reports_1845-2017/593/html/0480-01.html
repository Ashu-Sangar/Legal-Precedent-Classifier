Its primary complaint is that regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor and Industry (the “Department” or “DLI”) implement an overly broad construction of the term “state-owned buildings” to include buildings located at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center (the “Medical Center”) in Derry Township.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> According to Appellant, the effect of the Department’s regulation, in conjunction with the application of the Pennsylvania Construc<a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>tion Code Act, 35 P.S. § 7201.101-7201.1103, which requires the Department to maintain plan and specification review and inspection authority of all State-owned buildings, 35 P.S. § 7210.301, is to displace the ability of municipalities to review and approve construction plans, issue building permits, and collect fees, in connection with the construction of certain non-Commonwealth buildings.

    <p id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.6",535,[189,741,1156,830]]]'>Presently, Appellant argues that its petition for review presented an appropriate claim for declaratory relief based on undisputed allegations that an overly-broad regulation adopted by DLI was being applied to construction projects within Derry Township. According to Appellant, the issue presented in its petition for review was adequately developed for judicial review, and the Commonwealth Court’s refusal to consider the petition will cause harm to the Township in terms of the expense, burden, and delay of pursuing a municipal enforcement action against the Medical Center. Appellant regards such course as particularly burdensome, since such an action will not even resolve the question of the propriety of the challenged DLI regulation. Moreover, Appellant asserts that the issue presented in the petition for review is primarily a question of law, and there were no factual disputes justifying dismissal of the action.</p>

It stresses the importance of the resolution by the Commonwealth of matters of statewide importance, such as the interpretation of a statute by a Commonwealth administrative agency, since the Commonwealth Court is the statewide tribunal of special expertise designed for just such purpose. Further, DLI explains that “there are clearly antagonistic claims regarding the validity of the definition of <em>State-owned building </em>in the [Department’s regulations] and the responsibility for plan and specification review and inspection of ongoing construction projects at [the Medical Center].” Brief for DLI at 10 (emphasis in original). DLI also observes that the Commonwealth Court’s decision in this case is inconsistent <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>with its earlier decision in a pre-enforcement challenge to Department regulations on manufactured housing requirements. <em>See DRB, Inc. v.

Indeed, the Department suggests that this case presents a more concrete controversy than that presented in <em>DRB, </em>since the regulation in question is presently being enforced by the Department. <em>See </em>Brief for DLI at 11 (“There is an ongoing controversy in Derry Township concerning enforcement of this regulation. Commonwealth Court did not even mention in its analysis that there is real and pending construction”). Finally, the Department agrees with Appellant that the issues involved are purely legal in character; the parties are clearly at odds regarding the validity and application of the challenged regulations that are enforced by the Department and municipalities; and the parties are suffering actual harm due to the uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the challenged regulation. <em>See <a href="/pa/585/0008-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="887 A.2d 1216" data-case-ids="2472803,9004911" data-case-paths="/pa/585/0008-01,/a2d/887/1216-01">id.</a> </em>DLI thus contends that the Commonwealth Court’s order should be vacated; however, it invites this Court to rule in its favor on the matters raised in its preliminary objections. <em>See id. </em>at 13-17.</p>
