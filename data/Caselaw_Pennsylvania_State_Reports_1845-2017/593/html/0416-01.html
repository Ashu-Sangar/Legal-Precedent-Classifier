    <p id="b468-16" data-blocks='[["BL_468.12",468,[299,1577,1151,526]]]'>A material aspect of the Commonwealth Court’s resolution of this matter is found in its statement that “[t]he trial court found that Conrail asked [Petitioners] whether they would do the work and the answer was ‘No.’ ” <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. City of Harrisburg, </em>No. 238 C.D.2006, <em>slip op. </em>at 8 (September 12, 2006). The trial court, however, stated to the contrary. <em>See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. City of Harrisburg, </em>No. 3780 S 1998, <em>slip op. </em>at 12 (C.C.P. Dauphin January 19, 2006) (stating that “Defendants have never refused to perform the work, but refused to pay for the work initiated by plaintiff.”).</p>

We make this point only because various statements of fact on the part of the Commonwealth Court appear to be couched in terms of “findings,” whereas the function of the courts at the summary judgment stage is not to find facts, but rather, to examine whether there are genuine disputes as to material facts in issue and whether any party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Trowbridge.</em>
