Buffalo Valley is the owner of a 230-acre tract of land located in the Township, and McVille Mining owns or leases the coal under this tract and adjacent lands, totaling approximately 1,000 acres. Rosebud Mining Company has an option to purchase McVille Mining and will operate the proposed facilities. Following a hearing, the Township’s Planning Commission issued findings of fact and conclusions of law, recommending that the applications be approved. On June 12, 2000, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Township’s Board of Supervisors (the “Supervisors”) adopted a motion to grant the requested permits, and mining activities commenced in December of that year.</p>

The court granted the Supervisors’ preliminary objections, however, and dismissed the case, as the matter did not fall within the Commonwealth Court’s original jurisdiction.</p>

Further, Appellants asserted that, due to these violations, they had not been permitted to express their concerns regarding the consequences of the mining operations and the effects of such activities on their own properties, an opportunity to which they were entitled pursuant to Section 913.2(a) and the Township’s zoning ordinance. <em>See </em>South Buffalo Township Zoning Ordinance, § 401 (1990). Accordingly, Appellants sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Supervisors to hold public hearings on the permit applications, following adequate public notice, and to order all mining activities to cease pending the outcome of such hearing. The Supervisors filed preliminary objections, asserting that Appellants’ complaint was essentially a land use appeal that should have been filed within thirty days of the decision granting the conditional use permits pursuant to Section 1002-A of the MPC. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11002-A.</p>

The court reasoned that, because the Township’s grant of the conditional use permits in the present matter fell within its powers under Section 909.1(b)(3) of the MPC, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 10909.1(b)(3), the exclusive method by which Appellants could obtain review of the Supervisors’ decision was by appeal within thirty days. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11002-A. Noting that the complaint was filed sixteen months after the permit applications had been approved, the common pleas court determined that the action was untimely. In addition, the court explained that Appellants’ reliance on Section 610 of the MPC, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 10610, which requires notice of all proposed zoning ordinances, was misplaced, as the present matter involved the grant of a conditional use permit, not the enactment of a zoning ordinance.</p>

The court noted that Appellants could have challenged the Supervisors’ grant of the conditional use permits at issue via an appeal pursuant to Article XI of the MPC, <em>see </em>53 P.S. § 11002-A, which provides a right to appeal from all land use decisions within thirty days, including challenges to the procedures by which such decisions are made. Relying on its decision in <em>Schadler v.

The court found the concerns of finality elucidated in <em>Schadler I, </em>which addressed a challenge to the enactment of a zoning ordinance, to be equally applicable in situations, like the present matter, that concern the quasi-judicial act of permit approval. <em>See Luke I, </em><a href="/a2d/830/0655-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="830 A.2d 655" data-case-ids="9098387" data-case-paths="/a2d/830/0655-01">830 A.2d at </a>658 n. 9. Further, the court noted that a mandamus action may not be used as a guise to file an otherwise untimely appeal. <em>See Lizzi v. </em>

      <em>(“Luke II </em>”). More specifically, the court reasoned that there is a broad distinction between a challenge to the validity of a zoning ordinance, the situation in <em>Schadler, </em>and a challenge to the grant of a conditional use permit, the circumstance that gave rise to the present litigation. The court further explained that decisions of administrative agencies are subject to strict appeal deadlines, <em>see, e.g., </em>53 P.S. § 11002-A, while legislative enactments may be set aside or reinterpreted at ^tny time without voiding every decision made in accordance with the invalid statute; instead, generally only parties whose cases remain active may take advantage of changes in the law. <em>See Luke II, </em><a href="/a2d/883/1114-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="883 A.2d 1114" data-case-ids="8917084" data-case-paths="/a2d/883/1114-01">883 A.2d at </a>1119 n. 12.

Similarly, the court noted, Section 5571(c)(5), as it read at that time, contained the same time bar. 42 Pa.C.S. § 5571(c)(5) (1978) (“Questions relating to an alleged defect in the process of enactment or adoption of any ordinance, resolution, map or similar action of a political subdivision shall be raised by appeal commenced within 30 days after the effective date of the ordinance, resolution, map or similar action.”).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The Commonwealth Court also explained that this Court had previously addressed whether an ordinance not enacted in compliance with the MPC could be challenged more than thirty days after its adoption and concluded that such actions were not untimely, as an invalid ordinance had no effective date from which the time limitation could commence. <em>See Cranberry Park, </em><a href="/pa/561/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="561 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="92845" data-case-paths="/pa/561/0456-01">561 Pa. at 462</a>, <a href="/a2d/751/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="751 A.2d 165" data-case-ids="11508905,92845" data-case-paths="/a2d/751/0165-01,/pa/561/0456-01">751 A.2d at 168</a> (“As of <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>1995, eight years after the Ordinance was passed, the Ordinance was still not numbered, dated, signed or recorded in the ordinance book of the township, thus it never became effective.

As a policy matter, this Court further reasoned that ensuring public notice and comment on proposed ordinances or amendments was an important consideration underlying the mandatory nature of statutoiy procedures. <em>See id. </em>at 189, <a href="/pa/578/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="850 A.2d 619" data-case-ids="1329342,1329346,9228938,9228989" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0177-01,/pa/578/0176-02,/a2d/850/0619-01,/a2d/850/0619-02">850 A.2d at 627</a>. Accordingly, the Court concluded, the analysis underlying <em>Lower Gwynedd </em>and <em>Cranberry Park </em>remained valid, and a township’s failure to comply with other procedural requirements would continue to render an ordinance void <em>ab initio </em>such that the thirty-day appeal period would not bar later challenges on these grounds. <em>See id. </em>at 188, <a href="/pa/578/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="850 A.2d 619" data-case-ids="1329342,1329346,9228938,9228989" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0177-01,/pa/578/0176-02,/a2d/850/0619-01,/a2d/850/0619-02">850 A.2d at 626</a>.</p>

In this regard, Appellants concede that Section 1002-A of the MPC limits appeals of land use determinations to a thirty-day period following the issuance of such decisions. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 11002-A (“All appeals from all land use decisions rendered pursuant to Article IX ... shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the decision[.]”). However, Appellants argue, pertinent provisions of the MPC, like those applicable to zoning ordinances, require public notice and hearing prior to the approval of conditional use permits. More specifically, Appellants observe that Section 603(c)(2) provides that conditional uses must be “allowed or denied by the governing body pursuant to public notice and hearing ... and pursuant to express standards and criteria set forth in the <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>zoning ordinances.” 53 P.S. § 10603(c)(2). In addition, Appellants note that Section 913.2(a) mandates that a hearing be held to consider applications for conditional use permits pursuant to standards and criteria expressed in the Township’s zoning ordinance. <em>See </em>53 P.S. § 10913.2(a) (“Where the governing body, in the zoning, ordinances, has stated conditional uses to be granted or denied by the governing body pursuant to express standards and criteria, the governing body shall hold hearings on and decide requests for such conditional uses in accordance with such standards and criteria.”). Further, Appellants explain, the Township’s zoning ordinance contains extensive standards concerning the prerequisites necessary for approval of a conditional use permit, which they contend McVille Mining and Rosebud Mining have not satisfied. <em>See </em>South Buffalo Township Zoning Ordinance, §§ 401-402.</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[300,1142,1152,1192]]]'>Appellants also assert that the notice and hearing requirements for the approval of conditional use permits, like those applicable to zoning ordinances, are mandatory. <em>See Lower Gwynedd, </em><a href="/pa/527/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="527 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1827702" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0324-01">527 Pa. at 329</a>, <a href="/pa/527/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="527 Pa. 324" data-case-ids="1827702" data-case-paths="/pa/527/0324-01">591 A.2d at 288</a> (“The precedents of this Court have been consistent in holding that statutory publication requirements are mandatory and that ordinances adopted without strict compliance are void.”).

In addition, Appellees contend that the concerns of due process underlying the reasoning of <em>Schadler II </em>are not implicated by the present matter, as Appellants have not established that any property rights have been impaired by the mining operations at issue. In this regard, Appellees observe that conditional uses, such as the recovery of natural resources, are expressly permitted by the Township’s zoning ordinance, subject to approval by the Supervisors, and must be granted if the criteria specified in the ordinance are satisfied. <em>See </em>South Buffalo Township Zoning Ordinance, Table 201, RR. at 73-74. Further, Appellees note that there are indications in the record that public notice was provided for both the Planning Commission’s and the Supervisors’ meetings on the conditional use permits at issue. <em>See </em>Brief of Defendants in Support of Preliminary Objections, RR. at 27-28 (alleging that notice was twice published in a newspaper).

However, these differences do not preclude the application of <em>Schadler II, </em>which concerned a procedurally defective zoning ordinance, to a situation involving the approval of a conditional use permit in violation of pertinent procedural requirements. Indeed, the reasoning of <em>Schadler II </em>was not premised solely upon the fact that the question presented addressed the validity of a zoning ordinance. Instead, the Court emphasized the “egregious procedural defects” that rendered the ordinance at issue void <em>ab initio, </em>namely, the failure to provide the public with adequate notice concerning the alteration of zoning provisions by not publishing the required newspaper advertisements containing information about the ordinance and not filing a copy of the ordinance in a designated county office. <em>See Schadler II, </em><a href="/pa/578/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="44" data-cite="578 Pa. 177" data-case-ids="1329342" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0177-01">578 Pa. at 188-89</a>, <a href="/pa/578/0177-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="850 A.2d 619" data-case-ids="1329342,1329346,9228938,9228989" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0177-01,/pa/578/0176-02,/a2d/850/0619-01,/a2d/850/0619-02">850 A.2d at 626</a>.
