Appellant appealed to the Board of Finance and Revenue, arguing that it, as a corporation, is not subject to the bank shares tax, and that the tax should instead be levied upon its shareholders. Appellant further maintained that its sole shareholder (first FMB, then AFI) could not constitutionally be subject to the tax because Appellant is a foreign corporation not organized under the laws of Pennsylvania and neither FMB nor AFI is incorporated or commercially domiciled in Pennsylvania. After the Board affirmed the resettlements, Appellant petitioned for review in the Commonwealth Court, renewing its contention that the tax at issue is intended to be imposed upon its shareholders, and that the constitution prohibits such taxation in the present case because FMB and AFI were neither incorporated nor commercially domiciled in Pennsylvania.</p>

The majority similarly noted that, in a case from the 1940s, the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County — which at the time heard appeals from tax resettlements — had concluded that a previous enactment of the bank shares tax was “a tax not upon the bank but upon the shareholders.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Applying these factors to the present situation, the Commonwealth Court majority noted that the Commonwealth may not directly enforce the bank shares tax against shareholders should the bank default on the payment of the tax; banks must pay the tax on the interest of a shareholder who sells his investment after the assessment date but prior to the payment date; and banks have no statutory right to recover the tax from their shareholders. Finally, the majority considered the statutory language as supporting the conclusion that the tax is levied on the bank and not the shareholders. <em>See Allfirst Bank, </em><a href="/a2d/895/0669-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="895 A.2d 669" data-case-ids="8431958" data-case-paths="/a2d/895/0669-01">895 A.2d at 672-73</a>.</p>

Noting that prior decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had construed the tax as levied against shareholders and that the statute on its face “lays the tax upon the property of the stockholder, represented by the shares he owns,” the <em>Schuylkill Trust II </em>Court concluded that the tax was imposed upon shareholders and not the assets of the trust company. <em>See <a href="/us/302/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="302 U.S. 506" data-case-ids="6142013" data-case-paths="/us/302/0506-01">id. </a></em><a href="/us/302/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="302 U.S. 506" data-case-ids="6142013" data-case-paths="/us/302/0506-01">at 512-13</a>, <a href="/us/302/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="302 U.S. 506" data-case-ids="6142013" data-case-paths="/us/302/0506-01">58 S.Ct. at 298</a>.

In support of this contention, Appellant largely echoes the arguments of the Commonwealth Court dissent, and indicates as well that the Commonwealth does not dispute that the tax is unconstitutional to the extent it purports to tax the personal property of a foreign corporation that is not commercially domiciled in Pennsylvania and does not conduct banking activities here. As to the latter point, Appellant stresses that shares of stock have historically been considered to be present at the owner’s domicile, and that, accordingly, Appellant’s non-domiciliary owner’s property nominally subject to taxation under the bank shares tax (i.e., all shares of stock in Appellant) is located out-of-state, and thus, may not constitutionally be taxed by Pennsylvania.

Such a tax, the Commonwealth maintains, is permissible in the present context where the bank conducts business in Pennsylvania, the tax is apportioned to reach only that segment of value attributable to in-state activities, and the tax does not otherwise run afoul of federal statutory law. As for the Department’s administrative documents and practices which refer to the tax as a property tax on shares, the Commonwealth portrays these as “remnants of history, having their roots in a time before artificial distinctions were supplanted by a focus on practical effects in the analysis of the nature of a tax.” Brief for Commonwealth at 8.</p>

Indeed, under the express terms of the statute, the tax is assessed in the name of individual banks, and its direct and immediate incidence falls squarely on the banks. <em>See 12 </em>P.S. § 7701 (“It shall be the duty <em>of every institution, </em>at the time of making every report required by this section, to compute the tax and <em>to pay the amount of said tax </em>to the State Treasurer.” (emphasis added)). For example, in the present case, Appellant acknowledges that it, and not its shareholder, paid the taxes in question. Furthermore, the calculation of the tax is based on the book value of the bank’s net assets (adjusted to deduct value attributable to United States obligations). <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 7701.1. Although Appellant is correct that, in <em>Dale National Bank, </em>the Commonwealth took the position that the bank shares tax was a tax on shareholders, it is significant that the Commonwealth did not prevail in this argument. Rather, the Court determined that “it is clear that the bank shares tax is imposed on capital owned and employed by petitioner in its banking operations[.]” <em>Dale National Bank, </em><a href="/pa/502/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="502 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1784530" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0170-01">502 Pa. at 177</a>, <a href="/pa/502/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="502 Pa. 170" data-case-ids="1784530" data-case-paths="/pa/502/0170-01">465 A.2d at 968</a>.

Although the tax was assessed in the names of the banks upon the book value of their net assets, it was nominally levied against the depositors of such banks. <em>See id. </em>at 145-46, <a href="/us/349/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="349 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="11334070" data-case-paths="/us/349/0143-01">75 S.Ct. at 609</a>.

As the Court continued its analysis, the consideration of whether the statute contained any mechanism for the bank to recover taxes paid out became the third, and most important, element of a three-pronged test to determine the true incidence of the tax. In particular, the Court considered (1) whether the state could collect the tax from the depositors should the bank fail to pay it; (2) whether the bank was relieved from liability as to the interests of depositors who had an account on the assessment date of the tax, but withdrew their deposits before the tax collection date; and (3) whether the bank, should it pay the tax, had any legal right to make itself whole from the depositors. As to the third factor, the Court noted that, “[i]n all the cases upholding state taxes against shareholders, without the exclusion of federal obligations owned by the corporation, an express or implied right- of reimbursement was presupposed.” <em><a href="/us/349/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="349 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="11334070" data-case-paths="/us/349/0143-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/349/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="349 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="11334070" data-case-paths="/us/349/0143-01">at 151-52</a>, <a href="/us/349/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="349 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="11334070" data-case-paths="/us/349/0143-01">75 S.Ct. at 612</a>.</p>

On the other hand, the statute does not affirmatively require banks to make that choice, as a bank can always comply with the law by paying from its general fund (as occurred in the present circumstances and as appears to be the common practice). Moreover-and of particular importance-once the bank pays the tax, as it must upon arrival of the March 15 deadline, if payment was rendered from its general fund there is no evident means reflected in the statute by which it may force the shareholders to provide indemnification. It is worth noting, in this respect, that the Legislature did, at one time, affirmatively require trust companies to collect tax monies from shareholders prior to remitting them to the Commonwealth: a 1933 amendment to the statute then in effect imposed a legal duty upon the institution “to collect the amount of said tax from its shareholders and pay the same to the State Treasurer, through the Department of Revenue.” Act of May 31, 1933, P.L. 1130. <em>See generally Commonwealth v.

This aspect of the trust company legislation may be what prompted Mr. Justice Cardozo to remark that the “tax is not laid upon the capital of the trust company.

The difficulty with this position is that it fails to identify any such means. Indeed, although Appellant states that, “unlike the Ohio statute in <em>Bowers, </em>the Pennsylvania Bank Shares Act expressly authorizes banks to recover the tax from their share <a id="p647" href="#p647" data-label="647" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*647</a>holders,” Brief for Appellant at 23, in support of this conclusion Appellant only references the portion of Section 701 that gives the bank the ability remit payment “from the amount of said tax collected from its shareholders.” This phrase, however, does not place an affirmative duty upon the bank to collect the tax from shareholders or upon the shareholders to pay the tax, nor does it provide banks with a mechanism to require shareholders to render such payment. Instead, it simply permits the tax liability to be satisfied from shareholder funds if, in fact, the bank has already collected those funds. In this respect the law differs from the Ohio statutes that the Supreme Court identified as reflecting the bank’s status as a tax-collecting agent; those enactments (which were not at issue in Bowers) expressly placed a lien upon the shares of stock or the deposits, as the case may be, to guarantee the bank’s right of indemnification. <em>See Bowers, </em><a href="/us/349/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="349 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="11334070" data-case-paths="/us/349/0143-01">349 U.S. at </a>149 n. 8, <a href="/us/349/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="349 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="11334070" data-case-paths="/us/349/0143-01">75 S.Ct. at </a>610 n. 8; <em>see also Corry v.

That the present statute does none of these things weighs heavily in favor of finding that its practical effect is to tax the bank’s net assets rather than the shareholders; in short, that the bank is not merely a collecting agent for its shareholders, but is, effectively, the taxpayer. <em>Cf.

Relatedly, Appellant proffers that, because the Legislature chose to avail itself of the <em>Van Allen </em>rule during the time that doctrine was substantively meaningful, the Department cannot now interpret the tax as one levied against the bank rather than the shareholders. This assertion has some resonance, as it appears that the General Assembly’s intent all along has been to blend the concepts of taxing financial institutions and taxing their shareholders, perhaps to maximize the opportunity to collect the intended tax upon the value of banks’ net values that can be fairly apportioned to Pennsylvania, in light of the former restriction on taxing national banks and continuing limitations arising from intergovernmental immunity, as well as potential issues that might arise from any attempts to enforce property tax obligations against foreign shareholders.</p>

Appellant contends that this text indicates that banks do not actually pay the tax, but only the "amount of" the tax which must necessarily have been collected from its shareholders. Because, as developed below, banks lack an effective enforcement mechanism to collect the tax from shareholders, we do not understand the phrase "amount of,” as used in this context, to reflect such a specific meaning.</p>

It is noteworthy that the effect of the 1933 amendment was to ... relieve banks from paying the shares tax, which was another burden that banks faced during the Great Depression....

This conclusion is reinforced by noting that the act's provision for measuring the tax base incorporates a moving six-year average of the bank’s taxable net assets. <em>See </em>72 P.S. § 7701.1(a). This shows that the basis of tax liability in any given year is conceptually distinct from the actual value of the shares owned by the stockholders at the time of assessment on January 1st of that year.</p>
