Briefly, Appellant’s conviction stems from the murder of seventy-four-year-old Carroll Fleming, which occurred on December 7, 1989,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> when Appellant and his co-defendant George Williams, age twenty, along with Alvin “Eyeball” Morgan, age fourteen, decided to rob Fleming at his home, apparently because Appellant had previously seen the victim carrying money. In preparation for the robbery, Appellant armed himself with a twenty-gauge shotgun, stating that he would shoot Fleming if required.</p>
    <p id="b128-5" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[296,1222,1153,964]]]'>While en route to Fleming’s home at 11:00 p.m. that evening, the group of three encountered Kevin Lewis. Williams convinced Lewis that they were going to collect a debt, and Lewis offered Williams his gun, an inoperative .25 automatic, which Lewis said could be used “as a threat.” Lewis then watched as the three proceeded to Fleming’s home, where he witnessed the unfolding murder from a short distance away, close enough to hear the conversation and see what transpired. When Appellant, Williams, and Morgan arrived at Fleming’s home, Morgan acted as a lookout while Appellant and Williams proceeded onto the porch. Appellant loaded his shotgun and knocked on the door. Receiving no immediate answer, Appellant kicked in the door. Fleming then appeared, and confronted the intruders on his porch. Williams pointed his handgun at Fleming, and repeatedly pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. Appellant, who by this time was behind Fleming, placed the muzzle of his gun against Fleming’s back and fired, killing him.</p>

Both Appellant and Williams gave statements to the police. In December 1991, Appellant and Williams were tried together on charges of murder, criminal conspiracy, robbery, possession of an instrument of a crime, and carrying firearms on public streets. The Commonwealth introduced the eyewitness testimony of Lewis and Morgan, both of whom testified to witnessing the murder.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[197,746,1151,787]]]'>The Commonwealth argued that from its inception, the plan hatched by Appellant and Williams was not just to rob the victim, but also to Mil him if necessary. Appellant’s counsel argued that regardless of who Mlled the victim, if the murder was committed in the course of a robbery, Appellant could only be convicted of second-degree murder, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(b), and if it was committed in the course of a struggle during the collection of a debt, Appellant could only be found guilty of third-degree murder, <em>see </em>18 Pa.C.S.A. § 2502(c). Defense counsel proceeded to cast doubt on the eyewitness testimony of Lewis and Morgan, both of whom testified that Appellant was the shooter. As evidence against Williams, the Commonwealth also introduced Williams’ redacted confession. The jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder and related offenses.</p>

The Commonwealth suggests that Appellant does not analyze whether his claims are waived or previously litigated, but argues as if he were raising claims of trial court error on direct appeal. It further argues that in the few instances that Appellant attacks prior counsel’s stewardship, he has not properly developed his claims. Specifically, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant’s boilerplate allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel address only the underlying merit prong of trial counsel ineffectiveness and ignore completely the reasonable basis and prejudice prongs. <em>See (Charles) Pierce, <a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">527 </a></em><a href="/pa/515/0153-02" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="527 A.2d 973" data-case-ids="1806092" data-case-paths="/pa/515/0153-02">A.2d at 975</a>.

      <em>Hughes </em>is instructive in resolving the claim presently before us. During the penalty phase, the Commonwealth stipulated to two mitigating circumstances. In addition, trial counsel presented the testimony of Appellant’s mother in support of a third, the catch-all mitigator. 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(8). Appellant’s mother pleaded for her son’s life and testified that she had to work long hours, leaving Appellant alone to care for his siblings. The record indicates that at the very least, the testimony of Appellant’s mother should have prompted counsel’s awareness, to some degree, of Appellant’s difficult childhood. <em>See Hughes, </em><a href="/pa/581/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="190" data-cite="865 A.2d 761" data-case-ids="1140661,9035570" data-case-paths="/pa/581/0274-01,/a2d/865/0761-01">865 A.2d at 814</a>.
