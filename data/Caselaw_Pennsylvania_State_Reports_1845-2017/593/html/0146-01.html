In 1989, due to the pronounced traffic congestion and growth estimates for the region, preliminary engineering studies commenced to determine the feasibility of the project. The Federal Highway Administration produced a draft environmental impact statement, noting that the bypass project was directed toward improving traffic congestion and driver safety on Route 202, and that agency’s formal approval of the project was granted on August 27, 1998. In order to obtain the necessary federal permits for the bypass project, PennDOT applied to DEP for the requisite Section 401 Certification. On January 20, 1999, DEP issued the Section 401 Certification, approving the bypass project with certain reservations that are not presently the subject of the Townships’ appeal. <em>See </em>Letter from James Newbold, DEP, to Vito A.

In cases involving both Section 307 and Section 4(b), the EHB explained that, to determine whether an award of attorneys’ fees is appropriate, courts have applied an analysis that has become known as the <em>Kwalwasser </em>test, according to which “(1) a final order must have been issued; (2) the applicant for the fees and expenses must be the prevailing party; (3) the applicant must have achieved some degree of success on the merits; and (4) the applicant must have made a substantial contribution to a full and final determination of the issues.” <em>Big B.

    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.4",207,[186,389,1161,1117]]]'>On the merits, the EHB determined that, although a final order had been issued, namely, the dismissal of the case as moot, none of the remaining criteria had been fulfilled. Specifically, the EHB reasoned that the Townships and Delaware Riverkeeper were not prevailing parties because no ruling on the merits had been made, notwithstanding the parties’ argument that they had obtained precisely the relief sought, <em>i.e., </em>removal of the Section 401 Certification. Similarly, the EHB determined that the Townships and Delaware Riverkeeper had not achieved any degree of success on the merits, as, again, no ruling on the merits had been issued. In addition, because there had been no full and final determination of any underlying issues, the EHB held that no substantial contribution to the resolution of those issues could have been made.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Thus, the EHB denied the motions for counsel fees under Section 307(b) of the Clean Streams Law.

Additionally, the Commonwealth Court determined that the Townships’ challenge was properly brought pursuant to the Clean Streams Law such that it fell within the ambit of the fee-shifting provision of Section 307. Although a Section 401 Certification is not, technically speaking, a permit, the court noted that it is a prerequisite and a precursor to the issuance of a permit. Because PennDOT was in the process of seeking a permit when the challenge to the Section 401 Certification arose, the Commonwealth Court held that its action was pursuant to the Clean Streams Law such that the Townships’ petitions for attorneys’ fees under Section 307 were appropriate.</p>

The court noted that no party disputed that a final order had been issued in this matter, as the Townships’ appeals had been dismissed as moot. Concerning the second part of the test, the Commonwealth Court applied the definition of “prevailing party” contained within the Costs Act, pursuant to which a party may be deemed to have prevailed when an agency withdraws from or otherwise terminates the matter. <em>See </em>71 P.S. § 2032 (defining “prevailing party” as “[a] party in whose favor an adjudication is rendered on the merits of the case or who prevails due to withdrawal or termination of charges by the Commonwealth Agency or who obtains a favorable settlement approved by the Commonwealth Agency initiating the case.”). Since the Townships achieved the goal they sought, namely, revocation of the Section 401 Certification, the court found that the voluntary <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>rescission of the Certification did not affect the Townships’ status as prevailing parties.</p>
    <p id="b209-5" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[194,408,1154,1482]]]'>Further, the Commonwealth Court determined that the Townships had achieved some success on the merits. Because neither DEP nor PennDOT proffered a reason for revocation of the Section 401 Certification, the court concluded that the litigation instituted by the Townships was the cause of Penn-DOT’s request for rescission. <em>See Solebury Twp., </em><a href="/a2d/863/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="863 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="9168645" data-case-paths="/a2d/863/0607-01">863 A.2d at 611</a> (“This Court cannot close its eyes to the inevitable conclusion that DEP and [PennJDOT sought to suddenly avoid a full argument on the merits for either no reason at all or because their legal position was untenable.”). The Commonwealth Court emphasized that the Section 401 Certification was rescinded shortly before argument and did not accept Penn-DOT’s suggestion that a change in governmental administration affected its decision not to proceed with the bypass project. Similarly, the Commonwealth Court held that the Townships had made substantial contributions to a full and final determination on the merits because the only contributions to the final determination were the challenges raised by the Townships. Observing that there was no evidence to show that the Section 401 Certification would have been rescinded absent the present litigation, the court held that the <em>Kwahuasser </em>test had been met and remanded the case for imposition of fees and costs. Additionally, the Commonwealth Court viewed the conduct of DEP and PennDOT in “suddenly and inexplicably” rescinding the Section 401 Certification as vexatious, especially in light of Appellants’ claim that an award of fees and costs would be inappropriate as no merits determination had occurred. <em>See <a href="/a2d/863/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="863 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="9168645" data-case-paths="/a2d/863/0607-01">id. </a></em><a href="/a2d/863/0607-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="863 A.2d 607" data-case-ids="9168645" data-case-paths="/a2d/863/0607-01">at 611</a>.</p>

As the Townships observe, the phrase “proceedings pursuant to this act,” 35 P.S. § 691.307(b), contained within the provision granting the EHB discretionary authority to award fees is broadly phrased and plainly encompasses litigation arising under the Clean Streams Law. Notably, the Clean Streams Law expressly grants DEP the authority to “[i]ssue such orders as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this act or the rules and regulations of the department.” 35 P.S. § 691.5(b)(7). Moreover, the regulation addressing the procedure for obtaining a water quality certification for purposes of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act was promulgated under the authority of, inter alia, the Clean Streams Law, <em>see </em>25 Pa.Code § 105.15(b), and this provision was the subject of the dispute between the Townships and Appellants. Significantly, PennDOT expressly admitted that the underlying litigation arose out of regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Streams Law. <em>See </em>Solebury Township’s Application for Attorney Fees and Costs Pursuant to the Pennsylvania Clean Streams Law, RR. at 2306a, ¶ 4 (“Specifically, [Solebury’s] challenge was brought under 25 Pa.Code [ch.] 105, which implements aspects of the Commonwealth’s 401 [water quality certification] program.”); Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation’s Response to Solebury Township’s Application for Attorney Fees and Costs Pursuant to the Clean Streams Law, RR. at 2372a, ¶ 4 (“Admitted. By way of further answer, Section 105.15(b) is the only provision of 25 Pa.Code Ch. 105 that addresses treatment of a 401 Water Quality Certification (WQC).”); <em>see also </em>Department of Transportation’s Response, RR. at 2373a, ¶ 7 (“In bringing this appeal, Appellant Solebury Township sought to have the Board to invalidate the process used by DEP and PennDOT to obtain the [water quality certification] for the project.”). In its brief to this Court, DEP also acknowledges <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>the integral role of its regulations in the Townships’ initial challenge to its actions. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant DEP at 13 n. 5 (citing 25 Pa.Code § 105.15(b) and stating, “These regulations were the focal point of the underlying litigation.”); <em>id. </em>at 25-26 (“The underlying contention in the Townships’ appeal of the 401 Certification was a challenge to the Integrated Review Process by which DEP reviews and issues (or denies) 401 Certifications ...

    <p id="b213-4" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[201,846,1152,1171]]]'>Further, the plain language of such regulations indicates that DEP regards the Section 401 Certification process as a subset of its consideration of state law permit applications. <em>See </em>25 Pa.Code § 105.15(b) (requiring any applicant seeking a water quality certification to submit an environmental assessment equivalent to that required for a state law permit). In addition, DEP has authority to place limitations or conditions upon Section 401 Certifications, <em>see </em><a href="/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201341" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="33 U.S.C. § 1341">33 U.S.C. § 1341</a>(d), which may directly implicate subjects within the scope of the Clean Streams Law, and, indeed, such has occurred in the present matter. <em>See </em>Letter from James Newbold, DEP, to Vito A. Genua, PennDOT (Jan. 20, 1999), RR. at 64a, ¶ 4 (conditioning the water quality certification upon the development of an Erosion and Sedimentation Pollution Control Plan in accordance with Chapter 102 of DEP’s regulations, which were promulgated pursuant to Sections 5 and 402 of the Clean Streams Law, <em>see </em>35 P.S. §§ 691.5, 691.402.). In light of the above, we conclude that, at least under the circumstances presented in this case, challenges to the Clean Streams Law aspects of the issuance of Section 401 Certifications are “proceedings pursuant to this act” for purposes of the fee-shifting provision of Section 307.</p>

The EHB’s conclusion the townships were not prevailing parties was in accordance with the majority opinion in <em>Buckhannon:</em>

    <blockquote id="b225-5" data-blocks='[["BL_225.4",225,[249,595,1108,412]]]'>Numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney’s fees and costs to the “prevailing party.” The question presented here is whether this term includes a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree, but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant’s conduct. We hold that it does not.</blockquote>

      <em>Buckhannon, </em>at 600, <a href="/us/532/0598-01" class="citation" data-index="133" data-cite="532 U.S. 598" data-case-ids="9301812" data-case-paths="/us/532/0598-01">121 S.Ct. 1835</a>. While the prevailing party prong under <em>Kwalwasser </em>is part of a court-made test as opposed to statutory text examined in <em>Buckhannon, </em>this appears to be a distinction without a difference, as the wording of the issue above mirrors the issue and circumstances here. While the Commonwealth Court noted the Costs Act defines “prevailing party” in a way that could lead to a favorable result for the townships, <em>see </em>71 P.S. § 2032, the action here was for attorney’s fees under § 307. The townships brought a separate action for attorney’s fees under the Costs Act.</p>
    <p id="b225-7" data-blocks='[["BL_225.6",225,[199,1618,1153,417]]]'>Ultimately, I cannot conclude the EHB erred when it applied the <em>Kwalwasser </em>criteria and implicitly followed an interpretation of the prevailing party prong in accordance with <em>Buckhannon. </em>I would reverse the Commonwealth Court’s decision and reinstate the EHB’s decision. This would leave the <em>Kivahvasser </em>test in place and the prevailing party prong would track <em>Buckhannon’s </em>holding. In all other respects, I join the majority.</p>
