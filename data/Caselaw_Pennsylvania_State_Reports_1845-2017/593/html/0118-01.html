    <p id="b172-10" data-blocks='[["BL_172.10",172,[301,1440,1153,910]]]'>The plaintiff, Beverly Wexler (“Appellant”), commenced the present action in 1999 against Paul J. Hecht, M.D., a medical doctor certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery, and a colleague who was later dismissed from the action. The complaint asserted a claim of medical malpractice occurring during the course of treatment for a bunion. Appellant alleged that she experienced post-operative complications following surgery performed by Dr. Hecht, including pain and swelling on the top of her foot. Further, she averred that she was unable to walk without crutches, although she was led to believe that this would not be the case. According to the complaint, Appellant ultimately underwent corrective surgery by a podiatrist to repair the continuing problems with her foot, but she continued to experience some residual pain, discomfort, and scarring. Dr. Hecht was alleged to have breached the applicable standard of medical care, and monetary damages were sought.</p>

There, in contrast to its prior ruling, the common pleas court rested its decision primarily upon the MCARE Act. In particular, the court couched its opinion in terms of four provisions of the enactment’s Section 512: 1) Section 512(a), precluding, <em>inter alia, </em>the presentation of an expert medical opinion in a medical professional liability action against a physician unless the witness “possesses sufficient education, training, knowledge and experience to provide credible, competent testimony,” 40 P.S. § 1303.512(a); 2) Section 512(b)(1), requiring an expert testifying on a medical matter to possess an unrestricted physician’s license to practice medicine, 40 P.S. § 1303.512(b)(1); 3) Section 512(c)(1), requiring an expert testifying as to a physician’s standard of care to be substantially familiar with the applicable standard for the specific care at issue as of the time of the alleged breach, 40 P.S. § 1303.512(c)(1); and 4) Section 512(c)(2), requiring an expert testifying as to a physician’s standard of care to practice in the same subspecialty as the defendant physician, or in a subspecialty that has a substantially similar <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>standard of care for the specific care at issue, 40 P.S. § 1303.512(c)(2).<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

    <p id="b175-4" data-blocks='[["BL_175.4",175,[186,418,1158,1482]]]'>Of particular relevance to our decision here, with regard to Section 512(b)(l)’s requirement of an unrestricted physician’s license to practice medicine, the common pleas court observed that Dr. Lazar never attended a medical school proper, but rather, received his degree from a Pennsylvania school of podiatric medicine, the curriculum of which is limited by statute. <em>See </em>63 P.S. § 42.7 (“The curriculum taught at schools of podiatric medicine and surgery shall be confined to subjects covered by the definition of podiatric medicine as contained in this act.”). The court further developed that the practice of podiatric medicine itself is limited to the diagnosis and treatment of the foot and anatomical structures of the leg governing the functions of the foot, including incidental administration and prescription of drugs. <em>See </em>63 P.S. § 42.2(a). Additionally, the court highlighted that podiatrists are licensed through a different regulatory body, the State Board of Podiatry, than medical doctors, who are licensed through the State Board of Medicine. <em>Compare </em>63 P.S. § 42.2(b), <em>with </em>63 P.S. § 422.2. Finally, the court noted that, in its central definition of “health care provider,” the MCARE Act separately delineates “physicians” and “podiatrists,” thus, from the court’s perspective, expressly differentiating between the two categories of professionals. Since the court concluded that Dr. Lazar was not a physician holding an unrestricted license to practice medicine, he was unqualified under Section 512(b)(1) to render an opinion concerning the applicable standard of care pertaining to a medical doctor, such as orthopedic surgeon Dr. Hecht.</p>

Further, the court observed that Section 512 contains no limitations suggesting that it should be applied only to causes of action arising after the effective date of the MCARE Act, as are attached to various other provisions of the enactment. <em>See <a href="/a2d/847/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="847 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="9255833" data-case-paths="/a2d/847/0095-01">id.</a> </em>at 101 (citing 40 P.S. § 1303.513, Historical and Statutory Note; 40 P.S. § 1303.516, Historical and Statutory Note).</p>

Indeed, since the General Assembly was well aware that this Court’s procedural rules already addressed and established a test for expert testimony, and assuming the General Assembly did not intend to raise a separation of powers question, the statute no doubt was considered to be one affecting substantive rights.

Section 512’s expert witness provision is found in Chapter 5 of the Act, which is entitled “Medical Professional Liability.” The additional legislative “Declaration of policy” attending this chapter notes that “[t]he General Assembly finds and declares that it is the purpose of this chapter to ensure a fair legal process and reasonable compensation for persons injured due to medical negligence in this Commonwealth.” <em><a href="/a2d/771/0721-01" class="citation" data-index="71" data-cite="771 A.2d 721" data-case-ids="11101728,124707" data-case-paths="/a2d/771/0721-01,/pa/565/0001-01">Id.</a> </em>§ 1303.502.

Section 512 operates to lower the cost of insurance by simply extinguishing <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>those causes of action where the plaintiff cannot meet the new, and heightened, standard for assessing expert witness qualifications.</p>

Section 512 is an integral part of the legislative response. To prove a case of medical malpractice, the plaintiff generally must produce expert testimony concerning the tort elements of duty, breach, and causation. <em>Quinby v. Plumsteadville Family Practice, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/589/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="72" data-cite="589 Pa. 183" data-case-ids="2573784" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0183-01">589 Pa. 183</a>, <a href="/pa/589/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="907 A.2d 1061" data-case-ids="2573784,8937482" data-case-paths="/pa/589/0183-01,/a2d/907/1061-01">907 A.2d 1061</a>, 1070-71 (2006) (citation omitted).

The issue for decision in the case <em>sub judice </em>is not whether the response represented by the MCARE Act properly balanced and resolved the difficult policy issues presented, but whether Section 512 has a substantive effect on existing medical malpractice litigation, such that application to existing cases would be unlawfully retroactive.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> In my view, Section 512 has such <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>an effect. As Judge Johnson noted below, retroactive application of Section 512 of the MCARE Act “effectively recasts the standard by which the plaintiffs must prove their entitlement to relief on a vested cause of action” and “effectively ‘raises the bar’ on the character of proof required of a plaintiff to vindicate a substantive right.” <em>See Wexler, </em><a href="/a2d/847/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="847 A.2d 95" data-case-ids="9255833" data-case-paths="/a2d/847/0095-01">847 A.2d at 109, 112</a> (Johnson, J., dissenting) (citations omitted). Therefore, like the dissent below, I would conclude that this portion of the legislation is not simply “procedural.” The MCARE Act rejects and displaces centuries of common law explicating the standard for assessing expert testimony, and adopts a new standard which has the effect of insulating medical professionals from certain causes of action. In my view, Section 512 has a retroactive effect which, in the absence of legislative authorization for same, cannot be permitted to operate unfairly in this case.</p>
