There, the claimant, who had worked in Pennsylvania’s coal mining industry from 1939 until he retired in 1981, learned he was totally disabled as a result of coal worker’s pneumoconiosis in 1985. <em><a href="/pa/575/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="834 A.2d 524" data-case-ids="630352,9080745" data-case-paths="/pa/575/0066-01,/a2d/834/0524-01">Id.</a> </em>The employer argued claimant was not entitled to workers’ compensation benefits as he suffered no wage loss, since he voluntarily retired and had no intention of returning to the workforce at the time he retired. <em>Id., </em>at 1268. This Court agreed with the employer, holding “[bjenellts under the Act will only be permitted where the disabling, work related injury or disease, results in a loss of earning power.” <em>Id., </em>at 1270. Likewise, <em>Vitelli </em>and <em>Dugan </em>reached similar conclusions. <em>See Vitelli, </em>at 926; <em>Dugan, </em>at 1041 (“Although a claimant may continue to suffer a work-related physical disability, if that physical disability does not occasion a loss of earnings, then payment of workmen’s compensation must be suspended. Claimant’s loss of earnings was caused by his voluntary retirement and withdrawal from the labor market. Claimant’s loss of earnings was not occasioned by his injury. Therefore, we conclude that workmen’s compensation benefits were properly suspended.”).</p>

Through § 601, as discussed above, the legislature specifically entitled a volunteer ambulance corps member to the irrebuttable presumption if injured while actively engaged as an EMT, without regard to earning status. By definition, these volunteers receive no wages for the valuable services they provide their communities. The legislature, taking into account the nature of the position, enacted § 601 to ensure that those partaking in this laudable and selfless profession are entitled, at a minimum, to the presumed Statewide average weekly wage. <em>See also New Bethlehem Volunteer Fire Company v.

In so concluding, this Judge finds that it is the intention of the Workers’ Compensation Act that members of a volunteer fire department or fire company, are deemed employees and that when they are injured in the line of duty, they are entitled to workers’ compensation benefits even if they are paid no wages for compensation by the municipality for said services;</p>
      <p id="b229-8" data-blocks='[["BL_229.4",229,[272,1473,1082,155]]]'>(c) This Judge finds that Section 601(b) of the Act supports the fact that [appellee] is entitled to the rebuttable presumption of wage loss, at least equal to the statewide average weekly wage [for] the purpose of computing compensation under sections 306 and 307;</p>

      <p id="b229-10" data-blocks='[["BL_229.6",229,[268,1712,1086,583]]]'>(e) This Judge does not find as persuasive [appellants'] argument that [appellee] had voluntarily retired from the workforce prior to her work injury, and therefore is not entitled to wage loss benefits. In so concluding, this Judge initially notes that she finds claimant’s employment status outside the volunteer fire company is irrelevant. However, this Judge also notes that [appellee] specifically testified that she did not consider herself removed from the workforce. This Judge finds her testimony credible, especially in light of the of the [sic] fact that Lappellee] continued to work in her position as an EMT for the Borough of Heidelberg even though she was entitled to Social Security retirement benefits. This Judge further notes that the receipt of Social Security retirement benefits does not totally prohibit [appellee] from working and therefore, does not find the receipt of the same as indicative of whether [appellee] has removed herself from the workforce.</p>
