Three weeks later, on April 26, 1999, Appellant was seen arguing with William Townes as Appellant stood on a street corner and Townes sat in his vehicle. Appellant drew a gun and shot Townes three times at close range, killing him. Thereafter, on May 6, 1999, Appellant, together with three compatriots, forcibly entered Frank Schoenberger’s home, robbed and beat him at gunpoint, and fled when the police arrived. An officer apprehended Appellant as he was running from the scene. The following day, Schoenberger discovered that the intruders had left a handgun inside his home. Police firearms experts identified the gun as the weapon used to kill Santos and Townes. All <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>three incidents took place within several blocks of Appellant’s place of residence in the Hunting Park section of Philadelphia.</p>
    <p id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[306,415,1150,360]]]'>Appellant was charged by three separate bills of information with, <em>inter alia, </em>two counts of criminal homicide (as to Santos and Townes) and two counts of robbery (as to Santos and Schoenberger). The Commonwealth pursued trial of all of the offenses on a consolidated basis, which the trial court permitted over Appellant’s objection. Appellant proceeded to trial before a jury, which took place from May 2-11, 2001.</p>
    <p id="b264-6" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[303,799,1153,896]]]'>In its case concerning the Santos killing, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of four eyewitnesses to the shooting, which occurred at approximately ten o’clock a.m. on a clear, sunny day. As these witnesses described the events, Santos pulled up and parked his car along the street to use an outdoor payphone, leaving his two-year-old son in the automobile nearby. As Santos returned to his vehicle, Appellant approached him and began speaking with him. From the gestures of the two individuals, it appeared that Appellant was demanding the thick gold chain Santos was wearing around his neck, but Santos was refusing to comply. As Santos turned toward his car, Appellant shot him once in the back, and then grabbed and pocketed the gold chain as Santos fell. Appellant then calmly walked away from the scene, leaving Santos mortally wounded on the pavement. According to the medical examiner, the single bullet pierced Santos’s spinal cord, lungs, and aorta, causing his death.</p>

Additionally, one of these witnesses, Ms. Diaz, testified that she recognized Appellant at the time of the shooting because she knew him and his family from the neighborhood. Several weeks after the incident, she positively identified Appellant as the shooter from a police photographic array. Another eyewitness, Ms. Carrasquillo, also selected Appellant from a photographic array a few weeks after the incident. She, too, testified that she recog<a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>nized Appellant at the time of the shooting because she had previously seen him in the neighborhood. Ms. Khabir, on the other hand, failed to select Appellant from a police lineup conducted on June 16, 1999, but she did make a positive identification in court the following day at the preliminary hearing, a fact that was relayed to the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Finally, the fourth eyewitness, Mr. Abdu, saw the shooting from approximately twelve feet away as he was in his car stopped at a traffic light. He then reported the matter to the police over his cell phone as he followed the shooter in his car while the latter walked away from the scene. Mr. Abdu continued his pursuit until the shooter entered a row house on the 3900 block of North Percy Street. Although he could not tell exactly which row house the assailant went into, the location he provided to the police was the approximate site of Appellant’s known place of residence. Mr. Abdu, who testified that he got a good look at the shooter’s face at close range, also stated that he had positively identified Appellant from a police photographic array and at the preliminary hearing.</p>

Immediately after the robbery, she gave Townes a description of the individual who had robbed her, and Townes appeared to know who this was. In court, she identified Appellant as the robber, and additionally stated that he was acting in concert with another individual who was identified as Shiem Gary. This account of the April 25th incident was corroborated by another person who also saw the robbery occur and was <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>friendly with Townes. A third witness, Ms. Redden, stated that she saw the killing of Townes the evening of April 26, 1999, as she was walking home from a store. She indicated that she was near where Townes and Appellant were arguing as Townes sat in the driver’s seat of his car and Appellant stood on the street next to the vehicle; she stated that another individual was with Appellant but was not participating actively in the argument. According to Ms. Redden, Townes began to pull away, but then stopped his car at Appellant’s request. Appellant then fired several shots at Townes from close range, which resulted in the car suddenly lurching forward at high speed, hitting a number of parked cars and then flipping onto its side. She stated that, immediately after the shooting, Appellant and his companion walked past her as she sat on a porch, and Appellant stated, “That’s what the f— he get.” Ms. Redden identified Appellant as the shooter from a police photographic array several weeks later, and identified him in court as well. Additionally, a young woman testified that, at the time of the incident, she was sitting in the front passenger seat of Townes’s car when a black male who was arguing with Townes repeatedly shot Townes at close enough range to give her gunpowder burns on her legs and face.</p>

This evidence tended to show that one of Appellant’s accomplices in the Schoenberger incident was Shiem Gary, the individual who had assisted Appellant in his April 25th street robbery of one of Townes’s employees. Mr. Schoenberger identified Appellant in court as the leader of the group of armed intruders, and stated that he had also identified Appellant as such at the preliminary hearing one week after the crime. Additionally, at the time the police <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>arrived on the scene of the robbery, Appellant was wearing a coat matching the description given by witnesses to the Santos killing of the “puffy” jacket that the shooter in that matter had been wearing.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> When the police apprehended him, they recovered from one of his pants pockets a pager that had been taken from Mr. Schoenberger’s house.

Over Appellant’s objection, the trial court excluded testimony from Detective Wynn regarding any other purported eyewitness to the murders who may have participated in the police lineup.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Appellant’s mother also testified for the defense, stating that she had left Appellant at home at approximately 8:30 a.m. on the day of the Santos murder, and that when she returned later that day, he was still at home. Because she could not recall what time <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>she returned, however, the defense conceded that her testimony did not provide an alibi but, instead, went to the weight of the identification evidence. Similarly, Appellant’s sister testified that she called Appellant’s residence at approximately 9:00 on the morning of the Santos shooting, and spoke to Appellant briefly. Again, however, this was insufficient to constitute an alibi, as the killing occurred at least an hour later a short distance from Appellant’s house.</p>

With regard to Townes’s killing, the jury found two aggravators— that Appellant had been convicted of another offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(10), and that he had been convicted of another murder, <em>see </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(11) — and no mitigators.

The sum and substance of Appellant’s contention, then, is a challenge to the credibility of three of the four witnesses who identified him at trial. The Commonwealth correctly notes that the testimony of all of these witnesses was “vigorously challenged on these points” during cross-examination, but that the jury ultimately believed their identification of Appellant as the person who shot Santos.

Appellant acknowledges that the decision of whether to allow a joint trial is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, but submits that, here, the danger of unfair prejudice was simply too great to guarantee a fair trial. He asserts, as well, that the Commonwealth based its motion for consolidation on the theory that the ballistics evidence showed that the bullets recovered from the two decedents were fired from the gun left at the Schoenberger home, and that this, in turn, helped to identify Appellant as the shooter in both cases; Appellant posits that the Commonwealth could have accomplished this same objective by trying the two murder cases separately and introducing the circumstances of the robbery (including recovery of the gun) in each homicide trial, thereby eliminating the possibility that the jurors would be inflamed by evidence of one murder to convict him of the other murder.

While it is of course true that under Pa.R.Crim.P. 582(A)(1) it is permissible to try separate cases together, it is equally true that the rule makes this permissible only if the evidence “is capable of separation by the jury so that there is no danger of confusion.” Pa.R.Crim.P. 582(A)(1)(a). In addition, if consolidating unrelated cases would cause undue prejudice to the defendant, consolidation is not warranted. We have spoken cogently on the prejudice that could result:</p>
    <blockquote id="AVn" data-blocks='[["BL_289.4",289,[257,712,1108,583]]]'>The argument against joinder or consolidation is that where a defendant is tried at one trial for several offenses, several kinds of prejudice may occur: (1) The defendant may be confounded in presenting defenses, as where his defense to one charge is inconsistent with his defenses to the others; (2) the jury may use the evidence of one of the offenses to infer a criminal disposition and on the basis of that inference, convict the defendant of the other offenses; and (3) the jury may cumulate the evidence of the various offenses to find guilt when, if the evidence of each offense had been considered separately, it would not so find.</blockquote>

      <em>Commonwealth v.

Our Court has been careful to ensure that evidence of other crimes is not available for the jury to use as evidence that a defendant has a criminal disposition. For example, in <em>Commonwealth v. Spruill, </em>we stated:</p>
    <blockquote id="b289-5" data-blocks='[["BL_289.6",289,[253,1653,1109,367]]]'>Evidence of prior criminal activity [ ] is probably only equaled by a confession in its prejudicial impact upon a jury. Thus, fairness dictates that courts should be ever vigilant to prevent the introduction of this type of evidence under the guise that it is being offered to serve some purpose other than to demonstrate the defendant’s propensity to commit the charged crime.</blockquote>

For example, the Superior Court noted in <em>Commonwealth v. Harris:</em>
    </p>
    <blockquote id="b290-4" data-blocks='[["BL_290.4",290,[330,739,1113,640]]]'>The law is well settled in Pennsylvania that the prosecution may not introduce evidence of defendant’s prior criminal conduct as substantive evidence of his guilt of the present charge. The purpose of this rule is “to prevent the conviction of an accused for one crime by the use of evidence that he has committed other unrelated crimes, and to preclude the inference that because he has committed other crimes he was more liable to commit the crime for which he is being tried. The presumed effect of such evidence is to predispose the minds of the jurors to believe the accused guilty and thus effectively to strip him of the presumption of innocence.”</blockquote>

Even if the evidence in one of the murder cases was admissible in the other, the majority fails to weigh whether the jury might consider its finding of Appellant’s guilt in one of the murders probative of his guilt in the other. This is the mischief that holding separate trials is designed to prevent. The gun recovered from the Schoenberger burglary tied the appellant to both murders, as the evidence established that the bullets from that gun were the same as the bullets recovered from the bodies of the two decedents. Thus, it would not have been error to consolidate the Schoenberger burglary case with one of the murder cases, as evidence <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>admissible in one would be admissible in the other, and as the transactions and facts of the cases were so distinct that there would be little danger of jury confusion.</p>
    <p id="b291-4" data-blocks='[["BL_291.4",291,[204,472,1156,1296]]]'>However, in my opinion, the two unrelated homicides should have been tried separately. In each one, the evidence in the Schoenberger burglary case regarding the gun would be admissible to establish the perpetrator’s identity. However, the evidence from the Santos murder would not have been admissible in the prosecution of the Townes murder, and <em>vice versa. </em>The majority equates these cases to <em>Commonwealth v. Reid, </em><a href="/pa/533/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="110" data-cite="533 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1837557" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0508-01">533 Pa. 508</a>, <a href="/pa/533/0508-01" class="citation" data-index="111" data-cite="533 Pa. 508" data-case-ids="1837557" data-case-paths="/pa/533/0508-01">626 A.2d 118</a> (1993), in which we found that evidence of a second murder was admissible to establish Reid’s identity as the shooter in a first murder. In <em>Reid, </em>there were no eyewitnesses to the first murder, and the evidence of the shooter’s identity was thus circumstantial. Under such circumstances, evidence that Reid was the shooter in the second murder, and the same gun was used in both shootings, tended to establish Reid’s identity as the shooter in the first murder. In this case, however, aside from the use of the same gun, there was no evidence in the Santos case that would have been relevant in the Townes murder case, except that a black man wearing a puffy black jacket had a tendency to commit murder, which is of course impermissible. Allowing the two murder trials to be consolidated would likely have the effect of leading the jury to believe that Appellant must have murdered Townes since the evidence was clear that he murdered Santos.</p>
    <p id="b291-5" data-blocks='[["BL_291.5",291,[202,1819,1154,205]]]'>Finally, I must point out that judicial economy is never a valid basis for consolidation of unrelated offenses, and only exacerbates the prejudice of presenting evidence of more than one offense to the jury. As we noted in <em>Morris:</em>
    </p>
    <blockquote id="b291-6" data-blocks='[["BL_291.6",291,[244,2058,1112,262]],["BL_292.1",292,[344,275,1113,581]]]'>[T]he conservation of judicial resources and the efficient administration of justice, while estimable goals, does <em>[sic </em>] not justify the exposure of an accused to such a higher probability of prejudice. “When offenses are initially joined on the ground that they are of the same or similar charac<a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>ter, and evidence of one offense would not be admissible at a separate trial for the other, the saving of time effected by a joint trial is minimal.” More importantly, the saving of judicial time can never be given preference over the integrity of the factfinding process. When it is concluded that the evidence of the one crime would not be admissible in the separate trial for the other, we are in effect saying that the evidence is irrelevant and prejudicial in the second trial. To allow irrelevant and prejudicial evidence to influence a verdict in the name of judicial economy is abhorrent to our sense of justice.</blockquote>

It is hard to imagine a more prejudicial effect on a defendant than being convicted for a murder on the basis of compelling evidence that the defendant committed a <em>different </em>murder.
