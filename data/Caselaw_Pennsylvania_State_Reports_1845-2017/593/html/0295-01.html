The court initially addressed the Commonwealth’s claim that Jones waived the issue by failing to object to the inclusion of the charge in the bill of information and by pleading guilty. Acknowledging that a defendant waives any claim to quash a criminal information by failing to include the argument in a pre-trial motion, the court concluded that Jones could not have waived his claim because it sounded in subject matter jurisdiction, an issue not susceptible to waiver. <em>See Commonwealth v. Little, </em><a href="/pa/455/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="455 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="582176" data-case-paths="/pa/455/0163-01">455 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20270" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="314 A.2d 270">314 A.2d 270</a>, 272 (1974) (“An objection to lack of subject-matter jurisdiction can never be waived; it may be raised at any stage in the proceedings by the parties or by a court in its own motion.”). The Superior Court observed that subject matter jurisdiction exists when the court is competent to hear the case and the defendant has been provided with a formal and specific notice of the crimes charged. The court noted that a court’s competency hinges upon a demonstration that a criminal act occurred within the territorial jurisdiction of the court.</p>

In order for the case to advance past mere presentment to the magistrate, the Commonwealth must present a <em>prima facie </em>case. <em>See Liciaga v.

The Superior Court recognized that, despite the dismissal, the Commonwealth could have reinstituted the charges by refiling the complaint with the magistrate pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 544(A), but noted that, in this case, it did not do so. The court found that the dismissal of the conspiracy charge and the failure to reinstitute it prevented the Commonwealth from prosecuting further. The court then equated the absence of a formal reinstitution of the charge with a divestiture of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Superior Court concluded the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept Jones’s plea to criminal conspiracy absent a formal reinstitution of the charge.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Ct. Slip Diss. Op. at 1 (quoting <em>Little, </em><a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20270" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="314 A.2d 270">314 A.2d at 272</a>). The dissent concluded that the criminal conspiracy charge was within the “general class” of cases within the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas. Characterizing the inclusion of the dismissed charge as a procedural defect, the dissent concluded, “the failure to comply with a <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>Rule of Criminal Procedure, while perhaps giving rise to a claim for some relief on the part of the defendant, does not affect the subject matter jurisdiction of the court of common pleas.” <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>

The dissent analogized the defendant’s plea to a jury verdict, noting that the plea was based on Jones’s full knowledge of the charges included in the information, regardless of the lack of compliance with the rules of procedure for the reinstitution of a dismissed charge.

The Commonwealth contrasts the failure to object to the inclusion of the conspiracy charge with Jones’s actions regarding the other charges, noting that his counsel successfully obtained a favorable sentence in exchange for his plea and a concession from the Commonwealth, which entered an order <em>nolle prosequi </em>on the charge of knowingly and intentionally possessing a controlled substance. It additionally emphasizes that questions of sufficiency or regularity of proceedings “may not be considered for the first time after the defendant has performed the grave and solemn act of admitting in open court that he committed the acts charged in the indictment, and that plea has been accepted in accordance with the rules and decisions regarding guilty pleas.” Brief for Commonwealth at 15 (quoting <em>Little, </em><a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20270" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="314 A.2d 270">314 A.2d at 273</a> (internal quotation marks omitted)).

The Commonwealth also emphasizes that Jones failed to file a motion to withdraw his plea within ten days or to request sentence reconsideration, instead waiting to challenge the court’s jurisdiction for the first time on appeal.</p>

The Commonwealth acknowledges the two requirements for subject matter jurisdiction as it relates to criminal defendants: the competency of the court to hear the case, and the provision of formal notice to the defendant of the crimes charged in compliance with the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9, of the Pennsylvania Constitution. <em>See Little, </em><a href="/citations/?q=314%20A.2d%20270" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="314 A.2d 270">314 A.2d at 272-73</a>.</p>

The Commonwealth next acknowledges the necessity of formal and specific notice to the defendant of the crimes charged. It emphasizes, however, that this Court held in <em>Commonwealth v. Khorey </em>that, so long as the defendant received formal notice, even the lack of a proper criminal indictment would not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to accept <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>a plea. <em>See Commonwealth v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the Commonwealth provided Jones with formal and specific accusation of the crimes charged. Thus, despite the procedural flaw, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept the plea.</p>

Moreover, there are portions of the criminal process in which subject matter jurisdiction is premised upon other factors. The one year time limitation imposed for petitions under the Post Conviction Relief Act, for example, is considered to be a bar to the court’s exercise of jurisdiction. <em>See Commonwealth v.

However, it is significant that a defendant, upon pleading guilty, admits to facts sufficient to support his plea, <em>see Commonwealth, Department of Transportation v.

In addition, the information filed with the common pleas court in the present matter clearly indicated that Jones was being charged with conspiracy as well as drug related offenses. <em>See </em>RR. at 19a (conspiracy); RR. at 17a (possession with intent to deliver); RR. at 21a (possession of a controlled substance). <em>Cf Commonwealth v. Alston, </em><a href="/pa/539/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="539 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="474143" data-case-paths="/pa/539/0202-01">539 Pa. 202</a>, 210, <a href="/a2d/651/1092-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="651 A.2d 1092" data-case-ids="12257595,474143" data-case-paths="/a2d/651/1092-01,/pa/539/0202-01">651 A.2d 1092</a>, 1095 (1994) (“[A]n Information is sufficient if it sets forth the elements of the offense intended to be charged with sufficient detail that the defendant is apprised of what he must be prepared to meet.”). Thus, I concur with the majority’s disposition of this matter, as I agree that a prima facie case is not a component of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>
