That amendment was permitted on the written submissions and after argument, with the common pleas court indicating in its order that Buyers’ delay was not caused by a lack of due diligence. After a non-jury trial, the court entered a verdict in favor of Buyers, awarding them compensatory damages in the amount of $26,000, representing diminution in the value of the property on account of material non-disclosure and/or concealment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The court, however, declined to award rescission, restitution, treble damages, or attorneys’ fees.</p>

Rockey, </em>No. 2000-5705, <em>slip op. </em>(C.P. Washington Jun. 30, 2004). Within the period in which Sellers owned the subject property located on Stafford Drive in Peters Township, the property experienced several instances of substantial water infiltration. The court developed that the most major events occurred as a result of a connection between basement and outside stairwell drains to the local municipal storm sewer system. During a period of intense use in 1995, the storm water system became overloaded as a result of a broken water main, and water backed up through the floor drainage system into the interior and outside-stairwell drains of the Stafford Drive property. Subsequently, Sellers installed a back-up flow preventer in the interior floor drain, and, in 1997, they also installed a sump pump in the sidewall of the stairwell, which was most immediately responsive to more modest infiltration that occasionally <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>resulted from blockage of the stairwell drain from leaves or other debris. Despite the preventative efforts, however, in June 1998, the municipal system again overloaded, and a substantial accumulation of water collected in the outside stairwell of the Stafford Drive property. To relieve pressure, the water was eventually discharged into the basement, reaching a maximum level of up to eighteen inches from the floor and ruining carpeting and wall coverings in a finished portion of the basement. Sellers immediately (and personally) repaired the damage, including the replacement of a lower section of wallboard, painting, and carpeting.</p>

At the same time, Sellers completed a disclosure statement furnished by Ms. Corace, on which they disclosed generally that the property had experienced water infiltration, which they described variously as “storm drain backup” and “storm drain plugged causing water backup.” Sellers characterized the 1997 installation of the external sump pump as a remedy, despite the more recent flooding incident. Further, the common pleas court found that Sellers asked Ms. Corace whether these disclosures were appropriate, and her reply was to indicate that “the less [she] knew, the better.” According to the court, Buyers received the disclosure statement the next month and assumed that the installation of the sump pump in 1997 had cured the water issue, and neither Sellers nor Ms. Corace advised them of the extensive flooding only a few months before. After a home inspection, at which the court found that Sellers provided only general information regarding water seepage and the remedial efforts taken in 1997 to address that condition,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> a sale was consummated in December 1998 at a purchase price of $214,000. The <a id="p543" href="#p543" data-label="543" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*543</a>court indicated that, shortly after the purchase, Buyers learned of the June 1998 flooding incident.

In terms of damages, the common pleas court recognized that, upon discovery of actionable fraud, under prevailing Pennsylvania law an innocent party to an affected agreement may either affirm the contract and seek damages at law or repudiate the contract and commence an action for rescission. <em>See, e.g., Wedgewood Diner, Inc. v. Good, </em><a href="/pa-super/368/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="368 Pa.

The court also observed that, in order for a party to have a right to rescission, “it is his duty to act promptly, and, if he elects to rescind, to notify the other party within a reasonable time so that the rescission may be accomplished at a time when the parties may still be restored as nearly as possible, to their original positions.” <em>Schwartz, </em>2000-5705, <em>slip op. </em>at 15 (quoting <em>Galati v.

Applying these principles, the court held that Buyers were not entitled to rescind the sales contract, because they had effectively affirmed the contract by living in the house for six years and by not promptly seeking to rescind once they became aware of the undisclosed water damage, when the parties might still have been restored to their original positions. The common pleas court stressed <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>that Buyers were aware of the June 1998 incident almost two years prior to the filing of their original complaint; however, in that complaint they did not seek rescission but only monetary damages.</p>

In the panel’s view, the filing of such complaint did not bar an amendment to pursue rescission and restitution after Buyers obtained additional information via discovery and requested leave to amend, which was granted by the common pleas court upon a finding that they had proceeded with due diligence. <em>See id. </em>at 15. Thus, the panel determined that the appropriate course was to remand to the common pleas court to reconsider its decision concerning the availability of rescission and restitution. <em>See id. </em>at 16 (“[T]he decision of whether to grant rescission and restitution, or merely restitution, is a matter that must be addressed by the trial court in the first instance.”).</p>

I agree. I write separately to emphasize that the inquiries as to whether a plaintiff has elected to pursue a certain remedy and whether, in light of all of the evidence, the plaintiff is indeed entitled to that remedy are distinct. On this note, I believe that the concept of election of remedies is only obliquely implicated in this, case and that in resolving this issue, the Court need look only to whether the trial court erred in finding that Appellee purchasers were not entitled to restitution.</p>

      <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>The Superior Court’s opinion makes it clear that it viewed the trial court’s denial of rescission and restitution as indicative of that court’s position that by filing the initial complaint for damages, the plaintiffs had conclusively elected that remedy, thus barring any consideration of whether rescission and restitution were warranted. Holding that “the trial court’s opinion demonstrates confusion over the law governing election of remedies and the timing of when an election must be made,” the Superior Court reversed and remanded for the trial court to again consider the propriety of equitable remedies. While it may be accurate that the mere filing of a complaint does not necessarily serve to conclusively elect a remedy, this issue is beyond the purview of this appeal. The trial court did not, as the Superior Court believed, base its decision on election of remedies grounds.</p>

      <em>Schwartz v. Rockey, </em>No. 2000-5705, slip op. (C.P. Washington June 30, 2004). While the court peripherally mentioned the doctrine of election of remedies in its legal conclusions, it based its decision not to permit rescission not on grounds of election, but rather on the requirement that a party seeking rescission has a duty to act promptly so that the parties may be returned as closely as possible to their original positions. This is a substantive requirement of a claim for rescission. <em>Fichera v. Gording, </em><a href="/pa/424/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="69" data-cite="424 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1904961" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0404-01">424 Pa. 404</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20642" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="227 A.2d 642">227 A.2d 642</a>, 643-44 (1967). I agree with the majority, therefore, that the Superior Court failed to take into account the full rationale of the trial court’s denial of rescission and that its reversal and remand were misplaced. I would make abundantly clear, then, that this Court’s decision is premised entirely upon the trial court’s decision as to the merits of the claim for rescission and not upon grounds of election of remedies.</p>

It purports to rest its decision on the plain language of the statute, but also considers that “it seems reasonably likely that the Legislature wished to enhance the impact of monetary awards under the statute to deter wrongful trade practices affecting the public at large.” Majority Slip Opinion at 20. As a matter of statutory construction, these statements are contradictory. The Statutory Construction Act mandates that “[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.” 1 Pa.C.S. § 1921(b).

While the issue is not before the Court, I am puzzled by the trial court's decision to award damages as an alternative to rescission and restitution. I believe that this does violate the doctrine of election of remedies, as well as law of the case. When the original complaint was amended to seek a claim in equity, that was the remedy elected by the plaintiffs. Further, the decision of the trial court to permit amendment <a id="p560" href="#p560" data-label="560" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*560</a>was law of the case.
