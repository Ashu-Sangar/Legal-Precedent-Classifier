Toy and her husband owned a small business and their own home. Through her employment, Toy held a tax-sheltered annuity and a life insurance policy. Toy wanted to begin preparing for retirement. Toy’s husband, who was acquainted with Martini, arranged for a meeting between Martini and Toy so that they could discuss a product that Metropolitan Life offered. At their meeting, Martini presented Toy with information regarding the Metropolitan Life 50/50 Savings Plan. Martini explained that the plan was a savings vehicle and that if Toy were to make monthly payments of $50, the plan would generate a fund of approximately $100,000 when she reached sixty-five. Martini also informed Toy that life insurance went along with and was part of the plan. When Toy indicated to Martini that she was interested in the plan, he had her complete and execute an “Application for Life Insurance,” which asked a series of questions concerning lifestyle and health.</p>

The trial court ruled that bad faith under § 8371 was not, as Metropolitan Life argued, limited to allegations that an insurer refused to cover claims, but could be founded on allegations that the insurer did not satisfy a duty that the law imposed upon it in its relationship with its insured. <em><a href="/pa-d-c4th/35/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="35 Pa.

The trial court reasoned that § 8371 is written broadly; that the only restriction reflected in its language is that it does not reach conduct that is otherwise permissible to insurers under Pennsylvania law; that the court should not read a remedial statute narrowly; and that the Legislature was creating a comprehensive remedy for fraudulent conduct and violations of all UIPA provisions in enacting § 8371, and not merely responding to this Court’s refusal in <em>D Ambrosio v.

As to Toy’s bad faith claim, Metropolitan Life’s <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>starting point was the trial court’s ruling in <em>Ihnat. </em>Metropolitan Life asserted that inasmuch as justifiable reliance is an element of common law fraud, it necessarily followed from the trial court’s construction of § 8371 that justifiable reliance was likewise an element of a bad faith claim. Metropolitan Life then repeated the argument that Defendants made in support of their entitlement to summary judgment on any of Toy’s claims that were based on Martini’s alleged misrepresentations: that Toy could not prove the element of justifiable reliance. In addition, Metropolitan Life set forth the argument it had made in <em>Ihnat </em>that the bad faith statute is limited to a claim that an insurer failed to provide an insured with the benefits or coverage that his insurance policy provided. As to Toy’s claims brought under the Consumer Protection Law, Defendants contended that here too, Toy’s inability to establish justifiable reliance entitled them to summary judgment since under this Court’s decision in <em>Weinberg v.

The trial court also agreed with Defendants that Toy was unable to prove that she justifiably relied on Martini’s alleged misrepresentations about the Policy, and thus, were entitled to summary judgment on all of the causes of action in the Complaint that required such a showing.

Defendants are correct that Toy’s Consumer Protection Law claims, like those made in <em>Yocca, </em>concern a fully integrated contract,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_22" id="ref_footnote_1_22">22</a> and that Toy’s allegations of justifiable reliance, like those made in <em>Yocca, </em>concern misrepresentations that do not appear as terms or conditions in the parties’ written agreement. Defendants have overlooked, however, that the Superi- or Court found that Toy’s fraud claims concerning the savings plan features that Defendants represented would be included <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>in the parties’ agreement amount to a claim for fraud in the execution of a contract,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_23" id="ref_footnote_1_23">23</a> and that as such, demand a far different analysis than that applied to the fraud claim alleged by the plaintiffs in <em>Yocca </em>concerning the representations in the SBL Brochure that induced them into entering into the SBL Agreement. As we explained in <em>Yocca, </em>while the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule potentially applies in two scenarios — fraud in the inducement, where a party alleges that he was induced into entering the agreement through the other’s fraud, and fraud in the execution, where a party alleges that he was mistaken as to the terms and the actual contents of the agreement he executed due to the other’s fraud — this Court has determined that in Pennsylvania, only fraud in the execution, which is alleged in this case, but was not alleged in <em>Yocca, </em>is excepted from the parol evidence rule’s operation. <em>See Bardwell, </em><a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="79" data-cite="100 A.2d 102">100 A.2d at 104</a>.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_24" id="ref_footnote_1_24">24</a>

It means that when fraud in the execution is alleged, representations made prior to contract formation are not considered superseded and disclaimed by a fully integrated written agreement, as they are when fraud in the inducement is asserted. Thus, our analysis of the element of justifiable reliance in <em>Yocca </em>— that due to the parol evidence rule’s operation, a party cannot be said to have justifiably relied on prior representations that he has superseded and disclaimed through a fully integrated written contract — does not apply in a fraud in the execution of a contract context, where the prior representations are not deemed superseded or disclaimed under the parol evidence rale, but instead, are viewed as wrongfully absent from the writing that was to memorialize the parties’ contractual undertaking. <em>See Yocca, </em><a href="/pa/578/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="80" data-cite="854 A.2d 425" data-case-ids="1329385,9214675" data-case-paths="/pa/578/0479-01,/a2d/854/0425-01">854 A.2d at 439</a>.

Defendants’ position is tantamount to imposing upon such a party a duty to investigate the falsity of the misrepresentations upon which he brings suit, and as such, overrides the law that we have developed over the years for the determination of the element of justifiable reliance in this area. Some time ago, we determined that a party who engages in intentional fraud should be made to answer to the party he defrauded, even if the latter was less than diligent in protecting himself in the conduct of his affairs. <em>See Emery v. Third National Bank of Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.%20881" class="citation" data-index="81" data-cite="171 A. 881">171 A. 881</a>, 882 (1934) (quotation omitted) (“ ‘The law is not designed to protect the vigilant alone, although it rather <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>favors them, but is intended as a protection to even the foolishly credulous, as against the machinations of the designedly wicked.’ ”). In this regard, we consulted the Restatement of Torts, determined that its approach to the element of justifiable reliance coincided with our own, and as we had done before, embraced the rules it set forth. That is, we have relied on the principle that the recipient of an allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation is under no duty to investigate its falsity in order to justifiably rely, but that he is not justified in relying upon the truth of an allegedly fraudulent misrepresentation if he knows it to be false or if its falsity is obvious. <em>Merritz v.

These matters although related, are nonetheless, separate and distinct. We write to the former. The concurrence appears to write to the latter. In every one of the cases the concurrence cites on page 4 to describe our view of § 8371 as unduly restrictive and inconsistent with the Superior Court's perspective, the insured brought an action under § 8371, alleging that his insurer failed to satisfy his first party claim in the proper manner. The question before the court in each of those cases was not whether the insured alleged a cognizable claim under the bad faith statute. Rather, it was whether the evidence offered at trial by the insured as to the insurer's behavior was sufficient to prove the bad faith claim and/or admissible in a § 8371 action. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Condio v.

Food Fair Stores, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/437/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="211" data-cite="437 Pa. 117" data-case-ids="1927795" data-case-paths="/pa/437/0117-01">437 Pa. 117</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=262%20A.2d%20851" class="citation" data-index="212" data-cite="262 A.2d 851">262 A.2d 851</a>, 853 (1970), is not furthered by a refusal to recognize the fraud in the execution exception, as it is in refusing to recognize an exception for fraud in the inducement. This is so because in the fraud in the execution context, the allegation is that the written agreement <em>is not </em>the expression of the parties' true and complete contractual intent inasmuch as terms that were agreed to by the parties were omitted from that writing through fraud. Second, if a party were allowed to introduce representations made prior to contract formation that contradicted or varied the terms of his written contract by merely alleging that the representations were fraudulent, the fraud exception could swallow the rule. <em>See Bardwell, </em><a href="/citations/?q=100%20A.2d%20102" class="citation" data-index="213" data-cite="100 A.2d 102">100 A.2d at 104</a>.

In my view, in terms of the potential for opening the exception to ready abuse, there is a very modest difference between the making of representations concerning the subject matter of a contract, and general misrepresentations concerning actual terms of the written contract. Moreover, where written contractual terms are clear and apparent, the ability to review the document protects equally against either form of misrepresentation. In my view, in maintaining an exception to the parol evidence rule for “fraud in the omission,” the Court should require something beyond mere obvious misrepresentations concerning the terms of an integrated contract.</p>

Notably, as well, the policy was subject to a ten-day "free-look” condition, providing Ms. Toy with a right to examine it, return it for any reason during that period, and secure a full refund.</p>
