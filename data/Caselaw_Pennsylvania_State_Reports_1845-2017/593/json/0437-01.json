        "text": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nStudent Doe, a Lower Merion School District resident, suffers from mild spastic diplegia and a weakness in visual motor skills. Doe was set to enter kindergarten for the 2004-05 school year when, upon his parents\u2019 request, the District evaluated him to determine whether he was entitled to services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400-1487, or \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794.\nThe District determined Doe was ineligible for special education services under IDEA, but was eligible to receive occupational therapy under \u00a7 504. The District offered Doe\u2019s parents a \u00a7 504 Service Agreement that would have provided Doe one 30-minute session of direct occupational therapy per week along with ongoing teacher consultations and related accommodations; Doe\u2019s parents rejected the proposal.\nFor the 2004-05 school year, Doe\u2019s parents enrolled Doe in a private school with a full-day kindergarten program, something the District did not offer. Doe\u2019s parents also enrolled him in the District\u2019s school so he could receive the therapy the District offered, though he was attending classes at the private school. Since he was not attending classes at its school, the District refused to provide the \u00a7 504 therapy, contending \u00a7 504 and IDEA have fundamentally different purposes; IDEA concerns providing public educational services, whereas \u00a7 504 deals only with access to those services. The District stipulated Doe \u201cis an individual with a disability pursuant to [\u00a7 ] 504.... [Doe] would be eligible to receive occupational therapy services through the [\u00a7 ] 504 Service Agreement ... if he were a student attending school in the District.\u201d Administrative Hearing Record, Joint Exhibit, at Tab 4, J-l. However, it argued the therapy Doe qualified for is an accommodation to afford him equal access to the District\u2019s school, and not an independent service.\nA Department of Education Hearing Officer reviewed the matter at Doe\u2019s parents\u2019 request and issued an order requiring the District to provide Doe with the services outlined in the \u00a7 504 Service Agreement so long as he is dually enrolled and receives those services at the District\u2019s school. The Hearing Officer relied on Veschi v. Northwestern Lehigh School District, 772 A.2d 469 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001). Veschi was a case with nearly identical facts, though the matter was resolved under IDEA, not \u00a7 504. Veschi held a private school student can enroll dually in private and public school so as to receive IDEA-related services at the public school. Id., at 475.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court reviewed the applicable federal and state statutory and regulatory law, and determined the Hearing Officer did not err. Lower Merion School District v. Doe, 878 A.2d 925, 927-31 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005). The court referenced the federal implementing regulations, which require a public school district provide a \u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d to each qualified student in its jurisdiction, id., at 927-28 (citing 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a)), noting \u201cappropriate education\u201d constitutes a \u201cprovision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons.\u201d Id., at 928 (citing 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(1)). The court pointed out the regulations which implement \u00a7 504 in Pennsylvania require only that a child be enrolled in the district from which he seeks services; they do not require the student attend classes at a district school in order to receive those services. Id., at 929 (citing 22 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-15.11).\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth Court determined \u00a7 504\u2019s purpose would best be met by requiring the District provide \u00a7 504 services as part of a free, appropriate education for Doe. Id., at 930-31. The court also found it proper to consider case law interpreting IDEA when interpreting \u00a7 504. Id., at 931-32. Thus, the court stated the Hearing Officer did not err in extending the principles of Veschi to \u00a7 504. Id., at 932-33.\nAs Judge Smith-Ribner noted in dissent, 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 14.41(e), the relevant provision at issue in Veschi, was repealed in 2001; new regulations were adopted following amendments to IDEA and revisions to IDEA\u2019S federal regulations. Doe, at 933-34 (Smith-Ribner, J., dissenting). Judge Smith-Ribner found the occupational therapy Doe\u2019s parents requested is different because they sought access to the \u00a7 504 services, not the District\u2019s regular courses or programs. Id., at 935 (Smith-Ribner, J., dissenting). Judge Smith-Ribner cited a Pennsylvania Department of Education pamphlet that states, \u201c[i]f the protected handicapped student is attending only the nonpublic school, the school district of residence bears no responsibility to provide aids, services or accommodations within the nonpublic school.\u201d Id., at 936 (Pennsylvania Department of Education, Basic Education Circular \u201cServices to Nonpublic School Students\u201d 22 Pa.Code Chapter 15 (Issued: July 1, 2001)). Judge Smith-Ribner also asserted the instant case is one of first impression, and the majority\u2019s failure to note any amount of deference to the Department of Education is an error; ultimately, she would have reversed the Hearing Officer\u2019s decision and upheld the District\u2019s decision to deny \u00a7 504 services. Id.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to determine whether a school district is required to provide services pursuant to \u00a7 504 to an otherwise eligible student who is dually enrolled in public and private school. Since this is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary. In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006).\nThe District argues Doe could not be properly enrolled in the District\u2019s school because he did not seek to take school-courses, but only desired \u00a7 504 services. The District also argues the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision could lead to absurd results where public schools would have to make major alterations to schedules and facilities to accommodate a private school student\u2019s needs at the public school. Doe counters that \u00a7 504 should be broadly interpreted, and that we cannot interpret Pennsylvania regulations implementing \u00a7 504 to contravene \u00a7 504 itself. Doe argues he is properly dually enrolled in private school and the District\u2019s school.\nSection 504, in relevant part, provides:\nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this title,, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance----\n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794. Doe, at 927 n. 5. Section 504 has been described as remedial legislation, Kedra v. Nazareth Hospital, 868 F.Supp. 733, 740 (E.D.Pa.1994), and remedial legislation is to be interpreted broadly to effectuate its purpose. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 504, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999).\n[T]he term \u201cprogram or activity\u201d means all of the operations of ... a local educational agency ... or other school system ... or other private organization ... which is principally engaged in the business of providing education.... 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(b)(2)(B) and (b)(3)(A)(ii); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(k)(2)(ii) and (k)(3)(i)(B) (emphasis added).\nRelevant federal regulations state \u201c[a] recipient [of federal financial assistance] that operates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the 'recipient\u2019s jurisdiction ...34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a) (emphasis added). They define an \u201cappropriate education\u201d as \u201cthe provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that (i) are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met....\u201d Id., \u00a7 104.33(b)(1) (emphasis added).\nThe regulations go so far as to place an affirmative duty upon schools to identify qualified recipients:\nA recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall annually:\n(a) Undertake to identify and locate every qualified handicapped person residing in the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction who is not receiving a public education; and\n(b) Take appropriate steps to notify handicapped persons and their parents or guardians of the recipient\u2019s duty under this subpart.\nId., \u00a7 104.32 (emphasis added).\nChapter 15 of the Pennsylvania Code implements \u00a7 504, and provides in part:\n(b) ... The law and its regulations require public educational agencies to ensure that these students have equal opportunity to participate in the school program and extracurricular activities to the maximum extent appropriate to the ability of the protected handicapped student in question. School districts are required to provide these students with the aids, services and accommodations that are designed to meet the educational needs of protected handicapped students as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped students are met.\n22 Pa.Code \u00a7 15.1(b).\nThe Code then specifies to whom a public school district must provide services:\nA school district shall provide each protected handicapped student enrolled in the district, without cost to the student or family, those related aids, services or accommodations which are needed to afford the student equal opportunity to participate in and obtain the benefits of the school program and extracurricular activities without discrimination and to the maximum extent appropriate to the student\u2019s abilities.\nId., \u00a7 15.3 (emphasis added). As the Commonwealth Court pointed out, this provision requires a student to be enrolled in the district to gain \u00a7 504 benefits; it does not specify a student must attend classes at the district\u2019s public school. Doe, at 929.\nThe Code also defines how it should be interpreted in relation to \u00a7 504:\n(c) It is not the purpose of this chapter to preempt, create, supplant, expand or restrict the rights or liabilities of protected handicapped students or school entities beyond what is contemplated by Section 504, the Section 504 regulations at 34 CFR Part 104 or another law.\n22 Pa.Code \u00a7 15.11(c). The implementing regulations cannot be interpreted to contravene \u00a7 504\u2019s enabling legislation. Lisa H. v. State Board of Education, 67 Pa.Cmwlth. 350, 447 A.2d 669, 673 n. 6 (1982), aff'd, 502 Pa. 613, 467 A.2d 1127 (1983); Barr v. Department of Public Welfare, 62 Pa.Cmwlth. 211, 435 A.2d 678, 680 (1981).\nAs noted, \u00a7 504\u2019s federal implementing regulations require a public school to provide a free appropriate public education, including special services and accommodations, to a \u201cqualified handicapped person who is in the recipient\u2019s jurisdiction .... \u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a). It is undisputed Doe\u2019s condition would qualify him as handicapped for \u00a7 504 purposes. See Administrative Hearing Record, Joint Exhibit, at Tab 4, J-l. P^urther, \u00a7 104.33(a) does not require that to be an eligible student, Doe attend classes in any school; the obligation is for special services and accommodations. The federal implementing regulations requirement that recipient schools seek out eligible \u00a7 504 beneficiaries in the jurisdiction, further showing \u00a7 504\u2019s mandates apply to all potentially eligible students based on their residency, not their school attendance; as long as Doe is in the District\u2019s jurisdiction, the District has to provide what \u00a7 504 mandates. The required broad reading of these regulatory requirements in unison leads to the conclusion that \u00a7 504 requires the District provide Doe with the therapy services described above.\nChapter 15 of the Pennsylvania Code, before it says anything else, states it is meant to comply with \u00a7 504 and its implementing regulations. 22 Pa.Code \u00a7 15.1(a). Chapter 15 is not designed to provide provisions whereby an eligible student under \u00a7 504 can be found ineligible under Chapter 15. To the contrary, Chapter 15, specifically through \u00a7 15.3, is designed to further \u00a7 504\u2019s goals by attempting to get eligible students to participate in the school program and extracurricular activities \u201cto the maximum extent appropriate,\u201d 22 Pa. Code \u00a7 15.3, and to provide them with the accommodations they need so their education equates with the education of nonhandicapped students.\nWe cannot interpret Chapter 15 in a way that would inhibit the application of \u00a7 504\u2019s mandates. Allowing Chapter 15 to preempt, supplant, or restrict a student\u2019s rights under \u00a7 504 would lead to the untenable conclusion that our regulations were cutting across their very purpose. If we concluded Doe was entitled to services under \u00a7 504, but was improperly enrolled under \u00a7 15.3 by relying on an interpretation of dual enrollment in \u00a7 5-502, we would be inappropriately interpreting Chapter 15 in a way that restricts Doe\u2019s \u00a7 504 entitlement. Chapter 15 recognizes the full panoply of school responsibilities and is meant to implement \u00a7 504, not to cut off the entitlements due to an otherwise eligible handicapped student.\nThe District concedes Doe is disabled, and that he would be entitled to the proffered \u00a7 504 services were he attending classes in its school. Further, the District did not believe him eligible for IDEA services. Thus, the proffered \u00a7 504 services could not be merely a means of accessing IDEA services, for he was not entitled to them \u2014 this would be a Catch-22 situation, offering him a means of accessing something to which he was not entitled. Hence the \u00a7 504 services were either a means of accessing non-IDE A services (i.e., \u201cregular\u201d educational services), or they were an educational service unto themselves.\nIf an educational service unto themselves, the District has an obligation to provide them as part of \u201ca free appropriate public education.\u201d 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(a). There is little problem finding they are part of an appropriate education for Doe \u2014 indeed, the District offered them. However, if (as the District argues) the \u00a7 504 services are merely a \u201cmeans of access,\u201d one must ask \u201caccess to what?\u201d Is it access to an appropriate education, or merely access to the education as provided in the District\u2019s school? We find the answer must be broader than merely specific classes offered by the District\u2014 this purposefully remedial legislation must involve access to the \u201cappropriate education\u201d which the District has an obligation to provide.\nThe obligation can be seen as twofold \u2014 providing the education, and providing the means of accessing it. Nowhere do these legislative acts or implementing regulations set forth that the education be at the District\u2019s school in order for the obligation of facilitating access to an appropriate education to attach. Section 104.33(c)(4) provides that the cost of voluntary enrollment in a private school is the expense of the parents enrolling \u2014 the District need not pay that, and indeed is relieved of the cost it would otherwise expend on Doe\u2019s behalf for such classes. But clearly, \u00a7 104.33(c)(4) does not limit or truncate the District\u2019s obligation \u2014 it simply excuses it from paying for that part of its obligation which is received elsewhere. Further, if \u00a7 504 services were, as the District argues, merely a means of access to educational services, they would be outside this section\u2019s ambit.\nSince Doe is entitled to \u00a7 504 benefits and dually enrolled in private school and the District\u2019s school, we hold the District is required to provide appropriate \u00a7 504 entitlements to him without cost.\nOrder affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nFormer Justice NEWMAN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice CASTILLE, SAYLOR and BAER and Justice BALDWIN join the opinion.\n. A student may dually enroll in a private and public school:\n[T]he board of school directors in any school district may establish, equip, furnish, and maintain the following additional schools or departments ... namely: ... Schools for physically and mentally handicapped.... No pupil shall be refused admission to the courses in these additional schools or departments, by reason of the fact that his elementary or academic education is being or has been received in a school other than a public school.\n24 P.S. \u00a7 5-502.\n. Interpreting \u00a7 5-502 to trump \u00a7 504 would also lead to a Supremacy Clause problem.\nThe Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution prohibits states from enacting laws that are contrary to the laws of our federal government: \"This Constitution and the Laws of the United States ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2. It is through this clause that the United States Congress may preempt state law.\nKrentz v. Consolidated Rail Corporation, 589 Pa. 576, 910 A.2d 20, 31-32 (2006).\n. We recognize the District\u2019s concern that our decision could cause public schools to expend resources to comply with \u00a7 504. Doe, at 929 n. 10. However, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that \u2018\u2018[w]hile this may be a valid argument in another case, such matters simply are not at issue in the present matter.\u201d Id.",
