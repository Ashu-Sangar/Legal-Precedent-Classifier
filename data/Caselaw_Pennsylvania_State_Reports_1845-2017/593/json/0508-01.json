        "text": "Justice SAYLOR,\ndissenting.\nThe Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board seeks preliminary and permanent relief, effectively to negate an ordinance enacted by the Philadelphia City Council placing a referendum question on the local ballot in the May 15, 2007, primary election.\nThe Board asks this Court to exercise its exclusive, original jurisdiction over the matter under 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1904. Section 1904, however, pertains to challenges concerning the constitutionality of the Gaming Control Act. See 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1904 (\u201cThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any challenge to or render a declaratory judgment concerning the constitutionality of this part.\u201d). The Board is not seeking here to raise a challenge to its own enabling legislation; rather, it is challenging the validity of a Philadelphia ordinance. Therefore, the effort to invoke this Court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction under Section 1904 is not well taken.\nAs of last year, this Court has also been charged with \u201cexclusive appellate jurisdiction to consider appeals of a final order, determination or decision of a political subdivision or local instrumentality involving zoning ... of a licensed [gaming] facility.\u201d 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1506. On its plain terms, however, the statute merely shifts jurisdiction over appeals, ie., matters that otherwise would have been within the appellate jurisdiction of the intermediate appellate or common pleas courts, to this Court. Its provisions do not purport to fundamentally alter the character of appellate jurisdiction.\nIn the present case, the challenged government action is a legislative act, namely, the promulgation of a City ordinance, which is simply not a matter that implicates any court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Rather, challenges to legislative decisions of this sort, where cognizable, proceed in the judicial system by way of original jurisdiction actions, such as a declaratory judgment proceeding. See, e.g., Devlin v. City of Philadelphia, 580 Pa. 564, 862 A.2d 1234 (2004).\nI recognize that, given the substantial public importance of the Board\u2019s challenge, the present circumstances may implicate an exercise of this Court\u2019s King\u2019s Bench powers. See generally In re Avellino, 547 Pa. 385, 690 A.2d 1138, 1140-41 (1997). However, the Board has not framed its request in such terms, and to the extent that this Court will invoke this extraordinary form of jurisdiction sua sponte, I believe that this should be accomplished as a matter of record prior to the award of a preliminary injunction that will likely have the effect of a final one with respect to the challenged ordinance, since the ordinance is couched solely in terms of the May 2007 election.\nIn summary, I do not believe that the Court should enter a preliminary injunction on the existing record in this case.\n. I recognize that, had the General Assembly foreseen the present circumstances, it might very well have drafted Section 1506 more broadly. Nevertheless, our approach to statutory construction is to apply the plain terms of an enactment where they are clear, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. McClintic, 589 Pa. 465, 472-73, 909 A.2d 1241, 1245 (2006), as I believe they are here. Moreover, investing a State Supreme Court, which generally functions in an appellate capacity, with exclusive responsibility for original jurisdiction matters is a reordering of great consequence to both the Court (in terms of resources and procedures) and litigants, which I believe should occur only upon very clear and deliberate specification.",
