        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Jones,\nThis appeal is from a judgment of sentence for alleged contempt growing out of the fifth trial of Aaron Turner for murder which is the subject of our decision in Commonwealth v. Turner at p. 239 ante. Most, if not all, of the substantive and procedural facts material to the disposition of the instant appeal are set forth in the Turner opinion in detail. Some will necessarily have to be repeated here for a proper understanding of the issue.\nAt the Turner trial, the Commonwealth called Clarence Lofton, the present appellant, as a witness for the prosecution. Lofton had also been indicted for the same felonious homicide but had entered a plea of guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. lie had not testified against Turner at the latter\u2019s first trial on September 26, 1946, nor against Jasper Johnson, the third indictee for the same killing, at his trial on January 27, 1847. Turner and Johnson, both of whom pleaded not guilty, were convicted of murder in the first degree with penalty fixed at death. Their convictions were based on confessions which the Supreme Court of the United States later invalidated upon a review of Turner\u2019s trial: see 338 U.S. 62; also, Johnson v. Pennsylvania, 340 U.S. 881. After Johnson\u2019s conviction, Lofton, on January 31, 1947, withdrew his plea of not guilty and entered a plea of guilty and received a sentence of life imprisonment on the recommendation of the district attorney.\nThereafter, at the subsequent retrials of Turner and Johnson, the Commonwealth, with the confessions eliminated as evidence, called Lofton, who was then serving his life sentence in the Eastern Pennsylvania State Penitentiary, as a witness for the prosecution. In addition to having Lofton thus testify at Turner\u2019s second and third trials, he was also produced as a witness for the Commonwealth at Turner\u2019s fourth trial, but on that occasion he flatly refused to testify against the defendant. Subsequent to the fourth Turner trial but before the court en banc had passed upon the defendant\u2019s motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial (Turner having again been convicted), Lofton made a formal affidavit at the penitentiary in Avhich he recanted his prior testimony against the defendant and disclaimed any knoAvledge that Turner had had any part in the felonious homicide for which he had been indicted, tried and convicted. This affidavit, which had been notarized before a prison official, was filed with the trial court in support of the defendant\u2019s after-verdict motions then pending. A new trial was granted but solely because of improper remarks by the district attorney, within the hearing of the jury, relative to the defendant\u2019s three prior convictions.\nAt the ensuing fifth trial, the district attorney again called Lofton as a witness for the Commonwealth, although he knew full well of Lofton\u2019s steadfast refusal to testify against Turner at the fourth trial, his formal recantation affidavit, which had been filed with the court, and his persistently announced refusal to testify against Turner. And, as had been conclusively forecast, Lofton refused to testify to the effect which the district attorney strove to get him to do, and the trial judge twice held him in contempt for his refusal. This happened at the morning session of Turner\u2019s trial on February 19, 195The next day the trial terminated with the jury\u2019s verdict finding Turner guilty of murder in the first degree with penalty fixed at life imprisonment. It was not until August 22, 1956, however, that the trial judge called Lofton before him for sentence for the adjudged contempts. Lofton being unrepresented by counsel, the court requested Edwin P. Rome, Esq. (then present for the sentencing of his client, Turner) to represent Lofton in respect of his being sentenced for contempt. Rome promptly assumed the responsibility. The court thereupon imposed sentence on Lofton for the contempts Avhereof he had been adjudged guilty two and one-half years before. In support of its action, the court, approximately three months later, filed an opinion which, to say the least, it is difficult to correlate with what had actually transpired at the Turner trial Avhile Lofton was on the witness stand. Lofton\u2019s appointed counsel duly appealed to this court tlie judgment of sentence for contempt which the court below had imposed.\nIn holding Lofton for contempt at the trial, the court gave as its sole reason, for so doing, the witness\u2019s refusal to answer questions. The record makes this plain beyond quibble. Thus, at pp. 151a-152a of the Turner record on appeal, the following appears, Lofton being the witness:\n\u201cBy The Court : . . .\n\u201cQ. Then you refuse to answer any questions asked you by the District Attorney?\n\u201cA. Yes, sir, I do.\n\u201cThe Court : We hold you in contempt of Court.\n\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.\n\u201cThe Court: And the record of the answers and failure to answer is a record upon which we hold this witness in contempt.\u201d\nThe second adjudication appears at pp. 177a-178a of the record (Lofton still being the witness), as follows:\n\u201cThe Court: Well, we have already held you in contempt.\n\u201cThe Witness: Yes, sir.\n\u201cThe Court: For failure to answer the questions that were directed to you. We direct you again to answer the questions.\n\u201cThe Witness : Yes, sir. Your Honor, I will admit I was held in contempt before.\n\u201cMr. Rome [defendant Turner\u2019s counsel]: Sir, on behalf of the defense I would object to Your Honor\u2019s holding this witness in contempt in this fashion at this time.\n\u201cThe Court: Well, that objection is overruled.\n\u201cMr. Rome: Exception, sir.\n\u201cThe Court: We hold the witness in contempt of Court for failure to answer the questions.\u201d\nStrange as it may seem, the reasons so unmistakably stated contemporaneously by the court for its action had fallen into utter desuetude by the time (two and one-half years after the trial) that the judge imposed sentence upon Lofton for contempt. At that time the court, in express abandonment of its earlier ground for its action in holding Lofton for contempt, said,\u2014 \u201cIt was not the fact that the witness desired not to testify. That had nothing to do with it. It was the manner in which he showed contempt for counsel and for the Court, and for the Institution of the Court.\u201d This belatedly expressed idea, the court enlarged upon in its written opinion filed some three months after the sentence for contempt had been imposed and subsequent to Lofton\u2019s appeal to this court from the judgment of sentence. The opinion contains a diatribe against Lofton for his conduct at trial for which there is not the slightest basis in the record. Thus, it states that Lofton\u2019s manner was \u201cspiteful\u201d and \u201cvicious\u201d; that he \u201cinsulted the Court and disrupted the orderly process of trial\u201d; and that the \u201ccontempt consisted not only of the refusal to testify or answer questions, but of loud and vicious domination of the trial of the most reprehensible nature, sufficient to shock [the court] most completely.\u201d\nIn his brief, counsel states that Lofton was far from being loud and abusive and cites in support thereof record indications of compellingly persuasive force. Near the outset of Lofton\u2019s testimony the district attorney complained, \u201cI can hardly hear you\u201d; a little later on, \u201cI didn\u2019t get your answer, Mr. Lofton\u201d; and, again, \u201cI can\u2019t hear you.\u201d Two of these occasions the court obviously observed, for it repeated the witness\u2019s answers for the district attorney\u2019s hearing. Not once during the entire time Lofton was on the witness stand did the judge direct him to lower his voice or cease any loud or boisterous conduct. On tbe contrary, tbe record shows the witness to have been respectful. He uniformly addressed the judge as \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cYour Honor\u201d or referred to him as \u201cthe Court\u201d and, with like respect, he addressed the district attorney as \u201cSir\u201d or \u201cMr. Panati\u201d. And, it may also be noted in this connection, that the court did not at any time admonish Lofton to change his manner or attitude toward the court.\nIf Lofton\u2019s conduct at the Turner trial was as bad as the opinion for the court now tries to make it appear to have been, it merited condign punishment promptly imposed, i.e., immediately after the jury in the Turner case had returned its verdict and had been discharged. For the court to wait two and one-half years to punish for a contempt committed in its presence which it terms \u201cflagrant\u201d and of such \u201creprehensible nature\u201d as to shock the court \u201cmost completely\u201d serves neither to vindicate the majesty of the law nor to uphold the dignity of the court.\nIt is of course quite understandable why the court, after an overly-long continued opportunity for reflection, apparently came to the conclusion that it could not hold Lofton for contempt for having refused to answer the questions which the district attorney was propounding. What the district attorney was endeavoring to do was to get Lofton to admit having testified against Turner at former trials to an effect which the witness had since completely repudiated on oath as having been false. All that Lofton refused to testify to was what he then deposed had been untrue. Actually, he was quite willing to, and did, testify under the district attorney\u2019s own examination in keeping with his affidavit that he had no knowledge of any participation by Turner in the homicide. At one point in Lofton\u2019s testimony the court appeared to have understood the witness\u2019s situation when it said, \u2014 \u201cThis man has been called as a witness. He says that this paper is the truth and he says he wants to tell the truth. In other words, he wants to testify to those facts. Isn\u2019t it fair to him to permit him now to read this to him and ask him if these statements are true and give him a chance to testify to it before we rule on the other question? I feel this way. Here is a witness who is on the witness stand. He has refused to answer [the district attorney\u2019s] questions, true, and I have held him in contempt, and that is a matter that I will have to take care of later.\u201d How, possibly, could a witness be held in contempt for refusing to testify to what he insists is untrue and is willing to testify to what he affirms to be the truth.\nLofton, although unlettered and at the time uncounseled, handled himself remarkably well on the witness stand in resisting the district attorney\u2019s persistent efforts to get him to admit that he had testified against Turner in former trials in accordance with the testimony the district attorney was reading to him. The district attorney harrassed and even humiliated him in an ostensible effort to secure from him testimony which the district attorney well knew the witness had repudiated as being false and which, as he had repeatedly confirmed to the district attorney, he would not again testify to but that he would testify to the truth. The trial judge did nothing to protect the witness in his right to insist upon telling what to him was then nothing but the truth. The court not only tolerated but virtually condoned the district attorney\u2019s insistent goading of the witness in aid of the prosecution\u2019s devious stratagem for getting before the jury the witness\u2019s repudiated testimony of former trials in order to induce a jury\u2019s verdict of the defendant\u2019s guilt. If any of the witness\u2019s refusals to testify, in the way the district attorney was trying to force him to do, were \u201cloudly shouted\u201d, it was done out of the exasperation to which the court\u2019s erroneous and compliant rulings and the district attorney\u2019s loaded questions had driven the witness.\nWhile it is entirely unnecessary to our decision in this matter, we take occasion to point out that the judgment of contempt is invalid for a still further reason. The court, on its own showing, was moved, in part, to sentence Lofton for contempt for what it had professedly heard from the judge who had presided at Turner\u2019s fourth trial concerning Lofton\u2019s refusal to testify at that time. Thus, what had allegedly happened at a former trial, presided over by another judge, was availed of by the court as basis in part for sentencing Lofton for contempt at the latest trial. The rule has long been established in this State that one court cannot punish for a contempt committed before another court. In 1791, our own court, upon being moved to issue an attachment for a contempt in disobeying the process of an inferior court (the whole record being removed here by certiorari), said that \u201c. . . they knew of no case where one Court punished a contempt offered to another Court, and would not carry the system of punishing by attachments further than they were clearly warranted by practice and adjudged cases\u201d: Lessee of John Penn, Jr. v. Michael Messinger, 1 Yeates 2. In the famous Passmore Williamson\u2019s Case, 26 Pa. 9, 18 (1855), Mr. Justice Jeremiah S. Black, speaking for this court, said, \u2014 \u201cAll courts have this power [to punish for contempt], and must necessarily have it; otherwise they could not protect themselves from insult, or enforce obedience to their process. Without it, they would be utterly powerless. The authority to deal with an offender of this class belongs exclusively to the court in which the of-fence is committed; and no other court, not even the highest, can interfere with its exercise, either by writ of error, mandamus, or hateas corpus.\u201d And, in Commonwealth v. Shecter, 250 Pa. 282, 289-290, 95 A. 468, it was recognized on the authority of the above-cited cases that \u201cIt is settled law that each court is the exclusive judge of contempts committed against its process.\u201d\nWe have not failed to note the lower court\u2019s trite observation that \u201cIt is most difficult to peruse a \u2018cold record\u2019 and feel the tension and spirit of a trial.\u201d The record before us appears to have been exceptionally well reported and is most revealing. Nor are we impressed with the court\u2019s further statement that \u201cIn the instant record no careful reading can begin to produce the spiteful, vicious manner in which Clarence Lofton insulted the court and disrupted the orderly process of trial.\u201d When a matter is brought to this court on appeal, it necessarily comes before us on a printed record, and the litigants are entitled to have their rights adjudicated on the basis of what the record shows and not upon what the court below may intimate or suggest is not shown. If the record in this case is in any way deficient, it is the fault of the trial judge for not having bad it truly and fully reflect all material and important trial matters. Of course, tbe trial judge may have found tbe record \u201ccold\u201d when be came to write bis opinion supporting tbe judgment of contempt two years and nine months after the alleged courtroom occurrences, especially when tbe witness\u2019s refusal to answer tbe district attorney\u2019s questions was no longer to be tbe basis of the contempt adjudication. We find the record sufficiently accurate and informative to disclose that tbe witness was unjustly held for contempt.\nJudgment reversed and sentence for contempt vacated.\nThe reference in the quotation from Passmore Williamson\u2019s Case, supra, to the fact that a writ of error aid not lie to a judgment for contempt was because there was no appeal at common law from such a judgment. Although there is no statutory provision for an appeal from a judgment of contempt, appellate review has been afforded by this court: see Messmore\u2019s Bstate, 293 Pa. 63, 71-73, 141 A. 724. However, appeals of contempts committed in the criminal courts have been entertained by the Superior Court (see, e.g., Levine Appeal, 170 Pa. Superior Ct. 579, 88 A. 104) by analogy to that court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction of criminal matters. By the same token, the instant judgment of contempt having arisen out of a trial for murder, which was reviewable by us, jurisdiction of the appeal from the judgment of contempt was properly in this court.",
