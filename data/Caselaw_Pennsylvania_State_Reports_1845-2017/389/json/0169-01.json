        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThese three appeals 'arise from a controversy between a debtor-school district, a creditor-fair association and an assignee of the creditor-fair association concerning the payment of an award made in an eminent domain proceeding.\nIn 1955, Butler Pair and Agriculture Association (hereinafter called Association) was the owner of a leasehold which would expire in 1970. 'This leasehold covered 67 acres Of ground in Butler County upon which the Association, and its predecessor, had operated a county fair for approximately fifty years, and upon which Avere located approximately forty buildings used for fair purposes.\nIn August, 1955, the School District of the City of Butler (hereinafter called District), on behalf of itself and eight other districts comprising a Jointure, condemned the land covered by the Association\u2019s leasehold and entered into an agreement with the land owners for the purchase of their fee simple interest subject to the leasehold.\nOn November 7, 1955, a Board of Viewers 'awarded the Association $160,000 as the damages sustained by reason of the District\u2019s condemnation of its leasehold interest and this award was confirmed \u00a1by the Count on April 3, 1956. After a stipulation that the Association was to have the right to remove all its buildings from the land, the aAvard was reduced to a final judgment in favor of the Association and against the District Avhich AVas entered on April 5,1956.\nOn April 30, 1956, the District certified to the Association that provision had been made in its 1956-57 school budget for -payment of the amount of the judgment. For the purpose of enabling the Association to purchase other ground for its purposes, on April 30, 1956, one Philip Chambers loaned $60,000 to the Association and received as collateral the Association\u2019s judgment against the District. The Association on the same day assigned \u201call its right, title and interest in the principal and interest\u201d in the judgment to Chambers. Chambers entered a judgment against the Association on May 14, 1956. The District was notified, in writing, on May 17, 1956 by the Association of its assignment of the judgment against the District to -Chambers. It was not until January 28, 1957 that the assignment from the Association to -Chambers was entered formally of record.\nUndoubtedly, upon the receipt of its tax money, the District would have paid the Association\u2019s judgment and the Chambers loan would have been repaid and his judgment satisfied were it not for -the fact that on June 13, 1956, an equity suit -was instituted by certain stockholders of the Association\u2019s predecessor against the Association, certain of its officers and directors and the District. This equity suit set in motion the chain of events which led to the 'institution of three different law-suits which have now resulted in -the present appeals.\nThe Butler Fair and Exposition (hereinafter called Exposition), a Pennsylvania business corporation, was incorporated in 1925, for the purpose of conducting a county fair. In October, 1945, the Exposition owned certain assets including cash, a leasehold on the fair grounds and certain buildings thereon. . On October 22, 1945, the Exposition\u2019s directors voted to recommend to the Exposition\u2019s stockholders that the corporation be dissolved and that a sale of its 'assets he made to one Richards,-, a director -and Exposition\u2019s largest stock\u25a0holder, subject to the stockholders\u2019 approval. By a majority vote the stockholders voted to dissolve the corporation and sale of the Exposition\u2019s assets was made. Eventually the assets passed from the Exposition to the Present Association.\nAlleging that this sale \u2014 which took place eleven years previously \u2014 was fraudulent in that the fact of renewal of the leasehold was concealed, three former Exposition stockholders, representing fourteen shares, on June 13, 1956, filed a complaint in equity against the Association, the District and ten individuals who were former 'directors and officers of Exposition, seeking\u2014 insofar as relevant herein- \u2014 a Stay of ithe eminent domain proceedings, a declaration that the Exposition stockholders were entitled to the Board of Viewers\u2019 award and that they were the owners of the Association\u2019s assets together with 'an injunction against the District restraining it from paying over to the Association any money in satisfaction of the Association\u2019s judgment. Preliminary objections filed by the Association were sustained by the court 'below on January 22, 1957. It has been represented to us that 'an appeal \u25a0has been taken from this action of the court below, which appeal has not yet been heard and, of course, is not involved in this proceeding.\nOn June 29, 1956 \u2014 approximately two weeks subsequent to entry of the equity suit \u2014 on the theory that because \u00a1of the equity suit it stood in a position of being subjected to multiple liability and that it could not determine the persons entitled to payment of -the judgment, the District requested the Court for permission to pay the money into court, under the Act of 1949. The lower court, on September 28, 1956, refused to permit the District to pay the money into court and direeled it to be paid to the Association. Upon exceptions filed, the court below, on January 23, 1957, reversed its previous order and directed tbe District to pay the money into court. From this order tbe Association \u00a1has appealed.\nOn December 5, 1956, tbe District filed a petition for an interpleader, under the Act of 1949, supra, and tbe Rules of 'Civil Procedure, seeking to have tbe equity suit plaintiffs, tbe Association and Chambers interpleaded and requesting permission to pay the money into court. The lower court, on January 21, 1957, refused tbe \u00a1interpleader petition. From that order tbe District has appealed.\nOn January 11, 1957, Chambers \u2014 the Association\u2019s assignee \u2014 petitioned the court, under tbe Act of 1949, supra, to issue a writ in tbe nature of a mandamus against the District directing it to pay the amount of tbe Association\u2019s judgment. Tbe Court, on February 13, 1957, dismissed this petition. From tbe order of dismissal Chambers has 'taken an appeal.\nEach appeal will be considered seriatim.\nThe Association\u2019s Appeal From Tbe Order Permitting The District To Pay Tbe Money Into Court.\nOn August 8, 1956 \u2014 eight weeks after tbe institution of tbe equity suit \u2014 the District petitioned tbe Court of Common Pleas of Butler County, under the authority of the Act of March 10, 1949, supra, for permission to pay into count, or to a bank in escrow, the amount of the judgment ($160,000) together with interest ($3600). After reciting the details of tbe eminent domain 'proceedings instituted against it by the Association and 'the District\u2019s readiness and ability to pay the amount of the judgment and interest, the District alleged that, \u00a1because of \u00a1the equity action instituted against 'the Association and its officers and directors, in which -the District had been joined as a party defendant, the District stood in danger of multiple liability to the Association and the equity suit -plaintiffs and the District was unable to determine -the persons legally entitled to the amount of the judgment.\nThe Association filed an answer to this petition wherein it averred that the District Was not subject to multiple liability, that the District was able to determine the persons entitled to the amount of the judgment, that the equity suit -was not lis pendens 'and that the Act of 1949, supra, was not applicable.\nOn September 28, 1956, in refusing the District\u2019s \u2022petition to pay the amount of the judgment into- 'court and -directing the District to pay the Association, the court below said inter alia, \u201cThis court finds no reason in law why the amount \u00a1of the -award should not now be paid to -the Butler Fair and Agricultural Association, -and finds no legal reason Why said money should be paid into court, thus depriving the Butler Fair and Agricultural Association of the use thereof\u201d. The court below further indicated that the equity suit was not a lien on the leasehold, that the Association was legally entitled to payment of the judgment and that the District would not be subjected to multiple 'liability.\nOn January 23, 1957, the court below, in reversing itself and ordering \u00a1the' District to pay the 'amount due on the judgment into court, then held that the mere pendency of -the equity suit placed the District in a position of danger \u00a1of multiple liability, and rendered dubious the person or persons legally 'entitled ito payment of the judgment.\nThe authority of the court to entertain and act upon the District\u2019s petition arose from the Act of 1949, supra. This statute, which confers the power of eminent domain upon the Distinct, must 'be strictly construed: 'Statutory 'Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Art. IY, \u00a758, 46 PS \u00a7558) Lance\u2019s Appeal, 55 Pa. 16. The pertinent section of the 1949 statute provides: \u201cIf on account of any liens existing against such premises, or if the actual owners thereof cannot be found, or if the owners or any of them refuse the amount awarded by such report, or if, for any other reason, the school district cannot pay the sum awarded for such damages to ithe person legally entitled thereto, it may pay the same into court, and thereafter the owners of such premises or its lien creditors -shall look to said fund for all damages accruing to them on account of the taking of -said property.\u201d Unless within the language of this statutory provision the Court is empowered to act under the circumstances of this case, its order must fall. It is obvious that the equity -suit plaintiffs have no lien against the premises, that the District knows the whereabouts of all claimants and that neither the Association nor the equity suit plaintiffs have refused the \u25a0amount of the award. Consequently, the first three stated bases for invoking the A'ct are -clearly absent. The District must rest its right, if any, to affirmative action under this statute upon the phrase \u201cor if, for any other reason\u201d. To bring itself within the statute, the District -contends that its possible subjection to double liability and its uncertainty as to the persons \u25a0legally entitled to the award afford a \u201creason\u201d within the statutory definition.\nThe Statutory Construction Act of 1937, -supra, \u00a733, provides: \u201cGeneral words shall be -construed to take \u25a0their meanings and be restricted by preceding particular words\u201d. The late President Judge Rice, speaking for the court, in Corry v. The Corry Chair Co., 18 Pa. Superior Ct. 271, 277, said: \u201cThe general word which follows particular and specific words of the same nature as itself often takes its meaning from them, and often is presumed to he restricted to the same genus as those words, or, in other words, as comprehending only things of the same kind as those designated by them, unless there is something to show that a wider sense was intended: Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 405.\u201d\nIn Frederick\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 327, 331, 5 A. 2d 91, it was stated: \u201cGeneral expressions used in a statute are restricted to things and persons similar to those specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expressions: Derk v. Zerbe Twp., 322 Pa. 350, 185 A. 647.\u201d\nIn re Hurlbut\u2019s Estate, 44 N. Y. Supp. 2d 450, the phrase, \u201cfor any other reason\u201d, was presented for interpretation. The court therein was interpreting a statute which authorized a surrogate, in his discretion, to allow testamentary trustees additional compensation \u201cif the trustee\u2019s duties have been unusually difficult or burdensome\u201d and if, \u201cfor any other reason\u201d, the trustee\u2019s commissions were inadequate. The court limited the phrase in its meaning to specific cases within the class referred to in the immediate prior phrase in the statute.\nA consideration of the Act of 1949, supra, indicates that it was the legislative intent, by the use of the phrase \u201cfor any other reason\u201d, to limit it to a meaning within the class which immediately precedes this phrase. Such a restriction is further justified by reference to the provision at the end of this section of the statute which provides that \u201cthereafter the owners of such premises or its lien creditors\u201d shall look to the fund for damages. Certainly tlie equity suit plaintiffs are not lienholders and the theory of their equity suit is not that they were the owners of the fund but rather that the fund should be impressed with a trust in favor of the Exposition stockholders and the Association should be directed to hold the fund for them and other Exposition stockholders as a trustee ex maleficio. The phrase \u201cfor any other reason\u201d cannot be divorced either from the phrase which follows it or from the phrase which precedes it. Any other construction would alIoav the payment into court of an eminent domain award under any and all circumstances.\nLevin et al. v. Pittsburgh United Corporation et al., 330 Pa. 457, 199 A. 332; Deckert\u2019s Appeal, 5 W. & S. 342; and Youngs v. Stoddard, 27 App. Div. 162, 50 N. Y. Supp. 475 are clearly inapposite to the instant situation which involves the construction and interpretation of an enabling statutory provision.\nA required strict construction of this statute gave the court beloAV no authority to direct the payment of this fund into court and the court beloAV erred in its order.\nChambers\u2019 Appeal Prom The Order Of Court Denying A Writ In The Nature Of Mandamus.\nReference Avas previously made in this opinion to the fact that prior to the entry of the equity action the Association had made a complete assignment of its judgment against the District to Chambers as collateral for his loan. Approximately a month prior to the equity suit Chambers\u2019 judgment had been entered against the Association and the District had been duly notified not only of Chambers\u2019 judgment against the Association but also of the complete assignment of. the Association\u2019s judgment against the District.- On the date of entry of the equity suit, the District had knowledge of the Association\u2019s judgment against it, that Chambers had a judgment against the Association and that the Association\u2019s judgment was assigned to Chambers.\nAt the time that Chambers\u2019 petition to enforce the Association\u2019s judgment against the District was presented to the court, the District had not yet been permitted to pay the amount of the award into court although proceedings for that purpose were pending. It was not until twelve days after Chambers\u2019 petition was presented to court that the District was permitted to pay the amount of the award into court.\nChambers petitioned the court for the enforcement of the Association judgment against the District under the authority of the Act of 1949, supra, which provides: \u201cEnforcement of judgments against School districts \u2014 If any judgment is obtained against any school district and the same is not paid as required, the same may be collected as follows and not otherwise: \u2014 -The plaintiff in any such judgment shall petition the court of common pleas in which such judgment was obtained . . . whereupon the court shall issue a writ in the nature of a mandamus execution, directed to the directors and treasurers of the school district against which such judgment was obtained, commanding them to pay the amount of such judgment, together with interest and costs . . . The court may enforce obedience to such writ by attachment on proper cause being shown.\u201d\nThe court permitted the District to file an answer which set forth: (1) that when this petition was presented all proceedings on the Association\u2019s judgment had been stayed by order of court; (2) that Chambers was not a judgment creditor of the District, the assignment not having been entered until 17 days after presentation of this petition; (3) that the issue was moot because the fund had been paid into court; (4) that payment into court relieved the District of its obligation either to the Association and/or Chambers.\nThe court below refused to enforce payment of the judgment on the grounds that since the fund had been paid into court the matter was moot and that Chambers had the right to petition the court to dispose of the fund and to prove his claim. An examination of the District\u2019s defense as set forth in its answer indicates its debility: (1) the same court which stayed proceedings on the judgment allowed filing of the petition; (2) although the Association\u2019s assignment of the judgment to Chambers was not entered of record until after presentation of the petition, yet the District had full knowledge, in writing, six months prior to the petition that the Association\u2019s judgment had been assigned to Chambers; (3) the order directing payment of the fund into court was not made until twelve days after the Chambers\u2019 petition was presented to the court; (4) payment into court of the amount of the award did not act as a release of the District if the order directing such payment was erroneously made.\nIf Chambers is to be considered under the statute as the \u201cplaintiff\u201d in the judgment, clearly, he was entitled to this summary process at the hands of the court. While at common law the assignee of a judgment was not permitted to bring an action thereon in his own name (Baker v. Wood, 157 U. S. 212, 39 L. Ed. 677, 15 S. Ct. 577; Howes v. Scott, 224 Pa. 7, 73 A. 186), the rule today is that \u201call actions shall be prosecuted by and in the name of the real party in interest . . .\u201d. (Pa. R. C. P. 2002 (a)). Sub-division (c) of Rule 2002 provides an exception to the general rule where a statute or ordinance provides otherwise. The instant statute does not provide an exception to the general rule: Steinert v. Galasso, 363 Pa. 393, 69 A. 2d 841. (Cf.: statutes such as the Act of June 23, 1931, P. L. 1181, \u00a71, 8 PS \u00a7146; Act of May 4, 1927, P. L. 519, Art. XII, \u00a71202, Cl. LIV, 53 PS \u00a713,366 and similar legislation).\nWhen this judgment was assigned it divested the assignor of all its interest therein and necessarily carried with it all the interest of the assignor in the judgments and its incidents. Chambers, as assignee, became the real party in interest and in him was vested the power to control the action or discharge the cause of action which was being enforced by his suit. The assignment of this judgment gave to Chambers, as assignee, the right to employ every remedy available as a means of enforcing the judgment. The \u201cplaintiff\u201d in a judgment under the statutory provisions is the \u201creal party in interest\u201d. Chambers as the \u201creal party in interest\u201d had the right under this statute to enforce payment of his judgment against the school district.\nUnder the theory of the court below, the matter became moot and Chambers deprived of his rights under the enforcement statute by reason of a proceeding to which Chambers was not a party and in which he neither took part nor had any opportunity to take part.\nThe record indicates that the Association granted Chambers by the execution of the assignment its entire right, title and interest in the judgment. It was a complete, not a partial, assignment; the authorities relied on by the District, such as Gordon, Secretary of Banking v. Hartford Sterling Co., 319 Pa. 174, 179 A. 234, deal with partial assignments and are, therefore inapplicable.\nThe court below indicated that Chambers had a remedy in that he could proceed to present his claim against the fund itself. Assuming arguendo, that Chambers had adopted such a procedure he would have encountered two obstacles: (1) the Act of 1949, supra, by its terms provides the exclusive remedy to enforce the judgment against the District and (2), even if Chambers had offered to prove the recorded and unsatisfied judgment and his ownership thereof by way of assignment, he still could not have enforced the judgment until the equity proceeding was finally concluded.\nChambers was clearly entitled to the enforcement of the judgment and the court below\u2019s refusal to grant such enforcement was erroneous.\nThe School District\u2019s Appeal From The Refusal Of The Court Below To Grant An Interpleader.\nOver seven months subsequent to the entry of the judgment against it \u2014 six months subsequent to the institution of the equity proceedings and seven weeks after the court had originally refused to permit the District to pay the amount of the award into court \u2014 the District presented a petition to the court seeking an interpleader which the court below refused.\nThis petition was brought under the authority of the Act of 1949, supra, \u00a7726, and under the Rules of Civil Procedure governing interpleader by defendants. At the time it was presented there was still pending before the court in a proceeding to No. 109 June Term, 1956 \u2014 the same number and term \u2014 the District\u2019s petition to pay the amount of the award into court.\nA petition for interpleader, either at law or in equity must be presented by a \u201cdefendant\u201d, that is, a \u201cparty originally named as a defendant, any party added to the record as a defendant and any plaintiff against whom a counterclaim or setoff is asserted\u201d (Pa. R. C. P. 2301, 2302). The District invokes the aid of this rule by petitioning in the proceeding in which the judgment was entered against it as defendant.\nAt the time the petition was presented there was only one other suit instituted in which the District was a defendant, to wit, the equity proceedings instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County, sitting in equity, No. 3 June Term, 1956. Pa. R. C. P. 2306(b) provides \u201cIf the defendant petitions to inter-plead claimants who in good faith and without collusion have started independent actions against the defendant in the same or different courts, the court in which the petition for interpleader is filed (1) shall grant the petition where otherwise proper under these rules if the petition is filed in the first action commenced against the defendant;\u201d. (Emphasis supplied)\nOne of the important prerequisites in interpleader proceedings, under Pa. R. C. P. 2303, is that a claimant has made or is expected to make a demand upon the defendant as a result of which the defendant is or may be exposed to double or multiple liability to the plaintiff and to such claimant as to all or any part of the claim asserted by the plaintiff. \u201cIn order to inter-plead a third person his claim must be adverse to the claim of the original plaintiff and must be of such a nature that its prosecution in addition to the claim of the original plaintiff may expose the defendant to double or multiple liability\u201d: Goodrieh-Amram Standard Pennsylvania Practice, \u00a72303 (a)-3.\nThe District\u2019s petition for interpleader sought to interplead not only the Association, but also the equity suit plaintiffs and Chambers. The petition sets forth at length the nature of the claims both of the equity suit plaintiffs and of Chambers.\nAn examination of the claim of plaintiffs in the equity suit indicates that what they seek is to have the fund represented by the amount of the award lohen paid by the District impressed with a trust for them and other shareholders of the old Exposition Company; it is not and cannot be the theory of their claim that the monies should not be paid to the Association but rather that the monies when paid should be declared held by the Association as a trustee ex maleficio for them and other Exposition stockholders.\nThe claim of Chambers is not adverse to the claim of the Association and what transpires concerning the disposition of the monies when paid between Chambers and the Association is of no moment to the District.\nAn examination of the averments of the petition for interpleader indicates that the District by reason of these claims is not put in danger of double or multiple liability and therefore the proceedings lack that essential element.\nIt is particularly noted that when the District presented its petition for interpleader there was still pending a proceeding instituted by it which had as its goal and purpose the same result to be attained by the interpleader proceedings.\nThe words of the court below are most apt: \u201cOn the other hand, interpleader proceedings would seem to be inappropriate so far as the equity plaintiffs are concerned. If the interpleader is granted, those plaintiffs will be required to abandon their equity case and litigate their claim against the School District in the judgment proceeding. This would be an entirely inept method of establishing their claim. In fact, they can only obtain a valid claim against the School District at all in the event that they first win their equity ease.\n\u201cThe situation presented is a dilemma, in which the strict application of the procedural rules seems to make the granting of the petition for interpleader mandatory, whereas interpleader is completely inappropriate because it forces the equity plaintiffs to litigate their claim in the judgment proceeding, which is utterly unadapted to that purpose.\n\u201cIf we were forced to decide between their alternatives, we would hold the interpleader proceeding to be inappropriate and dismiss the petition for this reason.\u201d\nThe court below was not mandated under the circumstances to grant the petition for interpleader. No adversity of claims between the Association and Chambers has been shown and the claim of the equity suit plaintiffs concerns not the payment of the money, but rather the disposition of the money when paid to the Association.\nInsofar as Chambers is concerned he is the owner of an assignment from the Association of all its right, title and interest in a final judgment evidencing the District\u2019s obligation to pay the Association. Chambers loaned this money on the basis of a final judgment at a time when no liens or other encumbrances appeared of record and no claims of any nature whatsoever had been made concerning this fund. To grant a preference in this fund to the equity plaintiffs as against Chambers would have the effect of requiring every person loaning money to a corporation to make a complete and searching investigation into the entire history of the corporation, its predecessors, if any, its affairs and, even then, such a lender would not be protected under the theory advanced in this litigation.\nWithout filing any bond or securing any injunctive relief the equity suit plaintiffs have managed to hold up the payment of this judgment for many months. It is a situation which calls for immediate corrective action. Payment of the amount of the fund to Chambers and the Association can be made and at the same time the District fully protected against double or multiple liability by an appropriate order of court.\nIn the event that the equity suit plaintiffs succeed in their litigation, a trust can be impressed upon the funds or assets in the hands of the Association. That Chambers will have to be repaid that which he loaned the Association out of this fund is of no concern; it was not until long after the loan had been made that the equity suit plaintiffs took any action toward protecting their claim. As between an innocent lender of money and the equity suit plaintiffs who gave no notice of any claims on their part, the latter and not the former must suffer.\nThe appeals of the Association and Chambers are sustained and the orders of the court below from which they have appealed are reversed.\nThe appeal of the School District is dismissed and the order of the court below from which it appealed is affirmed.\nThe costs in all appeals are placed on the District.\nAct of March 10, 1949, P.
