By statutory requirement, such a proceeding must be instituted within thirty days after the ordinance takes effect. See Act of May 18, 1933, P.L. 818, 5'3 P.,S. \u00a712900 (pkt. part). The court below should, therefore, have summarily dismissed the motion as having been lodged out of time.\nAppeal dismissed.",
