The question of the liquidating value of the plaintiff\u2019s stock, which the'defendants have latterly tried to inject, was not' an issue before us. In fact, liquidation of the corporation Avas not begun until some time after the record on the former appeal had been returned to the court below.\nThe only particular in which the decree now before us exceeds the intendment of our former decision is ,iii its inclusion of interest on the sum payable to the plaintiff by the defendants. The delay in payment for the plaintiff\u2019s stock interest is largely attributable to his excessive estimate of the fair value of his stock Avhich he persisted in demanding.\nThe decree of tbe court below is modified by tbe elimination of tbe item of interest and, as so modified, is affirmed; costs to be borne by tbe parties equally.",
