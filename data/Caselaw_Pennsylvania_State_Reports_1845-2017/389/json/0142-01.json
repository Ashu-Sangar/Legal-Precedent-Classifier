It is sufficient to note that the original action in replevin was instituted on July IS, 1950.\nThe granting of an application to open a default judgment rests within the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal in tbe absence of a manifest abuse of discretion. Bekelja v. James E. Strates Shows, Inc., 349 Pa. 442, 444, 37 A. 2d 502 (1944).\nUnder tbe peculiar circumstances of this case we are of tbe opinion that tbe lower court did not abuse its discretion in opening tbe judgment. Unfortunately, the conduct of this case reflects unfavorably upon both counsel and tends to bring upon our administration of justice tbe condemnation of litigants. Tbe procrastination on tbe part of tbe attorneys and tbe multitudinous delays which have marked tbe course of this litigation over tbe past half dozen years are glaringly apparent from even a casual reading of the record. Tbe court below should take corrective measures to prevent a re-occurrence of such situations in the future.\nOrder affirmed.",
