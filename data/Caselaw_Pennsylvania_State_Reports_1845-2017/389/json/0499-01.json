The plaintiff received from his employers workmen\u2019s compensation for his injuries and signed- a final settlement receipt. All .of these facts appear by tbe pleadings and are confirmed by tbe plaintiff\u2019s admissions of record. Tbe learned court below gave judgment on tbe ple\u00e1dings for tbe defendant; and tbe plaintiff appealed.\nTbe plaintiff\u2019s injuries for wbicb be claimed in trespass were sustained in tbe course of bis employment and were therefore compensable by bis employers under tbe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law. He was not entitled, in addition, to a common-law action for damages against tbe defendant employer individually. So long as tbe plaintiff was an employee of tbe defendant partnership and was injured in tbe course of bis employment, it is immaterial that tbe injury was due to tbe alleged negligence of one of bis employers.\nTbe opinion of Judge Sohn for tbe court below disposed of tbe claim in trespass against tbe individual partner so cogently and so adequately that we need add nothing futber in justification of tbe judgment.\nJudgment affirmed.",
