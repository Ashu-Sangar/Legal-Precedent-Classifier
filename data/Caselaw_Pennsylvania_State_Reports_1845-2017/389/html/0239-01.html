For present purposes, it is sufficient to relate that about 5 P.M. Saturday afternoon, December 15, 1945, the brutally beaten bodies of two men, Charles Simmons and Frank Endres, owner and employee, respectively, of the Ace Broom Factory, located on North Second Street in Philadelphia, were found lying in pools of blood on the floor of the factory. Both men were unconscious and neither ever regained consciousness before dying as a <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>result of Ms wounds. The only witnesses of the crime were its perpetrators and its victims.</p>
    <p id="b266-4" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[278,469,1147,601]]]'>The police interrogated many suspects and approximately five months later, viz., May 19, 1946, they took into custody one Clarence Lofton “relative to another murder” and not in connection with the broom factory killings. On June 3, 1946, Aaron Turner, the present appellant, was taken into custody around noontime by two Philadelphia detectives; and about 3 P.M. the same day the detectives arrested Jasper Johnson. Turner and Johnson along with Lofton were then detained by the police incommunicado until June 12, 1946, when they were delivered to the county prison.</p>
    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[279,1080,1147,982]]]'>On June 8, 1946, written confessions were obtained from Turner, Johnson and Lofton, each signing his own confession as well as the confessions of the other two. At Turner’s first trial, the Commonwealth offered in evidence against him the confessions of all three accused. It is unnecessary here to restate the invalidating circumstances under which the confessions were obtained. Upon a review of Turner’s first conviction, on certiorari to our judgment of affirmance, the Supreme Court of the United States held that the pertinent considerations left “open no other possible conclusion than that . . . [Turner’s] confession was obtained under circumstances which made its use at the trial a denial of due process” and that “the same considerations that bar admission of the confession by Turner made over his own name extend to his contemporaneous adoption of the Johnson and Lofton confessions” : see <a href="/us/338/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="338 U.S. 62" data-case-ids="3937819" data-case-paths="/us/338/0062-01">338 U.

The fact is that the prosecution’s subsequent efforts to meet the exigency of proof, thus occasioned, has been productive of reversible error at each succeeding retrial that has come before us for review. For a proper understanding of the background of the appellant’s present complaint, reference to the subsequent trials and appeals is essential in order that the continuity of the pervading error may become the more apparent.</p>
    <p id="b267-3" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[198,830,1148,1261]]]'>At the second trial the Commonwealth, deprived of the confessions, offered in evidence admissions made by Turner at a preliminary hearing before a magistrate on June 8th which was the fifth day of his vitiating detention and prior to signing of the confessions. The magistrate’s hearing was held in the same building in which the suspects were being detained and constituted but a very brief interlude in the persistent police questioning to which Turner, Johnson and Lofton were subjected. In holding that this evidence was inadmissible, Mr. Chief Justice Drew said for this court, — “Turner’s signed written confession has been deemed the result of inherent coercion. Certainly statements or admissions which he made at the preliminary hearing held during the coercive period and prior to his execution of the condemned confession must be considered tainted by the same infirmity. It is evident that the United States Supreme Court did not regard the interlude of the preliminary hearing as having purged the coercion. We are constrained to hold, therefore, that the testimony taken at the magistrate’s hearing was inadmissible as evidence against Turner as was his confession:” <a href="/pa/367/0403-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="367 Pa. 403" data-case-ids="1228342" data-case-paths="/pa/367/0403-01">367 Pa. 403</a>, 407.</p>

Lofton, at his trial, had entered a plea of guilty to the charge of murder and had received a life sentence. But, the crucial error so far as substantive evidence in support of the verdict was concerned was the objectionable testimony derived from the magistrate’s hearing.</p>
    <p id="b268-4" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[263,771,1149,916]]]'>The appellant had also assigned for error the trial court’s refusal of his request that the Commonwealth’s witnesses be excluded from the courtroom when not actually testifying. The importance of such a precaution became all too evident a little later when the two detectives, who had originally arrested Turner and had been present at, and had participated in, the June 3rd to 12th, 1946, interrogations of Turner, Johnson and Lofton, surprisingly gave incriminating testimony against Turner which they had never before disclosed to their superiors and specifically had not mentioned when testifying at the first trial. But, inasmuch as a new trial was being ordered because of the error already referred to, no mention was made in the opinion for this court with reference to the assignment of error based on the court’s refusal to sequester the Commonwealth’s witnesses.</p>

The detectives’ belatedly divulged testimony, which was designed to tie Turner to the actual commission of the homicides, con<a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>sisted of what the two detectives said they had eavesdropped on June 6,1946, from where they were secreted near a cell in which the three suspects (Turner, Johnson and Lofton) were allegedly then being held. What the detectives purportedly overheard is related in the opinion for this court on Turner’s appeal (see <a href="/pa/371/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="371 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1237077" data-case-paths="/pa/371/0417-01">371 Pa. 417</a>, 421) when the trial court’s refusal to sequester the Commonwealth’s witnesses upon request of defendant’s counsel became the chief error for which we again reversed and ordered a new trial.</p>

When you was up [at the Eastern State Penitentiary] last week I told you I had been tried and convicted and I preferred to have no more to say or do with the case. I am doing my time; I am doing life. There is nothing else that I can say in no way, shape or form.” An extended colloquy between the witness and the court and district attorney ensued following which the district attorney moved for permission to read to the jury portions of Lofton’s testimony at Turner’s third trial together with the cross-examination. (As already noted, Lofton had not been called to testify at Turner’s first trial.) The district attorney made this motion on the mistaken theory that Lofton, “having refused from the very beginning to testify at all”, had thus rendered himself “an unavailable witness.” The trial judge granted the motion over the objection of defendant’s counsel. The case went to the jury and resulted in a verdict of guilty with sentence fixed at death. In disposing of the defendant’s motion for a new trial, the court en banc erroneously approved the reading in evidence of Lofton’s former testimony but did grant a new trial because of the prejudicial effect of a statement made by the district attorney within the hearing of the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>jury referring to the defendant’s three previous convictions for the same offense: see 1 D. &amp; C. 2d 11, 16.</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[228,438,1153,1250]]]'>After the fourth trial but prior to argument of the motion for a neAV trial, defendant’s counsel received a request from Lofton in the Eastern State Penitentiary seeking an intervieAV. Counsel immediately apprised the trial judge of Lofton’s communication and, Avith the court’s approval, visited him in confinement. On that occasion Lofton repudiated entirely all of the testimony that he had ever given against Turner. His recantation Avas at once reduced to Avriting and was signed by him in the presence of prison officials. He moreover swore to its truth before a prison official who thereupon notarized it. This affidavit was filed with the court as an additional reason for the granting of a new trial since the Commonwealth’s principal witness against Turner had noAV admitted having perjured himself in everything he had ever theretofore testified to against him. A copy of the affidavit was submitted to the trial judge and to the district attorney. The effect of Lofton’s recantation was urged upon the court en banc on the argument of the defendant’s motion for a new trial, but the court did not, in its opinion granting a neAV trial for another reason, touch upon the significance of the affidavit.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[225,1711,1148,594]],["BL_271.1",271,[199,336,1156,867]]]'>In preparation for the impending fifth trial, Lofton was again visited at the Eastern State Penitentiary by defendant’s counsel Avho promptly apprised the district attorney of that fact and at the same time informed him that Lofton persisted in his repudiation of his former testimony against Turner and would refuse to testify against him at the oncoming trial. After defendant’s counsel and the district attorney had thus discussed Lofton’s reaffirmed attitude, the district attorney made a trip to the penitentiary to interview him. Lofton confirmed to the district attorney that his af<a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>fidavit recanting Ms former testimony was the truth and that he would not testify against Turner, as the district attorney pressed him to do. Nonetheless, at the subsequent trial, the district attorney called Lofton as a witness for the Commonwealth and, as had been plainly forecast, the witness steadfastly refused to tes-’ tify as the district attorney strove, by interminable and repetitious questioning, to get him to do in line with his earlier testimony. For his refusal to answer the district attorney’s questions, the trial judge forthwith held Lofton in contempt of court. The district attorney then argued that Lofton, by his refusal to testify, had rendered himself an unavailable witness and that, therefore, his former testimony against the defendant should be read into the record, and moved the court for leave so to do.</p>
    <p id="b271-3" data-blocks='[["BL_271.4",271,[191,1225,1153,1097]]]'>It is, of course, too evident to admit of any doubt that the district attorney well knew when he called Lofton as a Commonwealth witness at Turner’s fifth trial that he would refuse to testify to the same effect as he formerly had. Not only had the district attorney been so advised right up to the moment of his again calling Lofton as a witness but he was, moreover, the same district attorney who had appeared for the Commonwealth at Turner’s fourth trial where he had witnessed Lofton’s immovable refusal to testify against Turner. What, then, Avas the district attorney’s motive in again calling Lofton? The answer is not hard to discern. In the impasse created at the fourth trial by Lofton’s refusal to testify, the learned trial judge, on the district attorney’s motion, had erroneously permitted him to read in evidence Lofton’s former testimony against Turner on the ground that he had become an unavailable witness. It was that very procedural achievement at the fourth trial that inspired the district attorney to go ahead and again call Lofton.</p>
    <p id="b272-3" data-blocks='[["BL_272.3",272,[260,333,1147,1034]]]'>
      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>The record makes it abundantly clear that the district attorney expected or at least hoped to be permitted, in keeping with the trial court’s ruling at the fourth trial, to read in evidence Lofton’s former testimony as that of an unavailable witness. Thus, in arguing to the trial judge for the right so to proceed at the fifth trial, the district attorney said, “I now insist, if the Court please, that you rule on my motion to consider this witness, as was formerly done, an unavailable witness. The pattern is precisely the same as it was at that time. ... I would say this, Your Honor, that the Court en banc [on the fourth trial’s after-verdict motions] having the same pattern before it at the phase of the case where the Commonwealth made a similar motion, decided that that was proper. . . . That is the gist of my argument, if the Court please, to refer the Court to the opinion of the Court en banc in the prior Turner trial, as a basis of my contention of the motion made.”</p>
    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[262,1387,1146,929]]]'>Obviously, Lofton was not an unavailable witness either within the letter or the spirit of the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158. Not only was he then present in the courtroom but was actually on the witness stand at the time. Nor had he refused to testify to what he then avowed to be the truth. The fact is that he was willing to testify in accordance with his recantation. The matter of his affidavit having in the course of the colloquy between the court and counsel become known to the trial judge (who was trying the ease for his first time), the court stated, “This man has been called as a witness. He says that this paper is the truth and he says he wants to tell the truth. In other words, he wants to testify to those facts.” Such being the witness’s status, the court very properly refused the district attorney’s motion to read Lofton’s former testimony in evidence as that of <em>an unavailable witness.</em>

To accept the district attorney’s contention that Lofton’s hostility and adverseness was evidenced by his refusal to testify against Turner, as he had done at former trials, would be to put the Commonwealth in the position of seeking a victim regardless of the truth or falsity of the evidence elicited to <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>sustain the charge. At the same time, for the court to accredit “surprise” to the district attorney in the undisputed attending circumstances was to accept pretense for reality and make a sham of the requisite for the exercise of the privilege of cross-examining one’s own witness. What the district attorney intentionally and deliberately did was to set the stage for his request to cross-examine Lofton in order to get before the jury contradictory prior statements of the witness helpful to the prosecution. And, that is never permissible. Moreover, the trial court erroneously overruled the defendant’s proper request that the district attorney be required to state of record the antecedent conflicting statement of the witness upon which he had relied and whereby he was “taken unawares” at trial.

The evidentiary situation requisite for such a plea, even where there is <em>real </em>surprise, was well set forth by Judge (now Mr. Justice) Arnold in <em>Selden v.

In particular, the discrepancies between the different versions given at the various Turner trials by O’Mahoney (Thompson appears to have played a secondary testimonial role) are nothing less than glaring. For example, at the second Turner trial, O’Mahoney testified that he had not discussed the overheard conversation, which he was then relating in court for the first time, with anyone except Thompson and Turner; and he testified to like effect at Turner’s fourth trial. But, at the fifth trial, O’Mahoney testified that he had made an oral report to Sgt. Riccardi of the Homicide Squad of what he had overheard in the cell.

It so happens, however, that Sgt. Riccardi testified at Turner’s third trial that he “did not receive any report [concerning the conversation O’Mahoney had allegedly overheard] because from what had developed, we did not need it.” At the very time O’Mahoney was thus enlarging his prior testimony, Sgt. Riccardi was sitting in the court room but was not called to the stand by the Commonwealth. The reason why is not hard to fathom.

Indeed, O’Mahoney confirmed at Johnson’s second trial that he had not made a written report of what Turner was supposed to have said because he did not think it important enough. Was it not important that the other police officers be informed of what Turner and Johnson were supposed to have said in the cell on June 6th when the police interrogation of them was continued beyond that date and the broom factory murders were the burden of the questioning of the three suspects?

We will direct that all witnesses be segregated and that they be kept out of the court room except when testifying. And we also instruct all witnesses that they are not to discuss this case among themselves or with any other witness at any time during the continuance of this trial.” After brief remarks by respective counsel of their satisfaction with the ruling, the court ordered all witnesses to stand and then added, — “If there is any witness who didn’t understand the Court’s instruction, please let us know now.

Their actions plainly indicated that they had been taken unawares. Counsel brought the occurrence to the attention of the trial judge immediately upon resumption of the court session following the recess and, outside the hearing of the jury, the following took place. The court called before it the two detectives who were then examined by defendant’s counsel in relevant connection. Each admitted he had been in court when the court ordered the witnesses for the Commonwealth to be segregated and heard the court’s caution to the witnesses not to talk with each other about the case. O’Mahoney told the court how he had gone to the back of the restaurant and there sat at a table for two at which Thompson was already seated. The detectives’ consciousness of having violated the court’s instructions was evidenced by a trifling but nonetheless compelling incident. Defendant’s counsel, who had been facing Thompson, walked over to the detectives’ table and, from behind, placed his hand on O’Mahoney’s shoulder to make certain that he, too, knew of counsel’s presence. In turning around to face defendant’s counsel, O’Mahoney held his paper napkin up to his face as if to disguise himself, as he expressed it.

Nevertheless, the -witnesses’ disobedience is to be considered as affecting their credibility. See 53 Am. Jur., Trial, §33, p. 48. Nor is the impairment of the witness’s probity by reason of his contumacy lessened to any degree because his deliberate disobedience was professedly not utilized to accomplish what the order sequestering him as a witness was designed to obviate. If the rule were otherwise, “the expedient of sequestration” which, as Wigmore expresses it (Yol. VI, (3rd Ed., 1940) §1838, p. 352), “is (next to cross-examination) one of the greatest engines that the skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in a court of justice” would for all practical purposes, become a hollow form.</p>
