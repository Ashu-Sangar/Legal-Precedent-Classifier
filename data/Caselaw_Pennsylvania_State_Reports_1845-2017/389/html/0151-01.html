The railroad is given the “right to enter upon the said land, and lay out, construct, maintain and operate a railroad over and across the land . . . taking and using such earth, stones and gravel, as may be needed for grading and filling such road”. The rights thus granted — -the right of entry, the right to use, construct, maintain and operate a railroad, the right to use earth, stones and gravel to grade and fill the roadbed — are all rights which naturally and lawfully arise from ownership of land in fee simple.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_18" id="ref_footnote_1_18">18</a> If the parties intended the railroad to receive a fee in this land, this language would give it those rights which it already had. If the parties intended to convey a fee simple interest to the railroad, it was surplusage to give the railroad these rights because such rights would naturally belong to the railroad as holder of the fee. The only rational conclusion from this language is that the parties did not intend to vest in the railroad any interest in fee simple; any other construction does violence to the expressed grant of these rights to the railroad.</p>

It is appellees’ position that these two steps were taken by the railroad company to acquire this land by eminent domain.
