Previously on the same day the defendant had been in this club, after sometime he left there and, when he returned, he had in his possession a .45 caliber Colt revolver. When the defendant returned there were present, among others, one Aaron Daniels, a patron, and one Wallace Bussell, the bartender. Bussell and Daniels had been engaged in a conversation and Daniels was turning from the bar to leave the place when he was shot through the left arm by the defendant and then Bussell was shot by defendant according to the Commonwealth’s version which was denied by the defendant. There was <em>some </em>testimony that before any shot was fired, the defendant said “This is a stick-up, don’t nobody move.” There was also <em>some </em>testimony that the bartender said “Don’t kill me, if you want the money take the money. Don’t kill me”, that the bartender raised his hands in the air from behind the bar and that the defendant shot him through the abdomen, inflicting wounds from which Bussell died. There was also <em>some </em>testimony that the defendant had reached into the bartender’s pocket and <em>some </em>testimony that defendant had gone behind the bar to the cash register and that, when backing toward the door to make an exit from the place, the defendant said “Nobody move, if you do, I will kill you.” Five witnesses testified on behalf of the Commonwealth to the events surrounding the shooting.</p>

However, the Commonwealth offered in evidence a statement made to the police by defendant the day following the shooting, and defendant’s testimony at the first trial and at the habeas corpus proceedings.

Defendant stated that he returned to the Barbary Coast hoping to talk it over, that he remembered firing only one shot: “Q. How many shots did you fire from this revolver? A. I don’t remember but firing one. Q. And who did you fire that at? A. The fellow that I killed.” Pie stated that he then left. According to defendant’s testimony at the first trial, defendant went to the Barbary Coast Club at approximately three o’clock in the afternoon, saw one Susie Horton there and got into an altercation with Johnny Taylor about dancing with the Horton woman; Taylor threatened to evict him; defendant started to back toward the door, Johnny Taylor kicked him and he saw a gun pointing at him; at that time the defendant stated he had drunk four pints of moonshine and had been smoking marihuana; defendant stated that he went home, secured his gun and returned to find out why he was kicked out of the Barbary Coast; upon his return, he saw a man (apparently Daniels) lying on a table; that the bartender, Bussell, started after him with a gun in his hand and that if he, the defendant fired his gun, he had no recollection of the incident; he denied he said anything about a stick-up or that he tried to take any money from any person. At the habeas corpus pro<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>ceedings the defendant testified that, after he was thrown out of the Barbary Coast, he did not leave the premises but went downstairs and there met one Oscar Carey who gave him a gun; that he went upstairs with the gun and the bartender ran toward him with a gun and grabbed him by the collar; he did not admit firing any shot but he did admit that he told some friends later that he had “shot somebody” and that he had been drinking.</p>

Oscar Carey, a rebuttal witness for the Commonwealth, testified that the gun had been taken by the defendant from Carey’s home shortly before the shooting, without Carey’s knowledge; he denied that he had given the gun to the defendant in the downstairs area of the Barbary Coast Club and he testified that he was present when the defendant dropped the wallet in which he found not only the deceased’s social security card, but also a numbers slip and six dollars. The defendant, in neither his statement nor his testimony at the previous proceedings, denies that he fired a shot and the testimony of several witnesses Avho saAV and talked with him after the shooting is to the effect that defendant acknoAvledged having shot someone.

Therefore, in addition to the instruction on the law of self-defense, the jury should have been told, if they found that at the time of the shooting the defendant was not actuated by malice, but that he acted under the influence of an uncontrollable mortal fear raised by the threats and conduct of Boceo, and if they thought that the immediate circumstances, though adequate to raise the fear, were not sufficient reasonably to justify a belief on the part of the defendant that he was in immediate danger of death or great bodily harm, the grade of the crime would not rise higher than manslaughter.” This language must be read in context with the factual situation in the <em>Golandro </em>case. In that case, there was testimony that for three months prior to the shooting the deceased had demanded, money of the defendant, that deceased produced a revolver and threatened to kill defendant unless his demands were complied with, that deceased’s threats continued until the afternoon of the day of the shooting, that deceased sent a messenger to defendant conveying similar threats and at the time of the shooting when the deceased entered the room, he repeated his threats, started to shoot and the defendant was placed in fear. In the <em>Golandro </em>case, the Court instructed the jury that there was only “one issue” — self-defense—•, that the possibility of manslaughter was not present and that it was necessary for the defendant to satisfy the jury that his version of the shooting was correct.</p>

This Court held it was error to exclude proof of deceased’s threats to defendant and in refusing to permit defendant to show that when he saw the revolver in deceased’s hands, he was thrown into such a passion of terror, as a result of the previous uttered threats, that he killed deceased while under the influence of such terror. In the <em>Principatti </em>case we noted that evidence that, just before the shooting, deceased turned toward defendant drawing a revolver which defendant saw in deceased’s hands “would not be sufficient to show a provocation which would justify killing in self-defense, or even such a passion of fear as to reduce the alleged crime to manslaughter” (pp. 596, 597) : a factual situation very similar to the factual situation herein related by defendant.</p>

The Court informed the jury that when a killing takes place, without malice but intentionally, but brought about by passion, including fear and terror, such a killing would be voluntary manslaughter. At no place in the charge nor in any manner whatsoever did the Court even intimate to the jury that they could not find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. A trial court is not required to use any particular language in instructing a jury provided that the language employed adequately and fully conveys to the jury the law applicable to the facts in the case. The Court below fully instructed the jury and a reading of the entire charge is persuasive of the conclusion that the jury fully understood that if they believed the defendant shot Russell under the sway, compulsion and influence of fear or terror, however unreasonable it may have been, they could find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter.</p>

While defendant urges that the Court should have charged in the language of the <em>Golandro </em>case, supra, he fails to point to any evidence which would have justified the language of such a charge. There is no duty on a trial judge to charge and instruct a jury upon law which has no applicability to the presented facts: there must be some relationship between the law upon which an instruction is required and the evidence presented at the trial. For instance, a court is not required to instruct on the law applicable to an alibi, if the record fails to reveal any evidence upon which alibi may be premised. However, despite the lack of 'any evidence in this respect, the court below in the exercise of an abundance of caution fully and adequately instructed the jury on voluntary manslaughter and its possibility as a verdict. Evidently even defendant’s counsel before the verdict were satisfied with the Court’s charge because they failed either to request additional instructions or to except to the instructions as given.

Second, the Commonwealth offered in evidence the record of a general court-martial dated May 23, 1943, convened at Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Stafford-shire, England wherein the defendant was Cleveland Thompson, the present defendant: at that court-martial Cleveland Thompson was charged with violating the 93rd Article of War in three specifications. The first specification charged defendant with having committed an assault, with the intent to commit a felony, namely murder, by shooting Private Albert Johnson in the shoulder with a rifle; the second specification charged defendant with having committed an assault, with intent to do bodily harm, by shooting Private Wilbur Adkins in the foot with a rifle; the third specification charged defendant with having committed an assault, with intent to do bodily harm, by shooting Private John Camp in the buttocks with a rifle; all three assaults were alleged to have taken place at Whittington Barracks on November 27, 1942. The record, properly authenticated, indicates that defendant entered a plea of guilty to the first specification and pleas of not guilty to the second and third specifications; the findings on all three specifications and the charge were guilty and the defendant was sentenced to the Disciplinary Training Center No. 1, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England. The objection to the admission of this court-martial record was based on the ground that such a record lacked judicial authority and finality and was not to be considered a prior conviction by a court recoghized as a judicial tribunal.</p>

Curry, <a href="/pa/287/0553-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="287 Pa. 553" data-case-ids="1099588" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0553-01">287 Pa. 553</a>, 558), yet the act requires both the question of guilt and the punishment to be covered by one verdict. <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>It may be that, if under any circumstances evidence of other offenses than the one on trial is admitted as helpful to the jury in the performance of its duty in assessing the punishment, such proof will inevitably be used by it in determining the guilt of the prisoner. This is not an insurmountable objection. . . . The Act of 1925 was not passed to help habitual criminals, and we take judicial knowledge of the fact that offenders of that designation have become so general that the law, not only lex scripta, but non scripta, must advance to protect society against them. This being so, in a case like the present,, where the trial judge was. convinced from the confessions of the defendants, as the Court below evidently was, that they were habitual offenders against society,- — robbers, burglars, and, as occasion arose, murderers, — -where the evidence indicated such to be their general manner of life, and where the defendants asked that, if convicted, the jury, in assessing punishment, extend mercy to them, we cannot say it was reversible error to receive their full confessions in evidence, even though it is possible that the admissions therein of other offenses may have militated in a general way against defendants.” The <em>Parker </em>rule, without limitation, was followed in <em>Com. v.

This Court, in complete defiance of the plain intendment of the Legislature, has rewritten the statute so that it reads in effect: In the trial of any person charged with murder, the Commonwealth may introduce evidence of previous convictions so that the jury may determine, in the event they find the defendant guilty of first degree murder, whether the defendant should suffer death or life imprisonment. This rewriting of the statute, which was originally done in 1928, and has been affirmed by practically every group of judges forming the Supreme Court since then, represents to me an invasion of the Pennsylvania Constitution, a denial of due process guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and a repudiation, without cause, of one of the most fundamental rules of criminal law and procedure.

It introduced also a court-martial record to the effect that on November 27, 1942, while Thompson was serving with the armed forces of the United States in England, he committed an assault with intent to commit murder on another soldier, and an assault with intent to commit bodily harm on two other soldiers.

Writing for the Court, he said in the <em>Parker </em>case, that, because of the Act of 1925, the jury should be allowed “the same sort of information that a judge considers when deciding as to punishment for crime.” Of course, he possessed no authority whatsoever for such a pronouncement. To bestow on a jury the powers, authority, and responsibility of a judge requires more than the dictum of a justice of the Supreme Court, learned, conscientious, and dutiful as he may be. Chief Justice von Moschzisker said further: “Does not the discretion now vested in the jury as to the punishment to be administered dictate that there should be a more liberal rule of evidence applicable to a case like the present?” He then erroneously answered his self-asked question in the affirmative. Even if the stream of judicial interpretation were to be widened to the dimensions of the Mississippi at its greatest expansion, one could never find in the Act of 1925 the slightest suggestion, hint, or intimation that it authorized the liberalization of the rules of evidence. To widen the rules of evidence without authority is to remove trials from the courthouse to the market square where rumor, gossip, and the sheerest irrelevancy may condemn sovereign authority itself. <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>Chief Justice von Moschzisker would never have arrived at his illogical conclusion if he had given some attention to the purpose of the Act of 1925 and the meaningful history which preceded its enactment.

The authors of that bill would certainly never recognize it in the form into which it was tortured by Chief Justice von Moschzisker and all the justices who have laid a hand to it since 1925.</p>

There were (as there are today) those who felt that in the interests of the protection of society, certain malefactors should be put to death. There were others who believed (as they believe today) that capital punishment offends against the Sixth Commandment, that if is not a deterrent, and that the act of the State in killing its citizens offers an example of brutality which can only have a degrading effect on the people at large. In America this debate began with the landing of the first colonists and it has continued to the present. Interest in the controversy has risen and fallen, depending on the state of the public affairs of the day. In Pennsylvania the forces working for abolition of the death penalty had on several occasions come within striking distance of their goal, but they were never able to muster enough votes in the Legislature to bring about an outright repeal of the death penalty. However, by 1925 they had gained some effective allies, not from abolitionists like themselves, but from the enemy camp, namely, those who still advocated the death penalty but were aware that frequently juries returned second degree murder verdicts <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>only because a first degree murder verdict meant death for the defendant. It was also known that juries often accompanied their vei'dicts of first degree murder with a recommendation of mercy because they found extenuating circumstances in the commission of the murder which should save the defendant from the ultimate penalty of death. Of course, despite such recommendation, the judge was compelled by law to impose the death sentence.</p>

This was done without abolishing the death penalty because the jury trying the case was empowered to decide whether the punishment in that particular case should be life imprisonment or death. It was left to the jury making the decision to reach its conclusion on the evidence in <em>that </em>case. Not on other evidence. Not on extraneous episodes. But on the same evidence which would sustain the verdict of first degree murder. Since, prior to 1925, juries could and did return verdicts of first degree murder (which meant death) without hearing evidence on unrelated prior convictions, why would it be necessary, now that they were allowed to return a lesser penalty, to hear evidence in magnification of the prisoner’s criminality?</p>

So far as procedure was concerned, the law was to remain as it always was, namely, the jury would pass <em>only </em>on the issue presented to it by the indictment. Let us look again at the Act of 1925: “That every person convicted <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>of the crime of murder of the first degree shall be sentenced to suffer death in the manner provided by law, or to undergo imprisonment for life, at the discretion of the jury trying the case, which shall fix the penalty by its verdict.” Without looking through the spectacles of a Draco, can anyone discover in these words, as transparent as a freshly washed window, anything about liberalization of the rules of evidence?

Of course, it was n.ot passed to help habitual criminals, but neither was it passed to deny to the accused in a criminal trial those safeguards which have been guaranteed to all accused from the earliest days of the common law.

To say that the Act of 1925 was passed to protect society against criminals is to put the moral cart before the just horse, because the duty of the jury is to determine if the accused is guilty of the crime with which he is charged and not to decide whether he should be eradicated from the living on account of offenses he has committed in the past, for which, incidentally, he has <em>already </em>paid his debt to society.</p>

This episode had not the slightest relevancy to the killing on which he was tried.

Up until 1909, there was never any doubt that the law in Pennsylvania prohibited the Commonwealth from dragging into a criminal trial, evidence of prior crimes entirely disassociated from the crime which was the subject of the trial. In that year, 1909, in Lawrence County, in the murder case of <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Racoo, <a href="/pa/225/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="158" data-cite="225 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="965261" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0113-01">225 Pa. 113</a>, the district attorney prosecuting the case decided to circumvent the rule prohibiting the introduction of a prior record, by asking the defendant whether he had not already been convicted of crime. The defendant did in fact have a criminal record. The district attorney’s question thus threw him on to the horns of a double dilemma. If he denied the prior record he would be guilty of perjury. If he admitted it, he lessened his chances for an acquittal of the crime for which he was then being tried. His counsel objected to the question, was overruled, and the defendant compelled to answer. He was convicted. Thus the district attorney was permitted to bring in by the back door of cross-examination what the law for centuries had kept away from the front door of direct evidence. On appeal, this Court affirmed the conviction by explaining that when the defendant offered to testify in his own behalf, his credibility became a question for the jury. Justice Brown, writing for the Court, said further: “Under our statute permitting him to testify no restriction was placed upon the limit of his cross-examination.” This, of course, was sheer sophistry, because all limitations to cross-examination which appear in the law of the land must perforce remain, unless specifically eliminated which they certainly were <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>not in the statute referred to. The <em>Racco </em>decision met with much criticism at the bar and in the Legislature. Accordingly on March 15, 1911 (P. L. 20), the General Assembly passed an Act to prevent a repetition of the <em>Racco </em>performance. It read: "An Act Regulating in criminal trials the cross-examination of a defendant, when testifying in his own behalf. Hereafter any person charged with any crime, and called as a witness in his own behalf, shall not be asked, and, if asked, shall not be required to answer, any question tending to show that he has committed, or been charged with, or been convicted of any offense other than the one wherewith he shall then be charged, or tending to show that he has been of bad character or reputation; unless, — One. He shall have at such trial, personally or by his advocate, asked questions of the witness for the prosecution with a view to establish his own good reputation or character, or has given evidence tending to prove his own good character, or reputation; or, Two.

In that case, the sister of the defendant, indicted for murder, was asked if the defendant had not been convicted of shooting another member of the family. Objection was made by defense counsel, but the witness was required to answer. The defendant was convicted and appealed, in reversing the conviction, Justice Walling said: “The statement, however, brought directly to the knowledge of the jury, not only the fact that defend<a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>ant had shot his brother but also that he had been convicted of it. <em>This was a violation of the fundamental principle that in the trial of a prisoner for one crime the Commonwealth cannot introduce evidence of his guilt of another independent crime.”</em>

The defendant objected, lifting in protection the shield of the Act of 1911 which forbade in so many words exactly what the district attorney was doing. The objection was overruled and, on conviction, the defendant appealed to this Court, where the shield was splintered.

The Act of 1947 proclaimed that “In the trial of any person charged with crime, <em>no evidence shall be admitted which tends to show that the defendant has committed, or has been charged with, ,or has been convicted of any offense, other than the one wherewith he shall then be charged, or that he has been of bad character or reputation </em>unless,</p>

The title to the Act of 1947, was very specific: “An Act To amend section one of the act, approved the fifteenth day of March, one thousand nine hundred eleven (Pamphlet Laws 20), entitled ‘An Act regulating in criminal trials the cross-examination of a defendant when testifying in his own behalf/ by further providing what evidence is or is not admissible.” Nor can it be doubted that the subject of the Act of 1947 was germane to the Act of 1911 since it particularly had to do with evidence admissible in criminal cases.</p>

As Chief Justice Jones so cogently put it: “Even should the third exception of the Act of 1947 be so unintelligible as to be unworkable (which, of course, it is not), the invalidity would attach only to the third exception. How could it possibly affect the balance of the Act which, elsewhere, makes inadmissible <em>in the Commonwealth’s case </em>evidence of a defendant’s prior offenses?

From 1928 to 1947 the Legislature had had nearly 20 years to observe the effects of the <em>Parker </em>decision. The Act of 1947 was based on the knowledge of what had happened in those 20 years.

Every Opinion writer of this Court who has attempted to justify a procedure which on its face is not entirely satisfactory, not entirely fair, and not entirely just, has asserted that when a prior record is used, it is used only for one purpose, namely, to assist the jury in deciding the penalty — after they have determined the first degree murder guilt. The Opinion writers have assured the legal world that under no circumstances must the jury consider the prior records as evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant on the charge for which he is standing trial. Not one of these Opinion writers, however, has ever explained how the cat Avas to be belled. To say that a jury Avill consider the prior record if, and only if, it first decides the defendant is guilty of the indicted crime, is an equivocation which <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>amounts almost to a deception. Let us look at what happened in the case at bar in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b448-4" data-blocks='[["BL_448.4",448,[263,464,1144,709]]]'>The Thompson murder trial began on May 21, 1956. On May 24th, three days later, the Commonwealth introduced the record of the previous offenses. The trial ended on May 29th. Thus, for five continuous days, the jury saw the defendant through the blackening screen of his previous record. During all the time that the defendant was presenting his defense on the charge of the murder committed in September, 1949, the jury was thinking of what he had done in November, 1942. Strive as hard as they might, how could they sweep from their minds the consciousness and the knowledge that they were trying a man who already had been condemned by the law?</p>
    <p id="b448-5" data-blocks='[["BL_448.5",448,[261,1185,1149,762]]]'>The Majority Opinion says that the trial judge must emphasize to the jury that they are to limit their consideration of the prior record to a determination of the penalty. How much did the Trial Court in this case emphasize that point? This is what the Court said: “You are informed that these records cannot be considered by you in passing upon the question of the guilt or innocence of the defendant; and you must clearly understand that. The question of guilt or innocence must be determined under the evidence in this case, without consideration of those records. If you come to the conclusion of returning a verdict of murder in the first degree, then you come to the question of considering the other offenses.”</p>
    <p id="b448-6" data-blocks='[["BL_448.6",448,[261,1960,1148,366]],["BL_449.1",449,[171,359,1151,1204]]]'>When the Judge so instructed the jury, they had <em>already </em>been considering for five days the prior record of the defendant. Could they strain out the prior record from the evidence on the present case and consider that evidence alone? The human brain is not divided into water-tight compartments which hold ideas and memories incommunicado and sacrosanct from each <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>other. A stone and steel wall can stop a cannon projectile blit nothing can stop a thought. In fact, there is this paradox about mental images. Once the guardian of the mind is instructed that a certain idea must not be considered in connection with another idea, the forbidden concept will dart into every prohibited area. Even Chief Justice von Moschziskeb recognized this, because he said in the <em>Parlcer </em>case “It may be that, if under any circumstances evidence of other offenses than the one on trial is admitted as helpful to the jury in the performance of its duty in assessing the punishment, <em>such proof will inevitably be used by it in determining the guilt of the </em>prisoner.” (p. 154.) He added, however, that “this is not an insurmountable objection.” How did he propose to surmount the objection? He did not say, except to cite a Kentucky case and observe, “if the admission of such evidence is hard on the defendant, it is a burden which he must bear.” Must a defendant be content with cynicism when he asks for justice? Who said that it is a burden which he must bear? The Act of 1925 does not say so. The common law does not say so. Fair play does not say so.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[169,1576,1150,639]]]'>Do Courts engender respect for law when they lay down rules which do not coincide with recognized human phenomena, which bear no relation to the fundamental law of cause and effect, and which assert what the most unlearned man of the streets knows to be contrary to everyday experience? To expect that jurors can place in the deep freezes of their memories a defendant’s prior record, hold it there in unconscious congelation until they have decided the man’s guilt, and then take it out, warm it up and consider it in connection with determination of the penalty, is jurisprudential somnambulism.</p>

    <p id="b450-4" data-blocks='[["BL_450.4",450,[275,582,1151,1033]]]'>As I have stated at length, the Act of 1925 in no way authorizes the flaunting of a defendant’s prior record in the faces of the jury, but if it is to be brought into the case at all, it should not be revealed, exhibited, or mentioned until after the jury has reached a verdict of guilty of first degree murder. During the oral argument of this case, defense counsel asserted (and justly) that the defendant had been irremediably harmed by the introduction of his prior record before the adjudication of guilt and was, therefore, entitled to a new trial. One of the Justices remarked that to order a new trial for that reason would be inconsistent with the position this Court had taken in the past, mentioning some of the defendants who had been convicted as Thompson has been convicted. I fail to see how that is a supportable reason for denying an established right. Because the Court has erred in the past is no reason why it should continue to err. Piling error upon error does not finally add up to infallibility.</p>

But there is no need for the Legislature to act if this Court will do what seems to me to be its obvious duty. That duty is to bring the law of criminal procedure in murder trials back to what it was in 1925, before this Court, without removal of judicial robes, assembled to sit as a super-legislature, vetoing the acts of the chosen representatives of the people, and rewriting statutes in accordance with individualistic ideas which cannot be found <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>in Blackstone or in the code of American justice and fair play.</p>

Now that this Court has apparently thrown open the floodgates on all trivial as well as serious offenses of an accused’s past, it is possible for an innocent man to be sent to the electric chair not on the evidence of murder but because of the suit of peccadillos which the prosecution forces him to wear. No other State permits so bizarre and tragic a performance. Nothing in history since Justinian, nothing in all the logic of Aristotle, nothing in the mathematics of Euclid, nothing in the science of Newton and Einstein can justify so unAmerican, so unjust, and so unreasonable a procedure.</p>
