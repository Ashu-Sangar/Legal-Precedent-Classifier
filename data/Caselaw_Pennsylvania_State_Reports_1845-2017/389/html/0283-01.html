The court en banc, consisting of two judges, refused appellee’s motion for judgment n.o.v. but granted her motion for a new trial. This appeal was then taken from that order.</p>

He stated that he had not had anything to eat or drink all day. Upon entering the hotel, he decided that he would visit the lavatory before ordering his meal. The lavatory and the cocktail lounge of the MeKeesporter are located on the basement level; to reach them it is necessary to descend stairs from the lobby level. Appellant testified that there was no light over the stairs; that there was merely a “greenish-cast” light emanating from the basement level. He stated that this light showed the steps to be a light colored material which appeared worn but that he could not see the condition of the metal strips binding the front edges of the steps. After taking one complete step down from the landing he testified that he put his left foot on the second step whereupon his right toe caught in the edging of the first step and caused him to fall and suffer the injuries of which he complains.</p>

According to his testimony he could see approximately a foot and one-half above the landing and saw appellant reel or stagger, stop for a period of 30 seconds or so, and then collapse and fall. This testimony was substantially corroborated by a patron of the bar who observed the fall in a mirror behind the bar. Both witnesses testified that appellant smelled of alcohol when they went to give him aid. The doctor who treated appellant when he first arrived at the hospital testified unequivocally that appellant was under the influence of alcohol.</p>

The hotel manager testified that the steps had been newly covered in October, 1951 — seven months before the accident — with a dark material and this testimony was corroborated by the manager of the firm which had installed the covering who also stated that he had examined the steps prior to trial and found them in excellent condition. In addition, a former chief of the McKeesport police force, one of the two police officers who visited the premises in response to an emergency call on the night of the accident, testified that he had examined the steps and found them lighted and in good condition.</p>

The jury returned a money verdict in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant company moved for a new trial and judgment n.o.v. Before the Court could pass upon these motions, the court stenographer who had reported the trial died, leaving his notes untranscribed. Since apparently no one else could read the deceased reporter’s shorthand, the Court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered a new trial which resulted, this time, in a verdict for the defendant. The Trial Court ordered a new trial and, in affirming that order for a new trial, we said: “It was no fault of the plaintiff that the dead hand of the deceased reporter wiped away the verdict which he had legitimately Avon. The trial of a laAvsuit is not a game or gamble with either side gaining fortuitous advantages not based on legal principle or equitable consideration. The courtroom is not a gridiron Avhere a fumble can be seized by the opposite side and, regardless of intrinsic merit, go on to score a victory Avith it. As the matter now stands, tAVO juries, considering practically the same evidence, have brought in contrary A7er diets. The learned Trial Judge concluded that in this state of affairs, conscience and duty required him to order a new trial. He said : ‘If the trial court has a vieAV, amounting to a conviction, that justice has not been done, that tribunal has a remedy which it should not hesitate to apply.

The jury returned a money verdict in favor of the plaintiff, and this Court, refusing judgment n.o.v. or a new trial, affirmed the judgment. In the course of affrming the judgment, Justice von Moschzisker made an observation, not determinative of the issue, which I thought illustrative of the responsibility devolving upon the Trial Judge in the <em>Walters </em>case where the court stenographer died, and I quoted it.</p>
    <p id="b315-5" data-blocks='[["BL_315.5",315,[240,1602,1147,580]]]'>The <em>Walters </em>case, therefore, in its astronomical distance from the issue involved here, is scarcely authority for the case at hand where the new trial was ordered, not by the Judge who presided over the trial, but by two Judges, able and conscientious as they are, who never saw the witnesses, did not hear a word of the testimony, and are no closer to the case than we are. Thus, if a new trial is to be granted, it is to be granted not on any theory that an appellate court should uphold the decision of the Trial Judge who heard the case.</p>

In that case the plaintiff sued in assumpsit to recover damages because of the defendant partnership’s alleged breach of an oral contract whereby the partnership was permitted to dig and remove fill from land of the plaintiff at so much per cubic yard with the further understanding and agreement that any rock encountered in the operation would be removed by the defendants and that the digging would be done in such a manner that, when completed, the surface of the ground would be left in a smooth and even grade. The partnership consisted of Francis A. Canuso and Francis A. Canuso, Jr., trading and doing business as Francis A. Canuso and Son. After issue had been joined, Francis A. Canuso, Sr., died, and at the ensuing trial the plaintiff offered himself as a witness. The defendant objected, citing the Dead Man’s Rule. The Court allowed the plaintiff to testify and the plaintiff recovered a verdict. The Trial Court granted a new trial on the ground that, one of the parties of the defendant firm having died, the plaintiff was an incompetent witness under the Act of 1887 and should not, therefore, have been permitted to testify. Other reasons had been assigned for a neAV trial but the Trial Court did not touch upon those reasons. We affirmed the order for the new trial. Insofar as the issue before this Court in the current case is concerned, the <em>Mozino </em>case is <em>generale nihil cerium implicat. </em>The only possible similarity betAveen the <em>Mozino </em>case and this case is that they both had judges and juries.</p>

    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[226,450,1150,1191]]]'>The Majority Opinion in the case at bar says: <em>“It is abundantly clear that the court en banc proceeded upon the theory that the verdict in favor of appellant was against the loeight of the evidence; </em>that being so, the court then concluded that the interests of justice required a new trial.” (Italics in original) This Court has today affirmed a new trial on the basis of this statement. It was not always thus. In 1951, when the writer of this Dissenting Opinion was a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, he ordered a new trial in the case of <em>Carroll v. Pittsburgh, </em><a href="/pa/368/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="368 Pa. 436" data-case-ids="1230343" data-case-paths="/pa/368/0436-01">368 Pa. 436</a>, because he believed that the verdict in favor of the appellant <em>was against the weight of the evidence and that, therefore, the interests of justice required a new trial. </em>This Court, upon hearing argument, reading briefs and record, reversed the order granting a new trial, asserting: <em>“It would therefore seem clear that there was a palpable abuse of discretion in the court’s granting a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the evidence (meaning presumably the weight of the evidence) and that in the interest of justice a new trial should be had.”</em>
