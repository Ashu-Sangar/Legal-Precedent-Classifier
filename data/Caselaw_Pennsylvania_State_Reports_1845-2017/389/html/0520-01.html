Under this will he created a <em>primary </em>trust of $300,000 for two relatives and their descendants and then created a <em>secondary </em>trust of which his residuary estate was the corpus and two grandnieces were the principal beneficiaries. Under the latter trust the income was payable to the two grandnieces for life, with succeeding life estates in their issue; the principal was to be distributed to such of their issue as should be living twenty-one years after the death of the survivor of the two grandnieces and/or such of their children as might be living at the time the testator died; in default of lineal descendants, the testator provided for cross remainders and gifts over to the primary trust.

      <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>The term “annuity” is difficult of definition. The classic definition of an “annuity” is that of Sir Edward Coke: “Coke, whose definition has, substantially, been adopted by all the text writers (2 Blacks. 40; 3 Kent, 460; Addison on Contracts, 982; 2 Williams on Executors, 885; &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.) says (Co. Litt., 144 b.), ‘an annuity is a yearly payment of a certain sum of money granted to another in fee for life, or years, charging the person of the grantor only’ ”: <em>Bayard’s </em>Estate, 7 DR. 279, 281. At common law a yearly sum charged on the person of the grantor was an “annuity”; however, an annual payment charged on land was a “rent charge” and a sum payable annually by trustees was not an “annuity”. It must be recalled that the common law “annuity” was created not by will, but rather by deed or by contract: therefore, the classic definition of an “annuity” does not encompass an “annuity” created by a will or trust.</p>
    <p id="b547-4" data-blocks='[["BL_547.4",547,[169,1336,1148,596]]]'>In <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Beisel, <a href="/pa/338/0519-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="338 Pa. 519" data-case-ids="1199911" data-case-paths="/pa/338/0519-01">338 Pa. 519</a>, 521, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20A.2d%20419" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 A.2d 419">13 A. 2d 419</a>, former Chief Justice Stern very aptly defined an “annuity” as a “. . . term somewhat loosely used in financial and legal nomenclature and is perhaps incapable of exact definition. Generally speaking, it designates a right — bequeathed, donated or purchased— to receive fixed, periodical payments, either for life or a number of years. Its determining characteristic is that the annuitant has an interest only in the payments themselves and not in any principal fund or source from which they may be derived”.</p>
    <p id="b547-5" data-blocks='[["BL_547.5",547,[169,1945,1146,428]]]'>The distinction between income and an “annuity” was described in <em>Ex Parte McComb, </em>4 Bradf. (N.Y.) 151: “There is a distinction between income and an annuity. The former embraces only the net profits after deducting all necessary expenses and charges (and may be uncertain in amount) ; the latter is a fixed amount directed to be paid absolutely and without contingency”.</p>

Adopting the definition that an “annuity” is a right “to receive fixed, periodical payments, either for life or a number of years” it does not necessarily follow that <em>every </em>“annuity” is payable out of corpus or income in subsequent years in the event that the income for a particular year or years becomes deficient for payment of the “annuity”. There is no magic in the word “annuity”, although some courts attach to the definition of an “annuity” the method for or the source of its payment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Whether a particular bequest is an “annuity” or a “gift of income” may be determinative of the quantum of the bequest, yet only a construction and interpretation of the will or the trust will decide the manner of payment of the bequest in the event that the income becomes deficient for the purpose.</p>

To paraphrase testator’s intent as gleaned from the words employed by him in the second codicil: I (the testator) have already on this day modified my will by another codicil which provides that Miss Barck receive a bequest to be paid out of income from the secondary trust; I now further modify my will by providing that, in addition to Miss Barck’s bequest, and after it has been paid out of the income, I direct that Mrs. Harris <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>be paid a monthly sum of One Thousand Dollars ($1000.) out of the income and that whatever income is left after paying these two bequests shall be distributed as I have directed the income to be distributed under the Third Paragraph of my will. In line with the well established rule of construction which requires that we render every word of a will operative <em>(Brennan’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/324/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="324 Pa. 410" data-case-ids="1171348" data-case-paths="/pa/324/0410-01">324 Pa. 410</a>, 415, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20160" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="188 A. 160">188 A. 160</a>) such a construction as we thus place on the second codicil renders operative each word of the second codicil.</p>
    <p id="b552-4" data-blocks='[["BL_552.4",552,[246,915,1148,1244]]]'>Appellant urges that by the testator’s employment of the word “only” he negatived any intent that the bequest to Mrs. Harris be paid exclusively out of income. As we read the second codicil the word “only” qualifies the clause “as directed in the Third clause of my said Will” and not the clause “balance of income”. Furthermore, the words “annuity” or “annuities” do not appear either in the will or codicils: no mention of “principal” occurs in either codicil; outside of an expressed directtion that Miss B arch’s bequest be paid out of income and a clearly implied, if not expressed, direction that Mrs. Harris’ bequest be paid out of income, the codicils are eloquently silent on a source of payment other than income. This obviously carefully drawn will and codicil express no intent that the testator intended any invasion of the corpus of the trust to make up the arrearages in the event either or both the bequests were unable to be paid, either partially or fully, from income. The record is barren of any evidence which discloses that Mrs. Harris occupied a status among the objects of testator’s bounty in any way superior to that of the relatives expressly provided for under the terms of the trust.</p>

In the <em>MacMackin </em>case an invasion of principal was permitted because of a combination of factors: — -the bequests were termed “annuities”, the testator’s intent, gathered from the provisions of his will, was that the payment of the bequests was not restricted to income and the persons receiving the bequests were the principal objects of testator’s bounty. Particularly important is the language of Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Jones speaking for this court in the <em>MacMackin </em>case: “The appellant . . . stresses and relies wholly upon the fact that, in making the bequests of the annual sums to the individuals named in the will, the testator spoke, in that connection, of payment ‘from the income’ or ‘out of the income’ of the trust estate. If that were the <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>extent of the decedent’s testamentary words and intendment with respect to the character of the bequests, it would at once have to be conceded that they carried with them no more than a right to participate pro tanto in distributions of income annually derived from the trust estate and that, therefore, they were not annuities in the strict legal signification of that term”.

He urged that such evidence was appropriate-to show ‘the relations of the parties’ and the ‘many facts with respect to their own needs and financial status on or around the time the will and codicils were drawn.’ Testimony was offered and received, subject to a timely objection, with grant of exception. I now rule that the parol evidence is inadmissible since there is no latent ambiguity in the will and codicils. Moreover, while the testimony was proffered to evince the surrounding-circumstances showing testator’s relation to the beneficiaries, their condition or necessities, it went far afield of that category by the inclusion of oral declarations of the testator and thus its main import was to impute and contradict the terms of the will. What was said by Mr. Justice Allen M. Stearns, speaking for the Supreme Court in Wahr Estate, <a href="/pa/370/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="370 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1234518" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0382-01">370 Pa. 382</a>, 387, is ap<a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>propriate here: ‘We agree with the learned court below that parol evidence is inadmissible to explain, construe or contradict the terms of a will, for which principle no citation of authority is necessary.7 As for the documentary evidence— records in other estates — showing that testator’s two grandnieces had come into substantial inheritances of their own — this, too, although viewed in the light of surrounding circumstances, gives forth no aid to the claimant who contends that Ethel Heberton Harris was in fact an ‘annuitant’. Such extrinsic evidence but places one in the ‘testator’s armchair’ at the time he executed his will, as well as the codicils of October 25, 1928, including also the codicil of July 4, 1929, if not also up to the time of his death— when his will and codicils speak — with complete and full realization that, despite any independent financial means of his two grandnieces, testator was content to still benefit his said grandnieces and their descendants, and nowise manifested an intent that Helen Elizabeth Barck and Ethel Heberton Harris should be the sole objects of his bounty.”</blockquote>
