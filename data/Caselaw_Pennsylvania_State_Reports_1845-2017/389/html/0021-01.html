Appellant agreed to obtain steel ingots for Rockwell and then secure the services of a rolling mill to convert these ingots into steel sheets. In return Rockwell agreed to pay appellant a commission of $35.00 a ton for the finished product. Appellant obtained the requisite ingots and then attempted to secure rolling time from appellee Bethlehem Steel Company<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> for the necessary conversion into steel sheets. Bethlehem refused to roll the ingots, giving as its reason its policy against entering into any conversion agreement in which middlemen were involved. Rockwell then cancelled its agreement with appellant which cancellation is essentially the basis for all three subsequent appeals — the initial and the two present appeals — to this court.</p>

No authorities need be cited for the proposition that any. evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant to the issues of the case. And, as the court below stated: “It is well established that in order to grant a new trial on the basis of after-discovered evidence, the evidence must have been discovered since the trial and be such as could not have been obtained at the trial by the use of reasonable diligence; it must not be simply cumulative or merely to impeach the credibility of a witness.

    <p id="b49-4" data-blocks='[["BL_49.4",49,[217,455,1147,482]]]'>However, appellant seeks to fit still a different string to his bow. Our understanding of appellant’s position is that the after-discovered evidence became unnecessary in the court below because, by Rockwell’s alleged admission that Bethlehem’s policy against dealing through middlemen was irrelevant and immaterial, “the sole basis for the judgment n.o.v. had been eliminated, leaving the Court no alternative but to vacate it.”</p>
    <p id="b49-5" data-blocks='[["BL_49.5",49,[215,956,1149,1032]]]'>The answer to this contention by appellant is plainly and simply that Rockwell admitted no such thing. In its answer to appellant’s petition for a new trial because of after-discovered evidence Rockwell repeatedly asserted that the <em>reason </em>for Bethlehem’s refusal to roll appellant’s ingots is irrelevant and immaterial; that the whole crux of the case in assumpsit is Bethlehem’s refusal to deal through an intermediary regardless of its reasons therefor and appellant’s consequent inability to perform his part of the agreement. By what can only be termed obtuse reasoning appellant has seized upon these averments to argue that Rockwell has admitted and agrees that the <em>policy </em>— not Bethlehem’s <em>reasons for the policy </em>— is irrelevant and immaterial. Appellant has misconstrued the plain meaning of Rockwell’s language and has gone on to reason that the judgment n.o.v. and this court’s affirmance of that judgment n.o.v. was based on a ground that Rockwell now admits to be false.</p>
    <p id="b49-6" data-blocks='[["BL_49.6",49,[215,2009,1147,378]]]'>We conclude that Rockwell used the best defense available to it in this action in assumpsit and that appellant has fallen far short of proving, either by his “after-discovered” evidence, or by his claim that Rockwell now admits its defense in this case heretofore was false, that “the lower court erred in not holding that a fraud upon the court had been perpetrated.”</p>

The finality and conclusiveness of the original judgment cannot be affected by a petition for new trial filed 17 months thereafter and subsequent to the affirmance of that judgment by this court. And, as Rockwell aptly points out in its brief, appellant’s petition for a new <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>trial was denied and his appeal from that order does not operate as a supersedeas.</p>

Appellant demands the same recovery in this action ($164,500) that he demanded in the prior action. The only difference is that in the instant action he also claims exemplary damages. Appellant would inevitably call the same witnesses and present exactly the same evidence in this second action. In such a situation this court must pierce the technical differences between the two actions, and having done so of necessity find that beneath the camouflage net of the second action stands the first — the identical action which was previously litigated to the fullest extent.</p>

Ed. 1009</a>, it was said: “It is a principle of general elementary law that the estoppel of a judgment must be mutual. [citing cases] .... An apparent exception to this rule of mutuality had been held to exist where the liability of the defendant is altogether dependent upon the culpability of one exonerated in a prior suit, upon the same facts when sued by the same plaintiff.” The court then cited <em>Portland Gold Mining Co. v. Stratton’s Independence, </em><a href="/f/158/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="158 F. 63" data-case-ids="6749937" data-case-paths="/f/158/0063-01">158 F. 63</a>, 68, wherein it was said: “. . . it is settled by repeated decisions that the general rule that one may not have the benefit of a judgment as an estoppel unless he would have been bound by it had it been the other way is subject to recognized exceptions, one of which is that in actions of tort, such as trespass, if the defendant’s responsibility is necessarily dependent upon the culpability of another, who was the immediate actor, and who, in an action against him by the same plaintiff for the same act, has been adjudged not culpable, the defendant may have the benefit of that judgment as an estoppel, even though he would not have been bound by it had it been the other way. And we think it could not well be otherwise, for, when the plaintiff has litigated direetly with <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>the immediate actor the claim that he was culpable, and, upon the full opportunity thus afforded for its legal investigation, the claim has been adjudged against the plaintiff, there is manifest propriety, and no injustice, in holding that he is thereby concluded from making it the basis of a right of recovery from another who is not otherwise responsible. To such a case the maxim, ‘Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium,’ may well be applied.” Much the same reasoning, in which we agree “There is manifest propriety, and no injustice”, was also used in <em>Bruszewski v. United States, </em><a href="/f2d/181/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="181 F.2d 419" data-case-ids="1246864" data-case-paths="/f2d/181/0419-01">181 F. 2d 419</a>, and <em>Adriaanse v.

Apparently, according to appellant’s reasoning, the statute will never begin to run until appellees have either lost, surrendered or compromised their defenses in any action appellant chooses to bring against them. Assuming, <em>purely arguendo, </em>that a conspiracy did exist, we are utterly at a loss to understand how such conspiracy could conceivably be considered to have “continued” for this length of time. <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>A conspiracy is actionable only when it produces an overt act which injures the complaining party and the lower court properly held that the only overt act alleged by appellant was the cancellation by Rockwell of its agreement with appellant. The sole basis for appellant’s claim for damages is that act and that act alone. No authority need be cited for the proposition that in such a situation no continuing trespass is shown. The lower court committed no error in holding that this action is barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

In the instant case, however, Bethlehem was made <em>codefendant </em>of Rockwell, Rockwell was the sole defendant in the original case, and Bethlehem’s responsibility is entirely dependent upon Rockwell’s culpability which, as we have already seen, -was proven nonexistent in the prior ease. It will readily be seen that the instant controversy presents a stronger basis for the application of the doctrine of the Restatement than do either of the cited cases or any of the earlier cases which apparently contemplate an exception to the doctrine of mutuality of estoppel only where the relation between the defendants in the two suits has been that of principal and agent, master and servant, or indemnitor and indemnities. In fact, the instant case is much closer on its facts to <em>Slater v. Slater, </em>supra, where, in the second action an additional defendant was named because she and the defendant in the original action held property as tenants by the entire-ties. This court held that the first action determined the identical issue presented by the second action, the mere addition of a codefendant was not sufficient to defeat the defense of res judicata by the original defendant and the plaintiff was also barred from proceeding against the codefendant.</p>
