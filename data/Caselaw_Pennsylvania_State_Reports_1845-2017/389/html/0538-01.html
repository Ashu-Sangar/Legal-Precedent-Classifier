Appellant points out that the recount of votes in the two precincts ordered by the Court on November 21st must have still been in progress on November 28th because on that date the Court had by a written order permitted the work of computation to be transferred from one location to another; also, since the Court on November 29th had granted the petitions to open these boxes the Court was therefore precluded from refusing to direct the Board to cor<a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>rect its returns. However, appellant ignores the uncontradicted evidence which clearly shows that the computation had in fact been completed on November 23, 1956 and that the prohibition prescribed in the statute after the expiration of the five day period of limitation is directed not to the court’s action in opening the boxes but rather in directing a correction of the returns by the Board.</p>
