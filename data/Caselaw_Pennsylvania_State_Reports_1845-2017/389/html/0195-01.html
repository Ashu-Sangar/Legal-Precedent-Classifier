The question of the liquidating value of the plaintiff’s stock, which the'defendants have latterly tried to inject, was not' an issue before us. In fact, liquidation of the corporation Avas not begun until some time after the record on the former appeal had been returned to the court below.</p>

The delay in payment for the plaintiff’s stock interest is largely attributable to his excessive estimate of the fair value of his stock Avhich he persisted in demanding.</p>
