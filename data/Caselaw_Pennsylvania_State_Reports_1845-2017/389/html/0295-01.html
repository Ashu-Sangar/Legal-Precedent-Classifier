The late Mr. Justice Sutherland, at pp. 386-388, stated: “Building zone laws are of modern origin. They began in this country about twenty-five years ago. Until recent years, urban life was comparatively simple; but with the great increase and concentration of population, problems have developed, and constantly are deAreloping, which require, and will continue to require, additional restrictions in respect of the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>use and occupation of private lands in urban communities. . . . Such regulations are sustained, under the complex conditions of our day, for reasons analogous to those which justify traffic regulations, which, before the advent of automobiles and rapid transit street railways, would have been condemned as fatally arbitrary and unreasonable . . .</p>

The line which in this field separates the legitimate from the illegitimate assumption of power is not capable of precise delimitation. It varies with circumstances and conditions. <em>A regulatory zoning ordinance, which would be clearly valid as applied to the great cities, might be clearly invalid as applied to rural communities . . . </em>Thus the question whether the power exists to forbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for a particular use, ... is to be determined, not by an abstract consideration of the building or of the thing considered apart, but by considering it in connection with the circumstances and the locality.” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

Regulation under a proper exercise of police power is due process, even though a property in whole or in part is taken or destroyed . . . Likewise, there should be a reasonable and substantial relation between the thing acted on and the end to be attained, one that promotes health, safety or general welfare, necessary to the common good, and a reasonable demand for regulation, not one that is merely an <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>unnecessary ‘experimentation [or interference] with the fundamental rights of the individual’: Truax v.
