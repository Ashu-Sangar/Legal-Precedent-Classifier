    <p id="b82-9" data-blocks='[["BL_82.11",82,[237,1371,1147,759]]]'>An action of trespass for personal injuries arising out of a collision between a street car and an automobile was brought by Troy, a passenger on the street car, against both the Pittsburgh Railways Company, and Kiggins, the operator of the automobile. Kiggins, in turn, brought suit against the Railways Company for damage to his automobile. The actions were consolidated for trial, and the jury returned verdicts in favor of both plaintiffs against the Railways Company, and for Kiggins as defendant in Troy’s suit. From judgments of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, <em>en banc, </em>refusing the defendant Railways Company’s motions for judgments n.o.v. and new trials in the two actions, these appeals are taken.</p>
