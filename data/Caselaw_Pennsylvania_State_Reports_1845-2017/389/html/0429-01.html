During these negotiations the Authority sought to purchase 140 acres of appellants’ tract. When negotiations for the purchase of these 140 acres failed to accomplish their <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>purpose the Authority instituted eminent domain proceedings to acquire the <em>entire </em>tract.</p>

The basis of appellants’ complaint was that the extent of land sought to be acquired was far in excess of the Authority’s requirements for the construction and maintenance of a water reservoir and that the proposed taking by the Authority constituted an abuse of its discretion and was arbitrary and capricious in nature. The Authority filed an answer averring that the <em>entire </em>tract was necessary for the proper construction, maintenance and operation of an impounding reservoir and denying that its action constituted an abuse of discretion or was arbitrary or capricious. After a hearing, the court below dismissed appellants’ equity action. Exceptions filed thereto were later dismissed and this appeal ensued.</p>

This reservoir is to be located in the Service Creek area in Raccoon and Independence Toavuships in Beaver County. In fulfillment of that purpose the Authority has been acquiring land in that area and <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>the Authority, by eminent domain proceedings, sought to acquire appellants’ entire farm. Under the Authority’s plan the center of appellants’ land (approximately 61 acres) will be occupied by a portion of the reservoir itself and the northern and southern portions of appellants’ land (approximately 128 acres) would serve as a protective area for the reservoir.</p>
    <p id="b455-3" data-blocks='[["BL_455.4",455,[188,727,1157,1307]]]'>We must bear in mind that in acquiring land for the purpose of an impounding reservoir for the storage of water for human consumption something more is needed than the absolute control of the water basin up to the maximum flood water stage. Throughout the entire watershed surface water will drain and find its way into the actual area of the reservoir. It is common knowledge that surface water carries with it many impurities and waste matter, even sewage in some instances; such deleterious matter if carried into the reservoir and the water supply may well become a menace to the health and well-being of the water consumers. Any supplier of water must keep a strict and vigilant watch not only over the reservoir itself but also over the avenues of approach thereto from the watershed for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the dangers that arise from the intake of surface water coming down from the watershed. To this end a careful supplier of water will acquire land necessary not only for the actual impounding of the water but also for a protective area for the water thus impounded. The provision of such a protective area will insure, so far as possible, the purity of the water destined for human needs.</p>

Appellants argue that because in the course of negotiations the Authority desired to acquire only 140 acres rather than 189 acres, such fact indicates that the Authority did not need the entire tract; such a conclusion is a non sequitur and provides no basis for an inference that the whole tract is not presently necessary for the purpose for which it was condemned. Appellants’ contention that since the Authority failed to acquire certain other lands in the immediate neighborhood its action in condemning appellants’ farm was oppressive and arbitrary has been fully answered by the court below: “. . . failure of the Authority to acquire those properties [other lands near the reservoir] at the present time by reason of lack of funds, or any other reason, does not deprive the Authority of the right to acquire the property of the plaintiffs for the purpose of minimizing pollution by silt, algae or erosion.” An engineer called by appellants admitted that to insure full protection from contamination of the water supply would require taking of the entire area.</p>
