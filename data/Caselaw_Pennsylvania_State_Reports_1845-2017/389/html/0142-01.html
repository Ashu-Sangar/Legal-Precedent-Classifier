Unfortunately, the conduct of this case reflects unfavorably upon both counsel and tends to bring upon our administration of justice tbe condemnation of litigants. Tbe procrastination on tbe part of tbe attorneys and tbe multitudinous delays which have marked tbe course of this litigation over tbe past half dozen years are glaringly apparent from even a casual reading of the record. Tbe court below should take corrective measures to prevent a re-occurrence of such situations in the future.</p>
