The questions of negligence and contributory negligence were vigorously contested. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $22,000. Plaintiff sought a new trial because of alleged errors in the charge of the Court, and because the verdict was inadequate. A new trial was refused. Plaintiff has appealed from the judgment entered on the verdict.</p>

For about a month after the accident he was treated by his family physician, Dr. McDivitt, for shock and pain in the lower back and lumbar region. From <em>March 27, 1952 </em>until <em>October 1952, Dr. Steele, </em>an orthopedic surgeon, treated the plaintiff, prescribing heat and massage and the use of a belt. In October 1952, Dr. Steele took a myelogram, i.e., an X-ray of the spinal cord, which disclosed that plaintiff was suffering from a ruptured intervertebral disc. Dr. Steele subsequently recommended surgery. On January 23, 1953, an operation for this condition was performed upon plaintiff at the Veterans’ Administration Hospital in Aspinwall. Plaintiff was discharged from the hospital on <em>January 31, 1953. </em>Although he sought no further medical care until <em>January 1955, </em>he testified that he continued to have severe pain in his lower back and right leg after April 1953.</p>

A second myelogram was taken and Dr. Faix concluded that either all of the disc had not been removed during the operation in January 1953, or a recurrent disc had formed. Dr. McCabe testified that plaintiff had suffered permanent injury to his nervous system which would cause him severe pain throughout the rest of his life.

As I survey the panorama of the law, one of those contentions is of superlative importance. Because of this Court’s failure to discuss this certain feature of the case, judges may continue to charge juries on a standard which does not represent realities and, as a consequence, many unjust verdicts may hover on the horizon of future lawsuits.</p>

I do not say that the Trial Judge in this case, who is a very able, experienced and conscientious jurist, erred when he charged in the manner indicated, since he was duly following what was said by this Court in <em>Windle v. Davis, </em><a href="/pa/275/0023-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="275 Pa. 23" data-case-ids="1075704" data-case-paths="/pa/275/0023-01">275 Pa. 23</a>, 29, namely: “the interest must be computed at the lawful rate of six per cent.” A duty devolves on this Court, however, to overrule <em>Windle v. Davis, </em>and, in doing so, grant a new trial because the plaintiff was subjected to the outdated standard announced therein. We should retire <em>Windle v. Davis </em>because it proclaims a financial criterion which has long ago been repudiated on the Rialto. There was a time, of course, Avhen money Avas a very lively plant in a fertile soil. It only had to be Avatered with reasonable care and it would bloom with 6% and even higher rates of interest. In 1929 that plant suffered a blight from Avhich it never thoroughly recovered. To speak today of 6% on bank deposits and other guaranteed, safe investments is to indulge in day-dreaming. Today it takes exceeding financial skill or extraordinary luck to produce a <em>6% </em>ipso facto return on a given investment, and it is contrary to all demonstrated fact to assume that the average plaintiff in a personal injuries case possesses unusual talents in financial divination. Nor is it in keeping with our concept of fair dealing to subject him to the law of chance in obtaining Avhat is his by operation of the laAV of the land.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.4",92,[234,1888,1146,431]],["BL_93.1",93,[220,340,1147,266]]]'>I regard it as unfair, unjust, and inequitable to take from an injured man’s verdict an amount equivalent to 6 <em>°/o </em>when at most he might get only a return of 2 or <em>3% </em>on his investment.

The Trial Court instructed the jury: “. . . Of course he Avould only be entitled to reimbursement for his net earnings. I mean by that the amount of money he would have use of for himself and his family. Now we didn’t go into details here because most of you people are family people and you knoAV how much income tax you pay and how much is deducted from your pay envelope or your contribution you paid to Social Security. So you have a pretty good idea if a man is earning $3947 a year, has a wife and three children, even though there would be 10 per cent of that deducted by his employer he may get a refund. I don’t know. They didn’t go into figures on that and you Avill have to use your common sense on that but he wouldn’t be entitled to what he never would have gotten when you are figuring wages.

    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[235,449,1145,600]]]'>To suggest to the jury deduction for income tax and social security payments is clearly erroneous. What a man receives in a verdict for a broken leg, a crippled hand, a smashed pelvis, or any other damage done to his physical machine, which is the very generating power for wages, income, and profit, is clearly not taxable. A verdict is not income, it is replacement of flesh, bone and blood; it is giving back to a man what was his; it is restoring to the safe deposit of his being the wealth of health, energy, and motive power taken from him by the person required to pay the verdict.</p>

As matters stand now, should judges charge that juries should whittle down verdicts by 6%. Should they direct that juries reduce verdicts on account of income tax and social security? Should they charge on take-home pay? They cannot possibly know with definitive accuracy about these things because this Court, while it has considered these vital matters, had decided it unnecessary to discuss them.</p>

Sherman, the plaintiff, was injured in an automobile accident, legal responsibility for which was fixed against the defendant Manufacturers Light and Heat Company by a jury trial which resulted in a ver<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>diet for the plaintiff in the sum of $22,000. At the time of the accident the plaintiff was 27 years of age, weighed 175 pounds, stood 8 feet in height, worked as a railway motorman, enjoyed excellent health, and participated in vigorous athletics. Since the mishap which overtook him on February 12, 1952, he has lost 45 pounds in weight and has deteriorated into semi-invalidism, spending time in hospitals and undergoing continuing medical treatment. Unable to return to his former employment he tried to earn a living at four successive different jobs but in each instance could not physically carry on. Dr. William S. McCabe testified that as a result of the accident the plaintiff is unable to lift his right leg (“cannot get it off the ground”), that he has a %" atrophy in the right leg 5" below the knee and a <em>1" </em>atrophy of the same leg 5" above the knee; that the muscles have withered away at these points; that there is an impairment to the nerve supply in his right leg; that the quadricep groups of muscles in the leg “have been knocked out”; and that he experiences excruciating pains because of damage to the sciatic nerve. A myelogram performed in October, 1952 revealed that the plaintiff suffered from a herniated intervertebral disc, between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. He was hospitalized and underwent surgery for an attempted correction of this condition. Discharged from the hospital on January 31, 1953, he was re-hospitalized in April, 1953 because of a threatened nervous breakdown. On May 13, 1955, another myelogram revealed, according to Dr. McCabe, “a definite defect in the right hand anterior spinal canal region at L-4 which must be presumed to be a recurrent ruptured disc deformity. There are probably adhesions also at the tip of the caudal sac.” Although this deformity could possibly respond to further surgery, another operation has not been decided upon because the <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>patient has not, it is averred, yet entirely readjusted from the results of the first operation.</p>

Dr. McCabe testified that the plaintiff “has got to learn to live with his pain now.” Describing his routine at home, the plaintiff himself testified: “At home I have to use heat and no walking around or doing anything at all. I have to lie down all the time. Practically the only time I am allowed out on my feet is in the afternoon, he said, ‘If you feel like it, if you like to go for a little walk, take a walk up to the corner,’ but he said, ‘Mostly stay on your back.’ And I also have to use heat at home plus he gives me medication to help kill the pain a little bit so you don’t feel like you are going to blow your top every time you go to move.”</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[267,1229,1146,652]]]'>Dr. Philip A. Faix testified: “Q. Does he have pain? A. Marked pain. Q. Will you describe that pain? A. And we have to give him fairly marked opiates to give him any relief. Generally, we have tried several things, but we have been giving him empirin with codeine, a grain and a half and he usually takes four, five to six of them a day and that is a fairly good indication of the severity of his discomfort and pain. Q. I believe you mentioned some pain in the right leg? ... A. The pain in the right leg here comes from the distribution of the sciatic nerve which Doctor McCabe has so beautifully described and it has been persistent and severe.”</p>

So he would have a partial loss of future earning power based on his past record of earning power, his ability to earn.”</p>

Since the defendant contended that the plaintiff’s physical troubles stemmed from tuberculosis of the spine, unconnected with trauma, and that he would be able to resume a normal occupation in two or three years, it thus became a question of fact for the jury whether the plaintiff’s disability was or was not the result of the accident for which the defendant was responsible, and, if so, for what period of time his disablement would continue. The plaintiff maintains in this appeal that the Trial Judge in his charge to the jury assumed as established fact that the plaintiff was only partially or temporarily disabled and, with that erroneous assumption, the plaintiff was thus denied the expression of his full claim which was for damages based on total and permanent disability.</p>

    <p id="b99-6" data-blocks='[["BL_99.6",99,[196,1391,1148,375]]]'>(1) The Majority states the plaintiff “had worked on numerous occasions after the accident.” ' This does not prove that the plaintiff is not <em>now </em>totally and permanently disabled. It only shows that the plaintiff honestly tried to Avork time after time. He tried four successive jobs and had to leave each one of them because of his disability!</p>
    <p id="b99-7" data-blocks='[["BL_99.7",99,[195,1780,1147,263]]]'>(2) The plaintiff earned $2,000 prior to the trial. A total of $2,000 for three years for a man who was earning $3,000 per year prior to his accident is indication in itself of grave physical disability, Avhen Ave know that the plaintiff made every effort to Avork.</p>
    <p id="b99-8" data-blocks='[["BL_99.8",99,[194,2057,1147,261]],["BL_100.1",100,[247,329,1148,486]]]'>(3) The Majority states that the plaintiff’s “own doctor testified for defendant that he could do ordinary work in tAVO or three years.” The doctor referred to is Hr. Steele Avho treated the plaintiff for several months in the year 1953 and then did not see the plaintiff for <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>four years! Even so, when he was asked at the trial when he expected the plaintiff could return to an ordinary job, he did not reply definitively and with assurance, as the Majority Opinion seeks to convey he did. He replied as follows: “Well, <em>that is pretty hard to prognosticate because you can’t hnow what turn these things are going to tahe at all times </em>but I don’t see any reason why in two or three years he should not be able to.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[244,827,1149,428]]]'>(4) The plaintiff’s doctor stated: “I don’t believe that he could do any type of work that would require a great deal of physical activity.” How does the Majority come to the conclusion from this statement— that the doctor believes the plaintiff can not do <em>any </em>type of work which requires a great deal of physical activity — proves the plaintiff’s disability is not total and permanent?</p>
    <p id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[243,1269,1146,308]]]'>It will be recalled that I quoted earlier in this Dissenting Opinion that the doctor testified that the plaintiff would not be able to do any work which required bending, or much standing, sitting, or walking. If that is not evidence of permanent and total disability, we need another definition of that term.</p>
    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.6",100,[243,1598,1146,152]]]'>The Majority Opinion makes other assertions which I have considered but which I do not deem necessary to discuss — since they answer themselves.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b100-7" data-blocks='[["BL_100.7",100,[313,1763,919,33]]]'>Mr. Justice Arnold concurs in this Dissent.</p>
