It is difficult, if not impossible, to believe that the Legislature attempted to differentiate between permanently disabled firemen on the basis of the nature of the injuries received in determining whether compensation should be paid.</p>
    <p id="b590-5" data-blocks='[["BL_590.5",590,[243,1256,1153,865]]]'>The construction we have adopted is in line with the purpose for the enactment not only of the original, but the amendatory acts: to make more attractive to competent persons service in the police and fire departments of our municipalities. As the Superior Court said in <em>Iben v. Monaca Borough, </em>supra, p. 49: “From .this limitation it is reasonable to assume that the best interest of the municipality and not the disabled officer was the prime consideration prompting its enactment. Efficient firemen and police officers must take chances; the performance of their duties are hazardous. The prospect of uninterrupted income during periods of disability well may attract qualified persons to these vocations and proper medical attention assures a reasonably speedy return of a temporarily “disabled policeman or fireman to service essential to the community.”</p>
