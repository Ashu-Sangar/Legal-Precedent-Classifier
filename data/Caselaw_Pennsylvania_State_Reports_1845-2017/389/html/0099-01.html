In March, 1956, they acquired the adjoining building at 2504 Bidge Avenue and applied for a permit to raze the existing three-story building and for a variance to erect thereon a one-story building. A variance was necessary, since the proposed structure would occupy 100% of the lot. This addition was to be used in the expansion of their business as well as to provide personal facilities for their employes.</p>
    <p id="b123-3" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[203,947,1149,484]]]'>The Philadelphia General Code of Ordinances, Sections 14-303 (3), (b) and (g), regulates the “open areas” required for proposed structures in “A” Commercial zones. Subsection (g) requires at least an eight foot rear yard minimum depth, and subsection (b) requires the “open area” to constitute at least 20% of the total square footage of lots. As previously stated, the proposed structure would utilize 100% of the lot, and leave no “open area.”</p>

The Enabling Act expressly granted such power to zone for the purpose of promoting the health, ■safety, morals and general welfare of the community. In a highly commercialized and industrialized society, it is necessary that municipalities have power to regulate “open area” zoning so as to maintain the orderly function of metropolitan living. To declare otherwise would indeed be injurious to the health, safety and welfare of our citizens. It would unnecessarily subject them to the inhalation of noxious odors and gases; overcrowding of certain areas; denial of natural light; restricting the uses of accessible fire lines; impeding street expansion programs; and many other evils too numerous to mention.
