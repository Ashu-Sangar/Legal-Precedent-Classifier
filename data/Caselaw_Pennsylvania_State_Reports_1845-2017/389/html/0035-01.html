These reasons were an anticipated increase of traffic with attendant dangers and hazards to the public, a change in the quiet residential character of the district with a slight depreciation in property values, expense to the township, inadequacy of the site for the school and the availability of another site for the purpose. Was the denial of the application based on these reasons a manifest abuse of discretion or erroneous as a matter of law?</p>
    <p id="b75-7" data-blocks='[["BL_75.7",75,[192,1345,1149,818]],["BL_76.1",76,[268,324,1151,1866]]]'>The court found that the proposed use would increase traffic, which under the circumstances, would create dangers and hazards and be adverse to the public safety. In connection with this finding certain facts must be considered. The ordinance which classifies this area as an “AA” residential district specifically provides that land situated therein may be used for “educational, religious and philanthropic” purposes. The use of the land for <em>any </em>such purpose would naturally result in an increase in traffic and the framers of this ordinance certainly must have taken heed of this factor in the preparation of the ordinance. Further, the ordinance provides that in the same district a public utility building and office, (Section 301 (4)), a telephone central office or an electric-gas utility <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>building (Section 301 (5)), could be erected without any restriction and a municipal building or railway passenger station (Section 301 (6)), could be erected with the consent of the board; <em>any </em>such uses would increase traffic far and above any increase from the use of this site for school purposes. <em>Any </em>traffic increase with its attendant noise, dirt, danger and hazards is unpleasant, yet, such increase is one of the “inevitaable accompaniments of suburban progress and of our constantly expanding population” which, <em>standing alone, </em>does not constitute a sufficient reason to refuse a property owner the legitimate use of his land: <em>Rolling Green Golf Club Case, </em>supra, p. 456. It is not <em>any </em>anticipated increase in traffic which will justify the refusal of a “special exception” in a zoning case. The anticipated increase in traffic must be of such character that it bears a <em>substantial </em>relation to the health and safety of the community. A prevision of the effect of such an increase in traffic must indicate that not only is there a likelihood but a high degree of probability that it will affect the safety and health of the community, and such prevision must be based on evidence sufficient for the purpose. Until such strong degree of probability is evidenced by legally sufficient testimony no court should act in such a way as to deprive a landowner of the otherwise legitimate use of his land. An examination of the instant record fails to reveal evidence sufficient to justify a finding that the anticipated increase in traffic bears any substantial relation to the health and safety of this community or the requisite high degree of probability that such an increase will affect adversely the health and safety of the community. The record merely indicates an anticipated minimal increase of traffic.</p>

What we said in <em>Medinger Appeal, </em>supra, p. 226, is particularly apposite: “We therefore hold that neither aesthetic reasons nor the conservation of property values or the stabilization of economic values in a township are, singly, or combined, sufficient to promote the health or the morals or the safety or the general welfare of the township or its inhabitants or property owners, within the meaning of the enabling Act of 1931, as amended, or under the Constitution of Pennsylvania”. There is nothing in the contemplated use of this site of land by appellant which would depreciate or change the character of this neighborhood any more than would the establishment of any other school, church or philanthropic institution in the district. The conclusion reached in the court below in this respect would exclude <em>any </em>school from this district, a conclusion contrary to the language of the ordinance. No property owner is misled in this respect for every person purchasing a home site or a home in this district does so with notice contained in the ordinance that some day a school, a church or a philanthropic institution might be erected in the neighborhood.</p>

What relationship this factor bears to the standards set forth for granting or refusing a special exception — the health, morals and safety of the community — is beyond comprehension. <em>Any </em>use of this site would affect consequently the township in that it would require the widening of streets, etc. As a matter of fact, appellant has offered of record to assume part of any attendant <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>expense <em>by </em>widening at least a portion of Royal Avenue at its own expense, providing for off-highway parking and placing sidewalks along the main artery of traffic.

Neither reason furnishes an appropriate basis for the denial of this use. The Department of Public Instruction <em>recommends </em>that secondary schools have a minimum area of 10 acres with 1 additional acre for every 100 students of ultimate enrollment over a six year period. Under these recommendations the present school site of 18 acres is inadequate; an adequate site would be 26 acres. Such recommendations are not applicable to the instant situation. They are not requirements, in many instances the record indicates that even public school authorities are not following them and diocesan schools are not under and subject to the Department of Public Instruction. While it is idealistic and visionary to promulgate such recommendations concerning the adequacy of school sites, yet a court is not required to grant its imprimatur to such “ideal” plans when dealing with zoning questions. The availability of another site as a reason for the denial of a proposed use is novel in zoning cases. The fact that appellant owns another site which in the court’s opinion is more suitable is irrelevant. No court is empowered to substitute its judgment for that of a multiple site owner and, in effect, direct which of several sites is to be used by him for a particular purpose. Moreover, both these reasons fall because they were not within the orbit of judicial inquiry in this matter. The <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>grant or refusal of this particular use does not lie within the unfettered discretion of either the board or the courts. Such discretion can only be constitutionally exercised within the standards provided in the ordinance. Unless the proposed use affects adversely the health, safety and morals of the community — the standards controlling the board’s and the court’s discretion — it must be allowed. To refuse a proposed use for a reason which has no substantial relationship to the standards provided by the ordinance is beyond the powers both of the board and the court and such excess of power can be corrected both on broad and narrow certiorari: <em>Dauphin Deposit Trust Company v. Myers, </em><a href="/pa/388/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="388 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1272502" data-case-paths="/pa/388/0444-01">388 Pa. 444</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=130%20A.2d%20686" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="130 A.2d 686">130 A. 2d 686</a>.</p>

Three reasons assigned by the court — the cost to the township, the availability of another site, the inadequacy of the present site — bear no relationship to the only standards which must guide the court in the exercise of its discretion and therefore the court clearly exceeded its powers and abused its discretion in this respect. A fourth reason — the effect on the character of the neighborhood — has already been ruled by this court insufficient: <em>Medinger Appeal, </em>supra. A fifth reason — the anticipated increase in traffic — falls by reason of the fact that the evidence is insufficient to show a high degree of probability that the anticipated increase in traffic will adversely affect the health and safety of the community.</p>
