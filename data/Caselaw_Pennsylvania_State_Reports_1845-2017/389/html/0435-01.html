It has been said that ‘our common school system was not adopted in this State as it exists today, until many years after the Revolution, through the Constitutions of 1776, 1790, and 1838, and the laws recognized its virtually important part in our existence.’ After Thaddeus Stevens’ and Governor Wolf’s famous crusade for education, our schools became an integral part of our governmental system, as a State institution: the Constitution of 1874 fortified it and directed the legislature to maintain a ‘thorough and efficient system of public schools’.

Included among the described and proper means of raising funds and building buildings, is by the device of the municipal authority. There can be no doubt but that any individual school <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>board following tbe prescribed regulations and statutes, would have the power to commit its district to a lease or rental agreement extending, as is customary-today, for a twenty to thirty year period.
