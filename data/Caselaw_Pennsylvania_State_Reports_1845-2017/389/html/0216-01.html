A. §601 et seq., <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Stat.%20246" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="50 Stat. 246">50 Stat. 246</a>, was enacted, as stated therein, to establish and maintain orderly marketing conditions for commodities (including milk and its products) in interstate commerce and provides for marketing agreements exempt from anti-trust laws. Under §608c the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>to issue an order, inter alia, fixing minimum producer prices which all handlers (dealers) shall pay producers for milk in any marketing area where the Secretary believes market conditions warrant such an order to effectuate the purposes of the Act. Any producer or cooperative association may apply for a Federal order and, as was done in this case, submit a proposed form of order. Thereupon the Department of Agriculture conducts an investigation and may hold public hearings with notice to all parties interested at which evidence is presented and briefs thereafter filed and con-proposed form of order or containing different terms, sidered by the Department. An order adopting the conditions, etc., <em>may </em>be recommended by the Secretary. This tentative or recommended order, however, becomes effective only after the approval, separate and apart from any other approval required by the Act, of either a specified number of producers supplying the market (two-thirds or three-fourths thereof depending upon certain circumstances) or those producers who represent the same percentages from a volume standpoint. In the referendum conducted a cooperative association is permitted to cast its vote as a unit for all of its producer-stockholders. This is provided for in subsection (12) of §808c of the Act which reads: “Whenever, pursuant to the provisions of this section, the Secretary is required to determine the approval or disapproval of producers with respect to the issuance of any order, or any term or condition thereof, or the termination thereof, the Secretary shall consider the approval or disapproval by any cooperative association of producers, bona fide engaged in marketing the commodity or product thereof covered by such order, or in rendering services for or advancing the interests of the producers of such commodity, as the approval or disapproval of the producers who are members of, stock<a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>holders in, or under contract with, such cooperative association of producers.”.

Ct. 1019</a>, 1025, stated: “Two cooperatives voted for their members in favor of the amendments to the Order. No poll was- taken of the individual producer members. Nor was there any subsequent approval by them of the action taken on their behalf by the cooperatives. Section 808c (12) directs the Secretary to consider the approval or disapproval of cooperatives as the approval or disapproval of members. This is complete authority for the action of the Secretary. He need not require further referendums by cooperatives themselves. Presumably they will vote with an eye to the best interest of their members.”.</p>

On the other hand in their complaint the appellants claim that the proposed Federal order would be contrary to the best interests of the stockholders of the cooperative and solely benefit certain large dealer,? of milk who are not producers. However, the gravamen of appellants’ complaint is that the director»? of the cooperative cannot commit the corporation to a Federal order without the approval of a majority of the stockholders and the issue presented is not whether the proposed order is advan<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>tageous or disadvantageous to the stockholders<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> — the only question before us, and as to which the briefs and arguments of the parties solely relate, is whether or not appellants can enjoin the defendant cooperative and its board of directors from accepting any Federal marketing order proposed for the Pittsburgh District without first obtaining the approval of a majority of the stockholders.</p>

It is true that a cooperative association has certain features distinguishable from those of a business corporation, a notable one being the contractual relationship which under the Act of 1929 may, and in the case of the defendant cooperative <em>was </em>created between the association and its stockholders. Each of the stockholders executed the written contract above referred to under the terms of which the stockholder, inter alia, agreed “to abide by all of the by-laws and the rules and regulations of the Association” and, without any reservation, to have the association sell and dispose of all milk and cream produced by him to such parties and “by such methods” as the board of directors shall deem to be to the best advantage of the producer. After consideration of the Act of 1929 authorizing the creation of cooperative associations, the by-laws of the defendant cooperative passed pursuant thereto and the contract entered into with it by each producer-stockholder, we agree with the conclusion of the court below that the stockholders have delegated to the board of directors the right and duty of selling their milk in the market by whatever methods the board of directors “shall deem to be to the best advantage of the Producer.” and that the appellee, acting through its board of directors, has the power to approve or disapprove of any Federal order issued by the Secretary of Agriculture without submission of the matter to the producer-stockholders.</p>

But it may be observed that much may be said in support of the holding that appellants’ action was prematurely instituted. No order had been recommended by the Secretary of Agriculture and consequently there was no referendum pending. Indeed the Secretary of Agriculture after a hearing, if one were called, could decide that a Federal order was not warranted in the area. Thus it does not appear that any Federal order is imminently forthcoming, and equity ordinarily will not enjoin an alleged harmful act where it is not reasonably certain of occurring.
