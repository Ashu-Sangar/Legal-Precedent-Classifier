It is obvious that the equity -suit plaintiffs have no lien against the premises, that the District knows the whereabouts of all claimants and that neither the Association nor the equity suit plaintiffs have refused the ■amount of the award. Consequently, the first three stated bases for invoking the A'ct are -clearly absent. The District must rest its right, if any, to affirmative action under this statute upon the phrase “or if, for any other reason”.

Certainly tlie equity suit plaintiffs are not lienholders and the theory of their equity suit is not that they were the owners of the fund but rather that the fund should be impressed with a trust in favor of the Exposition stockholders and the Association should be directed to hold the fund for them and other Exposition stockholders as a trustee ex maleficio. The phrase “for any other reason” cannot be divorced either from the phrase which follows it or from the phrase which precedes it.
