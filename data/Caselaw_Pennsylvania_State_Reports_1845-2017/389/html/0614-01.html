The fact that the proponent did obtain a renunciation from his aunt of her right to act as personal representative of her husband’s estate does not, under the circumstances, prove the existence of a confidential relationship. With the husband having died very suddenly and the decedent a very ill woman, it was imperative, if the mine operated by the parties was to remain open, that someone be placed in a position to operate the mine, pay the workmen and attend to the myriad of duties in connection with its operation. To so operate the mine someone had to act for the husband’s estate: it was not only natural, but extremely logical, in view of decedent’s inability to act because of her hospitalization, that proponent who had managed the mine for many months assume charge in the situation. Under the evidence on this record a confidential relationship has not been established.</p>

In support of its contention that testatrix <a id="p626" href="#p626" data-label="626" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*626</a>was of weakened mentality the contestant depended principally on three witnesses: Dr. Pisnla, two nurses and the hospital records. Dr. Pisula testified that he was decedent’s physician from approximately 1946 or 1947 . until her death, and that during this period of time she was suffering from a heart disease accompanied by dropsy, swelling, and the hardening of her arteries. On occasion she had been hospitalized in the Cleveland Clinic and the Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh and on November 27th she was admitted to the Mt. Pleasant Hospital, Payette County. As she was taken to the hospital decedent was desperately ill, and on the morning of November 28th when the doctor saw her, her condition was serious and critical. He described her as: “Not nearly as alert as she had been in the early part of her illness”; “a bit foggy and confused”; “difficult to obtain answers from her”. However, she would recognize him when he would speak to her. The hospital records indicate that the decedent was “confused”, although “composed”, on November 29th. On November 27, 28 and 29, she was on the critical list and could have died any moment. At this time morphine was being given the decedent, although the records show that from 9:00 P.M. on November 28 until 9:00 P.M. on November 29 she had but one hypodermic of morphine. The purpose of the morphine was to quiet her down and help increase the fogginess or confusion of her mental processes. In Dr. Pisula’s opinion, decedent, on November 29, 1950, did not have the mental capacity to comprehend her possessions, the objects of her bounty, or what disposition she wanted to make of her possessions, and would not have been able to resist persuasion and/or pressure of relatives or friends, although she would give the appearance of comprehending and thinking normally.</p>

In contestant’s statement of the questions involved in this appeal four questions are posed: two questions deal with the issue of undue influence, (which have already been considered), and two questions deal with the issue of testamentary capacity, which must now be considered. On the issue of testamentary capacity, contestant urges (1) that the testimony of a priest, present at the time of execution of the will, raised an issue of fraud and (2) that the trial judge erred in refusing to charge on the relevancy of certain alleged testamentary desires uttered by testatrix immediately subsequent to the execution of the will. An examination of contestant’s brief indicates that contestant argues that the court below also erred in refusing to admit into evidence an inventory or appraisement of decedent’s husband’s estate and that the court’s charge was inadequate on the subject of the credibility of witnesses.

There was additional testimony from other witnesses to the effect that on the same day the decedent signed the renunciation in connection with her deceased husband’s estate. The court charged on this subject: “An effort was made through the testimony of Father Donnerbauer to show misrepresentation when he testified that Donald H. Kerr said something about a paper being only a temporary matter. But there is evidence in the case that the renunciation was signed about that time and that the remark was directed to that paper”. A reading of this portion of the charge indicates that Father Donnerbauer’s testimony was to be considered by the jury together with the testimony concerning the renunciation. The jury was left free to determine whether this remark of proponent, if made, referred to the will or to the renunciation. Contestant urges that a fraud was practised upon decedent by proponent’s representation that the will was to be temporary in nature.

While the contestant presented substantial evidence on the part of the attending physician and two nurses indicating that decedent did not have testamentary capacity, yet proponent’s evidence Avas also substantial. Two subscribing witnesses — one entirely disinterested and the other having an interest opposed to the will’s validity — and a priest testified that they were present at the time decedent executed the Avill and that she then possessed testamentary capacity; other witnesses Avho saw and talked with decedent within a comparatively short time prior to and subsequent to the date of execution of the will stated that in their opinion decedent had testamentary ca<a id="p635" href="#p635" data-label="635" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*635</a>pacity; after the date of execution of the will decedent was able to attend her husband’s wake at the funeral home, although she did not attend the funeral service; the will was kept after its execution by a person whose interests would be normally adverse to the provisions of the will, etc. The evidence on both sides was of such a nature that a finding of the jury either of testamentary capacity or lack of testamentary capacity could have been sustained. The dispute of fact on the subject of testamentary capacity was so substantial in nature that it was necessary for a jury to pass upon the evidence. Our province is not to decide whether we would have reached the same result as did the jury but rather to determine whether, on due consideration of all the evidence, the jury, whose verdict satisfied the legal conscience of the Chancellor, could reasonably have reached the conclusion which it did. The determination of the question of testamentary capacity was clearly within the province of the jury and its finding was based upon sufficient and adequate evidence.</p>
