Under the language of the Plan it is clear as crystal that a wife who is not living with her husband at the time of his death, and has not been living with him for over seven years prior to his death, is not entitled to the <em>maximum </em>Sickness Death Benefit under the provisions of the Plan. A wife-plaintiff falls, as does the decedent’s mother, within the clear language of Section 7 (4) (b), which provides for cases where there is no wife of the deceased employee living with him at the time of his death. In such an event, Section 7 (4) (b) clearly provides that “a Sickness Death Benefit in an amount not to exceed the amount specified in Paragraph 2 of this Section, [to wit: $6,-180.00] <em>may he paid </em>to any other person or persons who may be beneficiaries [under the Plan] . . . and be receiving . . . support from the deceased employee at the time of his death.” It further provides that the Committee shall have full authority to determine which beneficiaries are entitled and the amount to which each may be entitled “taking into consideration the degree of dependency and such other facts as it may deem pertinent.”</p>

Shore died on July 29, 1952, leaving a good record as a workman and a poor one as a husband. He beat his wife and threatened her life, on one occasion taunting her to “put your head in the oven twice and bring it out once.” He consorted with other women and when his wife objected to his immoral conduct he invited her “to get the Hell out.” His meretricious behavior continuing, Mrs. Shore left their common domicile on October 16, <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>1845. She returned shortly thereafter seeking to effect a reconciliation, but he repulsed her. When, one day, she sought to enter their apartment in order to obtain her personal effects, he barred her entrance, leaving her belongings on the outer doorstep. Mrs. Shore never relinquished efforts to rejoin her husband, and it cannot be questioned that had she instituted divorce proceedings against him, she -would have been entitled under the law to a decree <em>a vinculo matrimonii </em>on the grounds of malicious desertion.</p>

The Bell Telephone Company rejected the claim, asserting that since Mrs. Shore -Was not living with her husband at the time of his demise, she could not qualify under Section 7, subsection 4(a) above cited. However, the Company conceded some payment was in order under Subsection 4(6) which provided that if there was lacking sole beneficiaries under Subsection 4(a), benefits would go to any other person or persons entitled to receive support from the decedent before his death.</p>

    <p id="b475-4" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[209,733,1148,709]]]'>Mrs. Shore was dissatisfied with this decision and instituted an action in assumpsit against the Bell Telephone Company for the total sum of $6,180 payable under 4(a). Court of Common Pleas No. 4 of Philadelphia ruled that the Committee was justified in refusing payments under 4(a) since Mrs. Shore was not living under her husband’s roof when he died, but it decided further the Committee erred, under 4(b), in awarding total benefits of only $1357.20. The Court declared that the Committee should have distributed the entire amount of the death benefits, to wit, $6,180, using the same ratio (4 to 1) that it had adopted in distributing the $1,357.20.</p>

The Bell Telephone Company’s Pension and Benefits plan under consideration is not, as might be supposed, a unilateral arrangement, with the Company bestowing gratuities among its employees and their dependents. Although supposedly financed by the Company alone, the Death Benefits Plan actually represents an enterprise in which the whole consuming public participates. When the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission permitted the Bell Company to increase its rates it decided, inter alia, that operating expenses included costs for maintaining plans for pensions, accident disability benefits, sickness disability benefits and death <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>benefits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">*</a> To allow the Committee not to pay less than the total payment authorized under the Plan amounts to a deception practised on the consumers as well as the employees.</p>

While the Employees’ Benefit Committee must perforce be allowed some discretion in the performance of its duties, it may not depart from the equitable and fair standards set up by the Plan, taken as a whole.</p>

The real question is, did the Committee in administering the Plan act in good faith when they found that plaintiff was not diving with’ her husband at his death. It is our opinion that the Committee did act in good faith, regularly, and upon the merits of this question, and that its decision should not be attacked or set aside by us.” I believe the Court erred in this observation. The question of good or bad faith is not involved here at all. What we have before us is a question of realities. A tribunal cannot rule that 2 and 2 make 6 and be excused from responsibility for so bizarre a conclusion on the basis that it honestly <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>believed that its arithmetic was blemishless. The phrase “living with”, as found in Subsection 4(a) must be placed over the picture produced by all the events in the case and then evaluated against the background of those events. The lower Court failed to do this.</p>
    <p id="b477-3" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[195,627,1153,1417]]]'>It is fundamental law that goes back to the first prehistoric manifestation of inchoate justice that no one shall reap a benefit from a malefaction, and this rule applies whether the malefactor be alive or speaks from the grave. Maurice Shore had a legal duty to support his wife when alive and a posthumous obligation to assure her all benefits accruing to her as his legal mate. When the Bell Telephone Company Benefits Plan went into effect, Mrs. Shore immediately became a beneficiary thereof as much as if she punched the time clock with her husband each morning and worked at his side all day. Her right to death benefits was as much a chose in action as his right to pension. All these prerogatives were inextricably woven into the contract of employment. So long as Mrs. Shore remained the decedent’s spouse and maintained herself legally and morally in that position, he could not deprive her of benefits rising from the contract and ensuing Plan of Death Benefits. If Mrs. Shore had abandoned her husband, or had refused him her society, companionship and conjugal affection, she would have cut herself off from the Plan. She, however, did not do this. The facts indeed are all to the contrary. The rectitude of her conduct is a matter of judicial determination. Maurice Shore was ordered to pay his wife $20 per week because she was his wife and because <em>he </em>would not live <em>with her.</em>

They had not yet set up a common domicile. They had been married less than two months when his death occurred and for domestic reasons, entirely compatible with reciprocal loyalty and devotion, each had continued to live in the separate rooms in the houses in which they had dwelt prior to the marriage. The Board of Compensation concluded that since the husband and wife did not share the same house they were not living together under contemplation of The Pennsylvania Workmen’s Compensation Act. The Superior Court properly held to the contrary: “ ‘Living with’ does not always import physically dwelling together in the same house, (citing cases) Whether parties are ‘living with’ each other is a question of fact, but it is to be determined, not by consulting only one facet of the relationship, but by inspecting the whole picture. . . .</p>

I would reverse the judgment of the lower Court and order that a judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff Elizabeth H. Shore in the amount of $6,180, less $1,044 already paid to her on account.</p>

The vague standards set to guide the committee’s determination of the amount of benefits to be paid are inadequate to afford proper safeguards to the employes, and consequently, any other interpretation might well render the obligation of the defendant illusory.</p>

Even assuming, therefore, that the committee had the authority to exercise discretion in determining the amount of benefit payments, it had to exercise that discretion in good faith and within the bounds of a reasonable judgment. <em>Forrish v. </em>Kennedy, <a href="/pa/377/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="377 Pa. 370" data-case-ids="1249618" data-case-paths="/pa/377/0370-01">377 Pa. 370</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=105%20A.2d%2067" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="105 A.2d 67">105 A. 2d 67</a> (1954); see also 56 C.J.S. 834 (1948) (cases collected).</p>

It could not, in good conscience, have given partially dependent distant relatives much less. Such a lack of consideration for the closeness of the relationship, as Avell as the degree of dependency, herein involved indicates either that the committee did not exercise mature judgment, or that its determination was actuated by bad faith. In my judgment, dependent Avives and mothers merit maximum payments, and on that basis, without contemplation of any other factors, I Avould affirm the judgment of the lower court.</p>
