As this highway passes through the hamlet of Clinton, it is intersected at right angles by another state highway. The intersection is marked with both directional and school zone signs. As the appellee approached this intersection from the west, the minor appellant, Roy Layman, aged 8 years, was observed by two witnesses walking across the grounds of a public school, which school is located on the southerly side of the Connellsville-Melcroft Highway and east of the intersection. They noticed that he was eating something which he held in his hand as he walked along.
