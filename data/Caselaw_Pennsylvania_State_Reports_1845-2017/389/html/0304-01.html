      <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>Moon was directed to appear before Judge Wade on a charge of failure to comply with an order of support. (See Commonwealth v. Moon, 174 Pa. Superior Ot. 334, <a href="/citations/?q=101%20A.2d%20147" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="101 A.2d 147">101 A. 2d 147</a>). The day before the date fixed for his appearance he cashed a check for $1,500 and purchased a forty-five calibre pistol, a box of shells and two clips, both of which were loaded when he entered the court room. Moon never paid anything on the support order entered against him. Having been ordered to appear before the Court of Quarter Sessions of Warren County for sentence (he was then in default $1,600 on the support order), he appeared before said court on January 13, 1954. When asked if he intended to comply with the order of support, Moon replied, “Absolutely not.” When he stood before the court he drew the pistol in question, which had been loaded with one clip, and emptied the gun in various directions and at Judge Wade. Judge Wade stumbled from the dais and was prone on the floor of the court room when Moon fired two more shots. Judge Wade cried out, “Don’t shoot, please don’t shoot, I won’t sentence you,” to which Moon replied, “You God-damned . . . you will never get a chance to.”</p>
    <p id="b328-4" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[255,1618,1153,535]]]'>Judge Wade’s death was almost instantaneous. Moon then reloaded his gun and while making his escape from the court room threatened to kill attorney Bonavita who attempted to stop him. Moon got into his automobile and soon after officers stopped progress of the automobile by shooting the tires. He then got out of the car and shot himself in the neck, and was taken to the Warren Hospital, where he recovered. Repeatedly during his trial the defendant stated that he was extremely mad or furious.</p>

The court found him to be sane, but on appeal <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>this finding was reversed and this Court ordered a reexamination of the commission’s findings and recommendation, and reconsideration of the evidence in the -light of the statutory definition of mental illness. See <em>Commonwealth v. Moon, </em><a href="/pa/383/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="383 Pa. 18" data-case-ids="1261883" data-case-paths="/pa/383/0018-01">383 Pa. 18</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.2d%2096" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="117 A.2d 96">117 A. 2d 96</a>. Thereafter the lower court executed the mandate of this Court, and entered an order refusing to commit him to a mental hospital and finding that it was not satisfied that he was mentally ill. On appeal this order was affirmed. See <em>Commonwealth v. Moon, </em><a href="/pa/386/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="386 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="1268339" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0205-01">386 Pa. 205</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=125%20A.2d%20594" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="125 A.2d 594">125 A. 2d 594</a>.

If you found from a fair preponderance of the evidence, that the accused at the time of the commission of this act, was unable to distinguish right from wrong and unable to appreciate the consequences of his act, would you then find him not guilty by reason of insanity?” The Commonwealth’s objection was sustained and properly so. This Court declared in <em>Commonwealth v. Bentley, </em><a href="/pa/287/0539-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="287 Pa. 539" data-case-ids="1099645" data-case-paths="/pa/287/0539-01">287 Pa. 539</a>, at page 546, <a href="/citations/?q=135%20A.%20310" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="135 A. 310">135 A. 310</a>: “In conducting the preliminary examination, considerable latitude must be permitted to elicit the necessary information, but it is to 'be strictly confined to inquiries disclosing qualifica<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>tions, or lack of them, and not extended so as to include hypothetical questions, when their evident purpose is to have the jurors indicate in advance what their decisions will be under a certain state of the evidence or upon a certain state of facts, and thus possibly commit them to definite ideas or views when the case shall be finally submitted to them for their decision.”</p>
    <p id="b330-4" data-blocks='[["BL_330.4",330,[257,764,1150,593]]]'>(2) The appellant claims the court ¡below committed error in not sustaining the challenge for cause as to several jurors following examination on voir dire. These challenges for cause were made at a time when the defendant’s peremptory challenges were not exhausted, and hence the refusal of the challenge cannot be prejudicial error. <em>Sayres v. Commonwealth, </em><a href="/pa/88/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="88 Pa. 291" data-case-ids="1061168" data-case-paths="/pa/88/0291-01">88 Pa. 291</a>, 306, 307; <em>Commonwealth v.

The court, after excusing said juror, immediately, of its own motion, granted an additional peremptory challenge to the defendant. In <em>Commonwealth v. Schroeder, </em><a href="/pa/302/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="302 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1129067" data-case-paths="/pa/302/0001-01">302 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=152%20A.%20835" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="152 A. 835">152 A. 835</a>, the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree and sentenced to death. The court there charged that certain evidence on credibility of one of the defendant’s witnesses was substantive evidence of defendant’s guilt. This Court commented, at page 11: “Apparently the court did inadvertently treat the evidence as substantive proof. <em>We are convinced that this instruction did defendant no harm and did not bring about her conviction.” </em>(Italics supplied). Thus this Court there determined that even though the instruction Avas erroneous, if the court was convinced <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>that the defendant was not harmed thereby, the judgment and sentence would be affirmed. <em>“ ‘The defendant in a homicide case has no standing in an appellate court to complain of an erroneous instruction unless the error contributed to the result reached by the jury’: </em>Com. v.

    <p id="b331-3" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[226,768,1152,652]]]'>(4) The Commonwealth introduced the photograph of Judge Wade taken very shortly after the assault by the defendant. It was offered to show the location of the body in the court room, and to show the direction of the bullet wounds in vital parts. Having examined the photograph carefully, we find that it was not inflammatory or prejudicial. It simply showed a ■body prone on the floor of the court room with stains, evidently blood, on its left side. Introduction of -such -exhibits is a purely discretionary matter for the trial judge, and we find no abuse of -discretion: <em>Commonwealth v. Ballem, </em><a href="/pa/386/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="386 Pa. 20" data-case-ids="1268331" data-case-paths="/pa/386/0020-01">386 Pa. 20</a>, 27, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.2d%20728" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="123 A.2d 728">123 A. 2d 728</a>.</p>
    <p id="b331-4" data-blocks='[["BL_331.5",331,[228,1431,1151,255]]]'>(5) The defendant next complains that he was not allowed to show the bias of the witness, Bernice B. Seavy.

This memorandum was not signed or written by the -defendant, nor is such necessary. The defendant was unable to -speak due -to his -self-inflicted wounds and was instructed to nod his head yes or no, and to hold up fingers to indicate “how many.” The memorandum was clearly admissible just -as an unsigned or oral statement of the defendant would have been. Its weight was for the jury, and the defendant was not harmed <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>by tbe admission in evidence of tbe memorandum. Tbe answers of the defendant to the questions asked were fully testified to by officers Naddeo and Mehallic.</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.4",332,[224,491,1152,694]]]'>(7) The defendant complains about the lower court’s instructions on the question of the alleged insanity of the defendant. There was no prejudicial error in the court’s charge on the question of insanity, although much is attempted to be made of the self-inflicted wounds of the defendant.

The day before the killing he had obtained sufficient money to pay the back support, but refused to pay it, and instead murdered the judge who was about to order him to do so. The defendant had a night’s sleep after he had purchased the gun and shells and obtained the $1,500.

If the heinousness of the act is to dictate the punishment, regardless of sanity or insanity, then Norman W. Moon ¡should be executed. But, as long as we have in Pennsylvania the rule that an insane person should not be executed, certainly this is the case to apply it.

Moon had also tried to kill the district attorney of Warren County as well as the court stenographer, with neither of whom had he had any quarrel. And then he tried to kill himself, (a deed which could not possibly have brought him any advantage) by shooting himself in the neck. Moon was a man who had gone berserk. There was no rhyme, reason, purpose, or objective to his actions, so obviously maniacal. In my previous Dissenting Opinion I showed how the lower Court ignored the findings of a highly trained and qualified commission made up of two experienced doctors and a lawyer, and founded its conclusion mostly on the testimony of lay prison guards who were considerably limited in their appraisement of the subject of whom they spoke.
