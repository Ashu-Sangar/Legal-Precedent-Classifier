    <p id="b127-5" data-blocks='[["BL_127.8",127,[187,1059,1148,483]]]'>These principles were advanced and carried out until 1951, when a gradual but certain decline in the furtherance of the corporate purposes occurred. In 1954, the club premises, which housed facilities for selling beer and liquor, were sold. The following year it failed to elect officers as required by the State Liquor Control Board, and during the entire period of decline neglected to hold meetings and carry out the corporate purpose.</p>

Each member is vitally interested in the club, at least pecuniarily, since in the event of dissolution the remaining assets will be divided among them. Unquestionably they have the requisite standing and interest to maintain the action without the Attorney General, whose interest in quo warranto proceedings for dissolution is .limited to those having a public interest, not a private interest: <em>Commonwealth ex rel. v.

In the absence of such a special interest, differing not merely in degree but in nature and kind from that of the public at large, a private individual cannot demand a judgment of ouster on a writ of quo warranto.” See opinion of Judge Alpern in <em>Wotherspoon v.

    <p id="b129-5" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[172,1068,1154,1248]]]'>The appellant also contends that a nonprofit corporation does not forfeit the corporate franchise for failing to exercise all its powers. But in this instance the respondent, through its officers, has been charged with misuse or abuse of corporate rights and powers, rather than the mere failure to exercise such powers. Plaintiffs allege and the lower court found: refusals to conduct meetings according to the constitution and by-laws; failure to elect officers annually; depletion of corporate resources; total absence of corporate purposes; and a general state of dissipation of the club property, so that the club’s sole purpose and existence was to sell beer and liquor on week-ends. Furthermore, the corporation purchased real estate without strictly complying with the provisions of the Nonprofit Corporation Law of 1933, as amended 1951, August 17, P.L. 1287, §2, 15 PS 2851-308. Precisely the corporate evils which this section was designed to eliminate had occurred, to wit: diversion and dissipation of corporate assets: <em>Von Mailath v.
