Appellant brought an action in trespass to which the appellee filed a counterclaim. The jury brought in a verdict in favor of the appellee Kinnik in the amount of $10,000. Appellant thereupon asked for a poll of the jury, which request was denied by the trial judge. A motion for a new trial was argued before the court en banc which refused the motion, although one judge dissented on the ground that the appellant had an absolute right to a poll of the jury. This appeal followed.</p>

The procedure had its genesis in ancient common law (see 2 Hale, Pleas of the Crown 299) and has long been both approved and uniform practice in this State: . . . Even the Commonwealth possesses the right to have the jury polled: . . .”, and this is the rule generally applicable in the United States. A recent annotation of the cases on this point is to be found at <a href="/citations/?q=49%20A.L.R.%202d%20619" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="49 A.L.R. 2d 619">49 ALR 2d 619</a> et seq.</p>

No doubt such an application being parcel of the trial, by custom, might if refused and excepted to, have been brought up for examination here on a bill of exceptions, and then the court could have determined whether a special verdict of each juror <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>was the right of either party, or whether it was a matter solely within the discretion of the court to allow or not.

Mr. Justice Trunkey stated, page 389 : “Nor is there occasion to decide the mootable question, whether, in the trial of a civil cause, the court is bound to permit a poll of the jury on request by one of the parties. At request of the attorney for defendant, the jury were polled, and it is undeniable that the court had power to permit the poll. In argument it was urged that the allowance of the poll of the jury was discretionary with the court. This point was not decided in Byrne v. Grossman, <a href="/pa/65/0310-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="65 Pa. 310" data-case-ids="430562" data-case-paths="/pa/65/0310-01">65 Pa. 310</a>, but the Chief Justice expressed his individual opinion against the right. The court below were not bound by that dictum — they may have adopted the view of the Supreme Court of New York, in Fox v. Smith, 3 Cowen 23, when it was ruled that the jury may be polled at the request of either party at any time before the verdict is recorded, whether it be sealed, or is oral. One of the judges remarked, ‘Conceding that the judge may order the jury polled seems to give the party a right to insist on it.’ ”. See also <em>Rottmund v.

He might have polled the jury at any time before the verdict was recorded, whether it was sealed or not. . . .”, citing as authority the New York case of <em>Fox v. Smith, </em>3 Cowen 23, which held the poll to be a right. While this seems to lean toward the “absolute right” view, it appears to have been impliedly overruled by the more recent case of <em>Sylvester et vir v.

If one juror withholds his assent, a verdict will not be permitted to stand, and certainly it follows that there must be an opportunity in open court to ascertain that the verdict is unanimous. The practice in the courts of this Commonwealth is for the trial judge or the clerk or other court official to read the jury’s verdict back to it, and then ask if all assent thereto. If there be a dissent or if there is an indication from the jury that the verdict might be other than unanimous, it would surely be incumbent upon the trial judge to ascertain the unanimity of the jurors either by individual poll or other appropriate means. And not to check into the unanimity of the jury when good cause appears to question it, would certainly appear to be a dereliction in the performance of the trial court’s duty. The question presented on this appeal is, absent any outward indication of a lack of unanimity,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> is a trial court <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>bound to take a poll in a civil ease upon motion duly made?</p>
    <p id="b171-4" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[182,450,1151,1357]]]'>It is our view that a trial judge is not bound to do so, but that taking a poll is a matter which rests within his sound discretion. He has had an opportunity to examine the demeanor of the jurors. He is in a position to determine whether there are any reasonable grounds to question the verdict as announced by the foreman. He is present at the making of the motion by counsel and is able to judge whether it is a mere formalistic grasping at straws or whether there is substance to it. The trial judge by tradition and of necessity is given considerable leeway in supervising the functioning of the jury. He has the duty of giving them instructions, he may give them further aid if requested during their deliberation, and the determination of how long the jury will be required to deliberate when it has difficulty in reaching agreement is a decision for him in his sound discretion to make. So too, we believe, the extent of the inquiry into the unanimity of the jury is a determination which must rest within his discretion. Our conclusion in this regard conforms with the long-standing recognition that the ultimate fairness of a judicial proceeding depends upon the wisdom and good judgment of the trial judge, and he should be given considerable latitude in the conduct of a trial.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[182,1830,1148,489]],["BL_172.1",172,[274,346,1147,594]]]'>The right which a litigant has is to have a verdict determined by a unanimous jury. One method, but not necessarily the only method, of assuring this right is by polling the jury to determine its unanimity. We think that an equally meritorious and certainly more expeditious method is the one in general use in this OommonAvealth: that of having the foreman speak for the jury in announcing its verdict, having the jurors hearken unto their verdict as it is read back to them, <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>and asking them if they all agree to that verdict which has been announced in open court. The traditional function of the foreman is to speak for the jury, and the additional safeguard of giving the members of the jury an opportunity in open court to express any individual dissent, is ordinarily sufficient to guarantee the rights of the litigants. The right is to ascertain that the verdict is unanimous, not one to poll the jury. To elevate one of several possible procedures for insuring a right to the level of the right itself is to becloud the substance by concentrating on a formalism.</p>
    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[270,953,1149,923]]]'>Argument was made here and in the court below as to when a motion to poll the jury may properly be made. It is sufficient to say that no single moment is the <em>only </em>moment at which the motion can be entertained. A poll cannot be taken after a jury having announced its verdict has dispersed and come into contact with other persons, <em>Walters v. Junkins, </em>16 S. &amp; R. 414; but, as stated by Justice (now Chief Justice) Jones in <em>Commonwealth v. Martin, </em>supra, at page 598: “. . . the recording of the verdict does not become unalterable until the opportunity of the jury to correct or alter it has passed with Their dispersion.’ . . .”. A motion to poll, be it made at the moment the verdict is first announced in court, or even if made after the verdict is affirmed and “entered” of record, is still timely so long as it is made before the jury has dispersed.</p>

A review of the record convinces us <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>that the issue of contributory negligence was for tbe jury, and a reading of tbe charge shows that this issue was well explained and properly submitted to it.
