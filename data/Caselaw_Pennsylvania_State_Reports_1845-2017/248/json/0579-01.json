The court below found that she had abandoned her residence here, with the intention of acquiring one in New York, and that she actually had acquired a residence there in March, 1911. With this finding fully warranted by the evidence, the Commonwealth has no claim against her estate. We find nothing in the forty-two assignments of error calling for a resubmission to the court below of the single question of fact involved in the case.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",

T., 1915, by Commonwealth, from judgment of O. C. Carbon Co., dismissing exceptions to decree in estate of Janet Rutherford Marshall, deceased.\nBefore Brown, C. J., Mestrezat, Elkin, Stewart and Frazer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAppeal from appraisement of decedent\u2019s estate for purposes of collateral inheritance tax. Before Barber, J.\nThe court found that the decedent prior to the date of her death had taken up her residence in New York and that her personal estate was, therefore, not subject to the collateral inheritance tax in Pennsylvania. The court dismissed exceptions to its decree sustaining the legatee\u2019s exceptions to the appraisement. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appealed.\nMarch 22, 1915:\nError assigned, among others, was the decree of the court.\nWilliam Wilhelm and William M.
