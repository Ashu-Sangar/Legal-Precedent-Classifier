The learned and careful chancellor below found, \u201cwith no difficulty whatever,\u201d that the grantor, at the time she executed the deed, had sufficient mental capacity to understand what she did, and that the grantee, her son, had exercised no undue influence over her in inducing her to execute and deliver .the instrument to him. On these findings the appeal is dismissed and the decree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.",
