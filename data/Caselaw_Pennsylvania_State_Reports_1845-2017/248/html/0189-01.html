    <p id="b223-3" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[175,2315,1149,97]],["BL_224.1",224,[305,335,1149,1841]]]'>The learned trial judge took the view that the children were trespassers and that the plaintiff had not shown any <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>negligence upon the part of the railroad company; in this we are obliged to concur. There was no testimony to prove that the engineer, or any one else in charge of the operation of the locomotive, actually saw these children upon the tracks before the train arrived at the place where they were standing; and, since the accident happened after the locomotive had passed the public crossings and in a place where the defendant’s right of way ran between embankments, the engineer had no reason to maintain a particularly sharp outlook or to' anticipate the presence of children on the tracks. The watchman was placed at his station to operate the safety gates and to guard the crossing; our cases recognize the fact that the “primary duty” of one so employed is “to watch the crossing for the general public” (Jones v. Receivers of Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/186/0469-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="186 Pa. 469" data-case-ids="989681" data-case-paths="/pa/186/0469-01">186 Pa. 469</a>, 473)— “to guard it (the crossing),” (Philadelphia &amp; Reading R. R. Co. v. Spearen, <a href="/pa/47/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="47 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="485547" data-case-paths="/pa/47/0300-01">47 Pa. 300</a>, 301), and there is no evidence to show that the watchman in this case was fixed with any additional duties, or to prove that he actually saw the children in a place of danger when the train was approaching, conceding, for the purposes of this case, that the space in which they stood at the timé of the accident was a place of danger. Moreover, the statement of claim, filed in 1902, shortly after the accident happened, does not expressly aver negligence on the part of the watchman, its only averment of negligence being that the plaintiff was injured through the carelessness of the servants and employees of the defendant company engaged in operating its .trains; but without regard to the question of the sufficiency of the averments in the statement of claim, we do not feel that the learned trial judge erred in holding the evidence insufficient to take the case to the jury.</p>
