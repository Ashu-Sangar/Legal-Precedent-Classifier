On the trial of an appeal from an award of viewers in condemnation proceedings, where an expert states he bases his estimate of the value of the property affected upon prices obtained on sales of similarly located land in the same neighborhood, he may be cross-examined to test his good faith and the accuracy and extent of his knowledge as to all the conditions of these sales including the prices, but generally speaking, even on cross-examination such a witness cannot in the first instance be interrogated concerning the prices brought at sales not relied upon by him in making his original estimate of value, although, if he has relied on some sales in the neighborhood, he may be asked without mention of prices if he knew of other sales of property similarly located and whether he considered them, and if not, why not; the course which the investigation may take after that depends largely upon the discretion of the trial judge, constantly keeping in mind the fact that the cross-examination is simply a test of the good faith and accuracy of the witness and that prices paid at particular sales of other properties are not, in themselves, evidence of the market value of the land in controversy.</p>

    <p id="b213-3" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[172,649,1149,1460]]]'>The appellants contend that the tax assessments should have been admitted, and submitted to the'jury as some evidence of value, on the general principle that “a declaration made by a party against his interest is admissible as against him,” and they base their argument on the assumption that the City of Philadelphia either actually made or, in effect, adopted the tax assessments in question. The answer to the argument that the- city made the assessments is to be found in the recent case of Selig v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/232/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="232 Pa. 309" data-case-ids="977815" data-case-paths="/pa/232/0309-01">232 Pa. 309</a>, where the method of assessing taxes in. Philadelphia is elaborately discussed and it is ruled that such taxes are assessed by a “State Agency” under a system established by the Commonwealth and administered through public officers (see Richie v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/225/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="225 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="965284" data-case-paths="/pa/225/0511-01">225 Pa. 511</a>, 516) appointed by “a State Department whose rulings are subject to appeal ......to the courts of the Commonwealth,” and that the city officials have no jurisdiction in the matter whatever. As to the theory of adoption, we. see no merit in the argument that, because the city received taxes based on these assessments and they were used in determining its borrowing capacity, the municipality in effect adopted them as an expression of its own estimate of the value of the plaintiffs’ <em>land; </em>for no corporate body can properly be held to have adopted the action of another independent public agency by merely giving such recognition thereto as the law compels it to render.</p>

Ashland Co., <a href="/pa/84/0279-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="84 Pa. 279" data-case-ids="1053569" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0279-01">84 Pa. 279</a>, 285; Schuylkill Co. v.

It is true that these latter authorities can be distinguished on their facts from the case at bar, but the general ruling therein, to the effect that, in cases of this character, tax assessments represent nothing more than “ex parte statements” of the opinion of the assessor, applies, and, after giving most thorough consideration to the well stated argument of the able counsel for the appellants, we are not convinced that the court below erred when it refused to admit the assessments offered at the present trial; hence, the first question involved must be answered in the negative.</p>
    <p id="b214-3" data-blocks='[["BL_214.4",214,[309,1558,1148,863]],["BL_215.1",215,[177,370,1147,1247]]]'>In support of the appellants’-contention that the second question stated at the head of this opinion should be answered in the afflrmatiye they argue that, to their prejudice, counsel for the defendant repeatedly breached a recent ruling of this court regulating the cross-examination of expert witnesses; citing Roberts v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/239/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="239 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="995952" data-case-paths="/pa/239/0339-01">239 Pa. 339</a>, 341. There is nothing in the opinion in the Roberts case which, in any manner, or to any degree, altered or was intended to change the established rules relating to the examination of expert witnesses; in fact, our Brother Stewart practically there so states in his reference (p. 342) to Rea v. Pittsburgh Co., <a href="/pa/229/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="229 Pa. 106" data-case-ids="971856" data-case-paths="/pa/229/0106-01">229 Pa. 106</a>. On several occasions we have held that, where an expert states he bases his estimate of the value of the property affected upon prices obtained on sales of “similarly located land in the same neighborhood,” he may be cross-<a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>examined, to test “his good faith......and the accuracy and extent of his knowledge,” as to all the conditions of these sales, including the prices (see Henkel v. Wabash Co., <a href="/pa/213/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="213 Pa. 485" data-case-ids="943425" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0485-01">213 Pa. 485</a>; Brown v.

Pittsburgh Co., supra, at p. 115, et seq.); but, generally speaking, even on cross-examination, such a witness cannot in the first instance be interrogated concerning the prices brought at sales not relied upon by him in making his original estimate of value, although, if he has relied on some sales in the neighborhood, he may be asked, without mention of prices, if he knew of other sales of properties similarly located and whether he considered them, and if not, why not; the course which the investigation may take after that depends largely upon the discretion of the trial judge, constantly keeping in mind the fact that the cross-examination is merely to test the good faith and accuracy of knowledge of the witness, and that prices paid at particular sales of other properties are not, in themselves, evidence of the market value of the land in controversy (see Pittsburgh &amp; Western R. R. Co. v. Patterson, <a href="/pa/107/0461-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="107 Pa. 461" data-case-ids="8858174" data-case-paths="/pa/107/0461-01">107 Pa. 461</a>, 462, 464).</p>

The’ particular sales inquired about in that case not only had not been referred to in the direct examination of plaintiffs’ experts, but, in some instances, they were of land not similarly located, whereas, here, in practically every instance, the sales referred to by counsel for the defendant were those which had first been brought into the case by counsel for the plaintiffs, on the direct examination of their leading expert witnesses, as sales of similarly located properties which “would most favorably compare” with the property of <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>the plaintiffs and upon which an estimate of the value of the land under consideration might fairly be based. Although counsel for the plaintiffs expressly warned his witness not to state “the price at which the sales were made,” yet he added, “Unless my friend Mr.Lewis (counsel for the defendant) wishes the figures — in case he wishes them, you may give them”; and, in fact, the witness did thereafter, of his own accord, make a most pointed reference to these other sales, stating that the prices obtained therein were higher than the value he put on the plaintiffs’ property; further, while we find much talk about striking from the record the bit of testimony just referred to, yet, we see no order to that effect. It is unnecessary, however, to go into a lengthy discussion of this branch of the case, for it is not properly before us. An examination of the record shows that wherever counsel for the defendant mentioned prices of other sales, and an objection was made, it was promptly sustained, and, when requested, the court struck out any testimony elicited by such questions; more than this, in not one of the instances complained of did counsel for the plaintiffs take an exception to the ruling of the court below, and we discover no request upon the record for instructions to the jury concerning the alleged harmful references to these other sales, nor do we find any motion to withdraw a juror and continue the case at the cost of the defendant, which is the usual practice pursued when either party feels that he is being prejudiced in a matter of this kind.</p>
