The officer, who did not know him, asked defendant’s decedent if this was correct and whether he knew the man and would let him take charge of the machine, to which he replied in the affirmative. Maxwell then went into the street and started to crank the car; while he was so engaged, the car started, knocking him down, and the hub of one of the wheels caught in the plaintiff’s dress and she was thrown to the ground, receiving the injuries complained of.</p>
