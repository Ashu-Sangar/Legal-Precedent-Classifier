      <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>Butler, J., filed the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b390-4" data-blocks='[["BL_390.4",390,[323,393,1149,1461]]]'>The words of John M. WetherilPs will express a clear purpose, we think, to give the income of the property here involved, to Rachel M. Hewson for life; at her death to have it pass to Alexander Stewart Wetherill, for life, should he survive hex*, with the fee to his eldest son. Should Alexander, having survived her, — as he did —die without a surviving son — as he did — then the property should go to testator’s oldest nephew of the family name of Wetherill then living, for life, with the fee to his eldest son. If this nephew should die without a surviving son, then the property should vest in the heirs of this nephew deceased. “This Nephew,” just referred to, happens to he Henry E. Wetherill the plaintiff in the case stated, and in our opinion he does not, as is contended in his behalf, take a fee. The purpose plainly expressed by the testator was to give the nephew — who happens to be Henry E. Wetherill — a life estate, and to give the fee to this nephew’s eldest son, and in the event of their being no surviving son to take the property, then to this nephew’s heirs. Clearly, we think, the provision in favor of this nephew’s eldest son, makes him a purchaser, and may not be treated as words of limitation, enlarging the life estate given to this nephew. The devise oyer is not to the nephew’s children, nor even to his sons, but is descriptive of an exact, particular taker — his eldest son — and to him the testator directs the property to pass upon the death of the nephew.</p>
