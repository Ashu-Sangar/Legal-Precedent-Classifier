This view is urged with not little force; but it is believed the question must be regarded as no longer open. At least for the present we are bound by a ruling of the Superior Court which seems to be directly in point, and so long as that stands undisturbed it is controlling.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b608-4" data-blocks='[["BL_608.4",608,[291,890,1152,417]]]'>It is to be borne in mind that this county is in the so-called salary class. Yet in those where the treasurer’s compensation is made up of divers fees and commissionSj instead of a fixed salary prescribed by statute, it has been held that the fund officially in his hands belongs to the county, and for that reason he is accountable for any interest accruing thereon: Potter v.

The funds upon which interest was allowed by the several, banks did not belong to the appellant, and he could make no profit out of them. If he had contracted for interest to be paid to him, he would have been guilty of a misdemeanor: Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 382, Sec. 63. What he could not have done directly, public policy will not permit him to do indirectly. The judgment in each case is affirmed.</p>
