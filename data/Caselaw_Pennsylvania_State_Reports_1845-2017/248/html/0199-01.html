Her residuary estate which was to include the farm, when the executors obtained title, was to be held in trust for a home, to be known as the Garrett-Williamson Lodge (for which a corporation was to be formed) which home was to be located on such farm tract, and the income of the rest of her estate was to be used for its improvement and maintenance. In ease the executors could not obtain title, by reason of the nonconveyance of the legatees or by reason of other outstanding interests, they were to purchase for such price as they deemed proper, and, failing to secure the same, they were authorized to buy elsewhere.</p>

There is therefore no reason why the general rule as to a lapsed legacy should not be applied. It is true that testatrix, by codicil made a short time after the execution of her will, revoked the legacy to another brother, Edwin T. Garrett, and that such revocation was stated to be because of his death. And it is equally true that when Sylvester died, <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>February 9th, 1910, testatrix did not make a further codicil revoking his legacy. For this, however, there was no legal reason, because testatrix had, in the codicil before quoted, anticipated any further deaths, and had, in express terms, covered such a contingency. Not only does she reaffirm her will in all respects save as to this particular revocation, but she further provides that each legatee shall convey or procure to be conveyed “a good and marketable title free from all liens” as a condition precedent to the payment of their respective legacies. It therefore follows that the legacies to the four children of Sylvester Garrett were not to be paid them until they not only conveyed any interest they had or might have, but had also' “procured a conveyance” of their deceased father’s interest, whether title had vested in them absolutely, or needed to be made by the executors of his will, because of a power of sale or the possibility of the lien of debts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b233-5" data-blocks='[["BL_233.4",233,[194,1344,1147,537]]]'>Great stress is laid by counsel on the use of the words “legal representatives” in the latter part of the codicil, but it is apparent that this expression is used in the same sense as in an earlier clause, wherein it is provided that the “legal representatives of any one legatee under a disability shall obtain by proper legal procedure the authority to grant and convey,” etc. While “legal representatives” usually means executors or administrators, the context governs when they are shown to be used in a different sense (Osborn v. First Nat. Bank, <a href="/pa/175/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="175 Pa. 494" data-case-ids="880520" data-case-paths="/pa/175/0494-01">175 Pa. 494</a>).</p>

Nothing more need be added to what has already been said by the auditing judge, as a majority of the judges concur in his conclusions.</p>
