    <p class="summary" id="b238-11" data-blocks='[["BL_238.16",238,[279,1842,1147,482]]]'>On September 30th, 1912, plaintiff and William Levis, who is the president of the defendant corporation, entered into a written agreement, under the terms of which plaintiff agreed to loan William Levis the sum of $1,500. In consideration of the loan, Levis agreed that plaintiff would be employed by the defendant corporation, in the real estate business, for such length of time as the loan should remain unpaid, at a salary of $75 per month, and ten per cent, of the net profits of the business.</p>

On May <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>3d, 1913, plaintiff was discharged by defendant, as the result of some difficulty that arose between them as to minor cash items of expenditure, such as carfare, made by Wright. Wright objected to the discharge, stating that he had performed his duties faithfully in every respect, and that he would not acquiesce in the discharge except upon the return to him of his $1,500. Defendant would not do this, but stated that it would pay the loan back at the end of the year. Thereafter, on July 10th, 1913, defendant paid plaintiff $43.34, being ten per cent, of surplus as shown by a statement submitted.</p>
