As is pointed out in Perry on Trusts (Vol. II, sixth edition, page 1181), there is a wide distinction between a gift to a charity and a gift to a trustee to be applied to a charity, as in the former instance all that is necessary to be done is for the court to award the fund to the particular charity, the action of the court in this respect being ministerial only; whereas in a gift to a trustee to be applied to a charity, the court has jurisdiction over the trustee, as it has over all trustees, to see that he does not commit a breach of his trust or apply the fund in bad faith or to purposes that are not charitable.

And therefore, in the present instance, if we were to terminate the trust and order the transfer of the assets to the charitable beneficiary we would not only be defeating the intention of the-testatrix, but would also deprive the ultimate objects of her bounty (that is, the inmates of the orphanage) of the supervision and control which we have over trustees.</p>
