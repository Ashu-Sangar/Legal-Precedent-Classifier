    "head_matter": "Morrow, Appellant, v. Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Philadelphia.\nInsurance \u2014 Life insurance \u2014 Equation fund.\nIn an action upon a policy of life insurance where a plaintiff alleges that his equitable proportion of an equation fund was $1,800, and that if such proportion was less in amount it indicated a deficiency in the collection fund which under a condition of the policy should have been made, good by a pro rata assessment upon the members of the association, an affidavit of defense alleging that plaintiff\u2019s equitable proportion of the fund was only $426.60 and that a deficiency in the fund could only occur on certain specified contingencies and that they had not arisen is sufficient.\nArgued Oct. 28, 1909.\nAppeal, No. 180, Oct. T., 1909, by plaintiff, from order of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., April T., 1909, No. 724, discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in case of Lot' L. Morrow v. Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Philadelphia.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a policy .of life insurance.\nRule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nShaper, J., filed the following opinion:\nThe action is upon a policy of life insurance made in July, 1892, whereby for an annual premium of $131.46 the defendant company agrees to pay $3,000 at the death of the plaintiff, and also provides that if the policy be surrendered on February 19, 1909, the insured shall receive as a cash disability benefit \u201can equitable proportion of the equation fund, estimated according to the established experience of thirty American offices at the amount of $1,800,\u201d whereupon the insurance should cease. The plaintiff offered to surrender his policy on February 19, 1909, and demanded payment of $1,800, and alleges that his equitable proportion of the equation fund as provided in the policy amounted to $1,800.\nThe case is somewhat complicated by reason of the nature of the provisions of the policy, and is not made more easy of comprehension by the fact that we have four affidavits of defense. The policy does not promise the plaintiff $1,800 on February 19, 1909, but only an \u201cequitable proportion of the equation fund,\u201d and the only mention of $1,800 is a statement that this equitable proportion, estimated according to the-tabulated experience of thirty American offices, would amount to that sum. Plaintiff alleges that his equitable proportion of the equation fund is $1,800, and the defendant says that it is not, but is only $426.60. The plaintiff claims that this indicates a deficiency in the equation fund, which under a condition of the policy should have been made good by a pro rata assessment upon the members of the association, to which the defendant replies that the deficiency referred to in the policy for which an assessment is to be made would occur only when the equation fund would be insufficient to equalize the increasing cost due to advancing age, or if the proportion of such fund properly belonging to such policy shall at any time not equal the difference between the present worth of the future payments and the sum insured, and that this contingency has not occurred, but that the equation fund during the probable life of the insured was always sufficient for that purpose.\nIf this be true and it is a matter of fact, the affidavit of defense would appear to be sufficient to prevent judgment. The rule is, therefore, discharged.\nError assigned was order discharging rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nM. H. Stevenson, with him Wm. C. Boyd, for appellant.\u2014\nThe defendant expressly agreed that if the policy be legally surrendered on February 19, 1909, \u201c said member shall receive as a cash disability benefit an equitable proportion of the equation fund\u201d estimated at 11,800. Condition seven provides that any deficiency in this fund shall be made good by assessments, payable \u201cwithin thirty days from the date of notice of same.\u201d Defendant admits that it has been drawing from this fund continuously to pay death losses on other risks. No notice of this fact was given to plaintiff; no assessments were called to \u201cmake good the deficiencies.\u201d These withdrawals from the equation fund were practically secret assessments against plaintiff. The company claims that these secret assessments may now \u201cbe charged against the policy and deducted therefrom when it becomes a claim.\u201d This not allowable.\nL. K. Porter, with him S. G. Porter, Frank H. Kennedy and F. H. Calkins, for appellee.\nDefendant was under no obligation to make any assessment during the continuance of plaintiff\u2019s policy, because there was no deficiency in the equation fund for which an assessment could be levied under the terms of said policy.\nJanuary 3, 1910:\nDefendant was under no obligation to notify plaintiff that the estimated cash surrender value of the policy would not be realized, and the failure of defendant to maintain an equation fund sufficient to realize such estimate was not violative of the terms of plaintiff\u2019s policy.\nThe apportionment of the equation fund made by defendant was equitable: Uhlman v. Insurance Co., 109 N. Y. 421 (17 N. E. Repr. 363)."
