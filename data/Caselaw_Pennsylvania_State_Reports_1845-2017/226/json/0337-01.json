The testimony on behalf of the plaintiff tended to show that the tank fell because the steel substructure on which it rested gave way; that the substructure was defective in design and of insufficient strength to support the tank when filled with water; and that the design was an unusual one and had been selected and approved by the defendant. The court could not properly have said that under the testimony the plaintiff had not made out a case for the jury.\n\u2022The judgment is affirmed.",
