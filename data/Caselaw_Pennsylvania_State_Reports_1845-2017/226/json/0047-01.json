    "head_matter": "Kimmel's Estate.\nWill \u2014 Construction\u2014Gift to child \u2014 Remainder\u2014Intestacy.\n1. Testator in one clause of his will.provided as follows: \u201cI direct that fifteen hundred dollars be set aside for the use and maintenance of my daughter S., and after her death and paying her funeral expenses, the remainder shall be equally divided among my bodily heirs hereafter named, my executors shall manage the fund.\u201d In the clause immediately following he directed that his two sons, naming them, and that his two other daughters \u201cshall each share alike.\u201d Held, (1) that the \u201cremainder\u201d mentioned in the will was the remainder of the $1,500; (2) that testator died intestate as to his estate above the sum of $1,500, and (3) that S. was entitled to share equally with the other children in the portion of the estate as to which the testator died intestate.\nEstoppel \u2014 Partition\u2014Decedents \u2019 estates \u2014 Will.\n2. Where a woman ignorant of affairs and without legal advice, and without full knowledge of the facts, signs a paper in partition proceedings at the instance of her brother, by which she loses her share of her inheritance in her father\u2019s estate, she is not estopped from subsequently intervening in the partition proceedings and having them revoked and set aside.\nArgued Oct. 5, 1909.\nAppeals, Nos. 190 and 191, Oct. T., 1909, by Florence J. Claypool, from decrees of O. C. Armstrong Co., setting aside sale in partition in Estate of Lewis Kimmel, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition to intervene in partition proceedings, and to set aside a sale in such proceedings.\nOn the petition for intervention Patton, P. J., filed the following opinion:\nThe foundation of this application rests upon the construction of the last will and testament of Lewis Kimmel and especially upon the second and third items thereof, which said items read as follows:\n\u201cSecond I direct that fifteen hundred (1500) dollars be set aside for the use and maintenance of my daughter, Susie Sell, and after death and paying her funeral expenses the remainder shall be equally divided among my bodily heirs hereafter named, my executors shall manage the fund.\n\u201cThird: I direct that my sons, Tobias B. Kimmel and Solomon W. Kimmel and my daughters Carrie A. George and Florence J. Claypool, shall each share alike, Grace C. Kimmel, Sarah S. Kimmel and John A. Kimmel having preceded me to the spirit world.\u201d\nThe contention of Susie Sell, the petitioner, is that Lewis Kimmel devised only the $1,500 and his library (the latter in the fourth item of his will) and died intestate as to the balance of his real and personal estate. The claim of the contestants is that Lewis Kimmel devised his entire estate, real and personal, and (except as to the $1,500 and the library) it is to be divided among Tobias, Solomon, Carrie and Florence, share and share alike.\nBut few if any precedents or authorities can be found that will shed any light upon the question except those general and familiar rules laid down for the construction of all testamentary papers. The question is not what Lewis Kimmel intended to devise, but what he actually did devise. And in the paper before us the construction does not so much depend upon what was written as to what was left unwritten. We search the will in vain for any said familiar expressions as \u201cAs to such estate as it hath pleased God to intrust me with I give\u201d and \u201cAs to my worldly estate I give\u201d and no mention is made of either real or personal property and no disposition made of either except the $1,500 and the library.\nThe third item of the will says that the four devisees mentioned \u201cshall each share alike.\u201d But in what? In the real or personal property remaining after the $1,500 is distributed? The will does not say so, and we cannot read that into it.\nIn our opinion Susie Sell was the chief object of the testator\u2019s bounty, and it was she who was prominent in his mind, and it was primarily her welfare that he was seeking when he wrote the will. He first sets aside $1,500 for her use and maintenance and funeral expenses, and places the fund under the management of his executors; anticipating that there may be a balance remaining in their hands at Susie\u2019s death, he directs that this \u201c Remainder shall be equally divided among my bodily heirs hereinafter named.\u201d In the third item of his will he then proceeds to mention who his \u201cbodily heirs\u201d are and how this \u201cremainder\u201d of the $1,500 shall be distributed. And when he writes that Tobias, Solomon, Carrie and Florence \u201cshall each share alike\u201d it is in the balance of the $1,500 remaining in the hands of the executors after the death of Susie that they \u201cshall each share alike,\u201d and not the entire balance of the real and personal estate to the exclusion of Susie. Any other construction of the will would require us to exclude Susie, the favorite of the testator, from participating in his residuary estate and disinherit her without express words or necessary implication. This the law will not tolerate.\nIt is argued that the petitioner has estopped herself, by her acts and declarations, from coming in upon the fund.\nOn May 21, 1908, Solomon Kimmel presented a petition to the orphans\u2019 court setting forth that he, Tobias, Florence and Carrie were each the owner of the undivided one-fourth interest in the real estate of Lewis Kimmel, deceased, and that they and Susie Sell were all the heirs of said Lewis Kimmel. Susie Sell was named in the writ and duly served. She also accepted notice of the rule to show cause why the real estate should not be sold, asked the court for an order for a public sale and waived her right to bid on said real estate or take it at the appraisement. She further signed a paper setting forth that she was present at the sale to Linsenbigler; that she approved of it, and asked the court to confirm it, and waived the right to file any exceptions.\nEstoppels are governed by equitable principles. At the time she signed the papers above mentioned she was without legal advice, depending entirely upon what her brother Tobias (who was one of the executors and who claimed that she was not entitled to any interest in the estate) told her. If we are right in our construction of the will both Tobias Kimmel and his attorney misled Susie, although unintentionally. \u2022 She is a woman deserted by her husband, living remote from the county seat, her time taken up with domestic duties and in the care of her father in his declining years. It is not to be wondered at that she would sign any paper presented to her by her brother and his attorney in whom she had confidence. It would be most inequitable and unjust that under these circumstances she should lose her inheritance, and it is almost incredible that any brother or sister should ask us to do that which is repugnant to justice and fair dealing. The orphans\u2019 court is a court of equity and as far as able does those things which contribute to the furtherance of right and the suppression of wrong.\nAn estoppel to be binding must be intelligently made with a full knowledge of all the facts: Miller\u2019s Est., 159 Pa. 562; Harrington v. Stivanson, 210 Pa. 10.\nIt is argued that the decree of the orphans\u2019 court in partition is not binding as to the title of the present petitioner and that she can still assert her claim upon the fund. While this decree of the court stands it may well be doubted if she could attack that decree collaterally. It should be noticed that the petition for the partition is peculiar in this that Susie Sell is named as one of the \u201cheirs\u201d of Lewis Kimmel, and she is named in the writ the same as the others, although the petition denies that she has any interest in the real estate.\nViewing the whole matter from an equitable standpoint we think it but just and right that the petitioner, Susie Sell, should have her day in court, there to assert whatever rights she may have in the estate of her deceased father.\nAnd now, August 9, 1909, the decree of the court awarding an inquest dated May 21, 1908, and all proceedings thereunder including the sale, be rescinded, revoked and set aside, and the said Susie Sell is now allowed to intervene and file an answer in said partition proceedings in order that justice and equity may be done.\nNovember 5, 1909:\nThe court subsequently entered a decree setting aside the sale in partition proceedings.\nErrors assigned were (1) in permitting the intervention, and (2) in setting aside the sale.\nHarry C. Golden, with him H. M. Davidson and W. L. Peart, for appellant.\nThere was no authority: Woodside\u2019s Est., 188 Pa. 45; Vance\u2019s Est., 209 Pa. 561; Rawle\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 193; Miller\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 459.\nSusan Sell was estopped from objecting to the partition proceedings: Young v. Babilon, 91 Pa. 280; Donaghy\u2019s Est., 152 Pa. 92; King\u2019s Est., 215 Pa. 59; McClure v. McClure, 14 Pa. 134; Harlan v. Langham, 69 Pa. 235; Miller\u2019s Est., 159 Pa. 562.\nJ. W. King and H. A. Heilman, for appellees, were not heard."
