Langton.\nTrusts and trustees \u2014 Title to real estate \u2014 Execution\u2014Notice of trust\u2014 Sheriff\u2019s sale.\nWhere a trustee conveys real estate which he has held as trustee for himself and for his brothers and sister to another person by a deed which does not show the trust, but the grantee on being informed of the trust agrees to hold it on the same trusts as the grantor, a judgment creditor of the grantor who purchases the property at a sheriff\u2019s sale, with full knowledge of the facts relating to the trust, takes no more than the original trustee\u2019s individual interest in the property.\nArgued Oct. 21, 1909.\nAppeal, No. 117, Oct. T., 1909, by plaintiff, from decree of C. P. No. 2, Allegheny Co., Jan. T., 1909, No. 456, dismissing bill in equity in case of George M. Cote v. Thomas M. Langton, Sidney F. Langton, Andrew G. Langton, James A. Langton, Meade S. Langton and Ulysses G. Vogan.\nBefore Fell, Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nBill in equity by a judgment creditor of Thomas M. Langton.\nJanuary 3, 1910:\nFrazer, P. J., filed an opinion which-was in part as follows:\nThe purpose of the bill was to enjoin defendants from asserting title to certain real estate situated in Chartiers township, or claiming any interest therein as individuals, trustees or otherwise.\nIn our opinion the testimony clearly shows that Thomas M. Langton held the property in controversy in trust for himself and his brothers and sister. This fact was known to plaintiff long before he purchased the property at sheriff\u2019s sale. Consequently plaintiff by his sheriff\u2019s deed took no more than the interest of Thomas M. Langton. The situation was not changed in the least by the deed from Thomas M. Langton to U. G. Vogan. Mr. Vogan acted at the request of a fellow member of the bar in taking title to the property, and understood that he was taking it merely as trustee for Thomas M. Langton. Upon learning shortly afterward that Langton himself held as trustee for himself and brothers and sister, Vogan immediately agreed to hold the property under the same trusts and conditions that Thomas M. Langton held it. Under these circumstances plaintiff takes no more than the interest of Thomas M. Langton.\nThe court entered a decree dismissing the bill.\nError assigned was decree dismissing the bill.\nS. S. Robertson, for appellant.\nHarvey A. Miliar, for appellees."
