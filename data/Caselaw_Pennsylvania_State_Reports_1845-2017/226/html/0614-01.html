William Roseburg and Martha Owen Roseburg, his wife, by deed dated June 6, 1905, and recorded in the recorder’s office of Allegheny county, in deed book, volume 1401, page 88, conveyed to Joseph Hastings the real estate described in the second paragraph of plaintiff’s bill, the consideration therefor being $147,500, of which $47,500 was paid in cash and the balance secured by a purchase money mortgage on the premises, payable in three years, which mortgage was subsequently, on September 12, 1905, assigned to the Reliance Life Insurance Company.</p>

Lee Clark and Joseph Hastings, the title being placed in the name of Hastings for the reason that Clark did not wish to be generally known in the transaction. The purchase was made for speculation under a parol agreement between Clark and Hastings, under which the property was to be subdivided into lots and sold for their joint profit.</p>

To secure plaintiff against loss by his indorsement Clark and Hastings each assigned to him as collateral security 1,200 shares of the capital stock of the Ohio Valley Water Company.</p>

Lee Clark and Joseph Hastings, and deposited in the Enterprise National Bank of Allegheny, of which Clark was cashier, in an account opened June 15, 1905, and designated “Joseph Hastings Special.” The account of “Joseph Hastings Special” was kept separate and distinct from the individual accounts of Joseph Hastings and T. Lee Clark, and was also a separate and distinct account from the copartnership composed of Clark and Hastings.</p>

The engineer who subdivided the property was employed by Clark and Hastings jointly, both of whom visited the property from time to time while the work of surveying and grading the streets was being done, and gave the directions concerning the same, and they also jointly negotiated with a tenant upon the premises for the purchase or cancellation of his lease, and acted together in other matters relating to the property, both before and after its purchase by them.</p>

Lee Clark and Joseph Hastings, individually, the balance of the amount being paid chiefly by a loan obtained from the Second National Bank of Allegheny on a four months’ note for $10,000, dated October 16, 1905, made by T. Lee Clark to the <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>order of Joseph Hastings, and by Hastings indorsed.

Lee Clark, deceased, under and by virtue of which plaintiff was authorized to sell at public sale at the Pittsburg Stock Exchange the 2,400 shares of stock of the Ohio Valley Water Company held by him as collateral security, and credit the net proceeds from the sale of such stock on the indebtedness of $50,000 incurred by him as indorser on the two notes above referred to; that the stock was duly advertised and sold at public sale as provided in the agreement for the sum of $18,975.04, that being the highest price that could be realized for the same. Plaintiff has also received on account of his indebtedness the sum of $511.21 from the estate of T.

Hastings and Clark had together bought and sold real estate for a number of years, the title to the propexTy so purchased by them having always been taken in the name of Joseph Hastings.

There is no allegation or testimony tending <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>to show a written agreement between Clark and Hastings forming a partnership known as “Joseph Hastings Special” or that such agreement existed.</p>

Lee Clark purchased the Rose-burg property as' copartners is very doubtful. The testimony tending to show a partnership between them in that transaction is not convincing. While it appears that both were interested in the venture, joined together in raising the funds to <a id="p620" href="#p620" data-label="620" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*620</a>make the cash payment on the purchase, and opened an account in the Enterprise National Bank in the name of “Joseph Hastings Special,” out of which all payments on account of the property were made, there is nothing further tending to show a partnership except the testimony of the attorney of both Clark and Hastings to the effect that the Roseburg purchase was separate and distinct from transactions made by the “Hastings Land Company,” a partnership composed of Hastings and Clark, and that thé proceeds realized from the sale of lots were to be first applied to the payment of the purchase money mortgage, and the surplus of liquidating the notes indorsed by plaintiff. This testimony as a whole fails, in our opinion, to establish a partnership. On the contrary, the inference is strong that the property was held as tenants in common, rather than as partnership property. Had it been taken by them as copartners it seems to us the title would have been taken in the name of the Hastings Land Company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b652-4" data-blocks='[["BL_652.5",652,[316,1298,1158,1122]],["BL_653.1",653,[118,364,1160,1336]]]'>But whether the testimony does or does not establish a partnership in this case we think is immaterial in determining the case. While it is true a partnership may exist for the purpose of purchasing a tract of land and selling it out in lots, the land will not take the form of partnership property, except as between the partners, unless the deed or some other writing of record gives notice of that fact.' This is undoubtedly the law in this state, and has been so declared in an unbroken line of cases, beginning with Hale v. Henrie, <a href="/watts/2/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts 143" data-case-ids="1840152" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0143-01">2 Watts, 143</a>, and continuing down to the present time. In Hale v. Henrie the court says: “No averment of any right by parole, or by what is still.less, the nature of the funds which pays, or the uses or purposes the property is applied to, can be allowed to stamp a character on the'title inconsistent with that appearing on the deed and record to the prejudice of third persons.” In Mc-Dermot v. Laurence, 7 S. &amp; R. 438, it is said: “After a review of the American and English cases on the subject, where partners intend to bring real estate into the partnership stock, we think that intention must be manifested by deed or writing placed on record, that the purchasers may not be deceived.” In Stover v. Stover, <a href="/pa/180/0425-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="180 Pa. 425" data-case-ids="888382" data-case-paths="/pa/180/0425-01">180 Pa. 425</a>, the court says: “It is settled <a id="p621" href="#p621" data-label="621" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*621</a>that when two or more persons who are partners take title to land as tenants in common, the presumption arising from the deed is that they hold the title as tenants in common in equal shares. As between themselves the deed is not conclusive, but they hold in accordance with the facts. As to the purchasers and creditors, they hold in accordance with the record title: Ebbert’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="70 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="1028237" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0079-01">70 Pa. 79</a>. Taking and recording a deed as tenants in common gives character to the' title of the several holders upon which the public may safely rely. They are bound to take notice of what appears upon the records, and they have a right to act upon the faith of what they find there. Between the partners themselves the records' cannot mislead, nor can they change the fact. If real estate is purchased with partnership funds and for partnership purposes, the general rule is that it is thereby made partnership, assets. But it is equally well settled that as to purchasers and creditors the deed will control: Ebbert’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="70 Pa. 79" data-case-ids="1028237" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0079-01">70 Pa. 79</a>; Appeal of the Second National Bank of Titusville, <a href="/pa/83/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="83 Pa. 203" data-case-ids="1050802" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0203-01">83 Pa. 203</a>; Geddes’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/84/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="84 Pa. 482" data-case-ids="1053557" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0482-01">84 Pa. 482</a> — for the parties will be presumed to have put their title on record in accordance with the facts, and those who deal with them have a right to act upon this presumption. When it comes to a question of distribution of the proceeds of a sale of land so held, the individual creditor of a cotenant will have priority over the firm, claiming by virtue of its title and in contradiction of the deed.”</p>

It therefore makes no difference whether the Roseburg property was partnership property or not. The deed was taken in the name of Joseph Hastings, and so long as the title stood upon the records in his name his creditors had a right to rely upon what was there shown and consider it as his individual property. Any other conclusion would be in direct conflict with the authorities above cited.
