In such a case plaintiff’s injuries were the result of the negligence of a fellow servant, and he cannot therefore recover.</p>

The evidence shows that he was brushed off the side of a moving car by another car which was standing on a switch, the latter car not having been pushed in upon the switch past the danger post. And while it does not appear who the individuals were who pushed this car onto the siding, yet it is in evidence that all cars were placed upon sidings by crews in the employ of the defendant company, consisting of a conductor, engineer, fireman and brakeman. And even if this did not appear in evidence we could not presume the car was negligently placed in the position that it was found to be in by others than those whom common experience teaches us ordinarily perform the duty of placing cars upon switches, viz.: a crew generally consisting of a conductor, engineer, fireman and brakeman.
