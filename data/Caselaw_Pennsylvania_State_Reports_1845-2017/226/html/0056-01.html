    <p id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.9",90,[323,884,1150,1229]]]'>The appellant brewing company, a domestic corporation, was refused a license on the sole ground of the applicant being an unfit corporation to be licensed. The learned judge of the quarter sessions filed an opinion in which the reason for refusing the license and the character of the weight of the evidence relied on to sustain the order of refusal are clearly stated. This opinion in its entirety is as follows, to wit: "At the hearing of this application there were presented petitions favoring the application and remonstrances against the granting of the license, by reason of the unfitness of the applicant. The petitions filed contained the names of about three thousand residents of the county and the remonstrances the names of about five thousand residents of the county entitled to the court’s consideration. Of the remonstrants about two thousand were men and three thousand, women. From an examination of these petitions and remonstrances, having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners and remonstrants, we find that the weight of the evidence rests with the remonstrants and that the unfitness of the applicant is established by the weight of the evidence. Whenever in the opinion of the court this fact should be found from the evidence, the statute under which the application is made requires that the license shall be refused.”</p>
    <p id="b90-7" data-blocks='[["BL_90.10",90,[323,2123,1146,315]],["BL_91.1",91,[110,399,1153,2048]],["BL_92.1",92,[313,402,1156,1931]]]'>An examination of the opinion shows that the question of fitness was determined at the hearing upon the record made up by the application, the additional petitions favoring the license and the remonstrances filed against the granting of it. The record thus made up forms the pleadings in the case and is now properly before this court for review: Brewing Com<a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>pany’s Petition, <a href="/pa/127/0523-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="127 Pa. 523" data-case-ids="565753" data-case-paths="/pa/127/0523-01">127 Pa. 523</a>. There is thus presented for determination the narrow question, Does the weight of the evidence gathered from the petitions and remonstrances furnish a legal reason for refusing the license? The only averment contained in the remonstrances is that the applicant is not a “fit corporation” to be licensed, and upon this naked averment more numerously signed by persons who objected to the granting of the license than by those who favored it, the learned judge found that the unfitness of the applicant had been established by the weight of the evidence. The application was made under the Act of June 9, 1891, P. L. 257, which relates to wholesale dealers, brewers, distillers, rectifiers, compounders, bottlers, storekeepers and agents. The most casual reading of this act will show that the draughtsman had in mind primarily the granting of licenses to natural persons, and the phraseology as well as the requirements followed this primary purpose. As for instance one of the jurisdictional facts to be averred in the application is the place of birth of the applicant, and, if a naturalized citizen, when and where naturalized. While this is an imperative requirement of the act as applied to natural persons, it cannot of necessity apply to a corporation. There are other statutory provisions and requirements which cannot in the very nature of things apply in the same manner to natural and artificial persons. While the obvious purpose of the act under which this application is made is to regulate the granting of licenses to individuals, this court in order to give general effect to the spirit and purpose of the license laws in restraining the sale of liquors, has held that corporations created for the purpose of manufacturing and selling liquors, come within its purview, and that the proceedings in the granting of licenses to such corporations are assimilated as far as may be to the licensing of natural persons. The assimilative process, however, must necessarily have due regard to the natural and legal distinctions relating to each class of applicants. There can be no doubt that the words “fit persons” used in the act were intended to apply primarily to individuals, and the question raised by this record is in what manner ought these words be <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>made applicable to a corporation seeking a license. In determining the fitness of a natural person and of a corporation very different questions arise. In the case of an individual the qualities of the man, such as moral character, temperate habits, business integrity, citizenship and other kindred matters, are the important and frequently the controlling considerations with the court. With corporations the inquiry is different. A corporation has no personal attributes and must be judged by its corporate acts. In the present case the only averment in the remonstrances upon which the court based its finding is that the applicant is not a “fit corporation” to be licensed. This is clearly not sufficient. This corporation was created by the commonwealth with the authority to do the business in which it is engaged. To hold upon the naked averment of an individual or a large number of individuals that á corporation is not fit to engage in the business for which it was created would be to challenge the power of the legislature to authorize its incorporation and such a contention could not be seriously made. Of course, a corporation made fit by the act of incorporation to engage in the manufacture and sale of liquor may become unfit within the meaning of the license laws by corporate acts committed in violation of law by its directors, officers and authorized agents. In this sense the fitness of a corporation presenting an application for a license may be inquired into. When unlawful acts such as selling on Sunday, or to minors, or to persons of known intemperate habits, or any other violations of the law, are relied on to defeat the application, the evidence whether presented in a remonstrance or produced by witnesses at the hearing must establish to the satisfaction of the court the unlawful acts complained of. Such evidence must come from persons who know the facts, and numerously signed petitions or remonstrances expressing the views of the signers on the license question generally can have no weight in determining whether particular sales had been made, or specific acts had been committed, in violation of law.</p>
    <p id="b92-4" data-blocks='[["BL_92.5",92,[312,2344,1144,97]],["BL_93.1",93,[136,382,1152,2047]],["BL_94.1",94,[287,378,1150,789]]]'>Again the learned judge who passed upon the application in the opinion above quoted states in substance that the <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>petitions filed contain the names of about 3,000 residents of the county and the remonstrances the names of about 5,000 residents entitled to consideration, and having due regard to the number and character of the signers, he finds the weight of the evidence to be with the remonstrants and that the unfitness of the applicant is thus established. As has been hereinbefore pointed out, the unfitness of a corporation cannot be established in this manner, and it is immaterial which side to the controversy preponderates in numbers. If, however, it was intended to announce the principle that the judgment and discretion of the court are absolutely and conclusively bound by the preponderating number of the petitioners or remonstrants, such a conclusion would be clear error. This in effect would amount to a substitution of the wishes or convictions of-a majority of the signers for the judgment of the court, and this is not the law. The act imposes upon the court the duty to hear and determine, and the judge must decide whether the weight of the evidence, or all of it, makes out a case which in the exercise of a legal discretion requires a refusal. Having due regard to the number and character of the signers does not mean that in a judicial proceeding the issue resolves itself into a problem in arithmetic in which the court simply adds the columns and announces the result. In the granting of licenses to wholesale and retail dealers the question of necessity, applicable alike to corporations and to natural persons, is of first importance, and in such cases nearly every resident of a community has a fixed opinion upon this question which can as well be indicated by signing a petition or remonstrance as in any other manner. In an issue of this kind the number and character of signers should have great weight with the court. As to a brewing company the question of necessity cannot arise because it is so expressly written in the law, and if the applicant be a corporation, its unfitness must be established by evidence showing the commission of unlawful acts. If the applicant be an individual, moral character, temperate or intemperate habits, business integrity, and other personal qualities may always be inquired into. In such a case, however, the evidence <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>whether by remonstrance or by oral testimony should come from persons who know the facts relied on to establish the unfitness of the applicant in the respects charged. If the applicant be a corporation, questions of moral character, intemperate habits and other personal qualities cannot be raised because in no proper legal sense can such attributes relate to a corporate entity. The only method of establishing the unfitness of a corporation is to show that in the conduct or management of its business it has been guilty of violating the law. It is clear, therefore, that in the hearing of such an application numerously signed petitions or remonstrances by persons without knowledge of any unlawful act or acts having been committed should have no weight in determining whether the applicant had been guilty of violating the law.</p>
    <p id="b94-4" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[279,1187,1155,1067]]]'>The learned Superior Court in reviewing this case suggested that the language of the opinion permits the presumption that other evidence besides the remonstrances may have been considered in determining the propriety of granting the application. We do not so read or understand the language used. No one can read the opinion and give reasonable interpretation to its meaning without concluding the learned judge who wrote it meant what he said and said what he meant. He has specifically, stated the evidence upon which he relied and has given the reason which moved him to refuse the application, and we are not at liberty to presume he intended something else.

The application was filed in November, 1908. Additional petitions were filed in support of the application and remonstrances were filed against it. The court of quarter sessions gave the parties a hearing at the time fixed by the rules of court in February, 1909, and after dué consideration of the petitions and remonstrances and other matters required to be considered by the court, the learned judge of the quarter sessions refused the license. An appeal was taken from his decision to the Superior Court and by the unanimous judgment of that court the order of the quarter sessions refusing the license was affirmed. A petition of the brewing company was then presented to Mr. Justice Elkin of this court at chambers in Indiana and he entered the following order: “And now, July 30, 1909, appeal with certiorari allowed as prayed for.” The case was argued on October 12 in this court, and by a bare majority of its members the order of the quarter sessions refusing the license, as well as the decree of the Superior Court affirming the quarter sessions, are to be reversed, and a peremptory order made by this court directing the quarter sessions to issue the license. An opinion has been prepared by Mr. Justice Elkin to be handed down expressing the views of the four members of this court who concur therein.</p>

L. 257, entitled, “An act to restrain and regulate the sale of vinous, spirituous, malt or brewed liquors, or any admixture thereof, by wholesale.” The petition and supplemental petitions accompanying the application were signed by 3,090 persons, purporting to be residents of Indiana county, and averred “that said Indian Brewing Company is a fit corporation to which such license should be granted.” Remonstrances were filed against the granting of the license and were signed by 5,191 persons, purporting to be residents <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>of Indiana county, and averred that “the applicant is not a fit person or corporation to be granted the license applied for.” In addition to these remonstrances two reputable members of the Indiana county bar and members of the bar of this court, acting as attorneys for the remonstrants, filed specific charges of violations of the law against the applicant (1) for illegally selling malt or brewed liquors, and (2) for selling malt or brewed liquors contrary to the provisions of the Act of assembly of June 21, 1897, P. L. 176, which provides: “When any court shall have refused a license for any particular brewery the sale of said liquors at said brewery shall not be permitted under this act until the expiration of one year after the date of the application for the license which has been so refused.” At the time provided by the rules of court, the learned judge of the quarter sessions gave the parties a full hearing, at which both parties were represented by counsel; and after due consideration the application for a license was refused. The court filed the following opinion: “At the hearing of this application there were presented petitions favoring the application and remonstrances against the granting of the license, by reason of the unfitness of the applicant. The petitions filed contained the names of about three thousand residents of the county and the remonstrances the names of about five thousand residents of the county entitled to the court's consideration. Of the remonstrants about two thousand were men and three thousand, women. Prom an examination of these petitions and remonstrances, having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners and remonstrants, we find that the weight of the evidence rests with the remonstrants and that the unfitness of the applicant is established by the weight of the evidence. Whenever in the opinion of the court this fact should be found from the evidence, the statute under which the application is made requires that the license shall be refused.”</p>

The petitioners averred that the brewing company was a fit person or corporation to have the license and the remonstrants averred directly the contrary. Upon the issue thus made, both parties were permitted to file petitions and to introduce any other evidence which they desired.

As has been noted, this application was made under the act of June 9, 1891. The sixth section of the act provides as follows: “The court of quarter sessions shall hear petitions from residents of the county, in addition to that of the applicant, in favor of and remonstrances against the application for such license, and in all cases shall refuse the same whenever in the opinion of the <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>said, court having due regard to the number and character of the petitioners for and against such application, such license is not necessary for the accommodation of the public, or that the applicant or applicants is or are not fit persons to whom such license should be granted.” The fourth section of the act provides that the provision “ as to whether the place to be licensed is necessary shall not apply to a brewery or distillery.” The only question, therefore, under the statute for the consideration of the court in granting or refusing an application for a brewer’s license is whether the applicant is or is not a fit person to whom the license should be granted. The second section of the act provides, inter alia, that “the said court shall fix by rule or standing order a time at which application for said licenses shall be heard, at which time all persons applying or making objections to applications for licenses may be heard by evidence, petition, remonstrance or counsel.”</p>

This is distinctly ruled by this court in Reed’s App., <a href="/pa/114/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="114 Pa. 452" data-case-ids="550040" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0452-01">114 Pa. 452</a>, an application for a wholesale liquor license.

Justice Elkin says: “There is thus presented (to this court) for determination the narrow question, Does the weight of the evidence gathered from the petitions and remonstrances furnish a legal reason for refusing the license? The only averment contained in the remonstrance is that the applicant is not a 'fit corporation’ to be licensed and upon this naked averment, more numerously signed by persons who objected to the granting of the license than by those who favored it, the learned judge found that the <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>unfitness of the applicant had been established by the weight of the evidence.” It will thus be observed that the majority of the court holds that it is the duty of this court to weigh the evidence and determine whether the license should have been granted; that it is for this court to determine whether the applicant is a “fit corporation” to be licensed. This is in the’ teeth of all the authorities and is the fundamental error which leads the maj ority to its incorrect conclusion. This, as pointed out in the authorities cited, is a certiorari, on which this court can determine only whether the court below in passing upon the application conformed its action to the statutes regulating the subject. This court has nothing to do with the evidence in the case or in determining whether its weight is in favor of or against the application. It has no authority to examine and consider the petitions or remonstrances or any evidence which was produced at the hearing for the purpose of determining the facts. Those matters were for the quarter sessions and for that court only, and when this court attempts, as it does, to consider and determine the weight of the evidence for and against the license it is confronted by an unbroken line of our own decisions condemning its action. The reason assigned by the quarter sessions for refusing the license is a valid one under the act of assembly, and hence an appellate court cannot inquire into the reason or determine whether the evidence sustains the quarter sessions in its conclusions. No further discussion of this paragraph of the majority opinion is necessary, as the authorities cited above clearly covers the question and convicts the majority of palpable error.</p>
    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[115,1903,1151,533]],["BL_102.1",102,[314,380,1148,900]]]'>The majority opinion concedes that the wholesale liquor license act of 1891 applies to corporations, and suggests that the “ question raised by this record is in what manner ought these words (fit persons) be made applicable to a corporation seeking a license. ... A corporation has no personal attributes and must be judged-by its corporate acts. In the present case the only averment in the remonstrances upon which the court based its finding is that the applicant is not a ‘fit corporation’ to be licensed. This is clearly not sufficient.” The finding of the quarter sessions is: “That the unfitness of <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>the applicant is established by the weight of the evidence.” The additional petitions in favor of the license aver that the Indian Brewing Company, “is a fit corporation to which such license should be granted,” and the remonstrances allege that the applicant “is not a fit person or corporation to be granted the license applied for.” This is the issue made by the pleadings and the one which the act of 1891 requires the quarter sessions to pass on in determining the applicant’s right to a license. How was this issue to be determined? As we have seen, the statute points out specifically that the court shall hear petitions, remonstrances, and any evidence which the parties may desire to introduce for and against the application. Such evidence was presented to and considered by the quarter sessions, and upon it the learned judge based his refusal of a license. It was the acts of the applicant corporation, as disclosed by the evidence, which compelled the quarter sessions to refuse the license.</p>

The sixth section of the Act of June 9, 1891, P. L. 257, provides that the quarter sessions shall not grant the license if the applicant is not a fit person. It is wholly immaterial why he is not a fit person, and if the remonstrants on the hearing convince the court that for any reason he is unfit, then the act prohibits the granting of the license. For aught we know, the quarter sessions found that this corporation had violated many of the laws of the commonwealth regulating the sale of intoxicating liquors. Specific charges were filed to that effect by reputable members of the bar of Indiana county in behalf of the remonstrants, and we must assume that these or other illegal acts, making the applicant unfit, were established to the satisfaction of the court. As pointed out above, our decisions all hold that the judge has the right to act on facts affecting the fitness of the applicant which are within his own knowledge. He therefore had before him in considering this application the fact that he had refused this same applicant a license during the previous year, because it was shown to his satis<a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>faction by evidence that the Indian Brewing Company was guilty of seven specific charges of violating the liquor laws of the commonwealth. The refusal of the license was based upon the evidence, as appears by the opinion of the learned judge, wherein he says: “We find that the weight of the evidence rests with the remonstrants and that the unfitness of the applicant is established by the weight of the evidence. Whenever in the opinion of the court this fact should be found from the evidence, the statute under which the application is made requires that the license shall be refused.” It is apparent, therefore, that the averment of unfitness by the remonstrants was supplemented by evidence which convinced the court of the unfitness of the corporation to receive a brewer’s license, and required the quarter sessions, under the statute, to deny the application.</p>

The case is being considered here upon a writ of certiorari, which brings up simply the record, and the evidence, including the petitions and remonstrances, are no part of the record for the purpose of determining the fitness of the applicant. Notwithstanding these facts, the majority of the court enters a mandatory order on the quarter sessions to issue the license, instead of awarding a procedendo requiring that court to again hear and determine the applicant’s right to the- license.
