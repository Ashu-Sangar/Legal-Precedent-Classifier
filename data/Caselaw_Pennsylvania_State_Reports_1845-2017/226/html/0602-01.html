This mode of using the building continued until about the first of the year 1908, when the first floor was rented from month to month to a book auctioneer. About this time the city of Pittsburg required the closing of the areaway as a purpresture, and access to the basement was cut off, except through the storeroom. . . .</p>

Negotiations were had between Mrs. McClure, by the Commonwealth Trust Company, her agent, and Davis during this time as to the rent, and on March 3, 1908, Davis was notified by the lessor that she intended, if the rent were not paid, to enter on the premises as agent for Davis and relet the same, under the terms of the lease. At about the same time, and during the same negotiations, the question of the advisability of dividing the first floor by partitions and letting to different tenants was discussed by Mrs. McClure’s agent and Davis, Davis making no objection to doing so and furnishing to her agents the plans which he had himself prepared for making such a change.- . . .</p>

Whereupon the court made an order granting the petitioner leave to enter and relet the premises. It is admitted by the parties that this was done merely for the purpose of avoiding any apparent discourtesy to the United States court.</p>

At and before the time of the petition in bankruptcy the Commonwealth Trust Company was endeavoring to find a tenant for the whole of the first floor, and was in communication on this subject with the renting department of the Real Estate Trust Company, but being unable to find a tenant for the whole determined upon a subdivision, which was not communicated to the Real Estate Trust Company, except that in the renting negotiations they knew that it was proposed to <a id="p605" href="#p605" data-label="605" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*605</a>rent a part of the store to one Raubitschek in case a lease could not be made for the whole.</p>

On March 23, 1908, Mrs. McClure entered upon the premises .and began the work of subdividing the lower floor and the basement, which was effected by putting up two lath and plaster partitions on the first floor, and corresponding partitions in the basement and making a way into the basement from each portion of the first floor in place of the only way which existed before, which had been closed up by the city as above stated. These changes cost something over $4,000 and took some thirty days to make, and were made substantially in accordance with Davis’ plan furnished to Mrs. McClure above mentioned, except that in one or two instances a pillar was placed in a different location from that shown in the plan. The making of these alterations so as to permit the first floor to be rented to different tenants was greatly for the benefit of all parties concerned and was the proper way to rent the premises so as to produce the largest income therefrom. The partitions are removable, and the building can easily be restored to its original condition.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b638-4" data-blocks='[["BL_638.5",638,[311,496,1155,1660]]]'>2. As to the $25,000 special deposit, the plaintiff claims that the entry by Mrs. McClure upon the premises and the alterations made by her has discharged the Real Estate Trust Company as surety, either as having modified the terms of the contract, or amounting to an eviction, or worked a forfeiture. We are unable to see how the alterations in the building and the leasing of the first floor to three persons instead of one is in any way a change of the contract of the surety. The lease contemplated subletting, and the stipulation in the lease under which Mrs. McClure entered; expressly provides that she may rclet the premises “or any part or parts thereof,” and it must be understood that these parts might be separated from each other by partitions. It is claimed, however, that this clause authorizing the reletting by the lessor is repugnant to the nature of the estate granted, and amounts to nothing but a forfeiture clause and that the entry under it effects a forfeiture, or if not, is an eviction. We cannot see anything in this contract which is repugnant to the nature of the lease, but only an additional remedy which the lessor may have if the lessee makes default in payment. The case is strictly analogous to those cases in which it has been held that, without an agreement to that effect, the landlord may enter upon the premises from which the tenant has removed and relet them, giving credit to the tenant for the rents so received. The remedy was one which the surety itself stipulated should be invoked before it became liable for the rent. We are, 'therefore, of opinion that there is nothing in either the alterations of the premises or the reletting of them by Mrs. McClure which releases the surety from liability to her, and the surety is, therefore, entitled to retain the special deposit held by it as indemnity for this suretyship.</p>
