Second, that there is no specific proof of any negligence in the case upon the part of defendant company, resulting in the accident to the plaintiff.</p>

      <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>The Court: I have listened to you intently during the rather protracted argument of this case, because it is an important case, especially to this plaintiff, who has been so seriously injured, and I wished to get a proper conclusion of the matter. I have come to the conclusion that it is the duty of the court to dispose of the case. The plaintiff.was injured December 23, 1905, while in the employ of the defendant company, as conductor of a transportation train of thirteen cars, within the defendant company’s ground, by being struck by some object projecting from the rear car of the train and knocked under it. It does not appear from the evidence whether the car in question belonged to the defendant company or was that of some railroad company in which material was being brought into defendant company’s works. It does not appear when, where, or by whom it was loaded, or when it came into the condition in which it was at the time of the accident. If the car was the property of the defendant company, and was loaded on its grounds, and by its workmen, there is no evidence to show this, and, consequently, no evidence showing that it was negligently loaded by defendant’s workmen. If it was not a car of the defendant company, but belonged to a railroad company and was being used to bring in material to defendant’s works, there is no evidence that its condition was actually known to the defendant company or that it had been in its possession a sufficient length of time to charge it with constructive knowledge of that condition. We think there is no proof of specific negligence on part of defendant company in the respects charged in plaintiff’s statement of claim. If it be said that the fact of the projecting object is evidence from which negligence may be inferred, yet there is no evidence from which it may be ascertained whose negligence it was and whether such as can be charged to the defendant company.</p>

Under all the evidence, therefore, we are disposed to believe <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>that there can be no recovery, and the motion for a compulsory nonsuit is therefore sustained. This seems to be a case that it is the duty of the court to dispose of. A case of this character we would much prefer to submit to the jury, if the rules of law permitted us to do so, by reason of the severe injury that the plaintiff has sustained, but we are quite clear that under the evidence, as it is before us, the court would be disregarding its duty in submitting this case, for the reason that under the law there cannot be a recovery, and for that reason you are discharged from any further duty in the case.</p>
