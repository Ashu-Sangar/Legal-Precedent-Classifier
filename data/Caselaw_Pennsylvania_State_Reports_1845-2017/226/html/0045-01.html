The land described in said deed consisted of a lot of ground situate on what is now West Jefferson street in the borough of Butler, and also an undivided one-half interest, being the whole interest of William Bauer in ten acres of land now wholly within said borough, being the interest now in dispute. The deed after being executed by William Bauer and wife, was given into the possession of said wife where it remained until December 14, 1875, when it was left for record by William Bauer. Benjamin Bauer, grantee in trust in said deed, had no knowledge, as he testifies, of its execution or existence, until after the present litigation was begun. William Bauer testifies that this deed conveying the life estate in the property to his wife was in <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>consideration of the fact that it was her money which had been used in the purchase of said lot on Jefferson street, the title to which had been taken in his own name. In so far as the children were, concerned^ the deed was a purely voluntary conveyance on the part of both William and wife.</p>

Executions were issued on the judgments, entered December 13 as well as on said other judgments, and the said Jefferson street property and also the undivided one-half interest in the ten acres were levied upon as the property of William Bauer and sold to John Berg &amp; Company by deed of George Walter, sheriff, dated June 21, 1876.</p>
