At and prior to the time of the execution of the foregoing agreement a large portion of the land in and about what is designated therein as Stewart station, at or near the boundary line between Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, was acquired by the East Pittsburg Improvement Company, and a portion thereof was laid out in lots under the name of Trafford City.</p>

The defendant railway company constructed a single track on the public highway under and by virtue of the terms of said agreement between the eastern limits of the borough of Pitcairn and the western limit or boundary of said township or county line, in length slightly over a mile, with two sidings for the passage of cars. At present two cars, making thirty-<a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>six trips each per day, averaging from four to six persons per trip, seem to be all that are in use for the purpose of accommodating the travel between said points.</p>

At or about or since the filing of this bill certain repairs have been made between the tracks and roadway of defendant company, but it is apparent that neither the roadway nor the tracks are in the condition of repair stipulated for bj^ the agreement, and it is further apparent that the condition of the highway along the track, owing not only to the lack of repairs but to the grade from the railway tracks to the edge of the highway, has resulted in making the public roadway less desirable for travel than before the railway tracks were placed thereon as maintained at present.</p>

In 1902 upon ten acres of land at or in what is now said Trafford City, the Westinghouse Foundry Company, having secured title therefor from the East Pittsburg Improvement or the Securities Investment Company, built a foundry plant. This consists of a main building about 600 feet long by 200 feet in width, and four other buildings of about the same length but different widths, in which five buildings are housed, the machinery and works of the foundry people, its power house and various other works and operations, constituting a part of said foundry plant. Operations were begun in October, <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>1903; the number of employees has run from 200 to 600 men; the products turned out are complete castings, shipped from there by a private railway system to the other Westinghouse interests at Wilmerding, and other points in that vicinity. The town of Trafford City has about 1,500 population, with paved streets, stores and a bank; the number of houses is about 200.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b407-3" data-blocks='[["BL_407.4",407,[130,748,1155,691]]]'>7. It is estimated that the construction of an additional track between Trafford City and Pitcairn, including the improvements of the highway caused by the building of said additional track, is about 134,000. There is no evidence tending to show that there is a present demand for the additional track; nor is there any evidence tending to show that if the additional track were built and the public were better accommodated by re'ason thereof that increased traffic would not result. The defendant company’s road now connects with, or has a traffic arrangement with, another street or passenger railway at Trafford City, extending eastwardly to Irwin and Greens-burg in Westmoreland county, forming a complete line from these easterly points through and into the city of Pittsburg.</p>

In consideration of the grant of the use of the public highway from Pitcairn to what is now Trafford City by the supervisors of Patton township, to the defendant railways company, the latter agreed specifically as to the construction of the roadway, the character of pavement, the conditions outside of the rails, the grade of the road to be in conformity with the grade of the tracks so as to permit easy access to or from the same, and also within one year after the proposed Westinghouse foundry at Stewart station was erected to double-track said road.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[286,483,1151,792]]]'>2. It clearly appearing that the brick pavement between the tracks is uneven and rough, sunken between the ties; that the additional foot on the outside of the tracks is not constructed as the contract provided for and is below the level of the top of the rails; that the grade of the tracks does not correspond with the grade of the road; that cross ties have decayed and disappeared; that the slope from the top of the rails to the outer edge of the road is far too steep, as a result of which defects, caused by the noncompliance with the provisions of the contract, vehicles cannot drive on or off the tracks with ease; the terms of the contract require, and the duty of the defendant company is to put its pavement, roadbed, track-level, the space outside and the grade outside of the tracks in the exact conditions specifically set forth by the contract on every part of said line within three months of the date of final decree.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.6",408,[283,1293,1153,959]]]'>3. The Westinghouse foundry, including all the buildings, tracks and operations conducted at Trafford City, with its finished daily product and number of employees, fulfills the condition as to the proposed foundry that the contract said should be established; this, coupled with the development and growth of the town of Trafford City as shown by its population, number of houses, both private and business, has fully met the reasonable proposition contemplated and provided for by the parties when the contract was executed. The existence of the foundry, its various buildings, operations, etc., are a fact which cannot be overcome by the theory that other and additional plans were in the contemplation of parties in no way connected with those who' entered into the contract which is before us — conditions which at least the supervisors had no knowledge of and which were not in their minds when they executed this grant. Specific performance to the extent of requiring the defendant company to double-track its road from Pitcairn to Trafford City necessarily follows.</p>
