    <p class="summary" id="b80-4" data-blocks='[["BL_80.5",80,[319,482,1150,197]]]'>The foundation of this application rests upon the construction of the last will and testament of Lewis Kimmel and especially upon the second and third items thereof, which said items read as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b80-5" data-blocks='[["BL_80.6",80,[319,696,1150,263]]]'>“Second I direct that fifteen hundred (1500) dollars be set aside for the use and maintenance of my daughter, Susie Sell, and after death and paying her funeral expenses the remainder shall be equally divided among my bodily heirs hereafter named, my executors shall manage the fund.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b80-7" data-blocks='[["BL_80.8",80,[319,1237,1149,414]]]'>The contention of Susie Sell, the petitioner, is that Lewis Kimmel devised only the $1,500 and his library (the latter in the fourth item of his will) and died intestate as to the balance of his real and personal estate. The claim of the contestants is that Lewis Kimmel devised his entire estate, real and personal, and (except as to the $1,500 and the library) it is to be divided among Tobias, Solomon, Carrie and Florence, share and share alike.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b80-8" data-blocks='[["BL_80.9",80,[318,1670,1149,635]]]'>But few if any precedents or authorities can be found that will shed any light upon the question except those general and familiar rules laid down for the construction of all testamentary papers. The question is not what Lewis Kimmel intended to devise, but what he actually did devise. And in the paper before us the construction does not so much depend upon what was written as to what was left unwritten. We search the will in vain for any said familiar expressions as “As to such estate as it hath pleased God to intrust me with I give” and “As to my worldly estate I give” and no mention is made of either real or personal property and no disposition made of either except the $1,500 and the library.</p>

In the real <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>or personal property remaining after the $1,500 is distributed? The will does not say so, and we cannot read that into it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-4" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[106,495,1155,1073]]]'>In our opinion Susie Sell was the chief object of the testator’s bounty, and it was she who was prominent in his mind, and it was primarily her welfare that he was seeking when he wrote the will. He first sets aside $1,500 for her use and maintenance and funeral expenses, and places the fund under the management of his executors; anticipating that there may be a balance remaining in their hands at Susie’s death, he directs that this “ Remainder shall be equally divided among my bodily heirs hereinafter named.” In the third item of his will he then proceeds to mention who his “bodily heirs” are and how this “remainder” of the $1,500 shall be distributed. And when he writes that Tobias, Solomon, Carrie and Florence “shall each share alike” it is in the balance of the $1,500 remaining in the hands of the executors after the death of Susie that they “shall each share alike,” and not the entire balance of the real and personal estate to the exclusion of Susie. Any other construction of the will would require us to exclude Susie, the favorite of the testator, from participating in his residuary estate and disinherit her without express words or necessary implication. This the law will not tolerate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-5" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[110,1579,1151,98]]]'>It is argued that the petitioner has estopped herself, by her acts and declarations, from coming in upon the fund.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.7",81,[108,1688,1154,693]]]'>On May 21, 1908, Solomon Kimmel presented a petition to the orphans’ court setting forth that he, Tobias, Florence and Carrie were each the owner of the undivided one-fourth interest in the real estate of Lewis Kimmel, deceased, and that they and Susie Sell were all the heirs of said Lewis Kimmel. Susie Sell was named in the writ and duly served. She also accepted notice of the rule to show cause why the real estate should not be sold, asked the court for an order for a public sale and waived her right to bid on said real estate or take it at the appraisement. She further signed a paper setting forth that she was present at the sale to Linsenbigler; that she approved of it, and asked the court to confirm it, and waived the right to file any exceptions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[156,2391,1107,45]],["BL_82.1",82,[326,389,1152,965]]]'>Estoppels are governed by equitable principles. At the <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>time she signed the papers above mentioned she was without legal advice, depending entirely upon what her brother Tobias (who was one of the executors and who claimed that she was not entitled to any interest in the estate) told her. If we are right in our construction of the will both Tobias Kimmel and his attorney misled Susie, although unintentionally. • She is a woman deserted by her husband, living remote from the county seat, her time taken up with domestic duties and in the care of her father in his declining years. It is not to be wondered at that she would sign any paper presented to her by her brother and his attorney in whom she had confidence. It would be most inequitable and unjust that under these circumstances she should lose her inheritance, and it is almost incredible that any brother or sister should ask us to do that which is repugnant to justice and fair dealing. The orphans’ court is a court of equity and as far as able does those things which contribute to the furtherance of right and the suppression of wrong.</p>
