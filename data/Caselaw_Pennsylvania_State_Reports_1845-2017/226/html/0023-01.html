    <p class="syllabus" id="b55-8" data-blocks='[["BL_55.8",55,[154,1374,1152,450]]]'>1. At a murder trial the declarations of the murdered man are admissible, although made more than two hours after the shooting, and at a time when the deceased was able to walk a considerable distance, and although he did not die until the fourth day afterwards; and such declarations are admissible although a doctor told the deceased that the wound was not necessarily fatal, if it appears that notwithstanding such assurance the deceased believed that he was dying, and did in fact die from the wound. The test was the state of the mind of the deceased when making the declarations, and whether they were made under a sense of impending death.</p>
    <p class="syllabus" id="b55-9" data-blocks='[["BL_55.9",55,[157,1830,1149,216]]]'>2. On such a trial the admission of evidence that the prisoner had a prejudice against natives of Calabria of whom the deceased was one, is not error. Such evidence in some degree tends to show motive, and is proper for the jury's consideration in determining the degree of the crime.</p>

Gilmore, the physician and surgeon who attended the deceased, that he visited him at 9 o’clock on the night on which he was shot; that he stated to him that he would have an equal chance of recovery if he would go to the hospital and submit to an operation; that the deceased said to the doctor that, “ If I have a chance to get well I will go to the hospital,” and thereupon consented to be taken to the hospital; to be followed by proof that he actually was taken to the hospital at Lock Haven.

He called the Calabrians sons of bitches; that he blamed his wife with running away with a man by the name of Ferzina who was a Calabrian, and that Latampa made like statements showing hostility to the Calabrians as a class.

The more specific the design the greater its probative value. There may come a point at which the design is too indefinite in its indications to be of any probative value, but the mere' fact that it is generic, that it points toward a class of acts, does not destroy its relevancy providing the purpose naturally includes the act charged. But it is for the jury to determine whether such threats had reference to the person killed and whether he did come within the scope of the threats. All of these matters are questions of fact for the jury which will be submitted to them under proper instructions when it becomes our duty to charge them in this case.. The offer is therefore, admitted, objection overruled and bill sealed for the defendant. [3]</p>
