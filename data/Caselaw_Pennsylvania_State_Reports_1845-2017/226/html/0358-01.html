The testimony showed that the real estate was sold as unseated land at the instance of the treasurer of Westmoreland county for taxes levied against the property for the .years 1895 and 1896, and purchased byCanfield, the deed of the treasurer of Westmoreland county being dated June 13, 1898. On February 14, 1903, Canfield and wife conveyed the property to plaintiff, who thereupon took possession of and occupied the same until the buildings were destroyed by fire, November 24, 1905. The buildings erected upon the land were a dwelling house, barn, spring house, and other outbuildings, a portion of the land had been cultivated, and the property was occupied by tenants at least for a portion of the years 1895 and 1896.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b391-5" data-blocks='[["BL_391.4",391,[137,1182,1151,1231]]]'>On or about July 26, 1904, defendant issued to plaintiff a policy insuring the buildings upon the property to the extent of $1,425 and the household furniture contained therein to the extent of $500. Plaintiff’s claim is, that the property .was entirely destroyed by fire November 24, 1905, with the exception, of a spring house which was insured to the extent of $75.00. The insuring of the property was not denied, defendant contending, however, that plaintiff was not the sole and unconditional owner, its claim being that the property was seated land in the years 1895 and 1896, and that Canfield took no title under the sale by the treasurer of Westmoreland county. Plaintiff’s answer to this contention was, the defendant was fully aware of the circumstances under which she purchased the property, and also of the nature of her title to the same, she having submitted to the manager of the company at the time the policy was issued the deeds under which she claimed title. Whether the company was aware that plaintiff’s interest was dependent upon a tax title was, under the testimony, a question of fact for the jury, which was determined against defendant after being, in our opinion, fairly submitted. We must, therefore, now assume, that the manager of the company had actual knowledge of Mrs. Damms’ interest in the property, and the circumstances under which it was acquired.</p>

Under the circumstances of that case it was held the company was not liable. Here, instead of a written application for insurance, the husband of insured visited the office of the company with a person who acted as an agent for the company, and exhibited to the manager of the company the deeds under which plaintiff held title to the property.
