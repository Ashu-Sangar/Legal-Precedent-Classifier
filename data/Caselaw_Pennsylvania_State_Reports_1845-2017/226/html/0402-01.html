    <p class="summary" id="b435-4" data-blocks='[["BL_435.5",435,[106,1053,1157,533]]]'>The plaintiff company is operating a steam railroad under the general railroad Act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 79, and its supplements. In the operation of this road it becomes necessary to use a certain amount of water for steam purposes. This water, the plaintiff company claims that it has a right to appropriate under and by virtue of the power of eminent domain, which it contends is given by the Act of February 19, 1849, which said act it is alleged received legislative construction at the hands of the legislature of this state on April 9, 1856.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b435-5" data-blocks='[["BL_435.6",435,[109,1594,1161,803]],["BL_436.1",436,[304,364,1154,519]]]'>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company is incorporated by the act of assembly approved April 13, 1846, P. L. 312. The section of the general railroad act approved February 19, 1849, in which it is alleged the authority to condemn and appropriate the water of streams for general railroad purposes is contained is identical with sec. 11 of the act of 1846 incorporating the Pennsylvania Railroad Company with the exception that the act of 1846, authorizing similar acts to be done in the construction of railroads, contains the additional provision that the same acts may be done for maintenance or repair of the road. If the language of sec. 10 of the general railroad act approved February 19, 1849, gives to railroad companies the right to appropriate and condemn waters of a stream for its use in the operating of its railroad, the act of 1846, incorporating the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>then gave to it the right of eminent domain for the like purpose. It has not been pointed out to us that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company ever conceived that the right of eminent domain for the purposes in question was given to it by the act under and by virtue of which it was incorporated. On the contrary, it was found necessary in order that it might enjoy such privilege to add to legislation already in existence, and accordingly in 1859 an act was passed by the legislature of this state giving the right to appropriate and condemn water for such use.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A04" data-blocks='[["BL_436.5",436,[295,903,1162,1171]]]'>It is urged, however, on part of the plaintiff company that the Act of April 9,1856, P. L. 288, embodies the legislative construction of the act of 1849, and attention is called to the fact that the act contains the authority to appropriate “water and water rights.” The purposes of the act of 1856 were: first, to construe the act of 1855, extending the right of trial by jury in certain cases; second, to regulate practice of tendering “adequate security” required by the act of 1849; and, third, to regulate the practice in appeals allowed by the act of 1855. There is no intimation that it was the purpose of the legislature to then construe the act of 1849, or to enlarge upon the act of 1849, and thus give the right of eminent domain or so extend that right as to authorize railroad companies to appropriate water and water rights for the purpose of maintaining and operating a railroad; and if such a purpose was intended, the language employed is not sufficient for the purpose. The use of the words “water” and “water rights” indicate that the legislators were mistaken concerning the powers of eminent domain granted in the act of 1849, and were either careless or misled as to the language of the act. The act of 1849 was, therefore, in this particular neither added to nor subtracted from by the act of 1856.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b437-4" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[101,718,1157,419]]]'>It is urged, however, on part of plaintiff that the right of eminent domain for the purpose in question was held to exist by the late Judge Ewing in Smithko v. Ry. Co., .5 Pa. Dist. Rep. 543, and that the act of April 9, 1856, was there held to be a legislative construction of the act of 1849, in this, that the legislature meant to include in the right to construct water stations the right to take water and water rights under the power of eminent domain.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.6",437,[100,1150,1158,588]]]'>Had the question of the right to appropriate water been before Judge Ewing in the case referred to, his decision would at least be persuasive and we could be excused for following it if the reason supported the conclusion. The right to appropriate land for the storage of water was before him, and he held that the right to appropriate land for water stations included the right to appropriate land for a reservoir, a reservoir being necessarily a part of a water station; and the expression of opinion upon which the plaintiffs rely is, therefore, mere dicta, was unnecessary for the determination of the case, and, therefore, not binding upon this court as being persuasive,</p>

If any weight were to be attached to the intimation that water may be appropriated as material under the act of 1849, entry upon lands for this purpose could be had for the construction of bridges, viaducts and other buildings, and this power is separate and distinct from other powers to appropriate land. It, follows, therefore, that if water could be appropriated as <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>“material" it could not be appropriated for general railroad purposes as attempted in this case.</p>
