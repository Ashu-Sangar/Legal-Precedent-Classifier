    <p class="summary" id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[296,1346,1147,518]]]'>The evident purpose of the point was to have the court make the case turn upon the fact that the notary had not made out and sent the notices of protest to the indorsers before she signed and sealed the certificate of protest of the note in suit. In other words, — the fact being admitted, — the court was asked as a matter of law to say that the plaintiff’s proof of protest and notice to the indorsers as found in the certificate of the notary was completely met and the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant unless there was proof of notice aliunde the certificate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-7" data-blocks='[["BL_74.7",74,[294,1884,1148,527]],["BL_75.1",75,[133,382,1150,97]]]'>The Act of December 14, 1854, sec. 2, found in the Pamphlet Laws, 1855, 724, makes the certificate of the notary proof of the facts therein stated in all suits pending between the parties, which includes proof of presentation and dishonor of the note and notice to the maker and indorsers. Does the testimony of the notary that she, in the performance of her duty, signed and sealed the certificate before she made out and sent the notices to the indorsers, overcome this proof, or, to use the language of the point, “ completely rebut” the presumption of due notice arising from the facts <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>stated in the certificate, and is this a question of law to be determined by the court and not by the jury?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[131,490,1156,1932]],["BL_76.2",76,[300,378,1148,259]]]'>At the trial we thought that the fact that the notary signed the certificate offered in evidence in order of time before she had made out and sent the notices was not conclusive proof that she did not at any time make out and send notices to the indorsers and therefore did not completely rebut the proof found in the certificate under the provisions of the act of 1854. We further thought that the question whether this fact was sufficient to overcome the proof found in the certificate was a question for the jury and not the court, and we are still of the same opinion. It will be noticed by reference to the testimony of the notary that she was not asked whether she had sent the notices before she delivered the certificate of protest to the bank, nor was she asked whether she had delivered the notices to the indorsers immediately after she had signed, sealed and delivered the certificate. We do not know what she might have said to these last questions. She might have answered “Yes” she might have answered “No;” she might have answered “I do not recollect.” How then does the simple fact that the certificate was signed and sealed by the notary in order of time before she had sent out notices to the indorsers meet “the proof” that she did send out such notices? The act of 1854 does not provide that the notices to indorsers must be sent before the certificate is signed and sealed and that if they are not so sent it shall not be proof. In the eyes of the law, the protest, including the presentation, the making out of the certificate and the giving of notices to the indorsers, is one act, and the order of time in which the constituent parts of that act are performed is immaterial. On the whole case the question to be determined was, Had the proof of notice to John H. Moffitt of the nonpayment of this note at maturity, which was found in the certificate offered in evidence and admittedly executed and delivered by the notary in good faith, been overcome, and this in our opinion was a question for the jury and it was not within the province of the court to say that the fact “that at the time the notary signed and sealed the certificate of protest of the <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>note in suit she had not made out nor sent the notice to any of the indorsers,” completely rebutted the presumption of due notice arising from the certificate itself. We are therefore of the opinion that the point presented by the defendant at the trial was correctly answered.</p>
