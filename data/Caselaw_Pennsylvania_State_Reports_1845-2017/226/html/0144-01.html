    <p id="b177-11" data-blocks='[["BL_177.17",177,[122,1229,1150,963]]]'>This controversy is between a mother and her son. Alleging that, through fraud and deception practiced by him upon her, he had procured the execution and delivery to him of a deed for property which for years she had been struggling to redeem, this bill was filed, asking for a decree adjudging that he holds the title as trustee for her. From his admissions in the answer and in his testimony, considered in connection with the evidence offered in support of the bill, the finding of the court that the appellee had not practiced artifice and fraud upon his mother in procuring her signature to the letter of December 5, 1902, is so clearly erroneous that it must be set aside and the relief prayed for granted. Findings of fact by a lower court, if supported by testimony, will not be reversed because from that testimony we might have found differently, but when from it the findings must have been different, they must be set aside. With this test applied to the evidence in the case before us, the material allegation of the fraud practiced upon the appellant must be sustained.</p>

In <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>1895, being unable to pay the dues to the association, he executed and delivered to it, in consideration of his indebtedness, a deed for the property. At the time this deed was made a lease was executed between the association and Luther, which was also signed by his wife, containing an option or right to repurchase the property at any time within three years from January 1, 1895, and providing for the payment as a rental during that period of interest upon the amount due the association. F. O. Luther became one of the sureties to the lessor for his father’s faithful performance of the covenants in the lease. The payments agreed upon were much in excess of the actual rental value of the property. Luther died in October, 1897, — a few months before the expiration of the option to repurchase. His widow, the appellant, continued in possession of the property, through her tenants, and continued making payments to the association on account of the debt and interest due, the option to redeem having been informally extended. In the year 1902 she made five payments. The income from the property amounted to very little, if any, more than enough to pay the taxes and keep the property in repair. The payments made by the appellant were from her own separate estate. They were made by her with the intention of redeeming the homestead, and were received by the association with full knowledge of such intention. She and her son, the appellee, lived in the country only about three miles apart, and he knew that she had been making payments for years to the association under the arrangement to redeem. He admits that she paid more than the sum of $800 for that purpose, while the testimony showed that her payments amounted to over $1,000. He never contributed anything towards the redemption of the property, although he knew the struggle she was making to repurchase it. Her other son, John, assisted her from time to time. Some time in November, 1902, the appellee began negotiations for the purchase of the farm, leaving the representative of the building association with whom he dealt under the impression that he was acting for his mother. On November 29, the solicitor wrote her a letter of which the following is a copy:</p>

The appellee, though living near his mother and seeing her at times, said nothing at all to her about his attempt to purchase the property, and, when pressed for a reason for not telling her, admitted that he had testified in another proceeding that he had said nothing to her about it because he knew <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>that if his uncle Edward — his mother’s legal adviser — and his brother John should learn of his contemplated purchase, they would “ cut him out.” The appellee knew that the letter of November 29 had been written to his mother by the association, giving her the privilege of purchasing the property within thirty days, but two days afterwards — on December 1 — he paid to the association $500 on account of a sale which he alleges was to be made to him in his own right. Three days later — on December 4 — he met his uncle, E. H. Flick, Esq., the legal adviser of his mother, who, upon learning from him that he was trying to purchase the property, said that he should not undertake to purchase it without the consent of his mother and brother, as the mother had been endeavoring for years to redeem it and had put considerable money in it. In reply to this he said he would see her, but instead of doing so on the next day he paid to the association the balance which his mother would have been required to pay for the redemption of the property. The association, however, refused to deliver a deed to him in view of its understanding with her that it would let her redeem the property, having given her the privilege of doing so at any time within thirty days from November 29, and, for its own protection, prepared and gave him a letter to be signed by her, of which the following is a copy:</p>

In reply to her inquiry whether he had seen her brother, E. H. Flick, he replied that he had, but failed to tell her what his uncle had said. He further added, according to her testimony, that now he and his brother John were better friends than ever. These two brothers for years had been estranged, and the mother expressed gratification over their reconciliation. As a matter of fact the appellee had not seen John at all for some time before, and their relations continued unchanged. He further said to his mother that if he had been a day later, he would not have been able to get the farm, as the association would have sold it to Hoppel. This was untrue, for the association had given her the privilege of redeeming it up to December 28. On December 6, in compliance with the notice of November 29, the appellee’s brother made a tender of $50.00, but the same was refused in view of what had taken place between the association and the appellee.</p>

Luther, <a href="/pa/216/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="216 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="950354" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0001-01">216 Pa. 1</a>: It “was of a negative character, but it was not, for that reason, less potential in inducing her to sign the letter. He knew she had been struggling to regain the property, with the assistance and under the advice of her brother, E. H. Flick, Esq., a member of the Blair county bar. When he presented the letter to her she asked him whether he had seen his Uncle Ed., to which, he admits, he replied that he had. He must have understood from her question that she wished to be assured that her brother knew all about the transaction and would approve her signing the letter, and he must have known that she would not have signed it without such approval. By his reply he must have intended to convey the very impression that was made upon her mind, that her brother knew what she was about to do, and sanctioned it. If he had told her just what had occurred between him and his uncle, according to the latter’s testimony, it is not to be doubted that she would not have signed the paper; and so of what was said <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>by him about his brother John, which was intended to convey the impression that he, the only other person interested in the farm, was satisfied. On the cross-examination of the appellant, after his admission that he had never said anything to his mother about his intention to buy the property, though living near her, he gave the following reason for not having done so: ' I knew it wouldn’t get cold until Uncle Ed. and John would know about it, and they would try to cut me out.’ Knowing that they both would oppose his acquisition of the property, and that his mother would not consent to it without the advice of her brother, he artfully led her to believe that what he asked her to do had the sanction of his uncle. With much force she said in her testimony that, while he had not said anything dishonest to her that day, ‘ He did it; he said he saw his Uncle Ed., and that he and John were better friends than ever.’ By not telling the whole truth and withholding from her what she most desired to know, the artifice and deception were practiced upon her.”</p>

The court has found that she is of a highly nervous temperament, and remarks attributed to her, but denied by her, are not to be given the effect placed upon them by the court below in holding that she was entirely satisfied that her son had purchased the property.</p>

Luther, the appellee, be enjoined and restrained from transferring or incumbering the property described in the bill, and it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that he holds title to the same as trustee for the appellant, the costs of this appeal and below to be paid by him.</p>
