The material and controlling facts are the following: The action was brought May 23, 1904, to recover $4,687.49, with interest from May 23, 1903, being part of the proceeds of a draft drawn by the Eastern Tube Company to the order of the defendant bank on the Spokane Falls Gas Light Company for the sum of $6,544.42.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.9",517,[158,1346,1149,685]]]'>In December, 1901, the Eastern Tube Company made a parol contract with the defendant bank by which it was agreed that the company would keep twenty-five per cent of the proceeds of discounts made for it by the bank on deposit as security to the bank, the said proceeds and the tube company’s money on deposit to be security for the tube company’s indebtedness to the bank. The tube company’s balance was to be used as though it were collateral put up with the bank for its security, and to be applied in any case that the bank could have applied collateral security, whether the indebtedness was or was not due. Under this agreement the defendant bank discounted paper for the tube company, some of which was renewed from time to time.</p>

On March 26, 1903, at the request of the tube company, certain accounts receivable, inter alia, four accounts against the Spokane Falls Gas Light Company, were submitted for one of the warehouse receipts held as .collateral by the plaintiff bank which surrendered the receipt and received in its stead and as a substitute therefor said accounts, but there was no written assignment or delivery of the books containing the accounts to the plaintiff. The tube company agreed as plaintiff’s agent to collect the accounts for plaintiff and to pay over the proceeds which were to be applied to the liquidation of its liabilities to the plaintiff which were due or to become due.</p>

The draft was collected by the latter bank and the proceeds passed on May 20, 1903, to the credit of the tube company which at that time had a general account with and was a depositor of the defendant bank.</p>

The tube company agreed in the assignment to collect and deliver to the plaintiff without cost all payments received by that company, the same to be ap<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>plied to the liquidation of its indebtedness to the bank due or to become due or that may have been theretofore or might be thereafter contracted.</p>

On the latter date the indebtedness of the tube company to the defendant bank was about $100,000 and the bank, then in the hands of a receiver, applied to the indebtedness the entire' deposit balance of the tube company which was not more than twenty-five per cent of the indebtedness. At no time prior to the application of the proceeds of the draft to the tube company's indebtedness, had the defendant any notice or knowledge of the claim by the plaintiff against the proceeds of the draft.

The plaintiff bank gave no notice to the Spokane company of the assignment to it of the tube company’s accounts, and the defendant bank had no notice of the assignment when it collected the money and applied it to the indebtedness due it from the tube company. Under these circumstances, the title to the fund passed to the defendant bank: Phillips’s Estate (No. 3), <a href="/pa/205/0515-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="205 Pa. 515" data-case-ids="930064" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0515-01">205 Pa. 515</a>.</p>

In order to make a valid pledge as against other creditors there must be an actual or constructive delivery of the possession of the goods. The delivery must be clear, unequivocal, complete, and effective at all times so as to give notice to third parties of the pledgee’s rights; a mere agreement by the debtor that the creditor shall take and hold certain property as security for his debt is insufficient: 31 Cyclopedia of Law &amp; Procedure, 801. Delivery of possession is sufficient if made by the transfer of the instrument which represents the property, such as a warehouse receipt, elevator receipt, bill of lading, promissory note or an obligation or claim upon other persons. The delivery of a bank book is sufficient to constitute a pledge of the book and money on deposit: Boynton v. Payrow, <a href="/me/67/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="67 Me. 587" data-case-ids="639617" data-case-paths="/me/67/0587-01">67 Me. 587</a>.

Debts, negotiable instruments, stocks in incorporated companies, and choses in action generally, are pledged in that mode. Such transfer of the title performs the same office that delivery of possession does in case of a pledge of corporeal property. The transfer of the title, like the delivery of possession, constitutes the evidence of the pledgee’s right of property in the thing pledged. In 22 Am. <em>&amp; </em>Eng. Eney. of Law (2d ed.), 854, it is said: “As between successive pledgees without any communication with each other, that one who lawfully obtains possession at the time of the pledge, or subsequently, is entitled to be preferred. Where a contract or pledge is made, but there is no actual or constructive delivery of the goods to the pledgee, he obtains no lien although he actually advances money on the faith of the contract of the pledge and although he acts with the utmost good faith.” A book account is not pledged by the delivery of a copy of the account as security without an assignment, since such a copy does not represent the debt: Cornwell v. Baldwin’s Bank, <a href="/nys/43/0771-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="43 N.Y.S. 771" data-case-ids="3500478" data-case-paths="/nys/43/0771-01">43 N. Y. Supp. 771</a>.</p>

The • pledge was never completed by any actual or constructive delivery of the property pledged. This property consisted of four accounts or bills receivable which the tube company held against the Spokane Falls Gas Light Company. The accounts themselves, or rather the books containing the accounts, were 'never delivered to the plaintiff notwithstanding the note of January 19,1903, stated that they had been deposited with the bank. It is conceded that no such delivery was made. There was a delivery of copies of the account to the plaintiff bank without any assignment or other transfer of the right of the tube company in or to the accounts. This manifestly was not an actual or constructive delivery of the accounts to the pledgee. The same delivery could have been made to as many <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>parties as the tube company had creditors, and with like force and effect. It gave no notice to other parties purchasing or accepting the accounts as collateral security, nor did it confer authority on the plaintiff bank to enforce payment against the Spokane company by an action at law. The delivery of the copy, therefore, transferred neither the title nor the possession of the accounts to the plaintiff bank, and hence was insufficient to create a lien on the accounts in favor of the bank as against subsequent purchasers, pledgees, or creditors of the tube company without notice.</p>

In other words, before the plaintiff bank can insist upon the enforcement of that rule, it must show that it had a valid pledge of the Spokane accounts at the time the draft or its proceeds were deposited in the defendant bank.</p>
