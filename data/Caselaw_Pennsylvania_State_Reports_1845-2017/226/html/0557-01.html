There was neither warranty as to title nor as to priority of the lien touching the bonds in controversy at the time the contract was made either in the contract itself or in anything that was said or done at the time; both parties knew, and as lawyers were particularly bound to know, that the synopsis of the master’s report or the report i.tself was subject to exception and modification by the court.</p>

While both Stone representing the seller, and Kerin the purchaser, believed from the memoranda of the master’s report that the prior liens including costs would approximate $60,000, the fact that the railway was in the hands of a receiver, that proceedings for its sale were instituted, that litigation was pending touching the relative standing of the different class of creditors, that among the claims ahead of the bonds as shown by the synopsis was a mechanics’ lien of Tennis &amp; Company of the sum of $14,000, while immediately following were a larger number of other mechanics’ claims or liens, all combined was presumptive notice to the purchaser that he took title to these bonds subject to a final adjudication by the court upon the law of conflicting claims then pending or that might thereafter arise; his stipulation to be substituted in any actions pending and to assume all liability for costs in connection therewith is corroborative evidence of the condition which as purchaser he was bound to know these securities were subject to. As purchaser from an assignee of an insolvent he took the title held by the insolvent, unless the assignee warranted a different title.</p>

Whether it owned the bonds outright or had only a qualified ownership thereof to the extent of its advancements, is immaterial under the facts in this case, for it only undertook to sell and the purchaser agreed to buy whatever title it had.

No one else had any title to these bonds until these advancements were paid, and therefore for the purposes of the sale and for the purposes of acquiring control of the road the bonds were in the absolute ownership of the purchaser and entitled to as full participation either in the control of the road or participation in dividends or any amounts received from the sale thereof, at least to the extent of the advancements, as if the purchaser had acquired them outright from the railway company and paid for them.</p>
