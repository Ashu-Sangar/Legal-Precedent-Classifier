    <p id="b88-8" data-blocks='[["BL_88.10",88,[178,960,1152,1189]]]'>The facts are undisputed. In 1919 the then owner of adjoining Lots 1344 and 1346 North 52nd Street, Philadelphia (hereinafter referred to as Lot 1344 and Lot 1346), erected a brick garage on the rear of the two lots, 15 feet in width by 27% feet in depth, covering an area of 15 by 15 feet (225 square feet) of the rear of Lot 1346 and 15 by 12% feet (187% square feet) of the rear of Lot 1344, with the only entrance being located in the portion erected on Lot 1346 and facing Master Street, on which this lot abuts. On November 30, 1925, the common owner mortgaged Lot 1344 to Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company et al., trustees, and on July 28, 1930, he conveyed the two lots to the Edward W. Woolman Building and Loan Association, subject to the mortgage on Lot 1344. On January 9, 1933, the mortgagees acquired title by foreclosure to Lot 1344, and on July 29, 1939, they conveyed this lot to Vincenzo Sannuti and Maria Sannuti, his wife, appellants. Appellee, Anna Stumpf Clements, acquired title to Lot 1346 by deed from the Liquidating Trustees of the Edward W. Woolman Building and Loan Association on July 25, 1941.</p>

The bill did not aver that the use of the whole garage was necessary to the beneficial enjoyment of appellee’s lot, and at the hearing on bill and answer appellee conceded that the right to use of the portion of the garage located on appellants’ premises “is not claimed as a necessity.” Nevertheless, after hearing, the court below granted the injunction as prayed for. Exceptions filed by appellants were dismissed and this appeal followed.</p>

It may be merely negative . . . and may be created by a covenant or agreement not to use land in a certain way . . . <em>But it cannot be an estate or interest in the land itself, or a right to any part of it” </em>(Italics supplied) : <em>Slegel v.

Such right goes beyond a mere incorporeal right and is not a “service or easement” within the meaning of the rule stated.</p>

At the time of the conveyance a house stood on the lot conveyed and extended five feet over the line between the two lots. The plaintiff, although she was the grantor, brought an action of ejectment for the five feet and obtained a judgment awarding her possession which was affirmed on appeal. The court rejected defendant’s contention that the right to use and occupy the five feet passed to his grantor as an easement appurtenant to the lot conveyed, stating as follows (<a href="/citations/?q=12%20N.E.%20581" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 N.E. 581">12 N. E. 581</a>, 582) : “There is no suggestion of mistake of measurement in the amount of land intended to be conveyed, and yet a piece of land five feet in addition to that which was actually conveyed, and out of a total of only twenty-two feet, is thus called for to furnish this easement to defendant’s premises. We think that the language conveys only that part of the building which is on the land described, and that no right such as is claimed by the defendant exists upon or in relation to the land not conveyed, and which belongs to plaintiff . . . By the word ‘appurtenances’, incorporeal easements or rights or privileges will alone pass, and of <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>these only such as are necessary to the proper enjoyment of the estate granted . . .

The owner of the easterly lot had torn down the half of the middle house standing on his lot and the owners of the westerly lot in their complaint asked that the owner of the easterly lot restore the house and pay damages for interference with their use of it. In affirming a judgment dismissing the complaint, the court said (<a href="/citations/?q=58%20N.E.%20518" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="58 N.E. 518">58 N.

It requires the use of that amount of land belonging to the defendant. It would be intolerable to extend the doctrine applicable to party walls so far as to compel the owner of a lot, in the absence of an express grant or reservation, to maintain or permit its maintenance by the adjoining owner, in the interior of his lot, thus giving to the adjoining owner not only the support of the wall, but the dominant use of the intervening space, in order to reach his distant support. No case to which we are cited goes so far.”</p>

The grantee cut off so much of the barn as was on his own land and, in an action of trespass brought by the grantor, defended on the theory that the entire barn passed as appurtenant to the land conveyed. The court rejected this theory stating (p. 234) : “There is no mention of the barn in the deed to the defendant ; the premises are conveyed by metes and bounds. Whatever title the defendant has in the barn has been acquired because the barn was so attached to the realty as to have become a part of it . . .” And, see also, <em>Littlefield x.

Moreover, the court recognized (p. 39) that “had she thus attempted to surcharge her easement and develop it into a title to the land itself, a remedy at law or in equity would have been available to the owner to prevent the clandestine acquisition of his title.”</p>
