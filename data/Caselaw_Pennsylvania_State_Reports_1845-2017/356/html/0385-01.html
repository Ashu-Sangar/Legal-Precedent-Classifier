There are three plaintiffs but only two have appealed. The six defendants are the remaining stockholders. The plaintiffs sued to set aside purchases of stock made by two of the defendants from a stockholder named Detwiler. The plaintiffs contended that the by-laws of the company guaranteed to them the right to participate in the purchase of the stock Detwiler desired to sell and that they <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>liad been deprived of tbe right. Defendants pleaded that the by-laws, relied on by plaintiffs, were not effective, that they had been suspended or abrogated by the company’s and the stockholders’ disregard of their provisions in every transfer of stock made since the company’s organization. The case was heard by Judge Patterson who found the facts in accord with defendants’ contentions; the court in banc affirmed his findings and dismissed the bill.</p>

It follows that contracting parties cannot ignore their own contractual covenants with impunity and still seek to hold the others to the contract,” citing <em>Constructors Association v.

In this last ease the reason for the rule was stated: “The authorities which we cited clearly sustain the proposition that, since this provision of the by-laws was for the benefit and protection of the stockholders themselves, they might waive it, and such by-law, as to them, would be repealed by their acquiescence in the uniform practice of the company in disregarding it.”</p>

A copy of such amended By-laws shall be sent to each stockholder within 30 days after their adoption.” We do not think that section was intended to exclude the right of all the stockholders to waive provisions of the by-laws made for their benefit.</p>

The evidence gives all the instances. In considering them it is desirable to know that <em>B.

Mr. Elliott was Secretary of the Company from April 16, 1928, until February 1, 1941. A witness testified that in November, 1943, when the repeal of these by-laws was proposed as a subject for action at the next stockholders’ meeting to be held in February, 1944, Mr. Elliott stated: “I don’t care, these by-laws have never been observed.” In 1944, they were formally repealed by corporate action. Detwiler was one of the original stockholders and was president and a director until 1937. Thomas H. Gough had been a director since 1919 and president since 1937. E. C. West had been a director from the beginning and during part of the time was secretary and treasurer. O: B. Lindquist was one of the incorporators and a director for many years. G. H. Lindquist has been secretary since 1941.</p>

After her husband’s death, she, on January 10, 1939, presented the certificate endorsed by her as executrix with the declaration of trust attached, for transfer to herself.
