C. Ehrlich, the plaintiff. The policy insured the holder against liability to others, under specified circumstances and conditions, for injuries or death resulting from the operation of the insured’s fumigating business. The suit was brought by the insured in an effort to recoup from the defendant company the amount of damages and expenses incidental thereto which he had been required to pay in an action of trespass for the death of an infant upon a liability which the plaintiff claims was covered by the policy. At the conclusion of the plaintiff’s case, the learned trial judge entered the compulsory nonsuit (here involved), which the court en banc subsequently refused to take off, on the ground that the testimony adduced by the plaintiff conclusively convicted him of breaching certain of his express warranties contained in a “Co-operation Endorsement” or rider to the policy in suit.</p>

The first and third floors of the dwelling were occupied by the owner of the property, Mrs. Helen Stathopulos, and her family. Mrs. Ruth Binkley with her eighteen months old son, a normal child in good health, occupied the second floor as tenant. The fumigation was begun about 8 A. M., and all of the occupants of the house, upon warning previously given, had left the premises prior thereto.</p>

M. that morning. They returned about 5 P. M. that afternoon for the purpose of opening the building to ventilation. The fumigator first entered the house with a gas mask, doing no more upon that entrance than opening the doors and windows. The house was one in a compact row of buildings, being flanked on either side by a structure and, as a consequence, there was no cross draft in the dwelling under fumigation. After a time, the fumigator re-entered the house, gathered up the materials used in his work and disposed of them by burning in the back yard. He conducted a separate chemical test on each of the three floors of the dwelling for the presence of hydrocyanic gas. Thé test .made on the second floor (Mrs. Binkley’s apartment) and the one made on the third floor each produced a negative reaction. However, the test on the first floor, which was made bn a studio couch, disclosed the presence there of hydrocyanic gas in a deadly quantity. ■ There were twenty-five cubic feet of the gas per million cubic feet of air while, according to the plaintiff’s chief witness, the maximum tolerance of a human being for hydrocyanic gas is a mixture containing not more .than ten cubic feet of the gas to a million cubic feet of air.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> No <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>chemical tests of the premises other than the three above-mentioned were ever made.</p>

He did not again return. It was his expressed idea that “it [could] be safely presumed that these 25 per million will dissipate during that 12-hour period [i. e., until the authorized return of the occupants the next morning]”. After the house had been opened to ventilation, the fumigator was able to, and did, go into the building without the protection of a gas mask between 6 and 7 P. M. But, during the whole of the period (5 to 7 P. M.) the helper did not enter the house but remained outside. Later the same evening (around 9 P. M.) the fumigator returned the keys to the house to Mrs. Stathopulos at her place of business in another part of the city and instructed her to beat the overstuffed furniture and bedding near a window when she reentered the dwelling.</p>

Certainly, there were no issues of fact for a jury to resolve. Nor is there any occasion for resort to the familiar rule of construction that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer. That rule, like corresponding artificial aids for the ascertainment of intent, becomes germane only when the meaning of the writing in action is doubtful, uncertain or ambiguous. It has no proper role in the interpretation of a writing which is clear and unmistakable, — a circumstance primarily for a court to ascertain and declare in any case. To relieve the plaintiff, by a rule of construction, from his deliberate contractual undertakings would be tantamount to abandoning the judicial function of interpreting written agreements according to the ordinary meaning of their plain words.</p>

But, the question to which they are pertinent is not present on the record now before us. The case was pleaded by the plaintiff and, likewise, tried on the theory that it was incumbent upon him to prove, as a part of his case, his compliance with his warranties relative to the risk. The appellant concedes as much. In his “Statement of Questions Involved”, he poses that the “. . . insured showed in his case in chief (although not obliged to do so) absolute compliance with five out of six of such provisions [i. e., warranties] . . Assuming, therefore, that all the plaintiff needed to do was to prove a liability upon him which was within the insuring clause of the policy and free of any breach of his warranties, what he in fact did was to prove affirmatively his failure to comply with his warranties in several material particulars. That being so, he is without just cause for complaint on that score. When the existence of facts constituting an affirmative defense are admitted by a plaintiff or are established by uncontradicted testimony in the plaintiff’s case with such conclusiveness as to exclude the reasonable possibility of an inference otherwise, a nonsuit is proper: see <em>Kilpatrick v.

The plaintiff replies that there is not a word of testimony that his representative did not beat the specified materials, and, hence, no inference from the evidence that he did not do so can possibly be treated as conclusive. Conceding the merit of that position in the first instance, the evidence which the plaintiff actually produced at trial so exhausted the field of inquiry with respect to the beating of the furnishings, after the fumigation, as to render inadmissible an inference that the plaintiff’s representative had beaten or had supervised the beating of the overstaffed materials (including furniture and bedding). So much is readily apparent.</p>

They testified fully as to what they had done during the two-hour period they were at the house after opening it to ventilation at 5 P. M. But, not once did either of them intimate that the overstuffed material, including furniture and bedding, had been beaten by them or by anyone else. At the same time, it is perfectly plain from their testimony that, while they were on the premises following the fumigation, the house was still too saturated with the deadly gas to permit of work in the interior as time-consuming as beating heavily upholstered furniture and bedding. In fact, the helper did not even go into the house during the Avhole of that two-hour post-fumigation period. The fumigator, himself, did enter but only for intermittent brief periods. And, although his own testimony shows that he well knew the lurking danger from “sealed in” gas pockets, particularly in the upholstering and bedding, he left entirely to others for a later time the matter of beating any residual gas into the open for harmless dissemina<a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>tion. The first mention that the furnishings should be beaten was contained in the fumigator’s instructions to Mrs. Stathopulos upon delivering to her the keys to the house at her place of business at 9 o’clock that night; and, what he then told her “concerned the behavior of tenants after coming back [i. e., twelve hours later] in respect to cleaning or beating the mattresses and overstuffed furniture of any kind, in order to eliminate the possibility of gas being sealed in such pieces of furniture”. For some unexplained reason, Mrs. Stathopulos was not called as a witness, but it will be inferred in the plaintiff’s favor that Mrs. Stathopulos informed her daughter, Mrs. Wasenda, of the fumigator’s instructions. According to Mrs. Binkley, the daughter told her of the directions. Certain it is, however, that neither the plaintiff nor any representative of his had any firsthand knowledge at any time as to whether the material in question had been beaten. Indeed, the fact is that, notwithstanding the plaintiff’s assumption to prove compliance with his warranties, he produced .no testimony that either the studio couch on the first floor, which, upon chemical test, had been shown to be permeated with gas of deadly quality, or the sofa in Mrs. Binkley’s apartment had been beaten by anyone.</p>

What was said in <em>Virgilio v. Walker and Brehm, </em><a href="/pa/254/0241-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="254 Pa. 241" data-case-ids="1025399" data-case-paths="/pa/254/0241-01">254 Pa. 241</a>, 244-245, <a href="/citations/?q=98%20A.%20815" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="98 A. 815">98 A. 815</a>, is especially apposite here, viz., “. . . a nonsuit can be entered . . . when it is inconceivable, on any reasonable hypothesis, that a mind desiring solely to reach a just and proper conclusion in accordance with the relevant governing principles of law, after viewing the evidence in the light <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>most advantageous to the plaintiff, could determine in his favor the controlling issues involved”.</p>

The knowledge and experience which fulfillment of the latter warranty called for made it peculiarly a type of obligation which the warrantor could neither delegate nor evade. The two matters conjointly so warranted in the fifth paragraph of the rider, i. e., the beating of the furnishings and the performance of an adequate chemical test thereon, relate to one thing and are directed to the same end, viz., the time and the circumstance of allowing personal use of furniture, etc., following a fumigation. In apparent recognition of the latter warranty the fumigator, as already noted, made a chemical test for the presence of gas on a piece of upholstered furniture on each of the three floors of the dwelling and thereby detected in the studio couch on the first floor the presence of gas in a quantity two and a half times greater than can safely be tolerated by a human being. Yet, all the fumigator did about that was to presume “that these 25 per million [would] dissipate during [the] 12-hour period” before the occupants’ return which he was ready to, and did, authorize. Of course, the fumigator could not discharge his express warranty by any such facile assumption. And, again, on the basis of the facts which the insured himself adduced at trial, he is conclusively to be held to have breached his warranty. The fact that there is no direct causal relation between the gas found in the studio couch on the first floor and the death of the child is wholly without bearing upon whether the plaintiff breached his covenants. This is <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>not an action in trespass based upon negligence but an action of assumpsit founded on a contract.</p>

While this point was not passed upon- by the court below, it furnishes an additional reason for our affirmance of the judgment appealed from. In paragraph 6 the insured warranted that no person would be permitted to enter the fumigated premises before the fumigator had satisfied himself “by adequate chemical or other test <em>and by personal inspection </em>... of every part of the fumigated premises, that it [was] safe for human occupancy”. (Emphasis supplied.) The evidence in the case leaves no doubt that the fumigator did not take adequate steps to so inform himself before authorizing the return of the dwelling’s occupants. He did, it is true, perform chemical tests upon furniture on the three floors of the house and found gas in alarming proportions in the studio couch on the first floor. Yet, he did nothing thereafter to determine whether gas in harmful quantity was still present in the house. Rather, he contented himself with an unjustifiable assumption that all the gas in the house had been dissipated and that none would remain sealed up in upholstery or bedding after twelve hours. That assumption was the more flagrant in view of the facts that, because of the relatively short duration of the fumigation, the quantity of gas released in the operation had been intentionally increased over the amount normally used; and the house was without a cross draft.</p>

The contention is without merit. As we have already seen, the fumigator did nothing in the way of attending to the beating of the furnishings or making the required personal inspection of the fumigated premises. There is therefore no basis for a claim of substantial performance. One must make an honest, conscientious effort to perform an obligation or requirement before he can assert that his performance was substantial. “The equitable doctrine of substantial performance is intended for the protection and relief of those who have faithfully and honestly endeavored to perform their contracts in all material and substantial particulars, so that their right . . . may not be forfeited by reason of mere technical, inadvertent, or unimportant omissions or defects.

The insured is protected by this policy against liability arising from the use or handling of fumigating substances in “the places” above mentioned, or on “the sidewalks or other ways immediately adjacent thereto”, i. e., adjacent to places where the Assured is carrying on <em>any phase </em>of his fumigating operations in “Reading, Berks County and elsewhere in Pennsylvania.”</p>

That the possibility of an explosion causing injury to <em>either </em>persons <em>or </em>property is recognized in this policy is shown by the fact that there is excluded from any claims for damages for which the insured is legally liable under this policy and damage or destruction to <em>property </em>which is caused by “an explosion of any character”. An “item” in the policy reads as follows: “No explosives are used, allowed or kept at the place named in Statement 4, <em>except those usual to the work covered hereby.” </em>(Italics supplied.)

The dangerous character of the hydrocyanic gas used in fumigating is referred to in the testimony of Alexander Ehrlich. ITe testified that the zyklon discoids used in fumigating the premises where the infant child of Mrs. Binkley died as a result of inhaling the lethal hydrocyanic gas, is “the commercial name for a highly concentrated form of hydro-cyanic gas.” He also testified that the discoids after being used on the premises “were gathered up, together with the tape, and for safety reasons burned in the back yard of the house.” If they were not destroyed they would be a menace to life, limb and health.

If the majority opinion is correct, the plaintiff has been paying annually a very high premium (over $1,000) for a liability insurance policy not worth the paper on which it is written.

Obviously to obtain financial protection against any negligent conduct on his part which might involve him in liability to others. If he were always so careful as to avoid the likelihood of accident he would have no use for liability insurance, because, even if a third person were injured, unless such injury was due to negli<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>gence on the part of the insured the latter would not be liable to the injured person and would therefore have no need for insurance. In the present case, for example, the mere, fact that the child died from hydro-cyanic poisoning did not entitle its mother to recover against this appellant; it was incumbent upon her to prove that appellant in some way failed to observe all the precautions that a reasonably careful fumigator would have observed under the circumstances. The fact that she secured a verdict shows that, in the opinion of the jury, appellant did not measure up to that required standard of care. Therefore, when the majority opinion now attempts to show that he might or should have taken additional precautions it is merely engaged in establishing what has already been established in the suit of the mother against him, namely, that he was negligent. But his liability for the death of the child because of such negligence constitutes the very reason for which he is now entitled to recover on his insurance policy and for which alone that policy was designed. To hold, as the present decision does, that he cannot recover on the policy because of his negligence, is to say that the policy can <em>never </em>be enforced, because in the absence of negligence the insured would not be liable to the injured person and therefore would have nó occasion for any claim against the insurance company; in other words, the only circumstance which could possibly justify his recovery on the policy automatically prevents such recovery.

One is that “all overstuffed, material including, but not limited to, furniture and bedding, will be beaten and adequate chemical or other test for the presence of gas will be made before allowing any person their use”. It is said that appellant did not, either himself or by his employes, beat any of the furniture or other material. But certainly it is absurd for the insurance company to contend that under this clause the beating had to be done by the insured himself or by his own employes; if, as here, he instructed the occupants of the house to attend to the beating <em>and they did so, </em>what possible difference does it make if the beating was done by one person or by another? Witnesses, including the mother of the deceased child herself, testified that they beat thoroughly the mattresses, pillows, and all the bedding, including that on the bed in which the child subsequently died. But it is said that there were two pieces of furniture as to which there was no proof that they had been beaten, one a couch on the first floor and the other a sofa on the second floor. The answer to this is twofold: (1) There is nothing to indicate that failure to beat these particular pieces had anything to do with the death of the child or that any gas whatever emanated from them or either of them; therefore failure to beat them is of no legal import because not shown to have been a causal factor in the happening of the accident. (2) The clause in regard to beating the furniture provides that the beating is to take place and a test for the presence of gas made <em>“before allowing any person their use”. </em>Obviously, therefore the beating and test (as distinguished from the test prescribed in another covenant hereinafter discussed) are only for protection <em>in connection with the subsequent use of the furniture to be beaten; </em>the purpose of the beating was to make such furniture itself safe for use. There is no evidence whatever that the couch and the sofa were used by anybody after the fumigation, certainly not by the child; the only articles used by the child or by anybody else <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>were the mattresses and the pillows, and these were all adequately beaten.</p>

Does it mean that the fumigator must make such complete and exhaustive tests and inspection that the safety of the premises for occupancy is rendered certain? Does it mean that he must make such minimum tests as would be sufficient to exculpate him from any charge of negligence? I have already pointed out that if the fumigator had to measure up to such a standard in order to recover on his policy there would never be any need for him to have a policy because he could not be liable to anyone injured by the gas and therefore would not need liability insurance. It seems to me crystal clear that all that this clause does mean is that the fumigator must <em>in good faith, </em>“satisfy himself” that the occupants of the house can safely re-enter. It is only if he does not <em>honestly </em>satisfy himself, and an accident results, that he disentitles himself to recover on his policy. There is not a shred of testimony in the present case to indicate that there was any lack of good faith in the conclusion of appellant’s manager that the premises were safe for re-entry. The fumigation was finished around ten o’clock in the morning. Appellant’s employes returned to the premises at five o’clock in the afternoon. They opened the doors and windows, and, after an hour’s ventilation, the manager was able to enter without the use of a gas mask. He removed the chemicals from which the gas had been generated and made standard chemical tests at various points in the house which showed an entire absence of gas on the second and third floors and none on the first <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>floor except at one point on or under the couch. The majority opinion states in regard to this one spot that hydro-cyanic gas was there “in a deadly quantity.” On the contrary, while the test disclosed up to 25 cubic feet of gas per million cubic feet of air at that point, the testimony was that “25 per million of gas can be tolerated for quite a while before they will cause [merely] <em>It eadaches or slight feeling of </em>illness”, and that that quantity was not sufficient to cause death. Although it was testified that under the weather conditions then prevailing it would ordinarily have been considered safe to allow the house to be reoccupied by the tenants after the lapse of between four and six hours (an opinion which the witness said was based on his experience of eight years of fumigation work), nevertheless the tenants were instructed not to re-enter the house until the following morning, and indeed Mrs. Binkley did not re-enter with her child until late the following afternoon, which was twenty hours longer than expert judgment had decided was necessary for safety. Plaintiff’s manager was asked: “Q. Is it customary in your particular line of work to make a subsequent test after you had made the first tests, and show the results you had? A. I would say not, in the presence of only 25 per million gas. There were 12 more hours time available before the tenants came back, and it can be safely presumed that these 25 per million will dissipate during that 12-hour period. Q. In your opinion, based upon the experience that you have had, do you think it was safe to' allow people to come back the next morning at seven o’clock? A. Yes, I would say yes.” In spite of this testimony that the same tests were taken as were customary in the business and that the judgment exercised was based on long expérience, the court is now saying as a matter of law that the appellant had no right to “satisfy himself” by thus following the prevailing and normal standards. Certainly, at the very least, it would be for the jury and not for the court exercising judicial hindsight to say whether appel<a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>lant did honestly and in good faith satisfy himself that sufficient precautions had been taken. It is true, of course, that the child died, but how it came to die is wholly unexplained; there may have been some undetected, and even undetectable, pocket of gas lurking in the flooring, or a gas-pocket may have formed in a closet and dissipated during the night. Mrs. Binkley testified that, sleeping in the bed next to her child, she did not smell or otherwise perceive any gas whatever in her apartment. The child’s death was an accident which may have been due (as the jury in the suit brought by the mother has found that it was due) to some negligence on the part of appellant, — some failure to observe the measure of care which he owed to the child under the circumstances, — but to hold that therefore he cannot recover on this policy of liability insurance — intended, as it was, to protect him in that very event — is to render a decision which, in my opinion, is contrary both to the applicable rules of law and to the dictates of justice.</p>

The contract was to indemnify the plaintiff against liability for negligence by the assured or his employees. His employees were admittedly negligent, causing the death of an infant child. In a trespass action, the plaintiff was held liable and paid <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>the amount of the verdict rendered by the jury.

No business man of ordinary intelligence would accept such a contract. Heretofore a policy of insurance has always been construed favorably to the assured and not to the insurance company.</p>
