Then when I was finished with the front, their man took me to the other room to measure that room off. He went ahead of me and I followed him and when we were in there, I don’t know how many feet, he turned on the right and he said, ‘Mr. Bartek, here is the sink.’ I made another step and I went right down. I went seven feet down to the cellar, which I later on found out, and they had a trapdoor and it was open. That is all I remember until I got to the storeroom and I was sitting down on a chair in my storeroom and I came to myself.”</p>

She was accompanied by her daughter. While in the store she walked about three feet to go to the counter, and then fell down an open stairway. The Superior Court in sustaining the action of Judge Horace Stern, then of the Common Pleas Court No. 2 of Philadelphia County, in entering judgment for the defendant non obstante ver dicto quoted from Judge Stern’s opinion as follows: “To enter a store where she [plaintiff] had never been before and start to walk forward when it was so dark that she could not see even the floor beneath her feet, was an act of contributory negligence.”</p>

It is <em>not </em>the law of Pennsylvania that when a person walks into an opening in <em>semi-darJoness </em>the case is always for the jury. We made that plain in <em>Bailey v. Alexander Realty Co., </em>supra, where we said (p. 367) : “There is no rule which says that if a man walks into an open elevator shaft in semi-darkness, the question of his negligence must be submitted to the jury. If while in total darkness he walks into an open elevator shaft without first ‘feeling his way’, he is in law guilty of negligence. If while in semi-darkness he does not use either his sense of sight or his sense of feeling, as a guide, but walks into <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>an opening merely because he assumes that the elevator is at the floor, he is in law guilty of negligence. If in semi-darkness he uses his sense of sight as carefully as he can and reasonably believes he can ‘see his way’ and <em>if his sense of sight deceives him, </em>he may or may not be guilty of negligence and the question will be for the jury. The law does not require a man to possess perfect vision in a setting of complete visibility before proceeding on his course.” (Italics supplied). In other words, <em>under all circumstances </em>a man must use the senses that are available to him. If he uses his sense of sight but because there is enough light to cast shadows which mislead him to his injury the question of his negligence may be for the jury. We so held in <em>Murphy v. Bernheim &amp; Sons, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/327/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="327 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="1176685" data-case-paths="/pa/327/0285-01">327 Pa. 285</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.%20194" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="194 A. 194">194 A. 194</a>. In the instant case plaintiff made no claim that his senses were deceived by shadows or by anything else. .He simply refused to avail himself of his sense of sight and in blind confidence followed the man who was ahead of him. There was no necessity of his doing so. No individual in full possession of his senses is justified in dropping those safeguards which are instinctive in every human being and in depending on another for his safety when he is fully able to depend on himself. This court said in <em>Hoffner v. Bergdoll, </em><a href="/pa/309/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="309 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1141697" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0558-01">309 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20607" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="164 A. 607">164 A. 607</a>, that the plaintiff could not delegate to another her own duty to exercise due care and that if she did she was guilty of contributory negligence. These cases rule the instant case.</p>

The following paragraph [pp. 69-70] of the court’s opinion, by Mr. Justice Horace Stern, is particularly pertinent here: “The question of plaintiff’s contributory negligence was undoubtedly for the jury.

Penn-Pittsburgh Corp., </em>supra, to the facts of the instant case, first we must analyze the evidence to determine the degree of darkness. At the time of the accident there was no artificial light of any kind. The testimony of plaintiff’s son who inspected the scene of the accident immediately after his father was injured is helpful: “Q. Could you see anything in that rear room unless you turned on a flashlight? A. You could see part way. The light was shining in. You could see — would give you a faint illumination. You could notice where the white sink stood at. You could see the edge of that. Q. All you could see — you could see a little bit of the light from the— A. Where the light shines in the door. All you could see was the sink, and the floor right in front of the door. Q. All that you could see then as I understand you of this rear room, or what was in it, without having the flashlight on or some other artificial light turned on, was that portion of the floor immediately inside and directly in line with the opening in the partition and the white sink? A. Yes. Q. Is that right? A. That’s right. Q. Did any of this light that shone in from the front through the door way in the partition, <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>fall upon the trap door? A. No, sir. Q. You say that opening was at least six feet long? A. About six feet long. Q. And about thirty inches wide? A. About thirty inches wide and about three feet or a little better than that from the partition. That is the distance of it. One edge of it.” The evidence definitely proves that the room was neither pitch dark or in broad daylight. It is clear that some subdued light was reflected from the adjoining room. The actual degree of darkness was a question of fact and therefore only a jury could determine it.</p>
    <p id="b554-4" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[239,872,1147,586]]]'>Plaintiff was not exploring an unfamiliar place alone but was being shown the room by an agent with the intention of renting it for business use if satisfactory. Surely plaintiff could place some reliance on his guide and not anticipate a dangerous condition on the premises. The conclusion seems inescapable then that plaintiff has shown complete justification for his presence at the place of danger. Under these facts the question of whether plaintiff exercised reasonable care, could only be determined by a jury. See also <em>Kmiotek v. Anast, </em><a href="/pa/350/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="350 Pa. 593" data-case-ids="461169" data-case-paths="/pa/350/0593-01">350 Pa. 593</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=39%20A.2d%20923" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="39 A.2d 923">39 A. 2d 923</a>.</p>

In <em>Bailey v. Alexander Realty Co., </em><a href="/pa/342/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="342 Pa. 362" data-case-ids="1206887" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0362-01">342 Pa. 362</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=20%20A.2d%20754" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="20 A.2d 754">20 A. 2d 754</a>, plaintiff walked to the elevator shaft on the ground floor of a hotel and finding the door partly open and the interior dark, walked through the opening and fell down the shaft. It is obvious that the facts are not even remotely analogous to the instant case. In <em>Hoffner v. Bergdoll, </em><a href="/pa/309/0558-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="309 Pa. 558" data-case-ids="1141697" data-case-paths="/pa/309/0558-01">309 Pa. 558</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=164%20A.%20607" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="164 A. 607">164 A. 607</a>, another elevator case, plaintiff tried to excuse her negligence in stepping into an open elevator shaft by saying she relied upon a fellow employee. There was absolutely no reason for her to rely on Green, her fellow employee, because they were both employed by defendant and were equally familiar with the premises. Likewise, each of the other cases cited in the majority opinion, is completely different from the <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>instant case in its factual situation, and, therefore, easily distinguishable.</p>
    <p id="b555-5" data-blocks='[["BL_555.4",555,[173,388,1152,524]]]'>Plaintiff here entered a back room, which was not entirely without light, as a business invitee. He was under the agent’s guidance and had not been warned of the dangerous condition. The injury was sustained while he was pursuing a reasonable and proper business purpose and the question of whether he exercised the proper degree of care was for the jury. For these reasons the action of the learned court below should be reversed and a procedendo awarded. Mr. Justice Horace Stern concurs in this dissent.</p>
