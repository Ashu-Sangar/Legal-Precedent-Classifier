Defendants in their answer averred that the vendee was in default for failing to make settlement at the time specified.</p>
    <p id="b103-6" data-blocks='[["BL_103.9",103,[200,873,1149,979]]]'>On September 4, 1945, plaintiffs entered into a written agreement, apparently in Pennsylvania, to purchase the premises referred to from the defendants, who are residents of Philadelphia, for the sum of $16,850.00, subject to a mortgage of $12,000.00. The sum of $500.00 was paid on account of the purchase price. The agreement provided, inter alia, as follows: “Settlement is to take place at Atlantic City, N. J., on or before the 25th day of November, 1945, which time is of the essence of this agreement, when the Seller shall deliver a general warranty deed for the said premises, and the balance of the purchase price is to be paid or secured as follows: ...” The agreement of sale did not contain a waiver of formal tender of the general warranty deed. On November 24, 1945, by an agreement in writing, the time for settlement was extended to December 26, 1945, and the plaintiffs paid an additional sum of $500.00 on account of the purchase price.</p>
    <p id="b103-7" data-blocks='[["BL_103.10",103,[201,1865,1150,479]],["BL_104.1",104,[239,265,1150,2068]],["BL_105.1",105,[188,269,1149,539]]]'>On December 19,1945, the plaintiff, Rebecca Fischell, notified the defendants that she had received a general warranty deed for execution, and certain affidavits to be executed by the defendants as required by the title company in order to remove objections raised by the existence of certain judgments against an individual who bore the same name as Max Weiss. Cohn testified that on December 19, 1945, he discussed the settlement with the defendant, Max Weiss, that he told Weiss that <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>he had the papers for him to execute; that he would mail them to him; that Weiss told him not to mail them. The next afternoon Weiss came in and told Cohn that he [Weiss] had a child who had been taken to the hospital, seriously ill. Cohn said: “With your child in the hospital, I will try to save trouble for your wife. You have her sign the deed here in front of a Jersey Commissioner. You will have to. go to Atlantic City.” Weiss took the papers away. Weiss said to Cohn: “Let me know in a couple of days [about closing the transaction] because with the boy in the hospital I would like to know in advance.” He said: “Finally I got the Title Company and a date was arranged for the following Saturday, the 29th. I called Weiss immediately and said ‘settlement is arranged for the 29th if it’s all right with you, if it isn’t we can change the date.’ ” Weiss said: “I’ll call you tomorrow morning and let you know.” Weiss did not call him so he called Weiss, who then said: “I think we are going to have a little trouble ... I don’t own that property, my mother owns it ... We are not going to sell.” Weiss testified that his child was in the hospital not on the 21st but on the 24th of December. He said he asked Cohn on December 21st if a date had been fixed for settlement. Cohn said he would let him know. He again called Cohn on December 22nd to find out when the settlement was to be held. Cohn said he would let him know. They had a similar conversation on December 23rd. He testified that on December 26th, about 4 P. M., he talked with Cohn and was told by him the settlement was going to be December 29th in Atlantic City. Weiss testified he told Cohn he would let him know in the morning. The next morning he said he told Cohn “I could not agree and I refused to go on with the settlement at that time.” He was asked these questions on cross-examination: “Did you tell Mr. Cohn on the 21st that if a settlement was not made on the 26th you would consider the deposit forfeited.” He answered: “I did not.” “Did you <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>tell Mm that on the 24th?” He answered: “I did not.” “Did you tell him that on the 25th?1” “A. I did not. Q. Did you tell him that on the 26th when he called you at 4:00 o’clock? A. No.” He was asked: “The first time you told him was on the 27th?” He answered: “That’s right.” The conduct of the defendant, Weiss, during the week ending on December 26, 1945 was sufficient to convince the plaintiff that he, Weiss, was not going to insist that the transaction be consummated on the date specified, to wit, December 26, 1945.</p>
    <p id="b105-4" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[182,819,1155,1250]]]'>Even though the agreement of sale makes time of “the essence of the contract”, this provision may be waived by agreement or by the conduct of the parties. This record supports the court’s 13th finding of fact that “the defendants deliberately permitted the settlement day to pass without affirmative action in the expectation of avoiding the contract ...” Weiss admitted that 2 days before the fixed date of settlement he mentioned to Cohn that his [Weiss’] son was in the hospital. The further statement (if Cohn’s testimony is credited) that he was “not interested in real estate . . . his child’s life came first” was well calculated to lull Cohn into the belief that Weiss was not going to insist on closing the deal on December 26th. Weiss admitted that on December 26th, Cohn said that settlement had been fixed for December 29 and he [Weiss] made no objection. If Weiss really considered that time was of the essence of the contract, he should, on December 26th, have said to Cohn: “You close this transaction today or I will consider the agreement at an end.” Instead of thus acting with the frankness of a fair-dealing man, he said nothing until the following day when he refused to carry out the agreement of sale.</p>

After forfeiture for default has been waived, time becomes essential thereafter only where the vendor makes it so by proper notice and demand. The decisions proceed upon the theory that the vendor cannot use his own indulgence as a trap in which to catch the purchaser.” (Citing cases). In the instant case the apparent “indulgence” of the defendant at Christmas-time 194.5 and his leading Cohn to believe that his (Weiss’) solicitude for his son who was ill in the hospital had crowded the pending real estate deal out of his mind was well calculated to serve “as a trap” to put the purchaser “off his guard” in respect to time being of the essence of the contract of sale and purchase. His failure on December 26th to object to the postponement of the settlement date also tended to mislead Cohn into the belief that Weiss did not regard time as of the essence of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[233,1318,1149,806]]]'>Another important element in this case is the fact, as found by the court below, that the defendants never tendered a duly executed general warranty deed, nor the necessary affidavits as to existing judgments required to remove the objections of the title company. If the vendor intended to hold the vendee to a strict compliance to the terms of the agreement in respect to the time of settlement, he should have been meticulous about his own readiness to perform Ms part of the agreement at the time fixed for settlement.

The contract involved real estate located in New Jersey and was to have been performed in that state.

A decree having been obtained against the defendant, the latter objected to the jurisdiction of the court. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the United States Supreme Court, said: “. . . the principles of equity give a court jurisdiction wherever the person may be found, and the circumstances, that a question of title may be involved in the inquiry, and may even constitute the essential point on which the case depends, does not seem sufficient to arrest that jurisdiction.” Chief Justice Marshall cites several cases, among them being the celebrated case of <em>Penn v. Lord Baltimore, </em>1 Vez. 444, in which the Lord Chancellor of England decreed a specific performance of a contract respecting lands lying in North America. In Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion appears the following: “In the case of Arglasse v. Muschamp, 1 Vernon, 75, the defendant, residing in England, having fraudulently obtained a rent charge on lands lying in Ireland, <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>a bill was brought in England to set it aside. To an objection made to the jurisdiction of the court the chancellor replied, ‘This is surely only a jest put upon the jurisdiction of this court by the common lawyers; for when you go about to bind the lands and grant a sequestration to execute a decree, then they readily tell you that the authority of this court is only to regulate a man’s conscience, and ought not to affect the estate, but that this court must agree in personam only; and when, as in this case, you prosecute the person for a fraud, they tell you that you must not intermeddle here, because, the fraud, though committed here, concerns lands that lie in Ireland, which makes the jurisdiction local, and so wholly elude the jurisdiction of this court.’ The chancellor, in that case, sustained his jurisdiction on principle, and on the authority of Archer and Preston, in which case a contract made respecting lands in Ireland, the title to which depends on the act of settlement, was enforced in England, although the defendant was a resident of Ireland, and had only made a casual visit to England. On a rehearing before Lord Keeper North this decree was affirmed.” Chief Justice Marshall adds: “Upon the authority of these cases, and of others which are to be found in the books, as well as upon general principles, this court is of opinion that, in a case of fraud, of trust, or of contract, the jurisdiction of a court of chancery is sustainable wherever the person be found, although lands not within the jurisdiction of that court may be affected by the decree.”</p>
