After the suit was brought, the Pennsylvania Company petitioned the court, admitting possession of the fund, liability to pay it to the proper owner, averring that others than the plaintiff have laid claim to it, and asking leave to pay the money into court and for an order directing an interpleader between the rival claimants. That petition was granted, and in the interpleader framed thereunder, the claimants, some seven in number, are aligned as plaintiffs, and the Girard Trust Company as defendant. To the statement of claim filed by the plaintiffs in .the interpleader, the defendant filed an affidavit of defense raising questions of law, and, although given an opportunity to amend their Statement of Claim, the plaintiffs in the interpleader informed us that they did not desire to do so. We, therefore, granted judgment in favor of the Girard Trust Company, as defendant in the interpleader, for the amount of the sum in controversy. The controlling facts in the case, as disclosed by the pleadings, are as follows:</blockquote>

It was <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>provided in the mortgage trust deed that, until permanent coupon bonds could be prepared and delivered, the company might issue interim certificates in lieu thereof, without coupons, but in substantially the same form as, and exchangeable for, a like amount of permanent bonds, when the latter should be issued. The mortgage provided that the temporary bonds, when duly authenticated by the trustee, the Union Trust Company of Cleveland, Ohio, should enjoy the security of the mortgage, and that interest thereon, when and as payable, should be paid only ‘upon the presentation, and endorsement of such payment upon, the temporary bonds’.</blockquote>

This has never been collected <em>from </em>the trustee, although duly deposited with it by the railroad.' Prior to July 1, 1931, the railroad notified holders of interim certificates that the permanent bonds were ready and would be exchanged for the certificates, but the exchange was never made by the Girard Trust Company in the case of its bond.</blockquote>

In the agreement setting up the committee it was provided that the bonds deposited under it ‘must bear or be accompanied by the coupon maturing July 1, 1932, and all subsequent coupons’. On May 19, 1932, the Girard Trust Company, through its agent, deposited the bond here in question with itself, as depository, and issued therefor to its agent a standard form Certificate of Deposit, which, inter alia, acknowledged receipt of ‘one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars principal amount of the above mentioned bonds with appurtenant coupons due on and after July, 1932’. This, of course, was not a strictly accurate recital, for that particular Certificate of Deposit was issued against an interim certificate which had no coupons attached to it, as indicated above. This circumstance is not without importance to a decision of the case, however, because as will be seen from the following paragraph of this opinion, in which the sale of the bond by the Girard Trust Company to the claimant’s vendor is recited, what was actually sold and delivered to the purchaser at that sale was not the bond itself, but a certificate of deposit, which recited a bonded obligation ‘with appurtenant coupons (i. e., interest obligations) due on and after July, 1932’.</blockquote>

That certificate ‘and all rights and interests represented thereby’ was endorsed and delivered to the purchaser, Herbert H.

Thus, it is immaterial that Girard Trust Company did not actually exchange its interim certificate for the permanent coupon bond, which it could have obtained at any time on and after January 1, 1931. Plaintiffs concede this fact, as indeed they must, for there was no <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>requirement of exchange in the trust deed or in the temporary bond itself; and it has been held, in addition, that the issuance of permanent bonds may be waived by an interim certificate holder: <em>Smith v. Central &amp; Pacific Improvement Corp., </em><a href="/cal-app/45/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="45 Cal. App. 384" data-case-ids="2055201" data-case-paths="/cal-app/45/0384-01">45 Cal. App. 384</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=187%20P.%20456" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="187 P. 456">187 P. 456</a>. It is clear, therefore, as plaintiffs admit, that the Girard Trust Company, on each due date, could have presented its interim certificate and received payment of the interest. Nor was there any duty upon the Girard Trust Company to present its bond and collect each payment of interest as and when it was made to the trustee. As has been seen, the temporary bond, for all intents and purposes, was the equivalent of the permanent bond, the coupons attached to the latter being ‘given simply as a convenient mode of obtaining payment of the interest as it becomes due upon the bonds’: <em>City of Kenosha v. Lamson, </em>9 Wall (U. S.) 477, <a href="/us/76/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="19 L. Ed. 725" data-case-ids="3439757" data-case-paths="/us/76/0477-01">19 L. Ed. 725</a>, 728. If the bondholder chooses not to avail himself of that convenience, that is his concern. In fact, it has been held in this jurisdiction, as long ago as 1880, that there is no obligation on the holder of a coupon bond to present the bond, or the coupons, for payment. In <em>Williamsport Gas Company v. Pinkerton, </em><a href="/pa/95/0062-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="95 Pa. 62" data-case-ids="492929" data-case-paths="/pa/95/0062-01">95 Pa. 62</a>, 64: ‘he may hold on to the coupons just as long as he can hold on to the bond without requiring payment.’ In other words, the twenty years statute of limitations applicable to the specialty of the bonds is equally applicable to the interest coupons, and this is so, whether or not the coupons have been detached: <em>City of Kenosha v. Lamson, </em><a href="/us/76/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="19 L. Ed. 725" data-case-ids="3439757" data-case-paths="/us/76/0477-01">supra;</a> <em>McDowell, Executrix, v.

This being the clear legal rule upon that question, the position of the Girard Trust Company is not impaired by the fact that it did not actually collect the interest payments here in question, or that it failed to procure a permanent bond.</blockquote>
