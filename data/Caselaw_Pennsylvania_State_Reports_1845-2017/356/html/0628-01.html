Neller, who died January 18, 1945, intestate. Surviving him were two daughters of his marriage with Kathryn E. Neller, and a son by a former marriage. Kathryn E. Neller presented her claim against the estate for one fourth of the net estate, pursuant to a “separation agreement” which she entered into with the decedent on October 30, 1934. In it the husband admitted his liability for the support of his wife, and she agreed that she would not press any nonsupport charge against him and in lieu of her claim for support that she would accept $75 per week until April 1, 1935, and thereafter the sum of $50 per week for and during her natural lifetime. The husband agreed to make these payments and also that “at the time of his death there shall be paid <a id="p630" href="#p630" data-label="630" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*630</a>from his estate to the wife a sum equal to one fourth of the net amount of said estate”. It was further provided that the agreement shall “not be terminated by either party obtaining a divorce but that if the wife should remarry all her rights to weekly payment as set forth in the agreement shall be void and of no effect and his estate shall also be relieved from the payment of the obligation mentioned” (i. e., the one fourth of the net amount of his estate). In the adjudication the wife was awarded, according to this agreement, one fourth of the estate, amounting to $10,950.77. On this sum of money the Commonwealth makes its tax claim.</p>

      <a id="p631" href="#p631" data-label="631" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*631</a>This amended Act of 1943 makes it clear that the Legislature did not contemplate by the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act that the transfer of money used to pay a bona fide debt for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth should be taxable. This reduces the problem now before us to these questions: Did the separation agreement create a debt due his wife and payable upon the husband’s death and was it bona fide for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth? We decide that it was. The husband’s obligations which the “separation agreement” created relieved him of all legal obligations to give additional financial support to his wife, no matter how wealthy he might become. She by this agreement precluded herself from making him pay her more than (1) $75 per week until April 1, 1935, and (2) thereafter the sum of $50 per week during her natural lifetime, and'(3) one fourth of his estate at the time of his death. These debts “were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth”:</p>

Many individuals late in life incur debts whose payments they do not intend to be made until after their death, for the reason that their chief assets consist of the promises in their life insurance policies or because their estate is in such form that their debts cannot be liquidated until their estate is conyerted into money or its equivalent. If the money received by a creditor in payment of a debt from a decedent is subject to an inheritance tax because the debtor’s intention was that the payment should be made only after his death it is impossible to find any reason why <em>all </em>moneys received by creditors after the death of their debtors should not be taxed, provided both creditor and debtor intended or knew that the debt would not be paid until <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>after the debtor’s death. There is no basis for a logical distinction in imposing “transfer taxes”, between a transfer of money from a decedent’s estate to pay his general debts and a transfer of money from a decedent’s estate to pay a debt whose time of payment was formally fixed “at or after his death”. If A gives B two notes, each for a certain sum, and makes one payable 10 years later and makes the other one payable at A’s death, and A dies 10 years later, the money used by A’s executor in paying the first note is admittedly <em>not </em>subject to a transfer tax, but according to the Commonwealth’s argument the money used by A’s executor to pay the second note <em>is </em>subject to a transfer tax. We do not believe that the legislature in passing the Act of 1919, and its amendments, intended any such absurd result. The Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, Article IV, section 52, 46 PS 552, declares that in ascertaining the intention of the Legislature in the enactment of a law the courts may be guided by the following presumptions among others: “(1) That the Legislature does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable . . .”</p>

Gross of the court below succinctly summed up this case when he said: “If this decedent had agreed in writing for the same considerations to pay his wife a fixed and definite sum of money, or had executed and delivered to her a promissory note for the same purpose payable at his death, it could hardly be successfully argued that he would not have created a debt against his estate, and we fail to see any <a id="p633" href="#p633" data-label="633" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*633</a>difference between the contract as written and the two methods just mentioned, nor are we able to distinguish between the effect of this contract and an antenuptial agreement insofar as the payment of transfer inheritance tax is concerned.”</p>

In the <em>Vanderbilt </em>case, supra, Mr. Vanderbilt’s estate was depleted to the extent of $2,000,000 because of his antenuptial agreement with the woman who became his wife but that fact did not make the transaction illegal, nor did it subject the $2,000,000 to an inheritance tax.</p>

This was a sum about $1,800-more than the one-fourth of her husband’s estate she was entitled to under the separation agreement.

In view of Mrs. Neller’s agreeing to accept after the separation continued for 5 months, $25 a week less than she had been receiving for five months by way of support, this reduction of $25 a week to continue for the remainder of Neller’s life, the promise that in <em>lieu of additional support </em>she should at Neller’s death receive one-fourth of his net estate was a logical and natural provision to make. There is nothing in this record which justifies any intimation that this provision was a device to avoid taxation. In view of Mrs. Neller’s separation from her husband, she would have no motive to enter into any agreement whereby any part of her husband’s estate should be relieved of taxation, and Mr. Neller, of course, would have no motive to contrive any device by which whatever sum his separated wife should receive from his estate should be relieved of a “transfer inheritance tax”.

Such is precisely the situation which the instant decision covers; and the majority hold that the amount so payable to the wife out of her husband’s estate after his death is in discharge of a debt and, therefore, deductible in ascertaining the clear value of his net estate subject to tax. With that, I cannot agree.</p>

It matters not whether the parties, when thus contracting, are living separate and apart or are living together in amity and continue so to do until separated by death. The <em>postnuptial </em>relinquishment by the one of a marital right against the other is no more a <em>“consideration in money or money’s worth” </em>in the one instance than in the other. A conclusion otherwise' seems inadmissible from the very character of the subject-matter dealt with. Marital rights <a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>are created and exist by law in furtherance of its regard for the social importance and dignity of the status to which they attach. Once such- rights become , fixed, and thenceforth while the marriage endures, they are unsusceptible, as a matter of law, of being appraised, aliened or terminated on a parity with articles of commerce on the market. Tax laws, in particular, have generally so recognized: see <em>Commissioner v. Wemyss, </em><a href="/us/324/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="324 U.S. 303" data-case-ids="6155242" data-case-paths="/us/324/0303-01">324 U. S. 303</a>, 305.</p>
    <p id="b663-4" data-blocks='[["BL_663.4",663,[209,761,1151,1355]]]'>Primarily, the question presented for decision in the instant case is whether Mrs. Neller’s postnuptial relinquishment of her right to obtain a support order against her husband constituted an adequate,and full consideration <em>in money or money’s worth </em>for the husband’s contemporaneously specified obligation that she receive a certain portion of his net estate upon his death. In short, did Mrs. Neller become a creditor of her husband by virtue of their postnuptial agreement? Unless that question can justifiably be answered in the affirmative, there is no basis whatsoever for deducting from .the husband’s estate, in ascertaining its clear value subject-to tax, the amount so payable to Mrs. Neller. out of the estate. Section. 2 of the Transfer Inheritance Tax-Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 52Í, as amended by the Act of May 27, 1943, P. L. 757 (72. PS 2302), provides, in presently material part, that “. . . In ascertaining the clear value of such estates, the only deductions to be allowed from the gross values of such estates . . ; shall be the. debts of the decedent, [etc.] . ¿ Provided, That <em>the deductions herein allowed in the ease of any indebtedness of the decedent shall, when founded upon a promise or agreement, be limited to the extent that they were contracted bona fide and for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth. . . </em>.” (Emphasis supplied).</p>

The majority opinion cites no authoritative decision to the contrary, and none has yet come to my attention otherwise. The cases of <em>In Re Vanderbilt’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=172%20N.Y.S.%20511" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="172 N.Y.S. 511">172 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=172%20N.Y.S.%20511" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="172 N.Y.S. 511">N.

(Mass.) 509, cited by the majority, like the cases cited by the learned court below, are readily distinguishable and are not in point here. Each of them is concerned with property rights acquired under an <em>ante-</em>nuptial agreement, made when the contracting parties had not yet entered the marital status with its attendant reciprocal legal rights and liabilities, and the contemplated marriage, itself, upon performance becomes valuable consideration sufficient to support the antecedent covenants and obligations of the parties. The instant case grows out of a postnuptial agreement and the opinion of the majority as well as that of the court below so tabulates it. So far as a setting for deliberate tax avoidance is concerned, the distinction seems obvious.</p>

Rev. Code, 26 U. S. C. A. 812 (b) (5). In fact, the particular language is exactly the same in both the State and Federal Acts. The Federal statute, however, in the subdivision and subsection above cited, also goes on to declare that “For the purposes of this subchapter, a relinquishment or promised relinquishment of dower, curtesy, or of a statutory estate created in lieu of dower or curtesy, or of other marital rights in the decedent’s property or estate, shall not be considered to any extent a consideration fin money or money’s worth’ ”. The provision just quoted is not now <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>cited as directly controlling here. But, at most, it is no more than a super-cautionary iteration of the rule appropriate in the circumstances to tax law administration <em>even without the express statutory declaration. </em>That that is so is plainly evident from the action taken by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Merrill v. Fahs, </em><a href="/us/324/0308-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="324 U.S. 308" data-case-ids="6155285" data-case-paths="/us/324/0308-01">324 U.

    <p id="b665-4" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[206,704,1148,1357]]]'>Thus, the Federal Gift Tax Act, consonantly with the allowances of the Federal Estate Tax Act for debt deductions, taxes as a gift property transferred in excess of “an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth”. But, the Gift Tax Act, unlike the Estate Tax Act, does not contain the legislative declaration as to the relinquishment of a marital right not being considered “to any extent a consideration ‘in money or money’s worth’ Nonetheless, in the <em>Merrill </em>case, the Supreme Court applied the exclusory rule to that gift tax case on the ground that the principle was a naturally inherent part of the legislative limitation intended by the phrase “adequate and full consideration”. In that connection, Mr. Justice Frankfurter said at pp. 312-313, “Plainly, the explicitness [i. e., exclusion of relinquishment of marital rights from being considered “money or money’s worth”] was one of cautious redundancy to prevent ‘subversion of the legislative intent’. Without this specific provision, Congress undoubtedly intended the requirement of ‘adequate and full consideration’ to exclude relinquishment of dower and other marital rights with respect to the estate tax.” There is no sound reason, so far as I can see, for concluding that the Pennsylvania legislature meant anything different by its use of the same terms.</p>
