As early as 1612 Coke said: “Few men pinched with the messengers of death have a disposing memory”: 10 Rep. Pref. XIY. According to the physician, who was the scrivener, at the time decedent signed the paper he was desperately ill; death was imminent; his only possible chance to survive was to be treated in the hospital; when the paper was signed decedent was in a stupor and generally depressed; the alleged instructions for making the will were most vague and indefinite; there was no indication that decedent possessed a full and intelligent knowledge that he was making a <em>will, </em>or what property he possessed, or that he had an intelligent perception and understanding of the disposition he desired to make of his property. There was no proof that the scrivener, the witness or the proponent made the slightest inquiries of the decedent concerning such matters. The paper which was prepared and signed was neither read nor explained to decedent. Decedent was in such a debilitated physical and mental condition that the jury could fairly find that he did not possess testamentary capacity and was incapable of properly understanding the nature of his act and the purport of the paper which he signed.</p>

The most that was proved concerning the relations between decedent and proponent was the friendship of neighbors. Proponent never transacted any business for decedent, nor were they ever socially intimate. With the decedent in the physical and mental state hereinbefore stated, the physician scrivener who had never before known or <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>seen decedent, wrote the will, in proponent’s presence, was advised by the scrivener’s attorney as to wording, and with the proponent in company with another friend called as a witness, went to the darkened barn, and with the aid of a small flashlight secured decedent’s signature to the paper. To assure himself as to the legality of the paper, the proponent, after the execution, and the signature of testator, at that time or at a later date, added a circle and wrote therein the word “seal”. It is true that the scrivener, the witness and proponent all testified that decedent said he wanted “Mr. Boss” [proponent] to have everything, and declined to go to the hospital until such a paper was signed; in all the suspicious surrounding circumstances, the question of undue influence and fraud was clearly for the jury: <em>Cookson’s Estate, </em><a href="/pa/325/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="325 Pa. 81" data-case-ids="1172302" data-case-paths="/pa/325/0081-01">325 Pa. 81</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.%20904" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="188 A. 904">188 A. 904</a>; <em>Buhan v.
