On the contrary, the evidence is clear that the A. &amp; P.’s operating expense would be greatly increased, as in fact it was, by severing hauling relations with plaintiff and other non-union truckers. The written contract contained a clause reserving to each party the right to cancel on 1Ó days’ notice.

In dealing with the evidence said to support the charges against the union and the three officers it is necessary to consider section 8 of the Act of June 2, 1937, P. L. 1198, 1202, 43 PS 206 h.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> With respect to Appeal No. 146 from the refusal to take off the nonsuit entered on the motion of the executrix of Joseph Kenny, plaintiff encountered an additional difficulty; Kenny’s death closed plaintiff’s mouth. As to these four appeals, we also agree that the evidence does not measure up to what the rule requires. We realize from our consideration of the evidence and from what is said in the elaborate briefs of argument, that in presenting a case like this there was, and probably always will be, difficulty in supplying the measure of proof required by the law, but we may not for that reason relax the settled rule. We therefore adopt the opinion written by Judge Richardson; we may add that while the members of the learned court below were not unanimous with respect to Mason, <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>Marshall and Rosenthal, we all agree that in the case of each appeal the judgment appealed from must be affirmed.</p>
