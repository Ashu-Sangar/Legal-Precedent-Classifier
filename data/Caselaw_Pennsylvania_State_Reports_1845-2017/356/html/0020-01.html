L. 327, as amended by the Act of June 5, 1913, P. L. 412, section 1, 31 PS 802, which imposes license fees of $500 upon wholesale dealers in oleomargarine and $100 upon retail dealers of oleomargarine, unconstitutional and void, and enjoining the defendants and their agents from attempting to collect such fees as a condition precedent to the wholesale and retail dealers engaging in the business of selling oleomargarine.</p>

      <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>The matter came before the court upon bill, answer and testimony. The bill was brought to test the constitutionality of the license feature of the Act of 1901, P. L. 327, as amended. Four plaintiffs are engaged in retail sale of meats and groceries, and one is engaged in the sale of such products at wholesale, all of whom operate their own establishments, and have money invested therein.</p>

The license to manufacture oleomargarine costs $1,000. The proprietor of a hotel or restaurant must pay $50 for a license. The proprietor of a boarding house must pay $10 for a license. Each license is issued for one year. Heavy penalties are prescribed for violations. The Act charges the Dairy and Food Commissioner, now known as the Director of the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry, with the enforcement of the Act, and permits any citizen to bring suit for violation. It provides that the money paid into the Treasury shall constitute a special fund for the use of the Department of .Agriculture for the enforcement of the Act. The bill avers (1) that oleomargarine is that defined by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Foods and Chemistry “as the oleaginous product composed wholly or in part of fat other than butter fat, with incorporated water, and may contain salt, and casein, and must not be colored in imitation of butter”; (2) that oleomargarine is a pure, wholesome and nutritious food which must conform to the definitions and standards of oleomargarine as promulgated by the Federal Security Administrator, effective September 1, 1941, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended; and (3) that the oleomargarine law is an arbitrary and unreasonable interference with business and imposes harsh and unreasonable restrictions upon a lawful occupation, and constitutes an abuse of the. police power, in violation of the 14th Amendment to <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>the Constitution of the United States, Article I, sections 1, 9, and 26, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and Article III, section 7, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, because the fees imposed are far in excess of the costs of issuing the licenses and policing the business.</p>

President Judge Hakgest of the court below succinctly defined the issue involved as “whether the license fees of $100 per year for retailers and $500 per year for wholesalers, of oleomargarine, have a reasonable relation to the amount of money necessary to be expended for the enforcement of the oleomargarine statute.”</p>
    <p id="b47-6" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[182,982,1149,591]]]'>The court found, inter alia, that one plaintiff, Yorty, would handle oleomargarine except for the cost of the license. Another, Flynn, has a license, sells 20 pounds of butter per day and five or six pounds of oleomargarine, and does not sell, and has not sold, enough oleomargarine during this year to pay his proportion of the license. Another plaintiff, Yorktowne Wholesale Grocery Company, a wholesaler, would sell oleomargarine except that the $500 license fee would be prohibitive. It is agreed that the other plaintiffs would give cumulative testimony.</p>

For the biennium 1943-45, the amount of cash received from oleomargarine licenses was $1,121,763.18. The amount of expenditures by the Department for the enforcement of all laws for the same period was $239,-802.32. For the fiscal year 1945-1946, the amount of cash received from oleomargarine licenses was $533,-562.35, and the amount expended by the Department in the enforcement of all laws was $144,405.61. For all <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>the fiscal years between 1931 and 1946, the amount collected from oleomargarine licenses ranges from two to five times the amount expended by the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry in the enforcement of all the laws, the enforcement of which is charged to that Bureau.</p>

From 1931 to date there have been no manufacturer’s licenses. In 1935 there were 34,451 retail dealers, and 4,191 holding oleomargarine licenses; and in 1929 there were 36,888 retail licenses, but the number of oleomargarine licenses is not given. In 1946, up to October 15, there were 5,171 retail licenses, and 46 wholesale licenses. There are approximately 37 Acts of Assembly, the enforcement of which is charged to the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry, and, of these, approximately 32 separate and distinct Acts regulating the manufacture and sale of hundreds of different kinds of foods and agricultural products, the enforcement of which is charged to that Bureau. There is no available estimate of the number of persons assigned to the work of the enforcement of the oleomargarine statute, because the licensing is periodic and requires additional help at certain times of the year. There are five agents generally assigned to handle the enforcement of the oleomargarine and carbonated beverage statutes, although the full time of no single individual is required throughout the year. Among all the products, the enforcement of which is committed to the Bureau, placed by the 37 Acts of Assembly above referred to, the only license fees required are (a) in the ice cream industry, for the production of 100,001 gallons or less $10 per year, 100,001 gallons to 250,000 gallons $50 per year, 250,001 gallons and upwards $100 per year; (b) carbonated beverage and still drink licenses $50 per year; and (c) bakery license, 50 pounds to 100 barrels of flour per week $5 per year, 100 to 200 barrels <a id="p25" href="#p25" data-label="25" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*25</a>of flour per week $20 per year. The other statutes subjecting the sale of food items to the supervision of the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry require no license fees. Oleomargarine or margarine is a pure, wholesome, and nutritive article of food, and is made from ingredients, all of which are pure, wholesome, and nutritive.</p>

But while it is for the legislature to determine in the first instance what laws and regulations are needed to carry out these ends, the courts may determine whether the regulations have some reasonable relation to those ends.

In that case Justice Pbckham, speaking for the United States Supreme Court, said: “. . . it may be admitted that oleomargarine in the course of its manufacture may sometimes be adulterated by dishonest manufacturers with articles that possibly may become injurious to health. Conceding the fact, we yet deny the right of a State to absolutely prohibit the introduction within its borders of an article of commerce, which is not adulterated and which in its pure state is healthful, simply because such an article in the course of its manufacture may be adulterated by dishonest manufacturers for purposes of fraud or illegal gains.

The court below based its decision upon the following legal conclusions: (1) No reasonable relation exists between the amount of money collected by the Bureau of Foods and Chemistry from the licensing fees for retailers and wholesalers under the provisions of the Oleomargarine Act of 1901, P. L. 327, as amended, and the amount of money expended for the enforcement of said Act. (2) The fees provided by the said Oleomargarine Act of 1901, P. L. 327, as amended, for the wholesale and retail sale of oleomargarine, are unreasonable, confiscatory, and discriminatory, and constitute an illegal restraint of trade. (3) The facts and circumstances surrounding the sale of oleomargarine, as proved in the trial of this case, are different from those which appear in other cases of this Commonwealth involving the sale of oleomargarine. (4) The fees imposed upon wholesale and retail dealers in oleomargarine cannot be justified under the exercise <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>of the police power. (5) The unconstitutionality of the unreasonable, excessive, and confiscatory fees imposed upon wholesale and retail dealers of oleomargarine is not cured by the age of the statute. (6) The Oleomargarine Act of 1901, P. L. 327, as amended, violates Article I, sections 1 and 9, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
    <p id="b51-5" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[178,710,1152,746]]]'>The Commonwealth contends that the Act challenged imposes a <em>tax </em>rather than a <em>license fee. </em>This contention is without merit.

It is purely and simply a police regulation. The name given a license law by the legislature is not controlling if, in fact, a tax is intended to be imposed. And, in determining the type or kind of tax, the substance of the law, rather than a designation or a name given it by the legislature, must be considered, and such determination must be drawn from the incidents as well as from the language employed in the Act or ordinance. Applying this rule, this statute does not impose a tax. It is undoubtedly a revenue-raising statute; but, by its title, the legislature only intended to provide Tor license fees’, and, by Section 12 of the Act, it definitely pro<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>vided ‘the money paid into the Treasury under the provisions of this Act shall constitute a special fund, for the use of the Department of Agriculture in enforcing the law.’ The Fiscal Code of 1927 abolished all special accounts except certain excepted .ones, and the oleomargarine fund was not excepted, but this did not change the facts that under the Oleomargarine Act the license fees were designated for a special purpose. It merely changed the manner in which the money was to be carried on the books of the Commonwealth. Such provision could not have saved an unconstitutional enactment; and if the license fees are unconstitutionally excessive, the change in the mode of bookkeeping would not save them.”</p>

A license or occupation tax, however, is imposed as a condition or as an element of the conditions upon the right to exercise a given privilege, its primary object being to regulate and control the business affected, and while the tax itself may not always be the sole condition, yet its payment is invariably made a part or a factor in the conditions upon which a business may be conducted. The character of a tax as a property tax or a license or occupation tax must be determined by its incidents, and from the natural and legal effect of the language employed in the act or ordinance, and not by the name by which it is described, or by the mode adopted in fixing its amount. If it is clearly a property tax, it will be so regarded, even though nominally and in form it is a license or occupation tax; and, on the other hand, if the tax is levied upon persons on account of their business, it will be construed as a license or occupation tax, even though it is graduated according to the property used in such business, or on the gross receipts of the business.” In <em>International Text Book Co. v. </em>Tone, <a href="/ny/220/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="220 N.Y. 313" data-case-ids="298287" data-case-paths="/ny/220/0313-01">220 N.

The presumption that this act, like all other acts of legislation, is constitutional means that the burden of proof is upon him who contends that the act is ««constitutional. This burden the plaintiff met when it proved that from 1931 to 1946 the amount collected for licenses to sell oleomargarine was so far in excess of the amount required to enforce the regulations as to the sales of that product as to impose an oppressive and unwarranted restriction upon a lawful business. When a factual situation continues for fifteen years which reveals that an ostensible police regulation is not a police regulation but in practical operation a device to hamper or destroy a legitimate business, it becomes the duty of the judiciary to declare the act’s true character and to decree that it is inoperative, even if the statute when it was first enacted was <em>in the situation then existing </em>a justifiable police regulation. When it ceased for a substantial period of time to be such a regulation it lost its aegis of constitutionality.</p>
