On October 1,1942, plaintiff, employed by Swift &amp; Company, delivered to defendant a consignment of meat. “The<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> plaintiff unloaded the meat at the meat cooler in the rear of said store and when he had completed this work went forward <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>past tlie chopping block to a showcase on the meat counter where, as customary, one of the defendant’s, clerks signed a receipt for the meat delivered. In passing to this counter the plaintiff walked along an aisle formed by the wall of the store on one side and a chopping block on the other. The meat cooler is at one end of this aisle and the cold meat counter at the other. Immediately following the signing of the receipts for the meat delivered the plaintiff, as apparently had been a custom at this store, he went to a nearby showcase containing cold meats where he obtained a small slice of meat to eat. As he was returning in this aisle to the rear of the store to enter his truck the plaintiff walked past a point in said aisle opposite from where the defendant’s servant, Balliet, was engaged in cutting away the burlap covering from the top of a barrel of dressed poultry. The plaintiff had a small piece or wad of paper in his right hand ‘about the size of a cigarette butt’ and as he was walking along this aisle he flicked it out of his hand and he stated he did not realize which direction it was going, but Balliet claimed afterwards this small piece of paper or paper wad had struck him in the face.”</p>

Plaintiff Avas asked: “Q. And as I understand it when the paper wad, when you flicked the paper wad, Balliet jumped up and turned around and threw the knife, is that correct? A. As near as I am telling you, I was walking like a man does without realizing where he is at the present time and the first thing I noticed was his heaving around towards me and throwing the knife, that is the first I noticed. Q. Was his back toward you or his side? A. To be honest brother, the first I seen Balliet is when he was turning, Avhich way he was when I was coming through I couldn’t tell you. Q. He had to turn to face you? A. He was swinging toward me when I first realized he was there.” Later he was asked: “Did you propel the paper wad with a force?” He answered, “Yes, when my fingers snapped.”</p>

As I understand it Balliet was stooping over opening a barrel of chickens and his left cheek was toward Dincher? A. Yes. Q. And Dincher threw the paper wad and the paper wad hit Balliet on the left cheek? A. That is right.” He was asked by plaintiff’s counsel: “Q. Let me ask a direct question, did you see Mr. Balliet throw a knife at Mr. Dincher? A. I wouldn’t say he throwed the knife, no, the knife might have slipped out of his hands as he was drawing from the barrel, he might have thrown the knife overhand, I wouldn’t say that. Q. You saw the whole affair? A. Yes, but you know a case like that happens pretty quick. Q. Was there an interval of time between the time the paper wad struck Mr. Balliet’s cheek and the throwing of the knife? A. Very little time. Q. There was a little time? A. There would have to be. Q. In order to get the fact a little straighter, will you please explain the position in which Mr. Balliet was at the time the paper wad hit him in the cheek, what was he doing, and what Avas his position with respect to you and Mr. Dincher? A. He was stooping over, cutting the burlap top out of a barrel, and as near as I can picture it right now, he was standing sort of sideAvays. Q. You mean sideways toward you and Mr. Dincher? A.

He was asked, “Q. And whether or not, during that period, anything of an unusual nature occurred. A. No, nothing out of the ordinary. Q. In your relations with Mr. Balliet? A. Yes. Q. At any time during 1939 when Mr. Balliet requested you, as store manager, for additional <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>help in his bookkeeping department? A. Yes, there was one week end, what month it was, I' couldn’t state at this time. Q. State what happened on this occasion? A. He wanted a little extra help that evening to take care of his extra work, he had, while he was doing something else, and I didn’t feel he should have any more than what he had, and I told him he had enough clerk hire to take care of what he had to do and that was all there was to it. Q. Where were you standing when this took place? A. I was up by the safe in the office and he was in the aisle of the store. Q. How far away? A. Maybe seventy feet. Q. What occurred when you refused to grant his request? A. He came up to me and demanded more help, and I said no, he had all the help he was going to have. Q. What was his attitude as he approached you ? A. He was a little put out because he couldn’t have extra help, and I tapped him on the shoulder and said, now, ‘Miles, you are not going to have it, that is all there is to it, you might as well calm yourself and go along, you have enough help to take care of what you are going to do’ and that is that.” Counsel for the plaintiff stated to the court that the witness had made a contradictory statement to plaintiff’s counsel’s “investigator, Harold A. Davis” and asked leave to cross-examine the witness. This cross-examination was allowed over defendant’s objection and exception. He was then asked whether he had told Davis that when he refused Balliet’s request, Balliet “flared up and came running toward you in a rage with a butcher knife in his hand?” Koch replied, “I didn’t say that, I said he came down to me, he may have had a knife in his hand, but I didn’t say a rage.” Asked whether Balliet “didn’t threaten you with the knife?” the witness replied “No.” “Q. And he didn’t brandish the knife at you? A. No.” He insisted that what he said to Davis was “I said he came down, he may have had a knife in his hand, but he didn’t brandish it at me.” Asked whether he reported the incident to his superiors, he said he did not because he did not “think it was important enough . . .”</p>

This testimony of Davis erroneously went to the jury in violation of the rule excluding hearsay, as affirmative evidence of Balliet’s conduct. The jury should have been instructed concerning the purpose for which this testimony was received and cautioned that it could not be considered as affirmative evidence of facts declared.

After the witness had completed his work and was leaving the <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>store, lie passed Balliet and “pinched” him and Balliet turned quickly and the knife with which he had been working passed out of his hand and over the witness’s head, fortunately doing no injury. The witness was asked “Q. Was it done in anger or not? A. I don’t think it was done in anger, I would say just horse-play. . . . Q. What was Balliet doing on the way back, when you started back? A. As I came by I had not paid any attention to what he was doing, but it turned out he was cutting a steak at the block. Q. And of course, had a steak knife in his hand? A. That is right. Q. Just what did you do to Balliet? A. I retaliated the same thing as he had done to me, I grabbed him in the leg. Q. Did Balliet have his back to you when you grabbed him? A. Yes.” Later he was asked, “Q. When you grabbed him you grabbed him in the same place, will you please show the jury where he grabbed you and you grabbed him? A. (Witness stands up and shows jury). He grabbed me high in between the legs where it is tender and pinched me and that is the same place I grabbed him.” The witness said he did not report the incident to defendant.

No knife was thrown or swung at Koch; Balliet did not threaten him; Balliet had a knife in his hand but he may have come from his cutting block to Koch innocently or carelessly carrying the knife from his work. According to Koch there ’was nothing menacing in Balliet’s conversation or attitude. According to Yocum, the “horseplay” in which he participated may have caused the knife with which Balliet was cutting a steak, to pass from Bal-Jiet’s hand in recovering himself from the stooping position he occupied when Yocum pinched him. The Koch and the Yocum incidents do not justify the quoted instruction because the instruction authorized the jury to find facts concerning which we must hold there is no competent evidence to support the findings. Those two incidents as described in the evidence offered on behalf of plaintiff, are not sufficient to charge defendant with knowledge that Balliet was an improper person to be retained in the position he held.
