Plaintiff asked that (a) defendant be restrained<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> from continuing the violation of the agreement, (b) for damages and (c) for an account. Defendant answered on the merits. After trial, the court, agreeing with plaintiff, held that defendant breached the contract by conducting competitive business at Trout Run Service Station (in Portage Township) but, agreeing with defendant, held that the business done at Beaverdale (in Summerhill Township) by Vindex Stores, Inc., was not in violation of the contract. Defendant appealed at No. 14 from the decree for the plaintiff, and plaintiff appealed at No. 55 from the refusal of its claim based on the business of Vindex Stores, Inc.</p>
    <p id="b585-5" data-blocks='[["BL_585.5",585,[201,1429,1150,700]],["BL_586.1",586,[225,273,1151,1467]]]'>No. 14. The decree is supported by the facts found below and approved by the court in banc. The court found that defendant by its Trout Run Service Station competed with plaintiff. There is evidence to support the finding. In accord with the contract, the Store company conducted a general department store and operated a filling station selling oil, gas and auto accessories. In February, 1939, “as per our conversation relative to the gasoline pump you wish to install at the mines,” the plaintiff wrote to the defendant, “we want to inform you that it will be all right for you to go ahead.” Instead of merely installing a gasoline pump for the sale of gasoline, the defendant constructed a general service <a id="p562" href="#p562" data-label="562" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*562</a>station<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> at which it sold gasoline, oil, grease, tires, tubes, batteries, auto radios, auto accessories of all kinds, safety shoes and boots, candy and ice cream, all of which were articles also sold by the Store company. The Coal company collected,, by deductions from wages, the amounts due by its employes for purchases at this station and did so prior to deducting amounts due by employes to the Store company. The court found that the Store company lost $370.04 by failure of the Coal company to collect the Store company’s accounts at this station to the exclusion of its own, and, in appellant’s brief, appellant states “no complaint is made on this appeal of the action of the court in awarding to plaintiff damages in the amount of $370.04 for failure of defendant to collect” these accounts. The evidence shows that the Coal company did a large business at this station, one of the findings being that the Coal company collected from semi-monthly pays of its employes from June, 1939, to June 15,1941, the sum of $35,621.62. The conduct of such a business was not within the permission to install a gasoline pump but, as the court concluded, was in violation of the contract of June 22, 1937. Such competition was in plain violation of the contract. The evidence supports the amount of the damages ordered to be paid. In its legal aspécts .the case is without difficulty. Defendant’s assignments of error must be overruled, subject to amendment of the decree.</p>
    <p id="b586-4" data-blocks='[["BL_586.4",586,[230,1748,1147,318]],["BL_587.1",587,[196,287,1158,1525]]]'>No. 55. In reviewing the record on plaintiff’s appeal, it is necessary to consider additional facts not involved in considering the effect of the business done by the defendant at Trout Run Service Station in Portage Township. In 1939, the Coal company acquired a mine at Beaverdale, about six miles from Portage, and began <a id="p563" href="#p563" data-label="563" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*563</a>producing coal there in July, 1940. Late in 1940 the Coal company established a store in Beaverdale under the name Vindex Stores, Inc., in competition with the Store company (in the words of plaintiff’s brief) “insofar as employees of the Beaverdale mine were concerned.” This competition affected plaintiff’s business adversely and the only question now is whether conducting the store at Beaverdale violated the contract of June 22,1937. When that contract was made the parties contemplated the circumstances then existing and provided for their future relations in those circumstances. Defendant’s mining operations were in Portage Township ; it had none at Beaverdale. In considering whether the agreement against competition, as expressed in the contract, was intended by the parties to deprive the defendant of the right to conduct a, general store at Beaverdale, the court applied the familiar rule requiring the contract to be construed in the light of the subject matter and conditions existing at the time of its execution : <em>Silverthorn v. Silverthorn, </em><a href="/pa/276/0579-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="276 Pa. 579" data-case-ids="1077527" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0579-01">276 Pa. 579</a>, 582, <a href="/citations/?q=120%20A.%20656" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="120 A. 656">120 A. 656</a>. That the parties had in mind the. Coal company’s mining plant in Portage Township is clear from the provision in their contract (quoted above) for the termination of the contract before the expiration of 5 years if “the Coal Company shall sell its mining plant.” They made no provision for plants subsequently acquired such as the one at Beaverdale; they had in mind the plant in Portage Township.</p>
