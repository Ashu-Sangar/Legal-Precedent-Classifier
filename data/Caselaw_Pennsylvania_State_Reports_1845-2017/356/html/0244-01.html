Weisbecker, and dismissing the bill. Appellant was the inventor of certain improvements on hosiery knitting machinery. In consideration of providing funds for the procurement of several patents upon his inventions and for developing, exploiting and marketing them, appellant <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>assigned a two-thirds interest in his inventions to David L. Subin and Benjamin Subin, party defendants. As a result of an oral agreement among the respective parties, a corporation was .organized under the laws of Pennsylvania on September 20, 1935, known as Hosiery Patents, Inc. and the patents in question were thereupon assigned to it. The corporation issued 30 shares of stock and distributed 10 shares to each of the defendants, David L. Subin and Benjamin Subin, and 10 shares to plaintiff. Subsequently, Benjamin Subin transferred nine shares to David L. Subin and one share to Emanuel A. Lerman, a co-defendant in the present proceedings. At a special meeting of the stockholders of Hosiery Patents, Inc., held on July 19, 1945, David L. Subin and Emanuel A. Lerman voted their stock in favor of a resolution adopted by the board of directors proposing the' dissolution of the corporation and the liquidation of its assets. Plaintiff voted his 10 shares against it. On July 20, 1945, the plaintiff filed a bill for a special injunction to enjoin the defendants, David L. Subin and Emanuel A. Lerman, from proceeding to dissolve the corporation and from selling its assets and obtained a restraining order prohibiting the sale of the corporation’s assets until the date set for hearing, July 26, 1945. Prior to the date of hearing, the plaintiff and defendants agreed, on July 25, that the patents be offered for public sale on August 17th or 24th and, as a result, the parties filed a stipulation of counsel vacating the restraining order issued. Plaintiff avers that he agreed to this stipulation because defendants’ counsel represented to him that the improvements covered by the patents could not be produced at a profit and that the defendants desired to have no further interest in the patents, from which plaintiff and his counsel were led to believe that neither the defendants nor their agents would bid for or purchase the same at their own sale.</p>

Bids reaching a maximum of $4,900 were entered by outside interests. Plaintiff bid $20,000 while defendant corporation, Flexy Carriers, Inc., a corporation controlled by David L. Subin, bid $20,100 and thereby secured the patents. Flexy Carriers, Inc., is a Pennsylvania corporation chartered August 24, 1945, in which defendant, David L. Subin, owns a majority of the stock. The machinery and equipment of Hosiery Patents, Inc. were sold at public auction on October 18 and November 15,1945 under conditions approved by the plaintiff.

Subin, and is operating and conducting the same business formerly conducted by Hosiery Patents, Inc., upon the same premises formerly used by Hosiery Patents, Inc., at Fifth and Maple Streets, Lansdale, Pa. The bill also states that the machinery and equipment of Hosiery Patents, Inc., as set forth in Exhibit C, were thereupon sold at public auction on October 18, 1945, and the defendants have refused to disclose to the plaintiff the amounts paid for the same and the names of the purchasers. Plaintiff “believes and avers that a substantial part of the machinery and equipment was sold to the defendants or their agents or nominees for a grossly inadequate price.” On November 15, 1945, other parts of machinery, as set forth in Exhibit D, were sold at public auction and the defendants refused to disclose to the plaintiff the amounts paid for them and the name of the purchasers. The plaintiff avers that a substantial part thereof was sold to the' defendants or to their agents or nominees at a grossly inadequate price, and that the acts of the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>defendants, David L. Subin, Benjamin Subin and Emanuel A. Herman, in selling the assets, including the patents, were a fraud upon the corporation, Hosiery Patents, Inc., and upon the plaintiff as a minority stockholder therein, and that the acts of the defendants, David L. Subin, Benjamin Subin and Emanuel A. Berman, were planned, devised and executed for the purpose of effecting a confiscation of all the corporation’s assets for the individual use, benefit and wrongful profit of the defendants, David B. Subin, Benjamin Subin and Emanuel A. Berman, who, as officers and directors of Hosiery Patents, Inc., stood in a fiduciary relationship thereto.</p>

    <p id="b273-3" data-blocks='[["BL_273.4",273,[236,794,1149,877]]]'>The court below in its opinion said, inter alia: “Under the Act of 1933, P. L. 364, section 1102, the corporation had the right to dissolve and the plaintiff does not question the legality , of the proceedings to dissolve except to allege generally that such action was a fraud upon the plaintiff and done with the intent to deprive him of his patents. However, the exercise by a corporation in a legal manner of rights given to it under a statute, cannot be said to be fraud.” This statement is an over-simplification of the question involved. Courts have often held that an act which by itself may be entirely legal yet, if it is part of a scheme whose object is the invasion of another’s right, it may be enjoined. Sometimes an act takes its character from its motive, for example, the act of an insolvent debtor in conveying away his property.</p>

They repudiate the suggestion of fraud, and plant themselves upon their right as a majority to control the corporate interests according to their discretion. They err if they suppose that a court of equity will tolerate a discretion which does not consult the interests of the minority. . ...

A motion to enjoin the sale was denied, after which the property was sold and bought by a representative of the majority stockholders and conveyed to a corporation formed in their interest. The plaintiff then filed a supplemental complaint, bringing in the purchasing corporation as a defendant. The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the lower court, and directed judgment not only setting aside the sale, but annulling the dissolution proceedings. In that case the <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>Supreme Court of Washington said: “The real question to be determined here is, whether or not the statute confers power upon a two-thirds majority of a prosperous corporation to disincorporate and dispossess minority stockholders of their stock by paying them the market price for the same. . . . Under the provisions of this statute, it is the contention of the respondents that an absolute right is given a two-thirds majority to dissolve the corporation whenever they see fit; and the broad ground is taken, that, inasmuch as the corporation is acting within its legal capacity, the court has no right to inquire into the motive which actuated the moving stockholders; that its only concern is to see that the formal legal requirements have been complied with; and such was evidently the theory adopted by the trial court. This, in a sense, is true, and Avould apply to this case if the actual attempt was to dissolve the corporation, within the meaning of the law. . . . But in this case, all of the elements of dissolution are wanting. The corporation, with a slightly different name, proceeded in the same town, Avith the same property, the same poAvers, and substantially the same OAvners. All the difference is about Avhat was testified by the president of the corporation — that, after the new company was formed, the minority stockholders’ interest would be represented by a deposit in the bank instead of stock in the corporation. It might with as much reason be concluded that a man could escape responsibilities by changing his name, and that, by such change, his moral or financial relations with those with whom he was engaged in business under the old name would be affected. It is not enough to say that appellant received all his stock was worth. He embarked in this business, and had a right to stay in the business during the expressed life of the corporation, or until it Avas dissolved by a fair compliance Avith the laAV.”</p>

This court in an opinion by Justice Mosch-J2ISKER, said: “An officer is but the agent of his corporation, and in all transactions in which its interests are involved he must act for it with unselfish singleness of purpose.
