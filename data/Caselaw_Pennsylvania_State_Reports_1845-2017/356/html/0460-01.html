Defendants denied fraud, stated the employment relationship of the parties and pleaded that, in any event, plaintiff’s claim was barred by laches. From the evidence, the learned chancellor, President Judge Care, found the facts against the plaintiff and in accord with the contentions of defendants. The court in banc dismissed the bill after hearing plaintiff’s exceptions to the adjudication. The plaintiff has appealed. We must affirm the decree.</p>

From July, 1921, to February, 1923, her employment, as well as that of other employes, was subject to a collective employment agreement by the company and the Brotherhood which was then cancelled by mutual agreement.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> That contract had provided for seniority rights.

    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[240,1094,1150,755]]]'>In 1942, more than eleven years after plaintiff had been laid off and her job abolished,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> she applied for a position as “typist-clerk”; she was appointed and on the roster was given seniority rating as of April 27, 1942, the date on which she began working. The learned court found as a fact that she applied for the position “as a new employee.” She contends that seniority rights should have been granted to her as if she had been in continuous employment from September, 1917, and as if the collective employment agreement of July 1, 1921 (amended February 1, 1922) had remained in effect. “On the seniority rosters prepared and posted by the Company since that date she has been listed as entitled to seniority rating only as of April 27, 1942.”</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.5",486,[238,1858,1148,154]],["BL_487.1",487,[206,278,1152,1688]]]'>In the brief filed on her behalf it is said, “In the memorandum (Defendant’s Exhibit 25)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> of the meeting of January 19, 1923, between the management and the <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>clerks it appears that the intention was to eliminate the bargaining agent by abrogating tlie agreement of February 1, 1922; but that there was no intention to surrender any individual benefits incident to employment which had accrued.” From our examination of the evidence we think the learned court was correct in that part of the 18th finding of fact (now challenged) which, briefly summarized, finds that the first contract was terminated February 1, 1923,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and thereafter no contract provided seniority rights until the contract of 1933 was made. Now, in 1933, plaintiff was not employed by defendant railway company and sustained no relation to it. In the brief filed on her behalf it is said that she was “furloughed” in 1931 and therefore never was out of defendant’s employ; in support of this suggestion counsel quotes a provision in the Railroad Retirement Act providing “An individual is in the employment relation to an employer if he is on furlough, subject to call for service within or outside the United States and ready and willing to serve.” U. S. C. A. Title 45, section 228a (d). For several reasons the suggestion must be rejected. The learned chancellor found as a fact to which no exception was taken that .her employment ceased when “the position she had held [was] abolished” in August, 1931. The word “furloughed” probably got into the record because in 1943 defendant’s superintendent in writing to her said she had been furloughed in 1931. If he was then thinking of the word as defined above, he misapplied it in referring to her status in 1931, the statute first containing the definition was approved in 1935, <a href="/citations/?q=49%20Stat.%20967" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="49 Stat. 967">49 Stat. 967</a>, 45 U.

    <p id="b488-4" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[243,383,1148,972]]]'>With respect to laches we must also agree with the learned court below. Three findings of fact may be quoted: “22. During the latter part of 1934, the plaintiff called at the office of the Company looking for work, at which time she was fully informed by the chief clerk to the superintendent of the collective bargaining contract then existing between the Company and the Brotherhood, of the seniority roster that had been prepared and made effective pursuant to that contract, and she was then and there advised by him that because she had not been in the active service of the Company on January 1, 1933, and her name was not included in the seniority roster, consideration could not be given to reemploying her so long as persons whose names appeared on the roster could qualify and might apply for the same work. She also received information and advice to the same effect from the same source in 1936.” Plaintiff did not except to that finding.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.5",488,[241,1366,1148,425]]]'>“23. None of the defendants had, previous to July 12,1943, any notice or knowledge of any claim of seniority rights by the plaintiff, and since the latter part of 1934, when she received the information and advice set forth in our twenty-second finding, the position of the Company has materially changed in that it has employed and paid others to fill positions and do work for which she might have qualified.</p>
    <p id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.6",488,[240,1801,1147,264]]]'>“24. The plaintiff first joined the local lodge in July, 1942.

As seniority rights arise only out of contract, it is appropriate that the statute of limitations should be applied by way of analogy to actions at law: Dalzell v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/252/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="252 Pa. 283" data-case-ids="1021617" data-case-paths="/pa/252/0283-01">252 Pa. 283</a>; <a id="p465" href="#p465" data-label="465" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*465</a>Bailey v.

If the plaintiff’s seniority rights now in question were acquired under the terms of the contract of December 16, 1933, her cause of action arose when the seniority roster was finally agreed to and posted on April 11,1934. If, on the other hand, she was entitled to seniority rights on and after February 1, 1923, then her cause of action undoubtedly arose much earlier than April 11, 1934. Yet her action was not brought until May 16, 1944.</p>

She knew or had reason to know when she was laid off on August 1, 1931, that clerks junior to her were retained in the service of the Company. In 1934 her name had been dropped from the seniority roster, and in that year and again in 1936 she was refused re-employment for that reason, which was clearly stated to her. Since then the Company has employed and paid many others to fill positions to which seniority might have entitled her, and for the court to reinstate her now as a senior employee would result in great pecuniary loss and damage to the Company that would have been avoided had she prosecuted her claim with diligence.”</p>
