    <p id="b79-3" data-blocks='[["BL_79.4",79,[184,748,1149,910]]]'>The minor, sixteen years old, was illegally employed by defendant in its bakery. On or about April 28, 1944, while feeding dough into a pretzel machine, his left hand became caught in the mechanism, causing the loss of his left index finger. On November 23, 1944, the minor and his employer, the defendant, entered into a written compensation agreement (later amended), approved by the minor’s parents and their counsel and by the Workmen’s Compensation Board. All payments have been made as provided for by the agreements. On March 28, 1945, the present action in trespass was instituted by the guardian of the minor, and the parents, to recover damages for the same injuries for which the minor has already received compensation. Judgment was entered for the defendant upon an affidavit of defense raising question of law, from which this appeal was taken.</p>

L. 520$ 77 PS 672, <em>provided for compensation to </em>minors, <em>both legally and illegally employed. </em>As the minor had the same power as an adult to contract for and receive compensation, the single question remains: may the parents of the minor thereafter maintain an action for trespass against the employer for the same injury to the minor? This question must be answered in the negative. The Workmen’s Compensation Act, supra, provided a dif<a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>ferent remedy from that offered by common law.
