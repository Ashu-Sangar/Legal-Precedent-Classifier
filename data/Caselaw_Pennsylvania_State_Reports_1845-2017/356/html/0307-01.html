Defendant’s counsel states the controlling question to be “whether defendant had reasonable and probable cause for believing that which it published concerning the plaintiff.” That was one of the questions; in addition, it was necessary for the jury to consider whether the publication was inspired by a proper motive and was made in a proper manner. There is evidence to support the verdict on all three grounds.</p>

The learned trial judge instructed the jury that the following paragraph in the editorial was libelous per se: “John O’Donnell is a Naziphile. He makes no secret of it. On numerous occasions, to all friends and bar-flies within hearing, he has broadcast his sympathy with most of Hitler’s aims — such as destruction of the British Empire, suppression of labor unions and liquidation of Jews.” Those lines were printed in heavy type.</p>

The first two complain that the court held the defamatory paragraph quoted above libelous per se. It requires no argument to show that the learned judge’s conclusion was correct. The reason sufficiently appears in his instruction to the jury: “Now, as a mere abstract statement of a belief based upon an unworthy prejudice, there is nothing particularly libelous about that, but at that time there was sufficient common knowledge of what was being done by Hitler and the Nazis in Germany with respect to the Jews and others holding particular political or religious beliefs that the word liquidation’ meant the wanton extermination or cruel oppression, in one form or another of a people because they happened to be of a particular race or held a particular religious or political belief. Now, to the free Americans among whom this paper was published, that is an atrocious charge, especially if false and unjustified. To say that a man believes in exterminating fellow human beings because of their race natur<a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>ally and inevitably holds him up to the hatred, ridicule and contempt of decent people, and unless such a charge is true or is made upon reasonable, probable cause, it is libelous in itself, and the law presumes that it inflicts injury upon the person against whom it is made.” The subject was considered again in the opinion written on behalf of the court in banc and reported in 56 D. &amp; C. 328.</p>
    <p id="b337-3" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[238,696,1152,1628]],["BL_338.1",338,[226,256,1151,1955]]]'>The third assignment is to the refusal of a point for charge which, so far as we can understand it, had no relevance to the issue for trial; the point was therefore properly refused. The fourth and the sixth assignments are to the refusal of binding instructions and the refusal of the motion for judgment n. o. v.; as it was necessary to find facts from the oral evidence, the court could not take the case from the jury. On this subject, Judge Gordon said, . . the defendant called a number of witnesses, all conceded by the plaintiff to be reputable and well known Washington correspondents, to show that at various times, they had heard (and reported to J. David Stern, publisher of the defendant paper and one of the authors of the article in question) the plaintiff express opinions and sentiments respecting the treatment of Jews by Hitler and Nazi Germany, which, if communicated to the defendant, the trial judge told the jury furnished ample justification for the charge made in the editorial. Whether these witnesses did in fact so report to Mr. Stern, as testified by him and by them, rested entirely upon his and their oral testimony, and it was upon this question that the liability of the defendant ultimately turned. It was impossible, .therefore, to give binding instructions for the defendant, or to sustain its motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, in view of the well settled rule that, where the proof of a fact rests entirely upon oral testimony, the credibility of the witnesses thereto is solely a question for determination by the jury trying the case.” The fifth assignment is to the refusal of defendant’s motion <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>for a new trial and raises tlie' question whether there was abuse of discretion in dismissing the motion. No abuse of discretion has been shown. In dealing with this point, Judge Gordon said: “Had this been the only trial of the case, we would have acted well within our discretion in directing its submission to another jury, as was done after the first trial. We prefer, however, to accede to the judgment of two juries upon the fundamental question of liability, and to confine the exercise of our discretionary powers to keeping the amount of the verdict within reasonable bounds, in the light of all the evidence. The discretion of a court to grant as many new trials as may be necessary to bring about a verdict acceptable to it is not an absolute discretion, resting upon the personal judgment of the individual judge. It is a judicial discretion, which is limited by a proper recognition of the jury’s function to determine factual matters; and when two juries have spoken so decisively upon the question, their judgment is not to be lightly ignored.” The seventh and last assignment states that the entry of judgment on the verdict violated defendant’s rights “under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by depriving it of property without due process of law in that it abridged its right of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.” Defendant’s brief contains nothing which, so far as we can understand it, supports the assignment. The case is very simple in its legal aspects. Did the defendant have reasonable and probable cause? Was defendant’s motive proper? Was the manner reasonable? Was the asserted privilege abused? The jury on proper instructions took plaintiff’s vieAv of the evidence and rejected defendant’s. We need not refer to what is said in- appellant’s brief about burden of proof because we deal with the record as presented; the evidence was sufficient to go to the jury.</p>

By “up there” he meant the “Press Club bar”. He said: “I told Colonel Allen, John O’Donnell had stated [a feAV hours before] that in his opinion Hitler was right in his treatment of the Jews in order to build up Germany.

When they build a road, for example, they build the road straight through, regardless of anything that got in its Avay.

He had known John O’Donnell since 1933. He talked to John O’Donnell in the barroom of the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, Philadelphia, on June 24, 1940, at the time of the Republican National Convention in that city. O’Donnell expressed his opinion to the witness that “the British had started the war by giving the Poles hopes of support which he said the British had no intention of fulfilling”. Colonel Allen said to O’Donnell, “You talk like a Nazi. That is the kind of stuff that Goebbels is putting out.” O’Donnell replied, “Well, the Nazi have done a lot of good things in Germany. They cleaned up Germany, wiped out unemployment and they have restored the honor and standing of Germany as a nation in the world.” Colonel Allen then asked O’Donnell: “What about freedom of religion and the clergy who had been killed and jailed for no other reason than they had refused to preach the gospel as the Nazi ordered them to do?” O’Donnell replied: “religion had riot been suppressed in Germany”. Allen said: “Then what do you call the atrocities that they perpetrated on the Jews, thousands of old people, women and children who have beeri killed for no other reason than they were born Jews? The conversation then got around to Communists and Communism, arid we had some exchange of views on that, on which I pointed out that at the time the Russian Communists and the German Nazis were bedfellows; that they had signed a military pact to divide <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>up Poland.” Colonel Allen then asked O’Donnell: “What do you call the atrocities that the Germans perpetrated against the Jews?” Allen said O’Donnell’s answer was that “certain excesses- — my recollection is that there had been some excesses. There probably had been some excesses, but that certain elements needed cleaning up in Germany, and it was from there, sir, that we led into the discussion — the discussion turned on Communists and Communism in Germany.” He stated the conversation at that point was broken up by mutual friends coming in and we just split up.

The witness said, “Crawford expressed very great feeling about this attitude on the part of O’Donnell. It shocked him profoundly.” Crawford had stated to Allen: “I am horrified and shocked and profoundly disturbed.” The witness added that “The times were tense and critical times and these sentiments were not taken lightly.” The witness further stated that Mr. Crawford, in the witness’ presence, had talked to J.

O’Donnell had defended the Nazi theories and practices regarding the Jews and minorities, other minority elements, and had defended them on the ground that the Nazis had been obliged to remove the Jews because many of them had become dominant in German affairs, government, business, and the professions, and that in order to enforce and put into practice the Nazi policies both at home and abroad, it had become necessary for the Nazis to eliminate the Jews and to get rid of them.” The witness added that “John’s attitude in this question of the Nazi treatment of Jews, his failure to speak out against it, and his condoning of it — it was just a general topic”.</p>

He had heard O’Donnell say “that the Nazis had to get rid of the Jews in order to build up Germany”. Colonel Allen told J.

Jackson stated that they discussed O’Donnell’s attitude toward the Nazi System and O’Donnell spoke approvingly of it. Jackson testified that he said to O’Donnell: “I thought the treatment of the Jews in Germany was of itself so great a black mark on the establishment of the system that I could not possibly see how anybody could sympathize with a system which had risen to power on that kind of a procedure and platform against the Jews.” O’Donnell remarked: “That the place of the Jews in Germany had become — so many of them had become dominant in the professions and in finance in Germany that the Nazis had no other recourse than to remove them from those positions. And I said that I could not understand why it was necessary to distinguish between Jews in prominent positions, in the professions or in finance, and <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>non-Jews; that I couldn’t, for the life of me, find no distinction between them.” “Q.

Allen his conversations with O’Donnell within a month afterwards. The witness said: “This conversation with Mr. O’Donnell, with John, about which I am testifying, impressed itself on my mind and disturbed me.

He said there was no ill-will between him and Thomas McNamara, who was also looked upon as a reliable reporter, as far as he knew. He admitted that he had a lengthy conversation with Gardner Jackson that lasted about three or four hours, and that they discussed Hitler and the Nazi practices. He was asked the following question: “In connection with the Nazi practices, the treatment of the Jews was mentioned in that connection, wasn’t it?” He answered “Yes”. He was asked: “Did you take the position, when that was mentioned, either justifying it or condemning it?” He answered: “We were neither trying to justify or condemn. We were trying to explain it.” He was asked: “One question in the former trial was: ‘Q. You did discuss the Jewish question, didn’t you, during that discussion?’ ” The record shows that his reply was: “That was mentioned only very briefly. I think it was mentioned.” At the second trial the witness admitted that such was his answer at the first trial. The witness was then asked: “Speaking of Nazis, did you say they had found it necessary to liquidate the Jews to carry out their announced program? If the program were to be carried out, the Jews along with the other minorities, they would have to be swept aside, and that it had already been announced by the Nazis?” He answered: “That is a fact. That is true.” “Q. You said that?” “A. Yes.” He was asked: “Did you say to Mr. Jackson that you thought the Germans had done an effective and thorough job at reorganizing the country?” He replied: “They certainly had, and we both agreed on that.” “Q.

Yes, he is correct.” He was asked: “You agree, do you not, that Allen did say to you during that conversation [at' the Bellevue-Stratford], ‘John, you talk like a Nazi’?” “A. I think he did. I am quite certain he did. We were discussing the German army at that time.” He was asked: “After Allen had vehemently condemned the Nazis for their treatment of the Jews, did you say, ‘Well, the Nazis have done a lot of good things in Germany. They have cleaned Germany up and put her back on her feet. They have wiped out unemployment.’?” He answered: “I recall saying that they had wiped out unemployment and put Germany back on its feet.” He was asked: “Did Allen say to you, as he testified here, that in Germany atrocities had been perpetrated upon Jews, old people, men and women who had been robbed and killed for no other reason than they had been born Jews?” In reply he said: “He did say that, yes.” “Q. Did you reply by saying: ‘There probably have been some excesses, but certain elements needed cleaning up in Germany?’ ” “A. I said: ‘There certainly have been excesses there.’ Then there was a break in the conversation. Somebody came in. We were eating and hurrying away to write our stories and it turned to Communism.” “Q. Turning at page 1400, here is a question that was asked the last time you testified. Just follow it carefully. ‘Q. You understand me, don’t you, Mr. O’Donnell? When you said that certain elements needed cleaning up in Germany, Allen said that was in reply to his confronting you with the proposition that there had been atrocities perpetrated upon Jews, old people, men and women who had been robbed and killed for no other reason than they had been born Jews.

Was Allen right about that?’ ‘A. Yes.’ Did you so testify when, as you said, your memory was better than it is now?” “A. Oh, yes, I would say yes.” The trial judge then asked these two questions and received these two answers. “Q. Now do you say that that is what the conversation was?” “A. Yes, except my recollection is there was a break.” “Q. No, before you said that was in reply to your particular observation about the Jews. Now you say it was or wasn’t?” “A. I will say it was.

In that case the defendant, as we said, “came forward with evidence of a most persuasive character to explain the cause of the derailment as being one for which it was not responsible”, and the credibility of the evidence was submitted to the jury <em>but when the jury disregarded the evidence and found for the plaintiff this court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial. </em>The case now before us is far stronger against the plaintiff than was the <em>MacDonald </em>case, for O’Donnell’s own testimony so conclusively convicted him of being a pro-Nazi in complete accord with the Nazi practices of robbing and hilling (i. e. “liquidating”) Jews that no jury had the right to ignore his testimony and proclaim by its verdict that the charge made in the editorial was <em>not </em>based on reasonable and probable cause for a belief in the truth of what the editorial stated. When O’Donnell was on the witness stand, he said “Yes” to this question: “Was Allen right about that?” The “that” which Allen was “right about” was Allen’s testimony as to (1) his statement to O’Donnell on June 24, 1940, that “there had been atrocities perpetrated upon Jews, old people, men and women, who had been robbed and killed for no other reason then that they had been born Jews” and (2) O’Donnell’s reply as follows : “Well, there probably have been some excesses but some elements needed cleaning up in Germany”. When an individual refers to' wholesale murders, in a sarcastic euphemism as “some excesses”, there is no room for doubt that he is condoning the murders which constituted those “excesses”. When O’Donnell stated that “certain elements needed cleaning up in Germany” he obviously meant Jews, for it was only Jews who were being “cleaned up” by Hitler on a wholesale scale. To <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>“clean up” means, as O’Donnell used the phrase, to “liquidate”, that is, to “kill”. When in war a detail of soldiers receives an order to “clean up” a machine gun nest, no one has any doubt that the order means to destroy that nest. If, after the assassination of Abra1 ham Lincoln and the murderous assault on Secretary of State Seward, and the planned assassination of Vice-President Johnson, an individual who had been accused of expressing approval of these atrocities had, when later confronted with the expressions he had used, endeavored to “soften” them by referring to the conspirators’ crimes merely as “some excesses”, and had added that “certain elements in the Lincoln administration needed cleaning up”, no one possessed of normal mental processes would have any doubt that the individual so accused had been in favor of the assassination program which he had referred to in toned down but sinister terms. Wigmore on Evidence, Second edition, Vol. 1, section 27, p. 232, says: “The conclusions and tests of everyday experience must constantly control the standard of legal logic.” As Chief Justice Gibson said in <em>Com. v.

This testimony was not contradicted. Plaintiff himself testified to the good repute for reliability of defendant’s witnesses.

It was the duty of the jury to find what the witnesses said and what they meant and whether the defense of privilege was made out.” I ask under what theory of administering justice a jury can be permitted to make a finding of fact in favor of a plaintiff <em>which 'finding is contrary to what the plaintiff himself testified under oath? </em>O’Donnell, as we have pointed out, <em>admitted </em>that “Colonel Allen was right” when he testified that after Colonel Allen said to him, that he (O’Donnell) “talked like a Nazi” and asked O’Donnell, “What do you call the atrocities that the Germans perpetrated against the Jews”, he (O’Donnell) replied by characterizing these atrocities (murders) merely as “some excesses” and added: “Certain elements [obviously meaning Jews] needed cleaning up in Germany.” When a jury, by its verdict finds that there was no reasonable and probable cause for characterizing such a pro-Nazi as O’Donnell by his testimony <em>admitted himself to he, </em>as “being in sympathy with Hitler’s liquidation of Jews”, <em>the contradiction </em>between the <em>verdict in favor of the plaintiff </em>and the <em>plaintiff’s own testimony </em>is so <em>unmistalcahle </em>that no court can, in <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>justice, permit it to stand, and the judgment based upon it should be set aside.</p>

It is the only bulwark vouchsafed to us today against lawless power which in all ages has sacrificed to its wild lust and boundless ambition the blood of the best men that ever lived.” At the banquet which the people of New York Oity tendered Attorney Hamilton immediately after the acquittal of his client, Hamilton said in his address: “The right of the people to worship according to their consciences cannot endure unless there is a free press to defend that freedom. The right of the people to speak freely cannot endure less there is a free press to defend that freedom. The right of the people to meet publicly and talk over their troubles with their ruler cannot endure unless there is a free press to defend that freedom.”</p>

The jury was not even warned to disregard it. When J. David Stern, the chief executive of the defendant company, was on the witness stand, the plaintiff’s counsel asked him: “You knew, didn’t you, at that time that the Nazi persecution of minorities included other than Jews, didn’t you? Mr. Stern answered: “Yes”. Plaintiff’s counsel then <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>asked: “You knew O’Donnell was a Catholic, didn’t you?” This is the first time the writer ever heard of any attorney injecting into a case the religious affiliations of either a litigant or a witness. No more grossly improper question than the question thus asked J. David Stern can be imagined. So careful is our law to keep religion out of the trial of a ease that the Act of April 23, 1909, P. L. 140, <em>forMds </em>the questioning of any witness in any judicial proceeding “concerning his religious belief”. If a <em>witness’ </em>religious belief cannot properly be injected into a judicial proceeding, a <em>litigant’s </em>religious belief certainly cannot be. To inject a litigant’s religion into a judicial proceeding is more offensive to propriety and to due process of law than is the injection of the fact that a defendant in a negligence case carries liability insurance. The appellate courts have frequently declared that for plaintiff’s counsel to bring out in any way the fact in the trial of a negligence case that the defendant is insured against liability is such a gross impropriety as to require the trial judge to immediately declare a mistrial.

When plaintiff’s counsel asked J. Dávid Stern as to his knowledge of O’Donnell’s religious affiliation and stated that affiliation, the trial judge should have immediately declared a mistrial.

Jeremiah S. Black, who was at one time Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and later was Attorney General of the United States and Secretary of State of the United States, aptly said: “The manifest object of the men who framed the institutions of this country, was to have a State without religion, and a Church wihout politics — that is to say, they meant that one should never be used as an engine for any purpose of the other, and that no man’s rights in one should be tested by his opinions about the other . . .

They gave to bigotry no possible chance for thrusting herself into civil affairs without doing so in flat rebellion to the Constitution.”</p>
