L. 361, Article V, section 511, as amended, 15 PS 2852-511.</p>
    <p id="b323-11" data-blocks='[["BL_323.21",323,[198,1590,1150,587]]]'>Rose Bush, assignee of numerous wage claims aggregating over |12,000, instituted an action in assumpsit against the corporation employer and its three shareholders, seeking to recover the amount of such wages. Judgment for want of an affidavit of defense was taken against the corporation and Alexander, one of the shareholders. The other two shareholders filed an affidavit of defense denying liability. The case came on for trial before a jury. The trial judge entered a nonsuit, which the court in banc refused to take off. This appeal followed.</p>

It was conceded that the sole purpose for the assignment was the collection of the wage claims.
