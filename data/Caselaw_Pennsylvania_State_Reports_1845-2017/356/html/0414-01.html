    <p id="b439-7" data-blocks='[["BL_439.10",439,[227,845,1149,484]]]'>Defendant appeals from judgment on a verdict for plaintiff in his suit to recover for personal injury. The verdict establishes that the injury resulted from defendant’s negligence. The defendant contends that the learned court erred in not instructing the jury to find for the defendant and that this court should now reverse and enter judgment in defendant’s favor. As the suffificiency of the evidence to support the verdict is not challenged, we come at once to the legal contention.</p>
    <p id="b439-8" data-blocks='[["BL_439.11",439,[228,1341,1148,863]]]'>Defendant is engaged in manufacturing steel and steel products. John H. Brooks and Sons, a partnership, is engaged, inter alia, in the excavation of land. Defendant awarded to Brooks a contract “to furnish all necessary labor, material and equipment required to excavate for cooling pits at our Steel Mill, all in accordance with verbal instructions given you by our representative.” The dimensions of the pit were: depth 7 feet, width 10 feet and length 100 feet. In excavating, Brooks used a truck crane with a boom; the site of the pit Avas in an area over part of which defendant worked a traveling crane. After the excavation had been in process about half a day, defendant’s OArerhead crane negligently came in contact with the boom operated by Brooks, the contractor, and seriously injured plaintiff, who Avas employed by Brooks in the excavation.</p>

L. 736, as amended.</p>
