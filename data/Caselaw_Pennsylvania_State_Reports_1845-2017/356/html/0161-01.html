He left surviving as his only heirs six children and ten grandchildren (children of deceased children). His will, dated November 30, 1942, signed by his mark, was probated and letters testamentary granted to the executors therein named. By its provisions $500 was bequeathed to each of his six living children and $100 to each of five grandchildren, children of a predeceased daughter, and $100 each to five grandchildren, children of another predeceased daughter. The residue of the estate was bequeathed to three of the six living children: Gissa, Wolf and Louis. His sons Wolf and Louis were named as executors.</p>

On May 15, 1944, pursuant to a petition of the above named three children, a citation was awarded directed to Wolf and Louis (two of the beneficiaries under the will) to show cause why the appeal from the register should not be sustained and for an issue d.v.n. to the court of common <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>pleas to try by jury four questions of fact: (1) testamentary capacity, (2) undue influence, (3) whether or not the said writing is the last will and testament of decedent, and (4) “whether or not [decedent] acknowledged the alleged will to be his will in the presence of two witnesses.” An answer was filed by the respondents and hearing had before the two judges of the court below. At the hearing contestants abandoned their contentions concerning testamentary capacity and undue influence, leaving for judicial determination the sole question whether the will had been executed by decedent, with his mark, and proved as required by the provisions of the Wills Act of 1917, supra. President Judge Hiram H. Keller, in an opinion, dismissed the appeal from the probate and refused an issue <em>devisavit vel non. </em>The appeal followed.</p>

It will be observed that this section provides for the situation when the testator has no part in the mechanical signature, but requests another to sign his name for him. In such a case such a person can only act <em>“by his express direction” </em>and this must be proved by two or more competent witnesses.</p>

Under the 1938 will testator gave $500 each to his seven named children and $100 each to the five children of his deceased daughter Rose. He also gave $300 to his daughter Minnie “for her loving care. . . .” On November 30, 1942, Wolf Cohen, son of decedent, called Irvin L. Mac-Nair, a justice of the peace, on the telephone, and requested and secured an appointment for his father, the decedent. On that day between 9 and 10 a. m. the decedent and the son called upon Mr. MacNair. The justice of the peace had known the decedent and his son for 35 or 40 years. Decedent was over 80 years old; he could not carry on a conversation in English; could speak Yiddish, but could neither read nor write, not even his name; the son Wolf acted as interpreter; decedent took the 1938 will out of his pocket and endeavored to explain to MacNair that he wanted to change his will; the son, interpreting the Yiddish of the father, <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>explained in English, what decedent desired to accomplish. The daughter Sarah had since died; she had been bequeathed $500 and decedent desired to substitute a bequest of $100 to each of her five children; also he had paid his daughter Minnie $300 for his care and therefore desired this bequest to be eliminated; otherwise the will was to be as originally executed; Mr. MacNair, in his kitchen, in the presence of Mrs. MacNair, the decedent and the son Wolf, and with the will of 1938 before him, rewrote the present will on his typewriter. It was testified that with the aid of the interpretation of the son Wolf, the will was read and fully explained to decedent and decedent signified his approval thereof. In the presence of all of the four persons, Mr. MacNair wrote the name of Harry Cohen, the decedent; the decedent, without aid, affixed his mark or cross to the will. Mr. and Mrs. MacNair then signed their names as subscribing witnesses and certified, in the attestation clause of the will, that they had “subscribed our names at [testator’s] request as witnesses thereto, in the presence of the said testator, and the presence of each other.” Following the death of deceased, upon the probate of the will, both <em>subscribing </em>witnesses affirmed that they were “present, saw and heard Harry Cohen, the testator, sign, seal, publish, pronounce and declare the foregoing instrument of writing as and for his Last Will and Testament <em>by his marie . . </em>.” (emphasis supplied). Such proof, <em>standing alone, </em>Avould have been insufficient under section 3 of the Wills Act, supra, <em>because there was nothing in the register’s record to establish that decedent’s name had been written by his express or implied direction and authority. </em>HoAvever, this deficiency was supplied AArhen, at the hearing, on appeal, the surviving <em>subscribing witness, </em>Irvin L. MacNair, and an <em>attesting </em>witness, Wolf Cohen, testified as to this fact. It Avas proven that the name of Harry Cohen, the testator, Avas written in the will by Irvin L. MacNair, in decedent’s presence, at <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>3iis implied request, in the presence of two <em>subscribing </em>witnesses and of the <em>attesting </em>witness, and to which the testator affixed his mark or cross.
