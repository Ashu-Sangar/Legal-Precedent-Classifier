Defendants were the owners of 222 Black-man Street, in the City of Wilkes-Barre, acquired by purchase in 1931,- and which they occupied as their home. Plaintiff loaned defendants $4,300 at the time of purchase and took from defendants a first mortgage for that amount. On July 1, 1940, defendants, for an expressed consideration of $1, deeded the mortgaged premises to plaintiff. On the same day defendants executed and delivered to plaintiff a bond, designated as an agreement, in the sum of $4,300, reciting that plaintiff ivas about to re-deed the real estate to defendants and stipulated therein “. . . in part consideration therefor, the [defendants] have agreed to provide care, support, and maintenance, for and during the natural life of the said [plaintiff], in the manner he is accustomed to living, and to furnish him with medical care, attention and medicine during his illness.” On the same day plaintiff (without joinder of his wife) re-conveyed the premises to defendants. The consideration was declared to be $1. The deed included the following covenant: “ ‘And the said grantees for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, hereby covenant and agree with the said grantor, his heirs and assigns, that they the grantees will provide a home for, care for and maintain the said William A. Shook, grantor, in the manner as he is now accustomed to living, for and during the term of his natural life; and the grantees further covenant that at all times, during the life of the grantor, as the necessity arises that they will provide medical care, medicines and attention for the grantor.’ ” On July 19, 1940, plaintiff satisfied the mortgage.</p>

In April 1939 plaintiff returned to live with defendants under an oral agreement to apply the mortgage interest on his board and lodging at the rate of $30 per month. This arrangement continued until July 1, 1940, when the real estate transfer and agreement was concluded as above recited.

Such transactions are not fraudulent <em>per se </em>and are treated as transactions between other persons.

This Court reversed and held that the grantor retained an equitable title; that such a covenant was <em>an executory contract. </em>It was said, at p. 41: “It would be contrary to the original intentions of the parties as well as against good conscience to permit the vendee to recover the possession of land from his vendor, or one holding his title, without rendering or offering to render the equivalent contracted for.”</p>

Mr. Justice Jones said, p. 323: “As the court below correctly observed, the conclusion of law that the plaintiff was entitled to exclusive possession of the premises and a return of the deed for cancellation logically flowed from the established findings. The agreement itself expressly provided that ‘If, for any reason whatsoever the [Hafers] should be unable to carry out their part of the agreement, or should they be unwilling to continue to carry out the agreement, in either case [they] agree to re-convey the premises ... to [Mrs. Swartz], or her estate, if not living, and terminate the agreement.’ Even where no specific provision has been made for a reconveyance of a property conveyed under circumstances similar to the present, a failure of the grantees to perform the services for which they are obligated justifies an order requiring a reconveyance: see Borys v.
