The learned court below submitted the case to the jury on the issues whether the plaintiff and the defendant had orally agreed in respect of the lumber, as averred by the plaintiff, whether the defendant had failed to live up to the terms of the contract, as likewise averred, and what, if anything, was the extent of the damage which the plaintiff suffered from the defendant’s breach if that was found to have occurred.

The defendant (formerly American Supply &amp; Lumber Co.) con<a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>ducted a retail lumber business in Philadelphia where it had its office and place of business. For further relevant facts, we adopt the following from the succinct summarization made by the learned court below. “One, Waldo, contemplated the construction of 252 houses near Chester, Pennsylvania. He needed lumber, and went to Samuel Cohen, treasurer of defendant corporation, to procure it. Cohen got in touch with Benjamin Choate, Philadelphia sales representative for plaintiff. On July 18, 1941, Cohen, Choate and Waldo went to the offices of plaintiff in New York City, where Waldo’s requirements were laid before Miller Brister and Henry J. Koester, president and vice-president, respectively, of plaintiff corporation. Cohen and Koester left the group and went into a private office apart from the others, and after discussing the lumber needed and its cost, finally arrived at prices which would enable Cohen to handle the Waldo business. They rejoined the others and Cohen and Koester announced that the matter was ‘all set and that it was a deal’. An order was then made up by Koester on a printed order-book form used by plaintiff’s salesmen. This order slip set forth the types, quantities and prices of the lumber ordered. It was not signed by Cohen, but a yellow copy of it was given to him. It was orally agreed that deliveries were to begin about a week after August 1,1941. Then, with all the parties present, Brister called his firm’s buyer, Peterson, in Georgia, and instructed him to get in touch with the mills and place the orders to get the lumber shipped immediately. Cohen, Choate and Waldo then returned to Philadelphia. The same day, two copies of plaintiff’s usual eonfirmation-ofsale forms were mailed to defendant, with instructions to sign and return one. The copy was never returned.</p>

Ultimately, all the lumber which plaintiff attempted to deliver, 300,000 feet, was resold at a loss which plaintiff fixed at $4 per thousand feet. Plaintiff cancelled orders it had placed with various mills for the remainder of the lumber.</p>

The required memorandum for such purposes need not be a single writing, entire within itself; it may consist of several writings; and, if they bear connecting reference one to the other or have even an undisclosed but actual relation, which oral evidence may be used to show, they may be sufficient, when taken together, to supply the statute’s requirement for a writing: <em>Manufacturers Light &amp; Heat Co. v.

But, the interrelation of several documents, necessary to give them the effect of one, must be clearly indicated: <em>Lippincott v.

Superior Ct. 162</a>, 166. Accordingly, whether the memorandum relied upon is a single document or consists of several related or connected writings, the complete terms of a valid contract must be ascertainable therefrom with certainty and there must also be disclosed therein an intention on the part of the vendee to be bound by the asserted contract. See <em>Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. John, </em><a href="/pa/279/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="279 Pa. 104" data-case-ids="1083647" data-case-paths="/pa/279/0104-01">279 Pa. 104</a>, 109, <a href="/citations/?q=123%20A.%20685" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="123 A. 685">123 A. 685</a>. So that, while a letter acknowledging a contractual obligation may be sufficient, a mere indication of the existence <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>of an incomplete agreement is not sufficient: <em>Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. John, </em>supra, at p. 109. And, for a like reason, a memorandum which fails to specify the obligation and does no more than recognize that there is a contract does not satisfy the statute: <em>Stein v. Camden Fibre Mills, Inc., </em>supra, at p. 351; <em>Manufacturers Light &amp; Heat Co. v. Lamp, </em>supra, at pp. 520-521. To satisfy the requirements of the statute, the signed, written memorandum must either contain or, together with other writings adopted by reference, must disclose all of the essential elements of the alleged contract and, if any of such essentials is missing or incompletely stated, the memorandum is insufficient: <em>Stein v.

Manifestly, the defendant’s letter of August 29, 1941, of itself, does not state any quantity, price, time of shipment, place of delivery or terms of payment. And, while the letter incorporates, by reference, certain other writings, one of which is the unsigned order on a form of the plaintiff company, there is nothing in the additional writings with respect to the time of shipment or the place of delivery. In the indisputable circumstances, here present, both of those matters were of especial significance if the alleged contract was to be consummated. It clearly appears of record and is not controverted by the plaintiff that, at the time of the negotiations between the parties in July 1941 in the plaintiff’s New York office, when the parol understanding with respect to the lumber was arrived at, it was known to all present and by all fully recognized that the commencement of work on Waldo’s housing project de<a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>pended upon and necessarily awaited his receiving the requisite permits and priorities from the Federal Housing Administration as well as from other governmental agencies. In fact, the letter upon which the plaintiff so largely relies suggests the crucial interposition of the “F. H. A.” between the procurement of the lumber and Waldo’s possible need for it in his contemplated construction work. Nowhere, throughout the writings, is there a disclosure of an acknowledgment that the defendant intended to be bound for the purchase of the lumber under consideration. Nor do the words — “We asked you to cover” — in the letter of August 29th import any such intention. But, they do fully and appropriately comport .with the situation which the record conclusively discloses as above stated.</p>
    <p id="b65-4" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[160,1108,1154,1082]]]'>The appellant’s further contention is that there was part performance which took the parol contract out of the statute. As the statute itself provides, if “the buyer shall accept part of the goods ... so contracted to be sold . . . and actually receive the same, or give something ... in part payment”, the bar to a parol contract’s enforceability may be avoided. See <em>Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. Eiseman, </em><a href="/pa/290/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="290 Pa. 486" data-case-ids="1104419" data-case-paths="/pa/290/0486-01">290 Pa. 486</a>, 491, <a href="/citations/?q=139%20A.%20147" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="139 A. 147">139 A. 147</a>. But, delivery to and acceptance by the purchaser must be shown: <em>Vitro Manufacturing Co. v. Standard Chemical Co., </em>supra, at p. 97. And, the goods so accepted must be a part, and <em>only </em>a part, of those embraced by the parol contract: Williston, Sales, p. 159. Delivery must be made pursuant to the asserted contract and accepted as being such: <em>Franklin Sugar Refining Co. v. Eiseman, </em>supra, at pp. 492-493. A delivery and acceptance of goods under a separate contract, independent of an alleged parol agreement, is not such part performance as will take the latter out of the statute: <em>Scott v. Troop Water Heater Company, </em><a href="/pa/345/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="345 Pa. 368" data-case-ids="1213308" data-case-paths="/pa/345/0368-01">345 Pa. 368</a>, 372, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20A.2d%20922" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="28 A.2d 922">28 A. 2d 922</a>,</p>

Shortly thereafter, however, the plaintiff began tó sell to third parties sneh of the particular lumber on hand as it could. In the course of those sales, the defendant, through Cohen, purchased 8,175 feet of the lumber. The purchase was made because of the defendant’s ' general requirements and without regard to its undertaking with Waldo to whom none of the lumber was either sold or delivered. It is true that the price paid for the 8,175 feet of lumber, bought by the defendant under the circumstances above-stated, was the same as •the price shown on the original unsigned order for the plaintiff’s sale to the defendant and that the invoice number was one of those originally included in the unsigned order. Those facts were but coincidental. On the whole, the evidence was legally insufficient to support a jury’s finding that the 8,175 feet of lumber, so purchased by the defendant, was accepted as a part of the quantity called for by the original parol contract, and not otherwise. On the contrary, the delivery and acceptance of the 8,175 feet of lumber, as well as the. defendant’s payment for it, were part of a separate and independent sale and not in pursuance of the original parol agreement. The plaintiff’s conduct so confirms. Before the defendant’s purchase and acceptance of the 8,175 feet; the plaintiff had already sold to third persons a considerable portion of the lumber which it had formerly allocated to the parol contract. Incidentally, the particular entry made by the plaintiff on its books in connection with the defendant’s payment for the relatively small quantity of lumber so purchased and accepted by it and, likewise, the plaintiff’s use of one of the original invoice numbers for. the purpose of recording the sale were voluntary and self-serving. Such <em>ex parte </em>imputations are wholly without evidentiary value to a consideration of the rights and liabilities of the parties in respect of the parol contract averred by the plaintiff.</p>
