The action of the learned court below was so obviously correct as to render unnecessary any extended legal discussion on our part in further justification of the hearing court\u2019s action in such regard. The remaining questions raised by the appellant are equally without merit. The orders appealed from are accordingly affirmed on the opinion of Judge Thompson for the court below at the appellant\u2019s costs on each appeal.\nAffirmed.",
