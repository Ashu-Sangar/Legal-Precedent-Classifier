    <p class="summary" id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.5",536,[271,409,1164,1823]]]'>The Act of assembly of April 5, 1907, P. L. 59, commonly known as the two-cent fare law, was an attempt by the lawmaking power of the commonwealth to impose upon all the railroad corporations of the state, irrespective of the character or location of their roadbeds and of the expense of operation thereon, a flat rate of two cents per mile for the transportation of each passenger. With the question of the wisdom or unreasonableness of such a general and indiscriminate provision we are not concerned. It cannot now be regarded as a question open to debate whether it is within the power of the legislature to regulate the rates of fare or freight to be charged by railroad corporations by a general statute, leaving the question of the application of the statute to particular cases to be determined according to the particular circumstances of each. It would be easy to cite many cases which have arisen and been decided in different parts of the country wherein the rights of the states to enact such laws has been recognized and affirmed. We need not, however, go further than the decision of our own Supreme Court in the case of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company v. Philadelphia County, <a href="/pa/220/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="220 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1005934" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0100-01">220 Pa. 100</a>, to find an exposition of the doctrine. This case furnishes to us all the standards needed for the disposition of one of the main questions which have been raised in the present controversy. We must assume in the consideration of the matter in hand that the act of 1907 will apply to the plaintiff company and determine the rates of fare which can lawfully be imposed upon its passengers, unless some controlling reason can be found in constitutional rights which the company can assert and rely upon to exempt it from the statutory requirements. The burden of exhibiting and establishing the basis for such exemption undoubtedly rests upon the plaintiff.</p>

      <em>A. </em>After a careful study of the whole case as it has been presented to us, we have reached the conclusion that, to apply the principles settled by the Pennsylvania Railroad case to the present, it is not requisite to analyze the entire system of the plaintiffs railroad, and separate it into its original units for the purpose of ascertaining what rights the constituent companies possessed as to the fixing of rates of fare for passengers. In the case of one or two of these original corporations whose roadbeds are now parts of the entire system, the acts of incorporation limited the maximum charge for passengers to two cents per mile, but these instances were of roads of insignificant length, and not of sufficient relation to the whole system to make it worth while to give to them a separate consideration, or any determining weight in the case. As to these it may be conceded that the inhibition as to charges above two cents per mile is still in force, and yet the larger question as to what the plaintiff company may lawfully charge upon those lines generally will still be open.</p>

It is true that, in the twentieth section of the act, it was provided that the president and managers might from time to time “ordain and establish rules and regulations for the due ordering-of all traveling and transportation on the said road, and for its preservation, with power to alter, repeal, enlarge or amend the said rules and regulations as they may deem expedient. . . .

      <em>C. </em>By subsequent leases and mergers the Philadelphia <em>&amp; </em>Reading Railroad Company absorbed into its system a very large number of railroads, belonging to various companies which had been separately incorporated. Some of these railroads were extremely diminutive in length. All of these properties so acquired, together with the railroad of the main line as authorized by the act. of 1833, and together also with all franchises, etc., which the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company possessed were, in 1888, covered by a mortgage made and executed by that company to a trustee for the protection of bondholders. In the year 1896, under foreclosure proceedings all the property and rights covered by the mortgage was sold, and the plaintiff company was formed for .the purpose of taking, holding, using and operating all the properties and the rights that had been embraced in the said mortgage. All of said properties <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>and rights were conveyed or transferred to the plaintiff company. At the same time another corporation, called The Reading Company, was organized for the purpose of carrying out, in some of its details, the reorganization of the company. The capital of the plaintiff company was made for the purposes of the reorganization, $20,000,000, but this was merely nominal in character, and it was all issued to, and is still held by, the said Reading Company. But one certificate was issued for the entire amount of the capital stock. In the same year, namely, 1896, the plaintiff company, by resolution of its board of directors, accepted all the provisions of the present constitution of the state, and especially the provisions of art. XVI of the same.</p>

That the carriage of passengers by the plaintiff involves a net loss each year, whether the calculation of results is made by the revenue train mileage system, which is that primarily adopted by the plaintiff in the presentation of its case, or by any other standard that has been exhibited to us. It is true that if, as against the actual receipts from that class of business, only what may properly be called operating expenses are charged, there would appear to be a profit; but to arrive at a true <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>and just result, it is clearly necessary to include also other charges or deductions. As to these there is a mass of testimony and calculations, which we have carefully studied, but in our opinion it would be of no advantage to the ease to set them forth or to discuss them in detail. We agree with the plaintiff company that it is a proper method of reaching results — which in any possible way of attempting to reach them must necessarily be only approximate' — to set off against the total receipts not only the strictly operating expenses connected with passenger traffic, but also a certain proportion of common expenses, expenses common to passenger and freight business, and others which relate solely, or so nearly so as not to be divisible, to the passenger traffic.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b540-4" data-blocks='[["BL_540.5",540,[284,1127,1158,421]]]'>In our opinion, among such deductions not embraced in operating expenses there may and should properly be included fixed charges, interest on cost of passenger equipment, interest on the terminal bonds, and improvements; interest on the cost of shops at Reading, interest on ten per cent of the cost of the subway; interest on the improvements to and at Neshaminy Falls, and interest on cost of elevation of tracks on Ninth street in this city.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b540-5" data-blocks='[["BL_540.6",540,[281,1556,1159,688]]]'>Such deductions are made by the plaintiff in some instances by a division according to revenue train mileage, or by some other reasonable standard, and in others by a deduction of the total interest charges, as for example in the cases of the Neshaminy Falls improvement and the work on Ninth street. Whether the alleged resulting loss of over $3,000,000 thus arrived at by the plaintiff, or one much smaller, according to the contention of the defendant’s expert accountant, is correct, is not a matter of great moment.

The company clearly had the right, previous to the passage of the act of 1907, either under the provisions of its original charter of 1833 or under the general railroad act of 1849, to charge a rate of at least two and a half cents for each passenger per mile. This charge it did make on a large portion of its passenger traffic. It is true that, for the purpose of stimulating business and increasing results by a multiplication of passengers over short routes, adjacent to this city, it established commutation and other rates which were largely below the maximum rate just referred to. This course must be regarded as experimental and as intended to give information to the company in regard to the best manner of conducting its business and of imposing reasonable, profitable rates for passenger travel. It was not obliged to lower any of its rates below two and a half cents a mile, and it was at liberty at any time to impose the highest lawful rate upon its passengers on either the whole or any portion of its lines.</p>

In any event, it seems to be beyond question that the amount of loss has been and will be substantial, and, in the development and growth of the plaintiff’s business, it is reasonably certain that in the future the loss will be very great. We consider that the case is to be looked at, not merely with reference to present conditions or results, but with reference to the probabilities of the future and the actual rights of the company to derive a profit from the transaction of its business. It certainly cannot be successfully claimed, simple because by shifts and adjustments in a particular year the company may be able to avert any serious disaster or loss, that the company will not be able to make a reasonable and proper profit in other years, in case it was permitted to adopt and enforce rates above the maximum fixed by the act of 1907.

At the same time we agree with the view urged on the part of the plaintiff, viz.: that the inclusion of results of the interstate business, taking both receipts and expenses into consideration, can make no difference in the substantial condition of affairs, so far as those affairs are- involved in the present controversy.

    <p id="b545-6" data-blocks='[["BL_545.8",545,[126,892,1152,1281]]]'>All questions of law that were necessarily involved in the decision of this case in the common pleas were considered and settled in Penna. Railroad Co. v. Philadelphia County, <a href="/pa/220/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="220 Pa. 100" data-case-ids="1005934" data-case-paths="/pa/220/0100-01">220 Pa. 100</a>. The question of fact at the hearing, on which the case turned, was whether the enforcement of the Act of April 5, 1907, P. L. 59, against the plaintiff would do an injustice to its stockholders by depriving them of a just return upon their shares of stock. The learned judges who heard the case found after a most thorough investigation that the plaintiff’s passenger business yielded no net profit but resulted in a heavy loss each year. Their conclusion on the whole case is thus summarized in the opinion of the learned president judge of the court: “We, therefore, conclude, in view of the fact that the company is prosecuting its passenger traffic at a loss, and that it is within the power of the company to reduce this loss by charging rates to passengers in excess of the requirements of that statute, but within the limit which the law would otherwise permit, and that in this manner the company could more nearly approach a reasonable and proper return upon its capital, that it would work an injustice to the corporators of the plaintiff company if that company were required to obey the provisions of the act of 1907.</p>

Upon this ground alone we hold that the plaintiff is entitled to the decree and injunction prayed for.”</p>
    <p id="b546-4" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[309,568,1159,576]]]'>In the opinion of a majority of this court the finding of fact was fully warranted by the testimony, and the conclusion announced necessarily followed. The additional ground for relief set out in the amendment to the bill, that the penalties imposed by the act for any disregard of its provisions, are so out of proportion to the fault as to be evidence that they were not in good faith intended to secure observance of the law but to force acceptance of its terms by deterring a resort to the courts and that the act is therefore unconstitutional, need not now be considered.</p>
    <p id="b546-5" data-blocks='[["BL_546.6",546,[309,1161,1153,91]]]'>The decree enjoining the defendant is affirmed at its cost.</p>
