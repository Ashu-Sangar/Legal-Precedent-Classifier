It may be unfortunate that afterward some of these enterprises failed, but the evidence which the jury must consider is that which relates to the time when the sale was made. I find in this testimony no positive evidence in support of the various allegations made by the plaintiff, and I therefore direct you to find a verdict in favor of the defendant.</p>

    <p id="b110-9" data-blocks='[["BL_110.11",110,[287,1580,1159,580]]]'>This was an action to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by reason of false and fraudulent statements made by the defendant concerning the value of certain bonds and shares of stock which the plaintiff purchased on his recommendation. To establish her action it was essential that she should prove that the statements were untrue and that they were made in bad faith. The learned trial judge found that she did not prove either and directed a verdict for the defendant. We find no reason to doubt the correctness of his conclusion. The judgment is affirmed.</p>
