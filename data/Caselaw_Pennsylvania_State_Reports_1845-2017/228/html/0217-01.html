Trogler, who was not in possession of said tract, claimed an interest or title thereto, and praying for a rule upon the said respondent, William A. Trogler, to bring his action of ejectment within six months or show cause why the same cannot be so brought. To this rule defendant filed his answer September 17, 1906, setting up a complete and consecutive paper title from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania to himself for the land in controversy. Said answer alleged that the land claimed was uninclosed and unimproved woodland and that the plaintiffs did not have possession of the same, so as to bring themselves within the terms of the act of assembly under which the proceeding was commenced. Upon replication being filed both sides proceeded to take testimony. This testimony is very voluminous and much of it was perhaps not relevant to the particular controversy involved in this rule, for the reason that this is not a trial of an action of ejectment but simply a proceeding to determine whether or not the court has jurisdiction under the facts to compel the defendant to bring his action.</p>

Although open, uninclosed and unimproved, it was used by the said Fritzs for two or three generations for the general purposes of the farm, in making fences, shingles, timber and firewood. That Jacob Fritz, 2d, father of John Fritz, was a cooper by trade and cut over the whole tract of woodland now in dispute from time to time, for the purposes of his trade in securing stave timber.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b252-4" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[292,719,1154,366]]]'>7.

    <p class="summary" id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.6",252,[276,1094,1170,359]]]'>.offered in evidence what is claimed as a complete consecutive paper title to the whole of the Charlotte Carlile warrant.

    <p class="summary" id="b252-6" data-blocks='[["BL_252.7",252,[288,1470,1158,905]]]'>8. That in the lifetime of Jacob Fritz, 2d, some time during 1870 or 1871, George W. Wolf and other, the immediate predecessors in title of the respondent, William A. Trogler, cut certain timber on the land in dispute whereupon an action of trespass was brought against them by Jacob Fritz to No. 238, April Term, 1871. That Jacob Fritz died before the case came to trial and his heirs at law were substituted upon the record as plaintiffs, and that the record in said case shows that judgment was confessed by the defendants in favor of the plaintiffs September 14, 1875, for $350 and costs. It was also alleged in testimony, and not disputed, that this confession of judgment was the result of a settlement whereby the defendants not only agreed to pay the above sum but agreed to quitclaim to the heirs of Jacob Fritz the land in controversy, but no quitclaim deed or other conveyance is offered to show that said purpose was carried out.</p>

      <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>9. After said settlement and confession of judgment aforesaid, on September 17, 1875, a petition was presented in the orphans’ court of Franklin county for an inquisition on the real estate of Jacob Fritz, deceased, which inquisition was subsequently, on December 2, 1875, held on the land by the sheriff, and among the jurors summoned by the sheriff to appraise the land in dispute, inter alia, as the property of Jacob Fritz, was George W. Wolf, the immediate predecessor in title of the respondent, also Hiram Y. Reese, one of the predecessors in title of George W. Wolf to the land in dispute. It also appears in testimony, in the deed offered, that when Hiram Y. Reese conveyed the property now claimed by the respondent to Emmert and Nesbitt, predecessors in title to George W. Wolf, grantor stated that he did not warrant title to eighty-eight acres and seventy-nine perches and allowance lying east of Little Cove road, being the land now in dispute.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b253-5" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[121,1311,1151,574]]]'>10. It also appears from the testimony offered, that from the time the action of trespass was instituted against Wolf and others, in 1871, until the time of his death in 1896, the said Wolf exercised no acts of ownership over the timber land in controversy, and several witnesses were called on behalf of the petitioners to show that he told parties not to cut timber on said land as it was not his timber. After the death of George W. Wolf the land in dispute was included in the deed made by his executors to the respondent for a large portion of the Charlotte Carliie warrant.</p>

That the respondent, himself, is not shown by the testimony to have exercised any acts of ownership over the timber land in controversy for many years after his purchase and until after the purchase of the timber by the petitioners, Spangler and Faust, and after they had commenced cutting thereon. Respondent, William A. Trogler, then brought an action of ejectment to No. 23, February Term, 1905, and filed his declarations therein in which it is averred that the present petitioners are <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>now in actual possession of the premises now in dispute. This action of ejectment, after being put at issue, was discontinued by the plaintiff, and in the summer of 1906, respondent' purchased fencing wire and attempted to erect a fence between the cleared fields of the Long warrant belonging to the farm of John Fritz and the uninclosed woodland, which fence was at once destroyed by the petitioners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b254-4" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[299,776,1156,528]]]'>12. We find as a fact that the said D. W.

That the written agreement of May 14, 1904, entered into contemporaneously with the deed from John Fritz to the petitioners, does not defeat the right of possession vested in the petitioners by virtue of the deed of even date. Without construing it at length, its legal effect is, first, an agreement to reconvey the land to Fritz after the cutting and removal of the timber by the petitioners; second, to fix and make certain the terms of payment for the timber to be cut and removed; third, to cast upon John Fritz, the grantor in the deed given, the burden of defending his title, which burden by virtue of this agreement is probably no greater than that provided for by the warranty of his deed.</p>

The contemporaneous agreement, in its preamble, recites the purpose of the deed as being to enable Faust and Spangler “to exercise and enjoy the full and complete control and management of said tract of land so long as any timber remains thereon,” and this purpose involves an absolute right of possession. There is nothing in the further clauses of the agreement which can be construed to minimize, lessen or defeat this absolute right of possession vested in the petitioners for whatever of possession and control over the timber land had been previously enjoyed by John Fritz.</p>

The act is entitled, “An Act to settle title to real estate,” and in our judgment should receive a fair and liberal construction and not receive such a narrow construction as to defeat the purposes of <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>the act. There is, of course, a similar Act dated June 10, 1893, P. L. 415, which can be used where the title to property is. disputed and to compel settlement of titles. The two acts have a common purpose, viz., settlement of title to real estate, but the provisions of the acts show that they are intended to take effect under different circumstances.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b256-4" data-blocks='[["BL_256.5",256,[309,732,1163,1241]]]'>This proceeding being admittedly under the act of 1889, the question is, What are the jurisdictional facts necessary to put the case within the terms of that act? The language of the act is, “Whenever any person not being in possession thereof shall claim or have an apparent interest in or title to real estate, it shall be lawful for any person in possession thereof claiming title to the same to make application to the court,” etc. Two facts then must appear to give jurisdiction, first, possession by plaintiff or petitioner claiming title, that is, having color of title; and, second, a claim of title by the other party out of possession. In the petitioner or plaintiff there must be two things, possession and claim of title. As is said by Judge Lindsey, in Welsh’s Petition, 13 Pa. Dist. Rep. 498: “The possession of a mere intruder, or squatter, without color of title or claim thereto, would probably not be entitled to the benefit of the act.” It is not, however, necessary to decide that the plaintiff’s title is a good one. All that is necessary is that there is possession under some claim or color of title: Fearl v. Johnstown, <a href="/pa/216/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="216 Pa. 205" data-case-ids="950426" data-case-paths="/pa/216/0205-01">216 Pa. 205</a>; Welsh v.

The cleared land actually farmed extended not only over the Ramsey warrant but for a considerable distance over the line between <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>the two warrants into the Frederick Long warrant. In the action of ejectment brought by respondent against the petitioners in 1905, the description in the pleadings notches out the cleared fields of the Fritz farm extending into the Long warrant and simply describes that which they claim is woodland only, uninclosed and unimproved. So in this proceeding petitioners describe only the uninclosed and unimproved woodland. Both proceedings recognize and concede that there was the actual possession by clearing and farming of the cleared fields of the Long warrant so that even if there was not an actual possession by cutting of timber upon the woodland there would yet be the constructive possession of the woodland following the possession of a part of the Long warrant as farm land under a claim of title.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b257-4" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[90,1185,1153,1067]]]'>This is the well-recognized law of Pennsylvania as shown by a great many decisions. As is said in the syllabus to Ament’s Executor v. Wolf, <a href="/pa/33/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="33 Pa. 331" data-case-ids="988411" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0331-01">33 Pa. 331</a>, “In case of interfering surveys if the owner of the younger title enter upon and occupy a part of his tract and use the uninclosed woodland within the lines of his survey as woodland is ordinarily used this is not a constructive, but an actual possession of the woodland and would give title thereto under the statute of limitations, notwithstanding the entry by the owner of the elder survey upon another portion of his tract. The constructive possession which the law attributes to the legal title is ousted by such use of the woodland; and an actual entry by the owner of the elder title upon another part of his tract is not sufficient to vest the possession in him as against the occupier under the younger survey.” The same principles respecting actual and constructive possession under different conditions and facts appear in Hole v. Rittenhouse, <a href="/pa/37/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="37 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="418939" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0116-01">37 Pa. 116</a>; Burke v.

The surveyor and a son of the respondent both testified to the fact that stumps, as many as six to the acre, having been cut for a number of year's, showed over the entire tract. We think, therefore, we were justified in finding as a fact that there was a possession, either actual or constructive, in the predecessors of petitioners in the possession and claim of title to the woodland in controversy. It is also equally clear that there can be no question that there is a claim or color of title at least in the Fritzs, and the only question remaining is one raised by the admission of the agreement between petitioners and Fritz contemporaneous with the deed to petitioners. It is earnestly contended by counsel for respondent, that the effect of this agreement is to oust the jurisdiction of the court in this matter, owing to the fact there is no title in petitioners, taking the deed and the agreement together as one paper. We do not agree with this contention. The agreement of course to some extent limited the conveyance to petitioners, in that it is an agreement to reconvey the land after the timber is stripped off. The title, therefore in Spangler and Faust, is subject to the terms of this agreement. It in no sense, however, defeats the right of actual possession, and ejectment is a possessory action only.</p>

The fact that Spangler and Faust have not paid John Fritz is wholly immaterial to the respondent. Neither is the fact that John Fritz by this agreement undertakes to bear all the expenses of litigation of any consequence to this controversy or any impeachment of the possessory right conveyed to petitioners. Both these facts are important as between John Fritz and Spangler and Faust but are matters with which respondent has nothing to do <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>and we cannot see that it in any way interferes with the right of petitioners to bring this action.</p>
