That indeed it must be understood to include the realty is as sure as can be when the insignificance of the testator’s personal estate is borne in mind, as it should be: Postlethwaite’s App., <a href="/pa/68/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="68 Pa. 477" data-case-ids="1024532" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0477-01">68 Pa. 477</a>; Follweiler’s App., <a href="/pa/102/0581-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="102 Pa. 581" data-case-ids="502670" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0581-01">102 Pa. 581</a>. Moreover, it accords with a familiar rule of testamentary interpretation which it is not necessary to fortify with the citation of decisions, that these three clauses, separated though they are by spacing, punctuation and numbering, must be read together in order to get the real sense of the testator. Thus read, the unmistakable intent appearing from the language of the will is to divide the estate into two parts equal in value, and to give the one to defendant absolutely and the other to a trustee charged with managing the same and paying the income to the plaintiff during her life, and at her death handing over the corpus to the defendant, or to her children if she be dead. This intent being lawful must, under the cases referred to in an opinion just filed in Kemp v. Reinhard, C. P. No. 17, April Term, 1909, be given effect. Whether that involves a power on the part of the trustee to convert the realty into money, or whether it by itself works such a conversion, is not now an essential inquiry. What is decisive of the question here presented is that the land, so long as it remains such in fact, is given, not to the plaintiff, but to the trustee for a purpose which would be defeated if the plaintiff were permitted to prevail in this proceeding. As pointed out in Seiders v. Giles, <a href="/pa/141/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="141 Pa. 93" data-case-ids="974881" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0093-01">141 Pa. 93</a>, partition is a possessory action, its purpose and effect being to give to each of a number of joint owners the possession he is entitled to of his share in severalty. The indispensable prerequisite to its maintenance is that the plaintiff be a joint owner with the defendant and as such entitled to a separation of his share and possession of it. Where the plaintiff’s interest is not such as confers that right; where the ownership of the undivided portion of the property is not in the plaintiff, but in a trustee clothed with the title and charged with the management <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>of the property, i. e., with an active trust,.which necessarily excludes the plaintiff’s right of possession and control of it — it cannot be said that the plaintiff has a standing to ask for partition.
