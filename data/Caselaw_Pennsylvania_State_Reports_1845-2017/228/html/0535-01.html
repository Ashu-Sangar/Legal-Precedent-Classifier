Fetterhoff died on November 17, 1906, testate, leaving to survive her her mother and sister. Her will, dated March 17, 1906, besides providing bequests for a number of relatives, included legacies to the First Church of the United Brethren in Christ, and to the treasurer of the Old People's Home; and the residuary estate, in equal shares, was devised to the following institutions and societies connected with the United Brethren Denomination: Foreign Missionary Society, Home Missionary Society, Church Erection Society, Woman's Missionary Society, Beneficiary Fund, Union Biblical Seminary, Lebanon Valley College, and the Quincy United Brethren Orphanage and Home. The will was attested by three witnesses, Rev. W. H. Washinger, J. C. Peters and W. O. Appenzellar. Peters and Appenzellar were members and trustees of the First Church, and Washinger was presiding elder of the Pennsylvania Conference, trustee of <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>Lebanon Valley College, director of Quincy Orphanage, and director of Home Missionary Society.
