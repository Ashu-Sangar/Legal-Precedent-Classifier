About five months after the accident he was stricken with apoplexy which paralyzed his entire right side. The liability of the defendant was admitted, and the real controversy at the trial was as to whether the paralytic condition of the plaintiff was the result of the injuries received at the time of the accident or was due to a disease with which the defense claimed he was afflicted.</p>
    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.9",323,[138,1957,1151,422]],["BL_324.1",324,[268,355,1157,90]]]'>The first three assignments go to the refusal of the trial judge to compel the plaintiff to bare parts of his body for the examination of the jury. The plaintiff had submitted to a private physical examination by three physicians representing the defendant, and they were prepared to give their testimony as to the marks upon his body. An exhibition of this kind to an unlearned jury is apt to do more harm than good, and the trial <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>judge committed no error in refusing to order it in this case.</p>

    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[264,569,1160,421]]]'>The fifth assignment covers certain alleged objectionable remarks made by counsel for the plaintiff in the presence of the jury. It is sufficient to say that no exception was taken to the final remark complained of, and the court warned the jury to disregard the others. Since counsel made no request for the withdrawal of a juror, it must be assumed that he was satisfied with this warning.</p>
    <p id="b324-6" data-blocks='[["BL_324.7",324,[261,1000,1161,1389]],["BL_325.1",325,[160,353,1158,897]]]'>The sixth assignment complains that in the course of the charge the trial judge said: “There is no table of life probability adduced here in evidence, and I suppose counsel are afraid owing to the recent rulings of the Supreme Court to put in a life table, but it would be for you to look at this man and determine on the weight of the evidence from his appearance and from the evidence how long he would be likely to live, and if his injury is permanent, then he ought to be compensated for the loss of earning power and for any pain and suffering that the weight of the evidence shows he would endure in the future.” While life tables are admissible in evidence, the probability-of fife can be shown in other ways. In answering a request the court told the jury that they should take into consideration the plaintiff’s age, state of health, business habits, and manner of living. The suggestion that they might look at the plaintiff was expressly coupled with the instruction that their determination must rest upon the weight of the evidence in the case. The health of the plaintiff was discussed during the course of the trial by numerous medical experts On each side, and although the evidence on this subject was conflicting, there was considerable testimony to the effect that his injuries were permanent. There was also testimony that the plaintiff had enjoyed good health prior to the accident; that he had been a drag clerk at <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>a salary of $45.00 per month, which occupation he was obliged to discontinue for about one month after the accident, and that since his stroke he had not been able to work. If the jury believed the testimony of the plaintiff and that of his experts, they would have been justified in drawing the conclusion not only that he had been permanently injured, but that his earning capacity was entirely gone. The trial judge made no suggestion as to the time that the plaintiff would be likely to live, but left it to the jury to determine that question on all the evidence in the case; he expressly told them that they were to take the wages which the plaintiff was earning at the time of the accident as the outside value of his services, and gave them elaborate instructions as to the proper method of reducing the worth of future services to a present value. We see no merit in this assignment.</p>
    <p id="b325-3" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[159,1268,1155,847]]]'>The seventh assignment is to the effect that the court below committed error in using figures by way of illustration in charging the jury as to how they were to get at the present value of the plaintiff’s loss of future earnings. It is always better practice not to illustrate to a jury with figures, lest they may bo misled into taking the particular figures as their guide in fixing the amount of the damages. But here the court said to the jury: “I do not want you for a moment to think that these figures that I am illustrating are any indication of what I think about this case. ... I do not want in the least to indicate that I am figuring on any verdict. ... I am simply illustrating the thought in my mind.” After careful consideration we have concluded that in view of this warning it is not at all probable that any harm was done to the cause of the defendant.</p>

We do not so view it. No request was made for instructions on the subject of the weight of the evidence, and the case is not in that class where the preponderance of the evidence is so plainly on one side that such instructions would suggest themselves as essential to its just and adequate presentation. The plaintiff had five medical experts and the defendant six, and the testimony generally on the plain<a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>tiff’s side was to the effect that the injuries received in the collision were the cause of the subsequent paralysis, while the defendant’s witnesses attributed his condition to other causes. Under the circumstances the jury were sufficiently instructed upon their duty in passing upon the interest and credibility of the witnesses. The entire case was presented with care and impartiality, and it cannot justly be said that any of the issues were minimized.
