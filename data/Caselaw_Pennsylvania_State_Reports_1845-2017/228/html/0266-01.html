The plaintiff testified that she was seated in the third seat from the door when the conductor “called Woodmont station and me sitting in the same place, and I was sitting on the same place when the train stopped <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>and the conductor called Woodmont station, and my husband arose to go out and 1 tried to put one foot — one foot, and one train struck the other train and I fell.” The plaintiff’s husband described the accident as follows:</p>

Here is Woodmont station,’ and I stand up and wants to go and the train starts to go and stops again, and pulls one car another car. Q. What? A. One car pulls another car when she stops again, and I fall to the chair, and when I looked in the back side for my wife — she was three chairs in the back, I see she was on the floor in the back side and crying. I go to the conductor and we put her off and take her outside.”</p>

There was no injury to it, no collision nor breakage of anything. There was, therefore, no presumption of negligence: Herstine v.

She said that when the conductor announced the station and she tried to put her foot out, “one train struck the other train and I fell.” His testimony was that in one second one car pulled another. As the jury could not intelligently have found from the case as presented by the plaintiffs that the defendant was negligent, the judgment on the verdict directed in its favor is affirmed.</p>
