Orders procured by plaintiffs were subject to the approval of the company and prices fixed <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>by it. It was to furnish to plaintiffs monthly, between the fifth and fifteenth, a statement of the net selling price of all bodies, etc., shipped during the preceding month, and between the tenth and twentieth, to pay them the percentage figured upon that statement. It was provided that the contract should be binding unless either of the parties should become insolvent, in which case it might be terminated as soon as all payments then due were made. On November 29, 1907, the wagon works, having become insolvent, went into the hands of defendant as receiver. At that time there were unfinished and unshipped a number of automobile bodies, etc., for part of which the plaintiffs had obtained orders approved by the company. Under authority from the court the receiver proceeded to complete the bodies, etc., and when completed shipped them to the persons to whom they had been sold, the net selling price amounting to $20,520.10. Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled in this action to recover from the receiver ten per cent on that amount under the contract referred to. There being no facts in dispute, a request by defendant for binding instructions was declined and a verdict directed and taken for plaintiffs, whereupon these rules were entered.</p>

There was no express promise by defendant to plaintiffs. Is there any to be implied? It is not disputed, either that a receiver may refuse to assume and carry out a contract of the company executory at the time of his appointment, or that if he elects to adopt such contract and accepts the benefit of it, an assumption by him of its obligations is to be implied. A most apt illustration of this principle is found in Spencer v. Columbian Exposition (Ill.), 45 N. E. Repr. 250. There a company had obtained the concession for a certain period of a space <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>for restaurant purposes, the contract granting it stipulating for the payment in consideration of it of a percentage upon the gross receipts. The company became insolvent and a receiver was appointed when but half the term for which the concession had been made had expired. The receiver continued to occupy the space and to carry on the business, completing the term and receiving the profits. It was held that he could not at the end of the term repudiate the contract and pay the exposition on the basis of a mere quantum meruit. But' the case not only illustrates the application of the principle: it also marks, by the contrast between its facts and those of the present case, its inapplicability to the latter. There the receiver’s acts were a daily affirmance of the contract of concession. But for the continuance of the privilege secured by it he would have been a trespasser. Of course he could not have the benefit of the contract without assuming its burdens, and hence his assumption of them was bound to be implied. If here it appeared that the receiver (supposing him to have been so empowered) had continued the business of manufacturing automobile bodies, etc., accepting new orders for such from the plaintiffs under the old contract, or even only approving previously sent in orders not yet approved by the company, filling them and receiving payment for them, and the claim now in suit involved the question of his liability for the commissions fixed by the contract, the case cited might go far towards sustaining the plaintiffs’ position. But that is not what we have here. It is not alleged that the receiver continued the company’s business in the sense indicated. He continued it merely to finish what had been begun by the company. Plaintiffs sold nothing for him. They had sold the automobile bodies, etc., for the company. According to the contract they had with it, by which the parties had made their own law: Hartley v. Decker, 89-Pa. 470, 473, their services to the company, which were continuous, entitled them to a certain compensation <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>from the company. They were its creditors for the amount of that compensation. Payment of it was to be made at the times and upon the basis provided for in the contract; that is to say, every month they were entitled to receive, not ten per cent upon the price of this or that particular body, etc., or of all the bodies, etc., they had found purchasers for, but a sum equal to ten per cent upon the aggregate sales of bodies, etc., shipped by the company during the preceding month, no matter by whom sold — and so on until the termination of the contract by its expiration or of the business of the company by its insolvency. It will be noticed that the completion and shipping of the bodies, etc., were no concern of the plaintiffs except as furnishing the measure of the monthly payments to be made to them. Their claim against the company under the contract was perfect without this. In other words, the indebtedness to plaintiffs arising by virtue of the contract, was the company’s debt at the date of the appointment of the receiver. When therefore the receiver, taking charge, found in process of manufacture certain automobile bodies, etc., already sold to certain parties through plaintiffs’ agency, and finished and delivered them, he created no new liability in favor or against anyone. He did not adopt the sales made by the plaintiffs. The company had done that. He did not accept any duty or benefit under the company’s contract with plaintiffs, which the company had not accepted. He simply performed a duty assumed by the company towards the vendees in approving those sales and thereby making them its own. He, in other words, adopted and fulfilled its contracts with its vendees. Surely in so doing he cannot be said to have assumed any liability towards plaintiffs, with whom he had no dealings and came into no relation whatever, or to have adopted their contract with the company as a continuing one. The contrary would seem to be one of those self-evident propositions of which it is said in Miller v. Miller, <a href="/pa/187/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="187 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="900273" data-case-paths="/pa/187/0572-01">187 Pa. 572</a>, 583, that they are not the subject of demon<a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>stration, and in Smoot v.
