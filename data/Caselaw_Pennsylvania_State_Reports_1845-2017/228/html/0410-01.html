Besides the usual form of newspaper ad<a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>vertisements, circulars have been sent to the moderators of all Presbyteries in Pennsylvania and to all the members of several of the General Assemblies of the Presbyterian Church. Clergymen have been guests of the Home and members of the General Assembly have visited it. It has been recommended by resolution of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to every minister under the jurisdiction of the Assembly. No better proof of the efficiency of the advertisements can be found than the fact that the comparatively .few applications for admission that have been received by the managers have come from divergent, and not infrequently, most distant parts of the land. Notwithstanding the efforts of the managers, however, the primary object of the testatrix has been defeated by the few applications that have been received and the fewer applicants that have been admitted. In the twenty-one years since the institution of the Home only thirty-five applications have been received. Of this number twelve applicants were refused admission because they did not come within the class of beneficiaries designated by the will; eight did not pursue their applications, or after being approved, declined or neglected to enter, and fifteen were approved and became residents. Of the fifteen who thus entered, ten resigned or left the Home for various personal reasons not connected with the management of the institution, and four remained until the time of their death. Only one is now a beneficiary. The average of entrances has, therefore, been less than one a year, and the average of permanent residents less than one every four years.</p>

It is for these reasons and not because of the lack of beneficiaries who are entitled to the privileges of the Home that its benefits have been rendered almost null and of no effect. The Board of Managers, after serious consideration, are unanimously of the opinion that the primary object of the testatrix would be accomplished by payment of the income directly to the beneficiaries coming within the provisions of the will and selected by the Managers rather than by endeavoring to fill the Home with such beneficiaries.

Those who were admitted seemed to have a pleasant time. Pour died there, one of whom had lived there ten years.

The literal accuracy of the plaintiffs’ charge is, consequently, negatived. Their reliance must therefore be on its substantial correctness.

The church at large had constituted a board for the relief of the same general class of persons, and was, in the common opinion, doing more good with a given amount of money than the same sum would accomplish under the very definite terms of the will. A conviction became general that an abandonment of the peculiar notions of the testatrix would accomplish more of her real purpose than the adherence to them, and that, therefore, the trust fund should be held and used in the manner approved by the experience of the board of ministerial relief. This conviction naturally affected the mind of the defendant trustee and gave rise to the petition. It was based on the thought that a sufficient cáse for the application of the cy pres doctrine could be made out, and certain passages were, under the circumstances, unduly emphasized.</p>

The thought, for instance, that a Presbyterian clergyman would have to desert his wife of many years, as a prerequisite to admission to the home, was read into the will. No word to that effect is written therein, nor is such a regulation fairly inferable therefrom. We cannot impute to a pious woman the idea that a minister of the gospel, should for the sake of a little added personal comfort, repudiate his life companion and thus set at naught the binding injunctions of human and divine law. To “support and maintain” an old clergyman means to enable him to keep himself and his wife. It would have been easy to specify the contrary, if the contrary had been meant. In such event the benefits would have been confined to single men or to widowers, but while she was careful to exclude .tobacco-users, the testatrix said nothing about the more important matter.</p>
