In cases of doubtful construction the law leans in favor of an absolute, rather than a defeasible estate; of a vested, rather than a contingent one; of the primary, rather than the secondary intent; of the first, rather than the second taker, as the principal object of the testator’s bounty; and of a distribution as nearly conformed to the general rules of inheritance as possible.</p>

The question of vested or contingent is not to be tested by the certainty or uncertainty of obtaining the actual enjoyment; for that would make the character of the estate depend, not upon the terms of its creation, but on the form of the result. Neither does it depend upon the defeasibility or indefeasibility of the right of possession; for many estates are vested without possession, as well as with, which are yet defeasible. If there is a present right to a future possession, though that right may be defeated by some future event, contingent or certain, there is nevertheless a vested estate. An unpossessed estate is vested, if it is certain to take effect in possession, by enduring longer than the precedent estate.</p>

His will, in seventeen items, bears evidence upon its face of having been drawn by one who was an expert in legal expression, makes careful and elaborate provision for each of his children and for the children of his deceased son, varying in quantity and in form, sometimes giving directly and at others in trust, sometimes in fee and at others for life, but in the main setting apart a portion of his estate in the form of life trusts for his children and the children of his deceased . son, with remainders over to their respective children.J, After making these particular provisions, the testator disposed of the residue of his estate — sufficiently large in 1907 to produce a net annual income of over $18,000— by creating a trust to last for twenty years as shown by item fourteen of his will, which reads as follows:</p>

Rettew, died August 28, 1907, intestate, leaving to survive her no children, but a husband, C. Yernon Rettew, the appellant here, to whom letters of administration were granted on her estate. On January 31, 1908, the executor and <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>trustee filed his fourteenth partial account of his several trusts, showing in his hands an undistributed accumulation of the income of the residuary estate of $18,265.30. Of this amount the children of Ira L. Long were entitled to one-sixth, or $3,044.21, which an auditor was appointed to distribute. Before the auditor the three surviving children of Ira L. Long claimed the entire fund for distribution, contending that the legacy to Florence R. Rettew in the residuary clause of the will was contingent, or, if vested, was divested by her death, and that the income of the residuary estate was not apportionable between them and Mrs. Rettew’s administrator. The latter claimed one-fourth of the fund going to Ira L. Long’s children, upon the ground that the legacy was vested in Mrs. Rettew during her lifetime, to wit: at the death of the testator, and was not divested by her death. The learned auditor, in an exhaustive and careful opinion, sustained the latter contention and submitted a table of distribution accordingly.' Upon exceptions filed by the three surviving children of Ira L. Long, the court held that Mrs. Rettew’s legacy was contingent, but that, so far as the fund was income from the rents of real estate and interest on mortgages and other loans, it was apportion-able between the life tenant and the remainder-men in the proportion of seven to five, Mrs. Rettew having lived about seven months out of the twelve covered by the account.

We here quote it: “And if any of my children should die without leaving lineal descendants, before the expiration of twenty years after my decease, then such share shall go to the other legatees <a id="p598" href="#p598" data-label="598" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*598</a>share and share alike — parties taking per stirpes and not per capita.”</p>

Long? In our opinion, the will gives vested legacies to the testator’s children and grandchildren provided for in the residuary clause. In oi'der to hold that these legacies were contingent places upon the person so asserting the burden of establishing by fair and reasonable construction of the will that the legacies are contingent without doubt. To the writer it seems quite clear that these legacies were vested at the death of the testator, but to convict the court below of error, and to sustain the learned auditor, only requires us to conclude that the question is doubtful. The rule of law is that a legacy must be assumed to be vested unless the contrary intention of the testator clearly appears.

Time is annexed, not to the substance of the gift, but merely to the payment, and, while the gift of the legacy is in the form of direction to pay, the direction to pay to the legatees the income not needed for the purposes of the trust shows the intention of the testator that the beneficial enjoyment should begin at once and that payment only of the principal should be postponed.

It is contended by the court and argued by the counsel for appellees that the testator evidently intended to make the legacies contingent so that the persons interested would not dispose of their interests and thus interfere with the trustee keeping control of the property for twenty years, but this argument is not of much force when we remember that the Supreme Court has often held that the' beneficiary may dispose of his legacy whether it be contingent or vested.

The remaining question strongly argued by appellees’ counsel is that if the legacy to Mrs. Rettew was vested, it was divested by her death, under the last sentence but one of item fourteen of the will hereinbefore quoted. The testator’s direction relied on is plainly limited to his children and it does not include grandchildren. To make this language include grandchildren requires a strained construction, and in our opinion a will so well drawn as the one in question will not bear a strained construction, especially on a question so well decided as the meaning of the words “my children” when used by a testator. It has been decided that the children means descendants in the first degree and never includes grandchildren, except in the contingencies referred to in the cases.</p>

But such construction can only arise, from a clear intention of necessary implication; as where there are not other children than grandchildren, or where the term ‘children,’ is further explained by a limitation over, in default of issue. The word ‘children’ does not ordinarily, and properly speaking, comprehend grandchildren, or issue generally. Their being included in that term, is only permitted in two cases, viz., from necessity, which occurs when the will would remain inoperative, unless the sense of the word, ‘children’ were extended beyond its natural import; and where the testator has clearly shown by the other words that he did not intend <a id="p604" href="#p604" data-label="604" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*604</a>to use the term ' children, ’ in the proper actual meaning, but in a more extensive sense.”</p>
