That testimony presented a question of fact for the jury, and it was accordingly submitted to them by the learned trial judge in a clear and adequate charge, to which no just exception can be taken. The facts upon which the case hinged were established by the verdict; and, the court below having refused a new trial, litigation should have then and there ended. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires further notice. Neither of them is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Edmund W. Holmes v. James Fitzpatrick, Appellant.\nContract \u2014 Agreement to pay for services rendered to another \u2014 Evidence \u2014 Question for jury.\nIn an action to recover for medical services rendered to defendant\u2019s mother, the case is for the jury where the evidence, although contradicted, shows that defendant said to plaintiff, \u201c Whenever my mother sends for you I want you to attend her, and I will pay your bill; \u201d and there is proof that defendant paid other bills rendered to him by plaintiff for attending his mother.\nArgued Jan. 15, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 132, July T., 1895, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Philadelphia Co., December T., 1893, No. 1401, on verdict for plaintiff.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit for medical services rendered to defendant\u2019s mother. Before Biddle, J.\nAt the trial plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that defendant agreed to pay plaintiff for any medical services that he might render to defendant\u2019s mother, and that defendant had paid some bills to plaintiff in pursuance of this agreement. This was denied by defendant.\nThe court charged in part as follows :\nIn this ease Dr. Holmes brought suit against Mr. Fitzpatrick to recover for medical services furnished to the mother of Mr. Fitzpatrick at his request. The doctor states that a number of years ago, when he first commenced attending the family, that is to say, ten or eleven years ago, he had an interview with Mr. Fitzpatrick, and he said to him, \u201c Whenever my mother sends for you I want you to attend her and I will pay your bill; \u201d and he contends from that time down to almost the day of this lady\u2019s death he had been in the habit of attending her and sending bills to Mr. Fitzpatrick, which Mr. Fitzpatrick had paid, and therefore in the usual course of business he sent this bill to Mr. Fitzpatrick, but, for reasons he has stated, Mr. Fitzpatrick declined to pay it.\nNow, as has been said by the defendant\u2019s counsel, it is true that a promise made ten years ago if you were to sue upon it now you could not recover. It is also true that a promise to pay the debt of another must be in writing.\nThose are both true principles of law, but they are not applicable to this case. . . .\nNow the defendant denies that he made this promise to the doctor originally, and he says he has paid bills of his mother, etc., but his explanation of that is that he has paid the bills whenever his mother requested him to pay, but on this occasion she did not request him to pay it, and therefore he declined to pay it.\nThese are the main questions that you have to decide in this case. If you believe the doctor\u2019s statement that he was continuously attending her on those terms, there is nothing to prevent you giving a verdict for him. On the other hand, a man is not bound to pay a bill simply because it is owing by his mother. That depends on his having bargained to pay it.\nDefendant\u2019s points were as follows:\n1. The plaintiff cannot recover unless the defendant promised in writing to pay the account sued for. Answer: Refused. [1]\n3. Under all the circumstances of this case the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: Refused. [2]\nVerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $75.00. Defendant appealed.\nFrrors assigned were (1, 2) above instructions, quoting them.\nCharles L. Smyth, for appellant.\n\u2014 The case is clearly within the statute of frauds: Riegelman v. Focht, 141 Pa. 380.\nSydney G. Fisher, Francis Rawle with him, for appellee,\ncited Merriman v. McManus, 102 Pa. 102.\nJanuary 27, 1896:"
