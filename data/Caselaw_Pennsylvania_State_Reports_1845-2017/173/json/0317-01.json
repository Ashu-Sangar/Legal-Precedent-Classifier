        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nWhile it is averred in the statement that \u201c defendant is indebted to plaintiff in the sum of $116.44 .... for work done and materials supplied in making alterations to\u201d her bouse \u201c as set forth in an itemized statement thereto annexed, marked \u2018 Exhibit A,\u2019 and .... that the said materials were furnished and the work done at her instance and request and upon her promise to pay for the same,\u201d it is nowhere averred that the prices set opposite the respective items of \u201cwork done and materials supplied\u201d \u2014 among which are, \u201c1 laborer day $2.00,\u201d and \u201c 100 feet white pine $10.00 \u201d \u2014 are either correct, just or reasonable, or that defendant agreed to pay said prices. If plaintiff believed, or expected to be able to prove that $2.00 for one laborer half a day, and other prices set opposite the respective items in \u201c Exhibit A,\u201d were either just or reasonable it would have been an easy matter for him to have said so. A claim, such as his, for the value of \u201c work done and materials supplied,\u201d cannot be regarded as complete without an averment of the amount or sum that each item is reasonably worth. In substantiating such a claim before a jury, it would be necessary not only to prove each item of work done and materials furnished, but also how much each was reasonably worth. As was well said in Fritz v. Hathaway, 135 Pa. 274, \u201cAs to all matters of substance, completeness, accuracy and precision are as necessary now to a statement as they were before to a declaration in the settled and time honored forms.\u201d\nBut assuming, for argument\u2019s sake, the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s statement, we have no doubt that the averments contained in the affidavit of defense are quite sufficient to carry the case to a jury. After averring \u201c that she has a just, full, true and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d the defendant, evidently still referring to the \u201c work done and materials supplied,\u201d which constitute the basis of plaintiff\u2019s claim, says in substance that on or about October 1, 1892 (the time named in plaintiff\u2019s statement), she made a verbal contract with plaintiff to do said work and furnish the necessary materials for the sum of $35.00, payable on completion of the work; that ever since the completion of the work she has always been ready and willing to pay him, the said sum agreed upon, but he has always refused to accept the same. We are of opinion that this is the only construction of which the affidavit of defense is fairly susceptible.\nJudgment reversed and a procedendo awarded.",

The account attached to the statement showed entries beginning with October 8, 1892; but it nowhere averred that the prices set opposite the respective items of work done and materials supplied were either correct, just or reasonable, or that defendant agreed to pay said prices.\nDefendant\u2019s affidavit of defense averred that \u201cshe has a just, full, true and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, \u201cthat on or about October 1, 1892, she made a verbal contract with plaintiff to do certain work upon her house, the same as described in the statement, for which she was to pay $35.00, that she does not owe the amount claimed by plaintiff, $116.44, but she is and always has been willing to pay the said sum of $35.00.

Taylor, the defendant in the above case, being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says that she has a just, full, true, and legal defense to the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s claim of the following nature and character:\nThat on or about the 1st of October, 1892, the plaintiff verbally contracted with the defendant to extend the partition walls of two rooms across a passageway or entry in the second-story back building of the premises owned by defendant at No. 1504 Pine street, in this city, and to replace two doors, and to do all such things as would be necessary to complete the work in the way of carpentering, priming, and plastering for the sum of $35.00, which defendant agreed to pay upon the completion of the work, which was shortly afterwards completed.\nDefendant avers she does not owe the plaintiff the sum of $116.44, as claimed by him in his statement, but she is and always has been ready and willing to pay the said sum of $35.00, but plaintiff has always refused to accept the same.\nAll of which the defendant avers to be true, and expects to be able to prove at the trial of this cause.\nError assigned was order making absolute rule for judgment.\nW. D. Neilson, for appellant.\n\u2014 The affidavit of defense was in all essential particulars sufficient to require the plaintiff to submit his case to a trial by jury: Shafer v. Brotherhood of Carpenters, 22 W. N. C. 312; Galey v. Fitzpatrick, 171 Pa. 50; Landis v. R. R., 133 Pa. 579: Bryson v. The Home, 168 Pa. 352; Knerr v. Bradley, 105 Pa. 190; Hunter v. Reilly, 36 Pa. 509; McPherson v. Bank, 96 Pa. 135; Bank v. Schofield, 168 Pa. 407; Barker v. Fairchild, 168 Pa. 246; Lawrence v. Smedley, 6 W. N. C. 42.\nThe statement itself is insufficient to support a judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense: Act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271; Byrne v. Hayden, 124 Pa. 170; Winkleblake v. Van Dyke, 161 Pa. 5; Newbold v. Pennock, 154 Pa. 591; Gould v. Gage, 118 Pa. 559; Shallcross v. Cole, 3 W. N. C. 272; Gottman v. Shoemaker, 86 Pa. 31; Fritz v. Hathaway, 135 Pa. 274; Bartoe v. Guchert, 158 Pa. 124; Allegheny v. McCaffrey, 131 Pa. 137; City v. Baker, 140 Pa. 11.\nLeoni Melick, of Melick & Potter, for appellee.\n\u2014 The insufficiency of the affidavit of defense is that it is not stated that the work done, for which the defendant admits $35.00 to be due, was the same or part of the same referred to in the statement, nor does it allege that this was the only contract made with the plaintiff.\nGaley v. Fitzpatrick, 171 Pa. 50, cited by the appellant, is not in point, because in that case the defendant denied the contract sued upon.\nAs to the allegation that the statement itself is insufficient, the word \u201c justly \u2019\u2019was held not to be essential in Smith, Kline & French Co. v. Smith, 166 Pa. 563.\nJanuary 20, 1896:"
