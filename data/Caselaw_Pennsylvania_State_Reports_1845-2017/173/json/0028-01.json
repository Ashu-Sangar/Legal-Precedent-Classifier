Willis & Co., appellants of the city of New York, placed in the hands of A. C. Johnston, their attorney in Pittsburg, for collection, an account against P. M. Finley, amounting to $475, in payment of which on December 12, 1893, Johnston received from Mr. Finley, through his attorney, A. C. Spindler, Esq., a cheek for that amount drawn upon the banking firm of it. Patrick & Co., of Pittsburg. This check was not delivered to Mr. Johnston until after 3 o\u2019clock p.m. on the 12th, and was deposited by him for collection in the Anchor Savings Bank about 3:30 p. M. on the same day, by which it was sent to the First National Bank immediately after 9 o\u2019clock a.m. on the 13th, and by the latter bank it was presented in the clearing house,on the morning of December 14. On that date R. Patrick & Co. suspended payment, and the cheek was returned through the Anchor Bank to Mr. Johnston unpaid. It was admitted at the trial that Patrick & Co. were open and doing business on the 13th, and that the appellee had sufficient funds on deposit with them to have paid this cheek if it had been presented on that date.\nThe court gave binding instructions for defendant.\nYerdict and judgment for defendant.
