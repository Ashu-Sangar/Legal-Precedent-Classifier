Saul, Trading as Cann & Saul.\nContract \u2014 Statute of frauds \u2014 Agreement to answer for debt of another\u2014 Act of Aprils, 1855.\nIn an action by a corporation against a partnership to recover for goods sold to another corporation, plaintiff in its statement averred that \u201cthe defendants promised and agreed that the plaintiff should have its account for the goods that were to be sold to the Penn Elevator Engineering Company under said contract guaranteed \u201d by the said defendants and that they, the said defendants, would ship on demand to the plaintiff goods to the amount guaranteed, and thus protect plaintiff from any loss which it might suffer by reason of the insolvency or failure by the said Penn Engineering Elevator Company; and that the goods for which suit is brought were sold to said company under said agreement, and that said company is insolvent. Held, that the contract as laid in the statement was virtually an agreement to answer for the debt or default of another, and not being in writing, it came within the letter as well as the spirit of the act of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, and was void.\nArgued Jan. 17, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 42, July T., 1895, by plaintiff;, from judgment of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March. T., 1895, No. 293, for defendant on demurrer.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nAssumpsit on a contract of guaranty.\nPlaintiff in its statement averred that it had sold goods to the Penn Elevator Engineering Company under two written contracts, and that there was due to it upon these contracts $1,329.60. The statement of claim continued as follows :\nTbe plaintiff avers that at tbe times tbe said contracts were made, to wit: On January 18,1894, and February 27,1894, the said David S. Cann and George E. Saul, copartners, trading as Cann & Saul, who are the defendants in this suit, promised and agreed with the plaintiff that the plaintiff should have its account for the goods which were to be sold to the Penn Elevator Engineering Company under the above-mentioned contract guaranteed by the said Cann & Saul to the extent of $1,000 on the first-mentioned contract and $1,500 on the last mentioned contract, and that they, the said Cann & Saul, would ship on demand to the said Putnam Machine Company, steel and files to the amount of the said $2,500, and thus protect the plaintiff from any loss which it might suffer by reason of the insolvency or failure of the said Penn Elevator Engineering Company. The said David S. Cann and George E. Saul were both stockholders of the said Penn Elevator Engineering Company, and the said Saul was a director, and the said Cann was the treasurer of the said company, and it was a part of the consideration for the promise and agreement above set forth, that the plaintiff was to ship the goods mentioned to the said corporation in which the said Cann and Saul were heavily interested.\nThe plaintiff avers that acting upon the promises and agreements of the said defendants, it shipped the goods above mentioned to the Penn Elevator Engineering Company, and that its account for the same amounted to $4,671.44.\nAfterwards the said Cann & Saul shipped to the plaintiff, upon their contract above mentioned, goods to the amount of $1,170.40.\nThat afterwards the said Penn Elevator Engineering Company became insolvent, and the plaintiff obtained a judgment against them for $3,630, on December 18, 1894, in C. C. P. No. 3, December term, 1894, No. 333, and issued an execution upon the said judgment, but could realize nothing upon the same, as the assets of the Penn Elevator Engineering Company were absorbed at sheriff\u2019s sale upon a prior judgment entered against them.\nThe plaintiff avers that it has made demand upon the defendants to deliver to it steel and files for the balance of $1,329.60 due under their contract, and has sent them written orders for the goods agreed upon, but the defendants have failed and refused to ship it any goods, or to pay the claim, and the plaintiff has therefore suffered damages to the amount of $1,329.60.\nDefendants demurred to plaintiff\u2019s statement on the ground that the agreement referred to in the statement was a contract of guaranty, not in writing, and void under the act of April 26, 1865, P. L. 309. The court entered judgment for defendants upon the demurrer.\nError assigned was entry of judgment as above.\nSamuel W. Cooper, for appellant.\n\u2014 The contract was not within the statute of frauds: Lobb v. Stanley, 5 Q. B. 574; Johnson v. Dodgson, 2 M. & W. 653; Propert v. Parker, 1 Rus. & Myl. 625; Paul v.
