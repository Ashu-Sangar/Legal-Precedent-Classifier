The court being equally divided in opinion as to the controlling question before it, neither of the exceptions was sustained, and hence the decree of the auditing judge stood as the final decree of the court below. From that decree this appeal was taken, and the main question here, as in the court below, is what, under the facts of the case, properly constitutes \u201c income and profits,\u201d and what \u201c principal.\u201d That question has been so thoroughly considered and so satisfactorily solved by the learned president of the orphans\u2019 court in bis dissenting opinion, that for reasons therein given we are all satisfied the court erred in bolding as it did.\nTbe decree is therefore reversed, with costs to be paid by appellant, and it is ordered that tbe record be remitted, with instructions to correct tbe surviving trustee\u2019s account in accordance with said dissenting opinion.",

The gift being general gave the remainder-man no title to any specific property, but implied conversion into cash which referred the value of the corpus to the date of the testator\u2019s death.\nArgued Nov. 8, 1895.\nAppeal, No. 256, Oct. T., 1895, by J. F. Leech and Margaretta Park Leech, his wife, from decree of O. C. Allegheny Co., Dec. T., 1894, No. 79, dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nReversed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nDavid E. Park, the testator, died on the 22d day of February, 1875, testate, leaving to survive him a widow, since deceased, and one daughter, Margaretta, the appellant, now the wife of J. F. Leech.\nThe auditing judge, Over, J., stated the facts to be as follows :\nThe testator, by his will, dated the 19th of February, A. D. 1875, devised and bequeathed the residue of his estate, both real and personal, to his executors in trust, \u201c to receive and collect the rents of the real .estate hereby devised to them in trust, and the income and profits of the personal estate, hereby bequeathed to them in trust,\u201d (after deducting taxes and expenses and some minor annuities,) \u201c to pay the residue of the net income arising from said real and personal estate, held by them in trust,\u201d into the hands of his daughter Margaretta, yearly and every year during her natural life, the corpus of the estate to be paid to her children after her death.\nThe executors and trustees were James I. Kuhn (who, during the testator\u2019s lifetime, was his attorney), Andrew D. Smith and James B. Scott, of whom Andrew D. Smith is the sole survivor.\nThe executors filed two accounts, both of which were confirmed absolutely; neither account showed complete administration, and as they both showed balances due the executors, no decree of distribution was made on either of them.\nThey turned over a large sum of money to themselves as trustees, and invested $8,564.11 of it in a mortgage on certain property known as the Adams' property, and $27,200 in a mortgage on certain other property known as the McKelvy property.\nThe interest on these mortgages fell into arrears, whereupon the mortgages were foreclosed, and at the sheriff\u2019s sale thereunder, the properties were bought in by the trustees to protect the estate and for the purpose of being resold.\nThere was no money paid for either property. No bids were made sufficient to pay the mortgages, and the properties were bought in by the trustees, who paid nothing for them except the costs of the sale.\nThe deed for the McKelvy property was dated April 20,1878, and the deed for the Adams property was dated May 18, 1878.\nIn February, 1882, the trustees sold a portion of the Adams property to the Pittsburg, McKeesport & Youghiogheny R. R. Co. for . . . $ 2,250 00\nwhich was paid in cash; and on November 1,1882, they sold the balance thereof to The Pittsburg Furnace Co. for....... 25,875 00\nreceiving in cash .... $ 5,375 00\nand a purchase money mortgage for . 20,000 00\nThe total consideration for both sales was . $27,625 00\nThe trustees paid Mrs Leech on account of back interest on the mortgage $ 3,018 59\nTheir commissions on the sale . . 932 79\nThe original investment was . . 8,594 11\nTotal ...... . $12,445 49\nMaking a net profit on the sale of . $15,079 51\nIn November, 1886, they sold the McKelvy property to A. L. Sailor & Company, for $53,000 00\n\u00d3n November 22, 1886, they received $17,000 00\nOn November 22, 1887, \u201c 10,000 00\nOn November 12, 1888, \u201c 6,000 00\nLeaving a balance of 20,000 00\nwhich was secured by purchase money mortgage on the premises.\nThe total consideration was . $53,000 00\nThey paid Mrs, Leech for back interest $13,288 33\nTheir commission on sale . 1,285 00\nThe original investment was . 27,200 00\nMaking a total of $41,873 33.\nShowing a net profit on sale of $11,126 67\nThere is no evidence that at the time of the payment of the so called back interest to Mrs. Leech, she had any knowledge of the transaction, or of the profits made, or of her rights in the premises. It would appear that she accepted what the trustees gave her, and made no objections.\nAt No. 164, September term, 1889, the trustees filed their first account as trustees. At the time this account was filed, there was still unpaid $20,000 of the purchase money of the Adams property, and $20,000 of the purchase money on the McKelvy property, this balance being secured, as already stated, by purchase money mortgages given by the purchasers.\nThe account filed did not show any balance for distribution. It was confirmed nisi on the 2d day of September, 1889, and absolutely on the 13th day of September, 1889, but it was never audited, nor was any decree of distribution made thereon.\nBetween that time and the filing of the present account, Mrs. Leech learned the facts in regard to these properties, and made a demand of the surviving trustee for the profits, claiming that the same should be paid to her.\nThis was refused by the trustee, and on the filing of his account, exceptions were filed, one being to the form of the account, and the other intended to raise the question as to her right to receive this money.\nThe auditing judge held that the net profits realized from the sale of the Adams and McKelvy properties belonged to the corpus of the trust estate. He accordingly dismissed Mrs. Leech\u2019s exceptions to the trustee\u2019s account.\nExceptions to the adjudication filed by Mrs. Leech were overruled, Over, J., filing the opinion of the court, and Hawkins, P. J., filing the following dissenting opinion:\nI dissent from the view which the auditing judge has taken in respect of what shall constitute \u201c income and profits \u201d and what principal.\nIf the gift had been of specific property for life with remainder over, it may be conceded that Mrs. Leech would have had no right to share in the proceeds of its sale, for such proceeds when realized would simply have been the measure of value of the specific property which, by the terms of the will, those in remainder would otherwise have had a right to demand at her death. The gift, however, being general, gave those in remainder no title to any specific property, but implied conversion into cash, which referred the value of the corpus to the date of the testator\u2019s death. Had the gift to Mrs. Leech been legal as well as equitable, that value would have been the measure of her liability to those in remainder and the source of the income and profits beneficially intended for her. Investment and reinvestment would have been in her control and for her sole benefit. Those in remainder would have had no interest further than the safety of this corpus and its payment at her death. This being conceded, why should the mere separation of legal and equitable estate imply any change in her beneficial estate ? The obvious purpose of separation was to vest in the trustee the duty of administration of the trust estate. The gift of the beneficial interest was as absolute as though coupled with a legal estate. It was no greater or less because of the separation. In either event the trust estate would consist at the beginning of cash, and Mrs. Leech, by the terms of the will, be entitled to whatever \u201c income and profits \u201d it might earn during her life. The direction given by the testator to invest and reinvest necessar rily had reference to cash as its subject; for the will spoke as of his death. Had bond been required of the trustee, that must have been the basis upon which its amount would have been fixed and the measure of liability to those in remainder. If the testator had manifested an intent that the fund should be invested in the purchase of lands and thereby work a conversion, any increase in value of the lands must, it is conceded, have inured to the benefit of the remainder: In re Gerry\u2019s Accts., 103 N. Y. 445. But there is no such intent apparent upon the face of the will; on the contrary, the direction to invest and reinvest evinces a temporary holding, and negatives any change in the nature of the fund. But however this may be, the investment made here was, in fact, of part of the corpus in a mere temporary security, and it is too plain for argument that the purchase of the mortgaged land under foreclosure proceedings was not a reinvestment. The trust estate was creditor to the extent of the mortgage debt, and the trustee must have accepted tender of the amount at any time before delivery of the deed. The proceeding was simply a process for collection, and part of the necessary duty of the administration of the trust estate: Oeslager v. Fisher, 2 Pa. 467. The purchase did not work conversion into realty. The investment retained its character of personalty, and the trustee had the same power over the land as he had over the mortgage. When the amount of the investment had been restored, what more could be claimed on behalf of those in remainder ? Speaking from the death of testator, that was the amount which the will gave them. If Mrs. Leech would have been entitled to ten, twenty, or any larger percentage, reserved in the mortgage, as must be- conceded, as income and profit, why not earnings resulting from process of collection by foreclosure ? If she is entitled to six per cent out of those earnings, why not to all ? It is impossible to understand why the earnings retained by the trustee are not as much \u201c income and profits \u201d as that paid to Mrs.' Leech. If it was right to pay her six per cent out of these earnings, the whole earnings logically belonged to her; for they are equally income and profits. which sprang from the mortgage investment. It is obviously immaterial how the earnings arise; it is enough that they were the income of the fund invested to give Mrs. Leech the right to them. It is said that \u201c because a loss would have fallen on both the remainder-men and life tenant it is but equitable they should both participate if there be a profit in the same proportion as they would bear to the loss.\u201d This rule logically carried out would enable a trustee to create a contingent fund of any profits, whether interest, dividends, or such as the present, and thus defeat the expressed intent of the testator. But suppose no loss should ever occur, to whom should these admitted profits belong ? If profits, the remainder-men could make no claim; and Mrs. Leech would be beyond the need of them. The true test of the equities of the parties must be found in the will; and that gave Mrs. Leech \u201c all the income and profits \u201d during life, and the principal to her children at her death. Loss of part of the corpus, when it happens, is a question of administration which the trustee must answer. If it result from his negligence, he must make it good; if not, he is entitled to credit on the principal; but in any event neither he nor the remainder-men can make her income security for hypothetical losses: Gerry\u2019s Accts., supra. The testator having specified the deductions which he intended should be made, thereby excluded all others, and made the net \u201cincome and profits\u201d the absolute property of Mrs. Leech. It may well be that if, as has been suggested, a loss had happened in one of these investments, it could have been made up out of gain in the other; for the amounts invested were but parts of a single estate, and the purpose and result of its administration must have been the same, whether the investments have been in several or one sum; the estate and its administration should be treated as entireties. But there was in fact no impairment of principal, and therefore no such question can arise here.\nNo Pennsylvania cases precisely similar in facts have been found, but analogous cases show (1) a favorable construction given bequests of income, and (2) life donees entitled as well to extra as ordinary profits earned pending their estates. That class of cases in which the earning for coal and royalties in oil have been treated as income, although they consume the principal, are striking illustrations of the first proposition: Eley\u2019s Appeal, 103 Pa. 300; 'Woodburn\u2019s Estate, 138 Pa. 606, while \u2022scrip dividends, Philadelphia Trust Company\u2019s Appeal, 16 Atl. Rep. 734, and the proceeds of sales made by land companies, Oliver\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 43; Thompson\u2019s Estate, 153 Pa. 332, sufficiently illustrate the second. In Earp\u2019s Appeal, 28 Pa. 368, which is the leading case, it was held that the surplus profits earned prior to testator\u2019s death on stocks were essentially part of the stock itself and principal; while those earned after, whether declared in the form of cash, scrip or stock, belonged to the life donee. \u201c In the ease before us,\u201d said the chief justice, \u201c the testator has not made a bequest of the stock itself to appellant; on the contrary he has given them only the income for life. Their interest commences after the death of testator. They have no right whatever to claim the income which had accumulated before his death. ... It is equally clear that the profits ' arising since the death of the testator are income within the meaning of the will, and should be distributed among the appellants.\u201d This principle was said by Mr. Justice Claek, in Smith\u2019s Estate, 140 Pa. 344, to have ruled all the cases involving the relative rights of donees for life and in remainder down to Oliver\u2019s Estate, supra, which was the then last, without modification or change. Oliver\u2019s Estate, and the subsequent cas\u2019e of Thompson\u2019s. Estate, supra, perhaps come nearest the present. There, as here, extraordinary profits were made during the life estate out of temporary investments in real estate, and as the life donees were there entitled, the necessary inference is they are entitled here. The increase in profits belonged to the donees for life, and those in remainder were only interested to the extent of the investment actually made.\nThe authorities cited in the support of the theory of capitalization of profits are not, in my opinion, entitled to the weight which has been given them. The rule, as quoted from Hill on Trustees, to the effect that \u201c any extraordinary \u201d profits realized from \u201c stocks or other property \u201d belongs to the corpus was no. doubt the result of the English cases which had been decided when the text was written; but later cases have greatly modified, if not reversed, it; while it has been distinctly repudiated in Pennsylvania: Earp\u2019s Appeal, supra. The case of VanVleck v. Lounsberry, 34 Hun, 569, decided by a subordinate court of New York, maybe classified with the Massachusetts and Georgia cases which were said in Smith\u2019s Appeal, supra, to be exceptions to the American, which is the Pennsylvania, rule. The question involved here does not appear to have been decided by the court of last resort in New York: Gerry\u2019s Accts., 103 N. Y. 445, cited for the trustee, was made to turn upon a question of construction. \u201c The theory of the will,\u201d said that court, \u201c did not contemplate any traffic in securities by the trustee, but a permanent investment in interest-bearing obligations, subject to be sold or exchanged only when the exigencies of the trust required it to be done. It is quite clear that the life tenant could not have compelled the trustee to sell or convert securities lawfully-purchased or held upon the ground that their market value had appreciated in their hands any more than they could have compelled her to make good any depreciation in the value of such securities. Their acquisition and retention was one of the objects contemplated by the will of the testator, and was essential to execute his design, and a proceeding to compel their sale would plainly have been contrary to his intent in creating the trust.\u201d The court expressly distinguished this from that class of cases in which temporary investments in stocks or trade have been authorized. It was admitted that Ware\u2019s Estate, 12 W. N. C. 571, also cited for the trustee, has been reversed: Middleton\u2019s Appeal, 108 Pa. 92; and Hubley\u2019s Estate, 16 Phila. 327, like Gerry\u2019s Accts., supra, appears to have involved a question of distribution of the proceeds of sale of property specially given wherein the natural increase was held to belong to the remainder.\nThese suggestions sufficiently indicate the trend of decision, and the principle which should settle the question raised here. The gift being, not of specific property, but general and residuary in its character, the measure of the remainder is its value at the date of testator\u2019s death, and that of the life estate the increase thereafter; it follows that the amounts invested in mortgage, which were admittedly parts of the estate at testator\u2019s death, should be treated as the corpus; and the residue, in the hands of the trustees arising from foreclosure as belonging to Mrs. Leech, as \u201cincome and profit\u201d within the \u201cpurpose and intent\u201d of Mr. Park\u2019s will.\nError assigned was the decree of the court dismissing the exceptions.\nGeorge W. Guthrie, for appellant.\n\u2014 The fund in dispute did not constitute any portion of the testator\u2019s estate. It did not come into existence until many years after his death; it never belonged to him; it does not represent any property which ever did belong to him, or into which any money of his had ever been converted: Navigation Co. v. Moore, 2 Whart. 491.\nA purchase of land made in this manner does' not work a conversion. For all purposes of administration and distribution, the fund preserves its original character: Oeslager v. Fisher, 2 Pa. 467.\nIn addition to the cases cited by Judge Hawkins the attention of this court is called to the cases of Wilkinson v. Duncan, 23 Beav. 469; Beaven v. Beaven (L. R.), 24 Chancery Div. 649; and In re Earl of Chesterfield\u2019s Trust (L. R.), 24 Chanc. Div. 643, in which the principle contended for by the appellant is fully sustained.\nThe authorities cited by the learned auditing judge in deciding against the claim of the appellant should not be permitted to overcome the rules so clearly enunciated.\nThe decision of the orphans\u2019 court of Philadelphia, in Ware\u2019s Est., 12 W. N. C. 571, also cited by him, has been reversed by tins court in Middleton\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 92.\nVan Vleck v. Lounsberry, 34 Hun, 569, was decided by a subordinate court. It does not appear to have been affirmed by the court of appeals, and even if it had been, is based upon a rule which has been repudiated by this court.\nJohn E. Kuhn, for appellee.\n\u2014 Mr. Park by his will vested the legal title to all his estate, real and personal, in his executors as trustees for the uses and purposes therein mentioned,- and by the terms of said will, Mrs. Leech\u2019s right and interest in Ms estate was specifically limited to the net Me\u00f3me arismg yearly from the residue of said real and personal estate; and when her father died, she was not entitled to any portion of the prmcipal of Ms estate; and if said trust is administered according to the directions of said testator, she will never receive any portion of the principal: Hubley\u2019s Est., 16 Phila. 327.\nThat advance in the value of securities is not Mcome therefrom but an accretion thereto, was held by the Supreme Court of the United States in Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63; Hill on Trustees, 175.\nIn Mudge v. Parker, 139 Mass. 153, it was held that profits received by trustees over and above interest on loans should be treated as capital and not as income: Middleton\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 92.\nJanuary 6, 1896:"
