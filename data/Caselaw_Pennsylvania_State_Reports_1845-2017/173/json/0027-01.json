T., 1895, by John Valentine Cartus, from order of Q. S. Allegheny Co., March T., 1895, No. 160, refusing a wholesale liquor license.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nPetition for wholesale liquor license.\nThe record showed that no remonstrances were filed against the applicant, and that he was indorsed by six hundred citizens.\nThe court indorsed on the petition the following order :\n\u201c This case having come on to be heard, the petitions in favor of the granting of said license were presented and witnesses also heard in behalf of said application: Whereupon the said petition and evidence were duly considered, and the court, from the evidence and our own knowledge of the location and the necessity of the case, being of opinion that the license applied for is not necessary for the accommodation of the public, said, license is now refused.\u201d\nError assigned was in refusing license.\nW. A. Hudson, of Hudson McCue, J. Scott Ferguson and H. McDowell with him, for appellant.\n\u2014 That a mere declaration upon the part of the court that from facts within its knowledge it deemed the license unnecessary for the accommodation of the public is not a judicial reason for refusing a license, unless the facts so claimed to be in the knowledge of the court are disclosed upon the record. Johnston\u2019s App., 156 Pa. 322; Kelminski\u2019s App., 164 Pa. 231.\nNo argument offered contra.\nJanuary 6, 1896 :"
