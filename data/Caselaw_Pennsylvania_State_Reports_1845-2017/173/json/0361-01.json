    "head_matter": "Samuel Huston, to the use of Charles P. Perot, Assignee, for the benefit of creditors, v. E. W. Clark, William Sellers and John Sellers, Jr., Appellants.\nEquity \u2014 Equity practice\u2014 Costs \u2014 Master's fee.\nWhere the Supreme Court affirms a decree of a court of equity and dismisses the appeal with costs, the master\u2019s fee is included in the costs to be paid by the appellant; and the fact that the specific amount of the fee is not ascertained at the time of decree does not change the conclusive effect of the decree.\nArgued Jan. 14, 1896.\nAppeal, No. 483, Jan. T., 1895, by defendants, from decree of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March T., 1882, No. 373, dismissing exceptions to taxation of costs.\nBefore Sterrett, C. J., Green, Williams, McCollum, Mitchell, Dean and Fell, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to taxation of costs in equity.\nFrom the record it appeared that a bill in equity was filed by the appellee against the appellants on May 13, 1882, claiming to be entitled to an interest in a certain new corporation which had been formed called \u201c The Midvale Steel Company,\u201d by virtue of an ownership which he had had in the property of a corporation known as \u201c The Midvale Steel Works,\u201d which had been purchased by the first named company. There was an alternative prayer for relief.\nUnder this bill a large amount of testimony was taken, for the purpose of establishing a resulting interest in said Midvale Steel Company on the part of the appellee. The Hon. Amos Briggs, as master, reported in favor of the existence of such interest and a form of decree that the appellee was entitled to the same.\nUpon exception to said report, filed February 7, 1888, it was decreed by the court of common pleas No. 1 that said exceptions should be sustained and that the bill should be dismissed.\nUpon appeal to this court by the appellee, it was decided that he had no interest in said Midvale Steel Company, but that he was entitled to an account of the receipts and disbursements of moneys by the appellants under a certain agreement which had been entered into between him and them.\nThe matter was then referred to Boies Penrose, Esq., as master, with directions to report such account. A large amount of testimony was taken by the appellee in support of his claim that he was entitled to have a sum of money.\nThe master reported in his favor, ordering the payment of $75,896.60.\nUnder exceptions to this report the court below held that all but one or two of the objections by the appellee, to the account rendered, were without foundation. It reduced the amount in his favor to the sum of $1,546.87, with interest from December 31, 1880, but decreed that costs should be paid. Both parties appealed to this court. Both appeals were dismissed.\nThe appellee filed a bill of costs which was taxed in his favor by the prothonotary in the amount of $7,441.62. This included a fee to the former master, Hon. Amos Briggs, of $3,000, which had been paid to him by the appellee many years before, and one to the second master, Boies Penrose, Esq., of $4,000. The fee of the latter included a charge in favor of an expert accountant whom he had employed.\nThe court below, upon appeal from this taxation, reduced the fee of the Hon. Amos Briggs to $2,000, and struck off the taxation of costs for printing, viz, $210, leaving an amount taxed against the appellants of $6,231.62.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to taxation of costs.\nJohn G. Johnson, Crawford & Loughlin with him, for appellants.\n\u2014 It is monstrous that after setting up against the appellants the claim which tins court denied, viz, that the appellee was interested in the Midvale Steel Company; after seeking,, without merit, as the court below and this court held, to sux charge them with an immense amount -of money; after subjecting them to a most vexatious, expensive and long continued litigation, without merit; and after he was found entitled to but $1,546.87, with interest, though he had been claiming hundreds of thousands of dollars, the appellants shall be compelled to pay master\u2019s fees to the extent of $6,000, occasioned almost exclusively by litigation over matters in which they have been held to be without blame.\nA. T. Freedley, for appellee.\n\u2014 Upon July 1, 1894, this court affirmed the decree of the court below, ordering that the costs should be paid by the defendants, and dismissed the appeal: Clark\u2019s App., 162 Pa. 435.\nIf the defendants desired to contend that they were not liable to this master\u2019s fee as costs, they should at that time have had the costs taxed before taking their appeal: Gibson v. Cummings, 25 Pa. 231.\nThe exact point was ruled by this court in Janes\u2019 App., 87 Pa. 428.\nJanuary 27, 1896:"
