To the cost of repairing, maintaining, operating and running the road, including the wages of all employees and the cost of all necessary materials, repairs to locomotives, and the cost of the customary car service. 2.

To pay any surplus remaining after the payments mentioned in items 1 and 2 to the party of the first part. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company further binds itself to keep accurate accounts of all the business, tonnage, receipts, revenues, expenses and disbursements of the leased road, which shall be subject to the examination of the president of the Danville, Hazleton &amp; Wilkes-Barre Railroad Company, which company shall also be furnished monthly with detailed statements showing the gross amount earned by the road and the receipts from passengers, from freights, from United States mails, and all other sources. In article 3 of the indenture it is agreed and understood that the intention is that the Pennsylvania Railroad Company shall use the Danville, Hazleton &amp; Wilkes-Barre Railroad for the control of the traffic by the Pennsylvania Railroad to and from New York over the Philadelphia &amp; Erie Railroad.</p>

The interest upon these bonds was represented by coupons. The present plaintiff, Henry G. Freeman, is the holder of certain of these coupons, amounting to $4,550. In his statement filed in this <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>case he avers that the defendant, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, guaranteed the payment of these coupons. This is an inaccurate statement, for the agreement and lease of February 21, 1872, between the two companies upon which the plaintiff relies shows conclusively that the defendant did not ■enter into any contract of guaranty with the plaintiff or with the holders of these bonds or coupons, nor into any contract whatever with them or with him. It was an entire stranger to the transaction and had no part in the agreement whatever. The arrangement made between the two companies was a private ■one which concerned nobody but themselves, and in which nobody but themselves had any part or voice whatever. The indebtedness represented by these bonds and coupons had been incurred and the bonds issued five years before the agreement entered into with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. They could not have been negotiated upon the credit of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, for that company had never in any way assumed any obligation for their payment.</p>

To establish this the plaintiff relies upon that class of cases in which it has been held that a person who is not a party to a contract may sometimes maintain an action upon it in his own name where he is the only one who is beneficially interested in its performance, and where the party with whom it was actually made has ceased to have any real interest in it.</p>

In later times the courts of law, borrowing a leaf, as they frequently did, from the records of the administration of justice by the courts of equity, recognized an exception to this general rule, holding that if one pay money to another for the use of a third person, or having money belonging to another, agree with that other to pay it to a third person, an action may be sustained by the only person beneficially interested; but that where the contract is for the benefit of the contracting party, and the third person is a stranger to the contract and the consideration, no action can be maintained by the third person, but only by the promisee.</p>

There have been cases perhaps in which the distinction has not been applied with entire exactness, and the tendency of which has been to obscure somewhat the just limits within which the rule may be properly applied.

If, on the other hand, a debt already exists from one person to another, a promise by a third person to pay such debt is for the benefit of the original debtor to whom it is made, and can only be released or enforced by him.
