And that would be a good defense to that claim, were it not that Mr. Weigley testifies that in 1892, at the time of this conversation in his office, Jas. Eorney promised to pay him for his services rendered in the case upon the settlement of Col. John W. Forney’s estate, the father of the present plaintiff.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b308-6" data-blocks='[["BL_308.6",308,[258,1128,1177,1166]]]'>Then comes the case called that of “ Mrs. E.” Gentlemen, there has been considerable discrepancy in the testimony between the plaintiff and the defendant in regard to that. The plaintiff rather taking position that nothing was done upon the part of the defendant that might be regarded in the nature of services. Gentlemen, you will have the correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant in relation to this matter of the claim of what they call Mrs. E., Mrs. Enger. According to my recollection, it opens by a letter from the plaintiff to the defendant in which he calls the defendant’s attention to the matter, saying he does not believe he can get rid of Mrs. Enger without a fight. I have the letter before me (reading). It says: “I anticipate that she will not give way without a fight, but by calm persuasion I think she will leave.” As Mr. Weigley by that time knew of the relations existing between the plaintiff and Mrs. Enger, and he had received a letter like that, it certainly was a call upon him to use the very best ability he possessed for the purpose of aiding the plaintiff to get rid of this woman, and it passes my understanding how the plaintiff can undertake to claim here that he did not call upon the defendant to render him any service when he wrote a letter like that. It seems that Mrs. Enger did go to the office of Mr. Weigley, and Mr. Weigley tells you that she made some claim.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.7",308,[258,2303,1172,85]],["BL_309.1",309,[143,354,1176,750]]]'>Just as Mr. Pettit told you to-day, it does not make much difference in a case like that whether or not the woman’s claim <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>is valid, if she has anything that would afford a pretense for a claim; because the important matter is not a legal determination of the contest between her and the man as to whether or not she has a legal claim, but it is as to not having any public exposition of it, and not have her bring any claim. If you believe the defendant in the case as to what he did in the matter of her having a claim, while she might not have had a claim of breach of promise or any other claim, yet I can readily understand that counsel getting a letter like that, and knowing of the relation existing between this man and this woman, might fear she would do it, because the ordinary experience of members of the bar is that such claims are very frequently made, and the man, as Mr. Pettit told you to-day, is always at a disadvantage. Mr. Weigley tells you he did perform the services in regard to that matter.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b309-5" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[137,1123,1179,1274]]]'>You then come to the question of the controversy between the plaintiff and his wife. There seems to be no doubt that was the case, because both the plaintiff and the defendant testify that there was some trouble between the plaintiff and his wife and that the wife did call upon Mr. Weigley. The wife is not called in the case, and therefore as to what occurred between the wife and Mr. Weigley you have no evidence except Mr. Weigley’s own testimony, and the wife could be called to contradict the defendant if Ms testimony is not to be relied upon, or if the plaintiff wished to contradict him. As she has not been called to contradict him, I think you may fairly take it Ms testimony is true, and could not be contradicted by the plaintiff, for the plaintiff had it in Ms own hands to do it, if he wished to. Mr. Weigley testified that the wife came to him and wanted to consult Mm with regard to a divorce, mentioning that the conduct of the plaintiff had been such as to entitle her to a divorce. Mr. Weigley says he told her that he was the counsel for her husband and could not represent her; she would have to have other counsel, but he would tell the husband about it, and he did tell the plaintiff about it. Then there seems to have been a number of interviews between them, and there was some paper drawn. Mr. Weigley tells you there were articles of separation drawn between the plaintiff and the wife, but that the matter however was finally blown over. That he was entitled to compensation for those services and his charge is $250.</p>

      <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>As to that item, the statute of limitations does not apply, because those services were rendered within a time, six years from the time of the bringing of the action, and therefore the statute could not be pleaded against it. [You are to determine, however, whether or not the plaintiff did render any services, and what is the value of the services; that is, with regard to every one of those items I have read to you except those items which have been agreed to. You are to determine, did the defendant render any services for the plaintiff, at the plaintiff’s request ?] [4] Then you are to say what is the fair value of those services. [Then you are to say as to those which would be barred by the statute of limitations, did the plaintiff within six years prior to the time of the filing of the plea in the case, which was upon January 5, 1894, promise the defendant to pay him for the services.] [5] If you so find, then you should find as to that item for the defendant. So you are to ascertain which of these items, if any, you will allow, and those you do allow you may add up together, because the date both counsel have agreed upon from which you are to count interest, I understand, is May 25,1893.</p>

The defense consisted of several counterclaims aggregating $3,940, for which amount, less credits of $905.12, including plaintiff’s claim in this action, the defendant, in the outset, claimed a certificate in his favor. During the trial, however, he withdrew by leave of court the last item, $2,000, of his counterclaim. The controversy was thus restricted to the remaining nine items, all of which were disputed, and as to some of them the statute of limitations was pleaded. The testimony was conflicting and presented a case that was clearly for the jury. It was submitted to them with instructions which appear to be substantially correct and adequate, and a verdict in favor of plaintiff for $322.95, was returned.
