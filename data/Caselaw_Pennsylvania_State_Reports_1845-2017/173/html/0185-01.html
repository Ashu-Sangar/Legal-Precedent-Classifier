For the year prior to his death $22,000; for the ten years after his death about $11,000. The market value of the interest fell from $200,000 at the time of his death to about $50,000 ten years after his death. <em>Held, </em>that the additional legacies to testator’s sistefs were payable only out of the profits of the Casting Company, and that the contingency upon which they were payable had not happened.</p>

And the trustee declined payment solely on the ground that under the facts within his knowledge he did not think that the condition on which the legacies were payable had been fulfilled, and that the discretion vested in him was exercised only in determining that question.</p>

This was the scheme of disposition of his estate as it existed at the date of his death, and these the preferred objects of his bounty. There is nothing necessarily inconsistent with this disposition in the provision of payment of additional legacies to his sisters. Why make them contingent upon continuance of profits, or, indeed, why refer to profits at all, unless as the source of payment ? It is conceded that had testator’s interest in the Pittsburg Steel Casting Company become unprofitable within ten years after his death, his primary <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>scheme of disposition would have become absolute; but why should the mere fact of continuance of profits, however small, subject the provision which testator had expressly made for his only son to further reduction on account of any deficiency in profits in favor of his sisters? Would the son need any less because of this fact ? There is no apparent reason for such construction. These legacies would, by the terms of the will, become payable, if at all, because of the continuance, and by necessary implication, out of the profits.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[165,827,1176,444]]]'>The obvious intent was, that they should be paid if the business should continue sufficiently profitable to justify payment. The profits had been extraordinarily large during testator’s lifetime; and had they so continued for ten years, the estate might well afford payment without embarrassment to the business, or impairing the provision which testator had made for his widow and son. This construction alone harmonizes with testator’s original scheme of division of the corpus of his estate and with his manifest intent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[166,1290,1176,404]]]'>The question of fact then is, whether or not testator’s interest in the Pittsburg Steel Casting Company continued sufficiently profitable for the ten years which elapsed after his death to justify payment of these additional legacies. The trustee, who is in a peculiarly advantageous position to judge intelligently, and to whom the decision of this question was primarily left, has refused payment; and, so far as appears, he is amply justified by the facts adduced.</p>

If the legacies are now to be paid, the necessary result must be a serious change in the scheme of division which testator in the first instance expressly declared, largely increase the already generous provision made for these sisters, and correspondingly impair the inheritance intended for his only son. At most, this, construction is but a bare implication, and must yield to the manifest intent.</p>
