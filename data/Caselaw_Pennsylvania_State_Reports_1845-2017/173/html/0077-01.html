The consideration was $2,050, to be paid in monthly installments. It was not fully paid until 13th of May, 1889, when a deed was executed by Mellon, in the name of Margaret alone. Margaret died 2d of April, 1891.</p>

These were sold and she moved to the city and lived with Margaret until her death. According to the testimony of Mrs. Isabella Miller, the witness had a consultation about the purchase. Sarah at first was not in favor of it for fear they might not be able to make the payments, but yielded when Margaret suggested that the rents would pay the interest, and once in awhile they could make payments.</p>

Margaret further told her that she and Sarah both made the first payment, and after the business paid, (the grocery store) they took the money out of it and paid Mellon. Margaret told me that the money derived from the sale of live stock by Sarah went into the grocery business.</p>

Simpson testified: That he was their family physician, that in a conversation with Margaret in March, 1890, she spoke of the store and property (the house and lot) and said they had it in common, and whichever should die first, the other one should have that property. Margaret spoke of Sarah as being a cripple and in delicate health, and said that she would never want for anything from the fact that they held this property as I have stated before, (that is, in common.) She did not say anything about the deed, but that they held the property in common.</p>

Patterson is in reference to conversations with the plaintiff, when she was making claims against the estate of Margaret. He was attorney for the estate. When he learned she was setting up claims against the estate which might be contested, he should have advised her to consult another attorney. To encourage her to state her case, and then appear as a witness against her to detail her statements, was, to say the .least, imprudent, if not a breach of professional confidence. But his testimony in no way contradicts or impeaches the testimony of the witnesses to the declarations of Margaret. There is no evidence that Sarah, during the life of Margaret, knew that the deed was in her name alone. At the time of the conversations with Mr. Patterson she may not have known that she had any right to claim a share in the property. We have not her testimony in the case, because of her feeble condition as explained by her counsel. The case, therefore, does not rest, m whole or in part, on her testimony. It is entirely on the testimony of disinterested witnesses.</p>
