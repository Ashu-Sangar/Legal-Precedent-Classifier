Subsequently a contract in writing was entered into between defendants as party of the first part, and plaintiffs as parties of the second part, which .contained the following recitals: “ The said parties of the second part have assisted in the development of, and are informed as to a part of the secret used in the process of manufacturing the steel known and put upon the market as ‘ Sterling Double Special.’ The said parties of the first part wish to protect such part of <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>said sem-et, and <em>so </em>protect their manufacture of steel.” The plaintiffs were to receive one cent per pound “ for eveiy pound of said steel made, sold and collected for, so long as said secret is not discovered and similar steel made and sold on the market by others.” The evidence showed that plaintiffs were' not the sole inventors or discoverers of the process. Defendants made another steel for the purposes of projectiles which was low in carbon and high in chromium. The process by which the oxide of <em>chromium </em>was reduced was the same as that by which it was reduced in the manufactm-e of “Double Special.” The physical characteristics of the product were wholly dissimilar, the “ Double Special ” being useless for making projectiles. The “Double Special” was high in carbon and low in chromium and very hard and brittle. The projectile steel was low in carbon and high in chromium, and had great cohesion on impact. <em>Held, </em>(1) that the fact that the oxide of chromium was reduced into metallic chromium by the same process in the manufactui-e of both kinds of steel did not make the two kinds of steel similar steels within the meaning of the contract; (2) that plaintiffs were not entitled to receive one cent per pound for the projectile steel manufactured by defendants.</p>

In 1889, plaintiffs undertook to assist in introducing into defendants’ factories a process whereby could be turned out a self hardening steel. Mr. Wheeler, president of the Sterling Steel Company, had been a practical steel worker for many years, and had tried to make a high carbon steel containing not less than three per cent of. carbon, but had failed in securing the desired results; on making his unsuccessful efforts known to Dr. Slocum, oné of plaintiffs, Slocum suggested a method by which the experiments theretofore made by Wheeler, if carried further by chemical combination suggested by him, would result in success, but he declined to give his personal attention to the matter for want of time, and named Mr. Todd as one capable of taking charge of the operation as an assistant. Todd assented, and spent at Mr. Wheeler’s .works some time in experiments, with a satisfactory result. The manufacture of this quality of steel was then begun by defendants, and was named “ Sterling Double Special Steel.” In their advertisements and labels, defendants described it by that name. The special quality of the steel made by this process, consisted in the high amount of carbon and low amount of chromium it carried, so that while it could be chilled or hardened at a low red heat, it would withstand in forging, without <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>injury, a high red heat, and still be very tough in the hardened state. It was especially and to a great extent only valuable as tool steel.</p>

    <p id="b145-9" data-blocks='[["BL_145.11",145,[111,1991,1169,297]]]'>They were to pay for the “ Double Special ” and for “ this steel,” alone; that is, a steel of the same nature or character, into the manufacture of which the new process entered; they were to cease paying, if a similar steel, that is, one resembling it in quality, were put upon the market by others, without regard to the process entering into its production.</p>

    <p id="b146-4" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[282,818,1166,803]]]'>In other words, the manifest intent of the parties was, that defendants should pay only so long as the monopoly lasted, by reason of the secret process of which Slocum and Todd were in part informed; and it is the plain implication that Slocum and Todd did not longer intend to exact payment. In view of the agreement, it is not material that the reduction of oxide of chromium by the use of aluminum was known by some chemists and "metallurgists in Europe before Mr. Todd’s experiments; the parties contracted on the assumption the 'method was not known, or at least not in use in this country; and the introduction of a small amount of silicon into the process seems to have been first suggested by Mr. Todd. But that the larger part of the product of defendants, after May, 1893, so far as the proportions of carbon and chromium were concerned, was entirely different from that of “ Sterling Double Special Steel,” cannot for a moment be doubted, in view of the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b146-5" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[283,1632,1165,757]],["BL_147.1",147,[116,339,1166,657]]]'>Mr. Todd testifies, the peculiarity of “Double Special Steel ” was “ that it would carry a much larger percentage of carbon than ever had been attained, if necessary; ” that, according to the comparative tests made by him and Wheeler of Wheeler’s best grade of steel and the “ Double Special,” the latter running very high in carbon, was not as brittle as the Wheeler steel; further that defendants advertised the “ Double Special ” as containing more carbon than any other steel known or invented. Mr. Wheeler testifies, that the “Double Special” was of three grades, A, B, and C, the first containing 3J per cent of carbon, the second 2J and the third 2 per cent; that by the “ Double Special ” process, he made projectiles from each of these grades, and on a test made by the government every one proved an absolute failure; they possessed no cohesiveness or toughness; they then went on experimenting with projectiles, and finally <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>were successful by using ten or fifteen times as much chromium as in the “ Double Special,” and making them low in carbon instead of high. This steel was the complete antagonism of the “Double Special,” so far as concerned the proportions of chemical elements contained in it. The oxide of chromium, however, used in its manufacture, was reduced to a metallic state by the use of aluminum and carbon, as in the manufacture of “Double Special.” The method, in one particular, of reaching the manufactured product, was more than similar, it was the same, while the physical characteristics of the product were wholly dissimilar; “ Double Special ” being noted for its brittleness, and therefore was worthless as a projectile. Nor is there any evidence tending to contradict these facts.</p>
    <p id="b147-3" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[112,1004,1168,1318]],["BL_148.1",148,[275,335,1163,96]]]'>We have, then, as tending to show the projectile steel is “ Sterling Double Special,” the fact that the particular method of reducing the oxide of chromium to a metallic state in the “ Double Special,” was also used in the manufacture of the projectile; but then, we have on the other side the opposing facts, that, by the use of opposite proportions of carbon and chromium, an exactly opposite quality of steel resulted; the “ Double Special ” was worthless for projectiles, the projectile steel was worthless for tools. Clearly, this product was not what they meant by “ should this steel be made and sold under any other name.” It was not the “Double Special” which was advertised to possess the distinctive quality of being high in carbon and low in chromium, for it was low in the first and high in the last. To have sold it as such, after the characteristics of the “ Double Special ” were established, would have been a fraud upon the public. We are clearly of the opinion that a fair construction of this contract, in view of the undisputed evidence, relieves defendants from any liability to account to plaintiffs for any projectile steel as “ Sterling Double Special Steel.” This, not because other parties had put upon the market “ similar steel,” but because projectile steel was not, by the contract, “ this steel,” that is, “ Sterling Double Special.” The evidence as to other parties putting on the market similar steel projectiles, is immaterial; the projectiles made by defendants not being the “ Sterling Double Special Steel,” or “this steel” under another name, as specified in the contract, their non-<a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>liability to pay arises not from a right to cease paying, but because no liability to pay ever commenced.</p>
    <p id="b148-4" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[271,438,1166,401]]]'>What we have said is just as applicable to the steel known as “ C. Y. W.’s Choice ” and “ C. Y. Wheeler’s Choice.” Under the contract and uncontroverted facts, neither brand was “ Sterling Double Special Steel.” They were wholly different in every essential quality necessary to identification with the “ Double Special,” and defendants owe no account for them to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs have a right to claim only for the use of and keeping secret the process in making “ Sterling Double Special Steel.”</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[269,846,1166,1511]]]'>The error of the court below is, in holding to one mark alone as sufficient to identity the steel manufactured by defendants as “ Double Special Steel ” under the contract. As an illustration, take the testimony of Mr. Clapp, a chemist and expert called by plaintiffs; he testified that two steels, possessing by analysis entirely different proportions of chemical elements, one high in carbon and low in chromium, the other high in chromium and low in carbon; one very hard and brittle, the other having great cohesion on impact, yet, if in the manufacture of both, chromium oxide were reduced into metallic chromium, by the same process, the steels would be the same. Although there was much expert testimony contradictory of this view, the court below adopted it as the correct one from which to determine the liability of defendants to account. It may be, among chemists, technically correct to fix the sameness of a manufactured product by a single part of the process entering into its manufacture, without regard to the chemical analysis, its physical characteristics, or its fitness for the purpose intended, but the parties here did not contract on expert opinion of chemists as to what, though widely different, would scientifically be the same. Wheeler had striven for a very hard tool steel; the plaintiffs effectually aided him in producing it; then, it was agreed this production should be put upon the market as “ Sterling Double Special Steel,” and plaintiffs should be paid one cent per pound, not only for the double special, but for “ this steel ” under any other name. The “ Double Special ” was not sold under any other name. The learned judge lost sight of the manifest intention of the parties as evidenced by the undisputed facts and their language in the contract, when he made the issue to turn on a technical definition.</p>

      <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>Therefore, the decree which directs defendants to account for projectile steel, “ C. Y. W.’s Choice,” and “ C. Y. Wheeler’s Choice,” is reversed and set aside. In so far as said decree directs an accounting under the contract for “ Sterling Double Special Steel ” the decree is affirmed, and an accounting directed under the contract in accordance with our interpretation of it.</p>
