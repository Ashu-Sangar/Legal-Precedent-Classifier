    <p id="ACv" data-blocks='[["BL_483.5",483,[107,405,1166,248]]]'>— The testimony shows, and the referee finds in accordance therewith, that every part of the property in question is devoted to the uses of a purely public charity, and nothing but clear error will justify an appellate court in setting aside a master’s finding of facts: Burton’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=98%20Pa.%20220" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="98 Pa. 220">98 Pa. 220</a>.</p>
    <p id="b483-3" data-blocks='[["BL_483.6",483,[106,663,1170,554]]]'>The cases cited in appellants’ paper-book, viz. Philadelphia v. Barber, <a href="/pa/160/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="160 Pa. 123" data-case-ids="852129" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0123-01">160 Pa. 123</a>, where a separate building away from church premises was rented out by a church that drew a revenue therefrom, and American Sunday School Union v. Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/161/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="161 Pa. 307" data-case-ids="854202" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0307-01">161 Pa. 307</a>, where a portion of the building was used as a store in which books were sold at a profit, do not apply to the case at bar, where every portion of the building is accessible to .the public, and is at some time or other used as a shelter for the destitute, and where the restaurant in which the food is sold at a rate less than the cost of furnishing, is not an affair conducted for profit but as a charity.</p>
    <p id="b483-4" data-blocks='[["BL_483.7",483,[103,1226,1172,606]]]'>The exemption is not claimed on the ground that the property in question is a parsonage, as in Church v. Montg. Co., <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.N.C.%20170" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="10 W.N.C. 170">10 W. N. C. 170</a>, cited by the appellants, but because the entire property, even by the rooms at times occupied by the deaconesses, is given up to the use of a purely public charity. The testimony shows and the referee found that there was no severance of the property, but that the whole of it was put to the uses of charity and is wholly free from any element of private gain. These facts certainly bring the case within the decisions in Philadelphia v. Women’s Christian Association, <a href="/pa/125/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="125 Pa. 572" data-case-ids="563953" data-case-paths="/pa/125/0572-01">125 Pa. 572</a>, and County v. Lafayette College, <a href="/pa/128/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="128 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="567106" data-case-paths="/pa/128/0132-01">128 Pa. 132</a>, and exempt the property from taxation.</p>

The next four assignments are to each paragraph of the decree, respectively; and the sixth and last is to the decree as a whole. In view of the learned referee’s findings of fact, which were confirmed by the court below, we are of opinion that there is no error in the decree, or in any part thereof, that requires reversal or modification.</p>
