This conveyance had been made before the indorsement of the note in suit which was the last of a series of renewal notes, all indorsed by defendant. The plaintiff with other creditors entered into an agreement to pool the securities held by each of them, and to divide the proceeds thereof pro rata. Plaintiff claimed that defendant knew of this agreement by which the property held as security was turned over to the syndicate before he indorsed the note. The defendant denied thathe knew anything about it until the maturity of the note. The testimony tended to show that the property turned into the pool was not sufficient to pay the debt other than the note which the maker owed to plaintiff. The evidence showed that the pool retained the securities for some time, paying the taxes and interest upon a mortgage, and that subsequently a portion of the property was sold at a loss. The whole case was left to the jury, and a verdict and judgment rendered for plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>

P. Bell and indorsed by S. W. Hill. The original note was dated November 16, 1892, and was for $4,500. The last note, being the note in suit, was dated March 22, 1894, and was for $8,000. Hill was an accommodation indorser upon all of the notes. In addition to the $3,000 note in suit, Bell borrowed from Denniston, the plaintiff, $15,450, which made Bell’s total indebtedness to him $18,450. It did not appear at the trial of this case when Bell borrowed from Denniston the $15,450, nor did it appear what obligations he held for it. By deed dated March 18, 1893, F. P. Bell conveyed to Joseph F. Denniston, the plaintiff, a property, known as the Fahnestock Homestead, situate in the 21st ward, Pittsburg, as collateral security for the $18,450 he owed him, which included the $3,000 note in suit. Bell was indebted to other parties in large sums to whom he had assigned property as collateral security for his debts. Bell had also left, with C. C. Davis, cashier of the Central Bank of Pittsburg, the notes of Kenneweg &amp; Co., a solvent firm, composed of F. P. Bell and C. F. Kenneweg, wholesale grocers of Cumberland, Md., to the amount of $40,000. Bell also gave to J. H. White, Esq., a mortgage for $10,000, which was assigned to C. C. Davis, cashier. The $40,000 of Kenneweg <em>&amp; Go. </em>notes and the $10,000 mortgage were left with Davis, cashier, that is, with the Central Bank as collateral security for the whole of Bell’s indebtness, including the debt of Mrs. Nannie C.

    <p class="summary" id="b656-6" data-blocks='[["BL_656.5",656,[253,573,1165,348]]]'>That transaction amounted just simply to this, in my view of it.

It is not claimed that the property was worth more than $22,000. That was the price that was given by Mr. Fahnestock. I do not think any person testified to its being worth more than that. His testimony was that the house was worth about $15,000, and the lots worth $8,900. If the house was worth $15,000 it would make it about $23,000 or $24,000. But he said the house before the improvements were put on by Bell was worth $10,000. That would only make it about $18,900, and then there were certain improvements put on by Bell. He did not know the value of them, but understood from Bell they were about $5,000; it appears however that the $5,000 was not all improvements upon the property, but included personal matters put in the house by Bell, and therefore probably the fair value of. the house would be $22,000. I do not know that any person testified to more than that; I do not remember of any one. But that was sub<a id="p637" href="#p637" data-label="637" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*637</a>ject to a $13,000 mortgage, which had two years of unpaid interest, as I understand, at the time, which would make about $15,000, leaving about $7,000 as the amount that it would be worth, taking it at its highest value.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b657-5" data-blocks='[["BL_657.5",657,[129,555,1168,196]]]'>Now, did the turning of this over by Denniston to the syndicate injure Hill. Because the mere turning over of the properly is not a defense unless it appears that by doing so there was an injury done to the defendant in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b657-6" data-blocks='[["BL_657.6",657,[128,759,1168,503]]]'>For instance, suppose a man has a debt of $10,000, and he has security upon which there is a surety, and also has security for $1,000. The relinquishing of the $1,000 only releases the surety to the extent of that $1,000; and if it was actual money then there would be no question at all about it. But tins being property, it is for you to determine whether or not Mr. Hill was injured, and in order to do that you have to find what the amount of this security was. According to my own figuring, taking the $22,000, it would not be worth, at all events, more than $7,000, to Major Denniston.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b657-7" data-blocks='[["BL_657.7",657,[127,1271,1167,196]]]'>[Now comes another question. It is claimed here that the defendant, Colonel Hill, is entitled to his proportion of that $7,000, that is supposing that you fix the amount at $7,000. I merely give you that as an illustration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b657-8" data-blocks='[["BL_657.8",657,[123,1475,1170,748]]]'>Say that the security was worth to Denniston $7,000, then Hill would be entitled to his proportion as $3,000 is to $18,450. I do not view the law that way. A person having security for a debt, and having a portion of it secured by a surety, is bound to act in good faith to the surety, but he is not bound to give him the advantages that he has. He is simply bound to treat him fairly, and therefore, if he has a loan as in this case of $18,450, and has a surety for $3,000, of that, and security for $7,000, he is not bound to give that to the surety. He has a right to protect himself, because he has the whole of it as his security. He has not only the collateral, but he has the suretyship of the party to protect himself, unless the properly had been given over to him specifically for that indebtness, or including that indebtness for which the surety was liable.</p>

Therefore, unless the property was sufficient to pay the debt for which Mr. Hill was responsible, he is not injured by this transaction.] [5] I do not know that I can make that any plainer.</p>

In the first place, I think that Mr. Hill had an interest under this agreement, as I will tell you hereafter. If, however, when he in<a id="p639" href="#p639" data-label="639" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*639</a>dorsed this last note, the note now in suit, he knew of this agreement and assented to it, then he would only, of course, have his rights under this agreement.</p>

But still, as I said in the first instance, that may be an important question, or it may be of no importance, because, if Mr. Hill was not injured by the original transfer, then he comes under this agreement, and whether he knew it or not he is entitled to whatever rights he may have under this agreement.</p>

This agreement recites that Bell was indebted to Denniston $18,450, including this $3,000 note; that he owed Mrs. Denniston $3,200; he owed the bank $26,500; he owed Adler $2,500; he owed B,eighard as indorser $21,500; making a total of $72,150, including this $3,000 note indorsed by Hill. Now whether this statement, “ Whereas Denniston holds as security for a portion of said indebtedness a deed of property,” whether that refers to the fact that he only had security for a portion of said indebtedness due to him, or whether it refers to a portion of the entire indebtedness of $72,150 is a matter that is not, it seems to me, material, because the entire indebtedness fixed by this agreement is $72,150. It is not disputed that that includes the note indorsed by Hill. It recites all of the other liabilities and securities, and then comes the agreement upon which there is some difference of opinion, and as to which I differ from counsel somewhat: <a id="p640" href="#p640" data-label="640" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*640</a>“ Whereas, in further security of all of said indebtedness ”— that means all the entire $72,150 — “ and indorsements, said Bell has turned over to C. C. Davis, cashier of the bank aforesaid, notes, ” etc., these Kenneweg notes and the $10,000 mortgage. It is insisted by counsel that that means that prior to the making of this agreement he had turned these notes over, the Kenneweg notes and the stock, etc., and the mortgage. I do not so understand it. I think that this agreement is entirely consistent with the testimony of Mr. Reighard and Major Dennis-ton that those were turned over in pursuance of this agreement. That is, it was a part of the agreement, and although it may have been turned over a minute, or a day, or two or three days, before the paper was actually signed, it was a part of this negotiation, because all the negotiations leading up to an agreement are a part of it. Therefore, this agreement does not show that this was turned over to them prior to and independently of this arrangement. In my judgment, and under the testimony of Mr. Reighard and Mr. Denniston it was a part of the same transaction. But however it was turned over, it was turned over as security for the entire indebtedness, including the $3,000 note, and therefore Hill had an interest in that, just as much as the others.</p>

I do not understand either that these parties under this agreement did not all give up their individual security just as Major Denniston did. They agreed to pool them all, and this was done with the consent of Bell, and could not have been done without his consent, because they had no right to use property put in their hands for security for any other purpose than what he gave it to them for.</p>

Or ought they to have disposed of it at once and taken the sacrifice, whatever there might have been in it ? If they acted as prudent men would have acted, then they certainly cannot be held responsible for any misfortune that would arise, because where a man acts honestly with the best intentions for himself, he-being the first interested, a person who is incidentally interested • certainly has no right to complain.</p>

It is alleged that they have disposed of the Kenneweg notes, and that they have made a large loss upon those notes, and that this was done with the consent of Major Denniston. It is claimed that this property is in the hands .of <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>a trustee, and that Davis was the trustee, but it seems, by the testimony that Mr. Bidall has charge of this in some way as trustee or manager. He is not strictly a trustee, he is rather the agent of these parties. But it appears that this transaction in relation to the Kenneweg notes was transacted with the knowledge, and I believe with the active participation of Major Denniston; because he testifies that after tins property was acquired, one share of it was given to him and one to Bidall, in order to enable them to act as directors of the corporation. He says they did act, that they investigated the matter and finally disposed of the property, and as I understand, it was disposed of upon the recommendation of Major Denniston himself. At all events, I do not see that he is not responsible with the others for any mismanagement in that respect, and therefore you come down to inquire whether or not the evidence shows that there was any mismanagement to the injury of the defendant in this case. .If there was, then to the extent of that injury he would have a defense to this note.</p>

If it was worth more than $16,000 and they ought to have known it and ought to have received more' than $16,000, then they are responsible for the difference, and the defendant here would bé entitled to his proportion of that difference, as a credit upon this note. For instance, suppose that it was worth its face value, there would be $24,000 of a-loss on that security which was made with the consent of MajorDenniston. That would-be one third of the $72,000, and therefore Colonel Hill would be entitled to a credit of one third upon this note, which was secured, as I have instructed you, by this-agreement, because Major Denniston had allowed .this $24,000.’ to go out of liis control.

One of the errors alleged is the affirmance of plaintiff’s fifth request for instructions. Five of the others are the refusal of the court to affirm defendant’s requests for instructions,' recited therein respectively; and the remaining three are to portions of the learned judge’s general charge. Our examination of the record has not convinced us that any of these specifications should be sustained; nor do we think that either of them requires discussion. As to the question, whether the defendant indorsed the note in suit with knowledge of the circumstances connected with the transfer of certain property, etc., to the so-called syndicate, the testimony was conflicting, but we think it was sufficient to justify the submission of that ques<a id="p645" href="#p645" data-label="645" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*645</a>tion to the jury as was clone in that part of the charge recited in the 9th specification of error. Referring to that transaction the learned judge' said, inter alia: “ If he (the defendant) knew it before the note was indorsed by him, and indorsed it with full knowledge of that fact, he would, of course, have no right to complain. It would be a substantial assent to the arrangement, and therefore he was not injured.” There is nothing in this, or in any of the instructions to the jury, of which the defendant has just reason to complain. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.</p>
