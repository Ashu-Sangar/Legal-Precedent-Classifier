The ledge had also become worn, therebyincreasingthe danger of the displacement of the grate. These defects were not apparent, and could not have been seen by any one on the pavement. The grate projected half an inch <a id="p551" href="#p551" data-label="551" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*551</a>above the surface of the pavement, and had on two or three occasions been displaced by passers-by who struck it with their feet, but no one had been injured. The defendant requested the court to charge that in the absence of actual or implied notice of the condition of the hole, the city was not bound to examine it in order to ascertain its condition, and that notice of its defective condition could not be implied if the defect could not be seen without removing the cover and making an examination, and that in the absence of notice the city was not bound to do this. <em>Held, </em>that such instruction should have been given.</p>

That is not proved by the plaintiff simply proving that she stepped on tins grating and the grating tilted and she went down. That does not of itself make out a case of negligence against the city of Philadelphia. If the action were against the occupant of the premises, or perhaps against the owner, that might, of itself be sufficient evidence of negligence, but that is not true with regard to the city of Philadelphia. The city of Philadelphia is bound to provide highways ordinarily safe, and the pavement is as necessary to the highway as the cartway. In other words, the city of Philadelphia is bound to furnish ordinarily safe streets. When the street is ordinarily safe, in order to hold the city of Philadelphia liable for any defects which subsequently occur, the city must have either actual notice of the defect, or else the defect must have been of such a character and of sufficiently long standing as the city must be presumed to have had notice.] [5]</p>
