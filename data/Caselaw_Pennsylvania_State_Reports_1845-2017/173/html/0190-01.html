The gift, however, being general, gave those in remainder no title to any specific property, but implied conversion into cash, which referred the value of the corpus to the date of the testator’s death. Had the gift to Mrs. Leech been legal as well as equitable, that value would have been the measure of her liability to those in remainder and the source of the income and profits beneficially intended for her. Investment and reinvestment would have been in her control and for her sole benefit. Those in remainder would have had no interest further than the safety of this corpus and its payment at her death. This being conceded, why should the mere separation of legal and equitable estate imply any change in her beneficial estate ? The obvious purpose of separation was to vest in the trustee the duty of administration of the trust estate. The gift of the beneficial interest was as absolute as though coupled with a legal estate. It was no greater or less because of the separation. In either event the trust estate would consist at the beginning of cash, and Mrs. Leech, by the terms of the will, be entitled to whatever “ income and profits ” it might earn during her life. The direction given by the testator to invest and reinvest necessar rily had reference to cash as its subject; for the will spoke as of his death. Had bond been required of the trustee, that must have been the basis upon which its amount would have been fixed and the measure of liability to those in remainder. If the testator had manifested an intent that the fund should be in<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>vested in the purchase of lands and thereby work a conversion, any increase in value of the lands must, it is conceded, have inured to the benefit of the remainder: In re Gerry’s Accts., <a href="/ny/103/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="103 N.Y. 445" data-case-ids="2205025" data-case-paths="/ny/103/0445-01">103 N. Y. 445</a>. But there is no such intent apparent upon the face of the will; on the contrary, the direction to invest and reinvest evinces a temporary holding, and negatives any change in the nature of the fund. But however this may be, the investment made here was, in fact, of part of the corpus in a mere temporary security, and it is too plain for argument that the purchase of the mortgaged land under foreclosure proceedings was not a reinvestment. The trust estate was creditor to the extent of the mortgage debt, and the trustee must have accepted tender of the amount at any time before delivery of the deed. The proceeding was simply a process for collection, and part of the necessary duty of the administration of the trust estate: Oeslager v. Fisher, <a href="/pa/2/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Pa. 467" data-case-ids="951173" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0467-01">2 Pa. 467</a>. The purchase did not work conversion into realty. The investment retained its character of personalty, and the trustee had the same power over the land as he had over the mortgage. When the amount of the investment had been restored, what more could be claimed on behalf of those in remainder ? Speaking from the death of testator, that was the amount which the will gave them. If Mrs. Leech would have been entitled to ten, twenty, or any larger percentage, reserved in the mortgage, as must be- conceded, as income and profit, why not earnings resulting from process of collection by foreclosure ? If she is entitled to six per cent out of those earnings, why not to all ? It is impossible to understand why the earnings retained by the trustee are not as much “ income and profits ” as that paid to Mrs.' Leech. If it was right to pay her six per cent out of these earnings, the whole earnings logically belonged to her; for they are equally income and profits. which sprang from the mortgage investment. It is obviously immaterial how the earnings arise; it is enough that they were the income of the fund invested to give Mrs. Leech the right to them. It is said that “ because a loss would have fallen on both the remainder-men and life tenant it is but equitable they should both participate if there be a profit in the same proportion as they would bear to the loss.” This rule logically carried out would enable a trustee to create a contingent fund of any profits, whether interest, dividends, or such as the present, and thus <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>defeat the expressed intent of the testator. But suppose no loss should ever occur, to whom should these admitted profits belong ? If profits, the remainder-men could make no claim; and Mrs. Leech would be beyond the need of them. The true test of the equities of the parties must be found in the will; and that gave Mrs. Leech “ all the income and profits ” during life, and the principal to her children at her death. Loss of part of the corpus, when it happens, is a question of administration which the trustee must answer. If it result from his negligence, he must make it good; if not, he is entitled to credit on the principal; but in any event neither he nor the remainder-men can make her income security for hypothetical losses: Gerry’s Accts., <a href="/ny/103/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="103 N.Y. 445" data-case-ids="2205025" data-case-paths="/ny/103/0445-01">supra.</a> The testator having specified the deductions which he intended should be made, thereby excluded all others, and made the net “income and profits” the absolute property of Mrs. Leech. It may well be that if, as has been suggested, a loss had happened in one of these investments, it could have been made up out of gain in the other; for the amounts invested were but parts of a single estate, and the purpose and result of its administration must have been the same, whether the investments have been in several or one sum; the estate and its administration should be treated as entireties. But there was in fact no impairment of principal, and therefore no such question can arise here.</p>

Y. 445</a>, cited for the trustee, was made to turn upon a question of construction. “ The theory of the will,” said that court, “ did not contemplate any traffic in securities by the trustee, but a permanent investment in interest-bearing obligations, subject to be sold or exchanged only when the exigencies of the trust required <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>it to be done. It is quite clear that the life tenant could not have compelled the trustee to sell or convert securities lawfully-purchased or held upon the ground that their market value had appreciated in their hands any more than they could have compelled her to make good any depreciation in the value of such securities. Their acquisition and retention was one of the objects contemplated by the will of the testator, and was essential to execute his design, and a proceeding to compel their sale would plainly have been contrary to his intent in creating the trust.” The court expressly distinguished this from that class of cases in which temporary investments in stocks or trade have been authorized. It was admitted that Ware’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20W.N.C.%20571" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="12 W.N.C. 571">12 W. N. C. 571</a>, also cited for the trustee, has been reversed: Middleton’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/108/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="108 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="539275" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0092-01">108 Pa. 92</a>; and Hubley’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Phila.%20327" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="16 Phila. 327">16 Phila. 327</a>, like Gerry’s Accts., <a href="/ny/103/0445-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="103 N.Y. 445" data-case-ids="2205025" data-case-paths="/ny/103/0445-01">supra,</a> appears to have involved a question of distribution of the proceeds of sale of property specially given wherein the natural increase was held to belong to the remainder.</p>

The gift being, not of specific property, but general and residuary in its character, the measure of the remainder is its value at the date of testator’s death, and that of the life estate the increase thereafter; it follows that the amounts invested in mortgage, which were admittedly parts of the estate at testator’s death, should be treated as the corpus; and the residue, in the hands of the trustees arising from foreclosure as belonging to Mrs. Leech, as “income and profit” within the “purpose and intent” of Mr. Park’s will.</p>
