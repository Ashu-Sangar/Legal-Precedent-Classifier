Williams, the plaintiff, was and had been engaged in the mercantile business in Kittanning, Pa., and while carrying on said business had become involved and indebted to a considerable extent for goods purchased for said business. When suits were brought against him prior to said June 14, 1884, he pleaded “infancy” to certain claims, and thereupon Jas. A. Reed and A. D. Sharp, partners as Reed, Beatty &amp; Co., creditors of said Williams, proceeded against him by warrant of arrest under the act of assembly of July 12, 1842, entitled “ An act to abolish imprisonment for debt, and to punish fraudulent debtors,” P. L. page 339. The fraud alleged was that said Williams “ had falsely, and with intent to defraud the plaintiffs, represented before he purchased the goods that he was a person of full age, and having received said goods upon such false and fraudulent representations, now refuses to pay for said goods on the ground that he is a minor, and therefore not responsible for the same.” In this proceeding a warrant of arrest against the said Williams was duly issued by the Hon. James B. Neale, president judge of Armstrong county, on May 27, 1884, and Williams was arrested on the same day. The hearing in &lt;the matter was postponed until June 16, 1884, and the defendant ordered to give bail for his appearance in the sum of $400, which bail was duly given. On June 13, 1884, Williams filed an affidavit of defense wherein he says that the statements of the plaintiff in the petition in the proceeding just referred to “ are wholly false and untrue, except as much thereof as states <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>the amount of defendant’s indebtedness, which is correct; which indebtedness was incurred in the usual course of business without any fraud or falsehood either in fact or intention; and that this deponent has never yet entered any plea of minority to the suit mentioned in the said complaint, and this deponent further avers that he has the right to plead minority and the same would be no reason for the proceeding in this case. And he therefore prays that the whole proceeding may be dismissed at the costs of the complainants.”</p>

On June 14, 1884, the said Williams, while in debt and under arrest as aforesaid, executed and delivered to It. B. Ivory, Esq., his attorney in the proceedings just mentioned, a deed of assignment which will be found attached as exhibit “A” to the bill in this ease, and is in the form of a deed of general and voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors. This deed was duly recorded in the office of recorder of deeds for Armstrong county within thirty days after the execution thereof, appraisers were duly appointed on the petition of said assignee on June 16, 1884, and appraisement made and returned to the proper court on June 26, 1884, and bond was duly given by said assignee in double the amount of the appraised value of the estate of said Williams. The assignee took charge of the personal property of said Williams, or a great portion of it at least, under said deed, converted it into money and also received certain money from accounts due said assignor. The appraised value of the estate according to the appraisement list aforesaid was $1,163.55. On August 9, 1884, a supplemental appraisement list was filed showing good accounts due said Williams to the amount of $360.16.</p>

The master also finds that upon the <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>hearing of the complaint before the judge who granted the warrant a postponement of the further proceedings was ordered until June 16, 1884, and that on the 14th of June, 1884, Williams while under arrest as aforesaid executed and delivered to the defendant who was his attorney at law in the case, a deed of general and voluntary assignment of all his property, real, personal and mixed for the benefit of his creditors: That the assignee duly recorded the deed, had the property appraised, gave the proper bond as assignee, took possession of the personal property assigned, or a great part of it, converted it into money, and also collected certain accounts due to the assignor. The master further finds that upon giving the deed of assignment the plaintiff was discharged from arrest by the judge who heard the cause and also that the plaintiff was at the time he executed the deed of assignment under twenty-one years of age. We regard these findings as entirely sufficient to show that the plaintiff obtained his discharge by availing himself of the provisions of the 13th and subsequent sections of the act of 1842 which regulate the proceedings for obtaining a discharge by insolvent debtors. The only serious question in the case therefore is the validity of the deed of assignment thus executed. We can see no reason why it is not an entirely valid and binding instrument. It was given in the course of a judicial proceeding to which the plaintiff was lawfully subject notwithstanding his minoriiy.</p>
    <p id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.5",561,[137,1638,1172,706]],["BL_562.1",562,[263,356,1165,146]]]'>By means of a decree obtained at his instance, and the fruits of which he accepted and enjoyed, he procured his discharge from arrest by executing a deed of assignment for the benefit of his creditors in strict accordance with the law. That law is applicable to all persons alike who become subject to its provisions. The plaintiff was not bound to avail himself of those provisions. He could have remained under arrest. But when he invoked the aid of the law to be extricated from his position he must necessarily do those things which the law requires to be done in order to get the benefit of its provisions. The act of 1842 makes no distinction of persons in describing those who may obtain its benefits. It expressly says that “ Any person committed as above provided etc. may present a petition to the court of common pleas of the county in which he shall be im<a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>prisoned, or in which the said suit is pending or to the judge thereof, praying that he may assign his property and have the benefit of the provisions of this act.”</p>
    <p id="b562-5" data-blocks='[["BL_562.5",562,[263,511,1169,1526]]]'>There is no limitation in the act which excludes persons under disabilities. “ Any person ” means every person. If persons who are minors should be excluded by reason of their disability to make contracts, they would be deprived of the benefits of the act, and that would be a hardship to which they ought not to be subject without express words of exclusion. There are no such words in the act and of course we cannot put them there. When therefore the act extends its benefits to all persons it must be held to confer capacity to make the necessary deed of assignment by which alone those benefits can be obtained: There is no straining of the law in putting upon it tins construction. It is a perfectly familiar principle that, “ a saving from the operation of statutes for disabilities must be expressed or it does not exist:” Warfield v. Fox, <a href="/pa/53/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="53 Pa. 382" data-case-ids="1004748" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0382-01">53 Pa. 382</a>. “A law general in its nature binds minors and femmes covert, and there is a multitude of statutes by winch the rights of such persons are affected though they are not specifically named.” To the same effect are Hunt v.

In the ease of The People v. Mullin, 25 Wendell, 698, the precise question was before the Supreme Court of New York under a statute “relative to voluntary assignments by a debtor imprisoned in execution in civil cases, 2 R. S. 31.” It was said by the Chief Justice, “that an infant as well as an adult was entitled to the benefit of the act which is general in its terms, viz: ‘ every person, may at any time petition ’ etc. Besides the relief from imprisonment being so highly beneficial to the petitioner his act in making an assignment must in law be regarded as valid notwithstanding his nonage.”</p>
