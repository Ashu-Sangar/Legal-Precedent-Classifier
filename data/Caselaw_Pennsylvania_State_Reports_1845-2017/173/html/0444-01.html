Plaintiff testified that he had stated to defendants that the work would take about two weeks, but that he was not aware that there was any great and vital necessity for having it ready at that particular time, and that the defendants delayed him in his work. <em>Held, </em>that it was for the jury to determine the facts under the conflicting evidence whether time was of the essence of the contract, and also whether defendants by their action delayed the plaintiff’s work.</p>
