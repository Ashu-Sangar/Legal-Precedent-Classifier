The scheme was impracticable ; it was not capable of accomplishment; that is, the number of assessments requisite to pay the amount of the certificates as they matured could not be collected from the membership within the seven years limited for payment; at least the rate at which the assessments were levied at no time was sufficient for this purpose.' The auditor does not, in so reporting, intend to cast the least reflection upon the good faith of the management of the order.. On the contrary, he is satisfied that the management acted in the fullest of good faith in their dealings with the order. The compensation of the officers and the expenses were paid entirely from the funds contributed expressly for those purposes, and no part of the assessments for the relief fund was so used. As heretofore stated, the relief fund was appropriated entirely for the benefit of the certificate holders. The management honestly endeavored to make the scheme a success. The trouble with it was that it was incapable of success; they undertook to pay more than the money which they received would justify, and it was only a question of time when the obligations would swamp the accumulated assets. The order paid all matured certificates that had matured prior to the 18th day of March, 1894, with the exception of two certificates, the payment of which had been delayed on account of defective proofs. The assets of the order, as shown by its books, on the 20th day of March, 1894, were 11,350,855.69 <em>; </em>
      <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>the outstanding, unmatured certificates aggregated 114,477,200. Therefore, on the 20th day of March, 1894, the order was insolvent and incapable of meeting its obligations, having in view the obligations that. thereafter were to mature. So that at the time of the maturity of the respective maturing obligations as aforesaid, the auditor finds as a fact, that the Order of Tonti was insolvent. Under the provisions of the by-laws, the obligations maturing after March 20,1894, did not become absolutely payable until the day of and after the assignment to the accountants. Therefore, at the time the certificates matured and at the time, under the by-laws, payment of the same was demand-able, the order could not have paid the same with any possibility of leaving funds in the order that would pay subsequently maturing certificates in the same manner and to the same extent. According to the books of the order there was less than $1,200,000 in the relief and reserve funds, and there was over $600,000 of certificates which had matured, and within a few months the rapidly maturing certificates would have exhausted the entire assets of the corporation. As before stated herein, the purpose of the order had failed of accomplishment. It had undertaken to do that which was not practically capable of accomplishment within the time limited for the maturing of the certificates. In the first years of its organization the assessments had been about one a month, but as the obligations matured the management was compelled to increase the number of assessments so that in the last year the number levied and collected was sometimes three a month. While it is true that the management of the order had a right to levy an unlimited number of assessments, yet that number was actually limited by the amount wlfich could be collected. As a practical question when they reached, as they did reach, three assessments a month, they had reached the limits of endurance and performance of the membership. By the terms of the certificate the time for payment was limited to seven years. There was only one course left open which held out any hopes of maintaining the order, and that was to do what they actually did, levy at one time two hundred and ten assessments on all certificates which had been issued prior to the 23d day of August, 1893. This meant on a thousand dollar certificate, $525 of assessments levied at one time and a proportionate amount on all certificates <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>for a less amount. Of course, this could not be collected, and they did the next best thing, they authorized its being charged against the certificates, thereby reducing the liability on the certificate by the amount of the two hundred and ten assessments, but, as heretofore stated, the result of levying these debit assessments, as they were called, produced so much opposition from the older certificate holders that the winding up of the order was the only just course left open.</p>

That result was reached by holding that members of the association who had given the requisite notice of withdrawal thereby ceased to be stockholders and became creditors to the extent of the withdrawal value of their stock, as evidenced either by orders on the treasurer or by the books of the association, and consequently their claims are superior to those of their fellow stockholders who had not given the requisite notice of withdrawal. In this we think, there was manifest error. While, in a qualified sense, withdrawing stockholders may be considered creditors of the association, their rights, as against those with whom they have been associated, are very different from those of general creditors whose claims are based wholly on outside transactions. If the association had been prosperous, they have a right, under certain limitations and restrictions, to demand and receive their proportionate share of the accumulated fund, but if bad investments have been made, or losses have been sustained before actual withdrawal, they must bear their just proportion thereof. That right, as was held in United States Building and Loan Association v. Silverman, 4 Norris, 394, may be enforced by appropriate proceedings at law. But the right of withdrawal and the extent to which it may be exercised presupposes that at least a relative proportion of the assets will remain for the benefit of those who continue to be active members of the association.</p>

Both classes are equally meritorious, and in marshaling the assets neither is entitled to priority over the other. The claims of each are alike based upon their relation to the association as members thereof. Orders issued to withdrawing stockholders are merely evidence of their interest in the assets remaining after paying general creditors. As was well said by the learned president of the common pleas in the Assigned Estate of National Savings, Loan and Building Association, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.N.C.%2079" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 W.N.C. 79">9 W.

If, as a practical question, the requisite number of assessments could be levied and collected, there would be no difficulty in repaying the amount, but the order started out and for a number of years continued to collect an insufficient number of assessments, and the result was that it failed to fulfill the object of its creation, and became hopelessly insolvent. The parallelism between the scope of a building association and an association such as the Order of Tonti is quite obvious. The main feature in which it differs from a building association is the payment of sick benefits, and, after all, such sick benefits were but anticipated payments on account of the principal of the certificate, because, by the very terms of the certificate, they were to be charged against the principal thereof, together <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>with interest thereon at the maturity of the certificate, and became, so far as the payment of the certificate at maturity was concerned, a very valuable asset in meeting obligations of the order.</p>

This proposition, the auditor thinks, is unsound. A sufficient answer to this contention of the matured certificate holders may be found in the fact that the two hundred and ten assessments could either be paid in cash or credited on the certificate. It certainly never was contemplated by any member on joining the order that he would be called upon in a single assessment to pay $525 on account of a thousand-dollar certificate or a like proportionate sum on certificates for less amounts.</p>

When the order was first established the assessments did not exceed one a month, and they were not increased until within the last few years, the last year being at the rate of about three a month; the previous year about two a month. It is manifest that this attempt at levying two hundred and ten assessments at one time was the last struggle to try and keep the order on its feet. It was promulgated on the 3d of May, and the assignment followed on the 18th of May. Cause and effect could hardly be more clearly shown. There can be no doubt that the attempt to levy such a number of assessments at one time was unreasonable and without authority in law, and certainly in an organizar tion of this character inequitable. While the supreme executive committee was clothed with discretionary power for the purpose of levying assessments, and although this "discretion was unlimited in words, the auditor thinks it must be construed as being limited by the reasonableness of the exercise of the dis<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>cretion in the light of all the circumstances. The fact that the certificate holders were given the option of debiting these assessments against their certificates is in and of itself a confession that they were unreasonable. The management knew that they could not be collected, neither was it ever intended that they should be collected. It was simply an effort to reduce the liabilities of the order by cutting the certificates in half. The auditor thinks that the whole scheme of debit assessment was clearly irregular and illegal, and was but an abortive attempt to keep the organization alive, and, therefore, it would be unreasonable and inequitable to require the unmatured certificate holders to submit to the enforcement of the same as against their certificates and in the meantime permit all the assets of the order to be distributed in payment to fellow-members of the matured certificates and leave nothing for themselves.</p>

While this provision as to one eighty-fourth of the reserve fund being applied to the certificates maturing in any one month was not in force at the time of the assignment, its purpose, undoubtedly, while in force, was to limit the amount payable on any certificate, and to reserve a fund for the benefit of the subsequently maturing certificates; and the aforesaid amendment of the by-laws, which was in force at the time of the assignment, by providing that the minimum of the reserve fund “ shall not be less than five hundred thousand dollars,” also had for its object the protection of the subsequently maturing certificates.</p>

The auditor said: “ What is meant by a sum not exceeding one eighth ? Is this merely a maximum limit of the amount to be paid to the certificate holder ? Can it be argued that a contract to pay any amount not exceeding a certain sum is a contract to pay that sum ? The mere interrogation suggests its absurdity. It was intimated at the argument that a sum not exceeding $625 might mean five cents; true enough, it might; but in an uncertain matter like this the law in its wisdom would say that this meant a sum which could be reasonably paid with a due regard to all the circumstances of the case. Now, what would have been a reasonable sum to have paid the matured certificates in this instance ? It appears by the appraisement that the assets of the order amounted to $810,000. On the day the assignment was made, there was nearly $600,000 due to matured certificate holders. In two months more, enough certificates would have matured to wipe out the entire benefit fund that it had taken nearly four years to accumulate. The payment of the maximum sum mentioned in the certificates would have plunged the order into bankruptcy. Is it at all in doubt whether, under such circumstances, a court of law or equity would compel the payment <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>of the maximum sum on the certificates ? It may be said that; the supreme executive committee had power to call an unlimited number of assessments, but the exercise of it would have been disastrous to the order. Under these circumstances, the auditor camiot see how it would be possible to award the matured certificate holders the maximum limit of their certificates.”</p>

Dismissal of said exceptions, all of which are recited in the first twelve specifications, and refusal to award the funds in the hands of the assignees to the holders of matured certificates in preference to the holders of certificates which had not matured at the date of the assignment, constituted the subject of complaint in the several specifications of error. We have considered the question involved, and are of opinion that the findings of fact and conclusion of the learned auditor are substantially correct, and for reasons fully set forth in his report the decree should be affirmed. In view of the insolvency of the order, the distribution made by the court below is just and equitable.” It would certainly be inequitable in a fraternal beneficial society where mutuality is the basis of the contract, that a member whose certificate matured the day before the assignment should receive the maximum amount named therein, and that the mem ber whose certificate would have matured the day after the assignment should receive comparatively nothing. In this distribution of an insolvent society of this character the equitable maxim applies, “ Equality is equity.”</p>
