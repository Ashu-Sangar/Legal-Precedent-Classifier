The officer of the company who conducted the negotiation with defendants’ ancestor, testified that the right of way was located prior to the signing of the deed, but he did not testify that the location as then made included the land in dispute. He also testified that the location as made interfered with the landowner’s kitchen which stood at the back of the house, and next to the railroad, and that the owner was allowed $100 to move it “ out of the way of the road.” The new kitchen was erected about four feet from the line on which the company subsequently built a wall, and upon the land in dispute. <em>Held, </em>(1) that there was evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that the center of the track or roadbed was the center of the strip of land conveyed in the deed; (2) that a fair inference from the testimony was that a portion of the kitchen was within the right of way as located by the company, and that the main part of the dwelling house, and a part of the kitchen was outside of it; (3) that parol evidence was admissible to locate the land conveyed by the deed; (4) that the ease was for the jury.</p>

The question is, where is it located.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b520-7" data-blocks='[["BL_520.8",520,[272,1592,1172,340]]]'>Unfortunately, the deed does not locate by monuments or by any marks oh the ground, where in the lot it is.

It was constructed, the road laid down and the iron laid, in 1873, and remains a single <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>track, according to the evidence, in substantially tbe same position it was put down in 1873. The grading was begun sometime in the fall or early winter of 1872, and the plaintiffs have given testimony in relation to the location of their track on the ground, and claim that the center of the single track, as it is on the ground, is the center of the sixty feet conveyed by this deed; and if there was nothing more, you would find for the plaintiff. They give another piece of testimony persuasive, pretty strongly persuasive if it be true, that this was the center ■of the right of way of sixty feet, and it is this : they call Mr. Yandervort, an engineer, for several years in the employ of the railroad company, but not an engineer at the time the road was located — nor has either side called an engineer who was engaged in the location of the road. In this description the sixty feet is not a straight line through the ground; it is, I believe, two straight lines and a curve. There is on each side of the sixty feet, first a straight line and then a curve, with a radius fixed. Beginning at the Hodgson line, it runs on a straight line 296 feet to a point, and thence a curve on a radius of 2895 feet, curving northwestwardly 368 feet; thence on a straight line, 108 feet to the Horne line ; thence along the Horne line, making the sixty feet — -a little more than that, because it is not on a right angle — and thence a straight line on the river side, 121 feet, and thence again, another curve, on a radius of 2835 feet, for 362 feet. You see the curve on one side has a radius of 2895 feet, and on the other side of 2835 feet. Now Mr. Yandervort says that the track as located will correspond with the center line of those two curves, with the radii given — that is my understanding of his testimony — and that if the track had been to one side of the sixty feet, instead of the center, those curves on the track, as it exists, would not have corresponded, as he says they do, to these radii given in the deed; which, if true, would be very persuasive that the track was intended at the time, and by the parties on the ground, to be located in the center of this sixty feet.</p>

Nobody has given us any estimate of its value or of the cost of removing it. It seems from the testimony that there was a kitchen stood nearer the hill than the main part of the house. Mr. Snee tells you that he heard Mr. Martin and Mr. Pearsol' — that he was present when they discussed this right of way on the ground, and that Mr. Martin — who testifies that he was the man negotiating for this right of way and was-vice president of the road at the time — pointed out on the ground and on the building — I think he said he marked on the-kitchen — 'where the line would run. Then he says that he cannot tell the precise time, but thinks it was in 1871. I believe-he says that, to the best of his recollection and knowledge, the building of a stone wall at this place where the kitchen was, was discussed at the time. He says that the kitchen was taken away and a stone wall was built there. There is testimony to indicate that it was built by the railroad or the railroad contractors, and that it is substantially at the place pointed out by Mr. Martin as the line of the right of way that they wanted.</p>

Now, it is argued on the part of the defendants that tMs plainly implies that the kitchen was to be affected, but that the house was to stand; that the road was to pass the house, but the kitchen was to be affected as it was, and it is argued again by the plaintiff’s counsel, with equal ingenuity and force, that this shows that it was expected to take the house.

The defendants have possession of the land and claim title to it under Peter Pearsol’s will dated April 20, 1881, and probated July 7, 1887. While it is undisputed that Pearsol on the 3d of November, 1872, conveyed to the above mentioned railway company a strip of his land, of the width of sixty feet, from a point in the division line between him and W. Hodgson to a point in the division line between him and John Horne, the location of the land conveyed was not defined in his deed. There was nothing in it by which it could be ascertained on what part of either division line the land which was the subject of the grant abutted, and it was necessary therefore for the parties to look elsewhere for evidence to establish its location.</p>
    <p id="b525-3" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[192,1016,1178,969]]]'>The Pittsburg, Virginia &amp; Charleston Railway Company commenced grading its road through the Pearsol lot sometime in the fall or early winter of 1872, and completed the same and laid a single track thereon in 1873, since which time there has been no material change in it at that point. The land in dispute lies between the railway tracks and the river and within thirty feet of the center of the former. The plaintiff bases its contention that this land is embraced in Pearsol’s grant to its lessor on the presumption in the absence of a designation of boundaries, that the center of the roadbed is the center of the strip of land conveyed by him. The learned court below conceded that “ in the absence of any testimony or facts or circumstances to the contrary” the presumption would entitle the plaintiff to a verdict for the land in suit, but thought there was evidence in the case from which the jury would be warranted in finding that it was not included in the Pearsol conveyance. The questions to be determined on this appeal are whether the evidence was admissible, and if so, whether it was sufficient to repel or overcome the presumption.</p>

W. Martin, who was its vice president, and authorized to purchase lands and secure rights of way for its use in the construction and operation of its road. It was a suggestive fact, that while he was called by the plaintiff as a witness and testified that the right of way through the Pearsol lot was located by the company’s engineers before the agreement of May 20, 1872, was <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>signed, he did not testify that the location as then made included the land in dispute, nor was his attention directed to this important matter by either parly. Another fact of considerable significance is that when it was discovered that the locar tion as made interfered to some extent with Pearsol’s kitchen, which stood at the back of his house and next to the railroad, he was allowed $100 to move it “ out of the way of the road.” The fair inference from Martin’s testimony is that a portion of the kitchen was within the right of way as located by the company’s engineers, and that the main building and a part of the kitchen were outside of it. This inference accords with the direct and positive testimony of Herman N. Snee in regard to the lower line of the right of way and the construction of a Avail upon it, and Avith the last clause of the agreement of May 20, 1872, which was Avritten and witnessed by Martin. The company built the wall in 1878 in accordance with the understanding between Pearsol and its representative, and it has not been changed since. There is nothing in the deed, nor in the negotiations or agreement which preceded it, which indicates that the dAvelling house was included in the sale. The allowance of compensation for the interference with the kitchen does not accord with the theory which carries the lower line of the right of way beyond it. If this line passed through or below the main building there could have been no occasion for a separate assessment of the damages arising from the encroachment upon the kitchen. As we understand the evidence, the new kitchen was erected about four feet from the line on which the wall Avas built, and upon the land described in the summons. The circumstances to which we have referred support the contention of the defendants and are opposed to that of the plaintiff.</p>

We think also that this testimony was sufficient, if believed, to repel the presumption on which the contention of the plaintiff was based. It was not offered, admitted or used to set aside or modify a Avritten instrument, but to assist in ascertaining the location of the land conveyed, in regard to which the deed was silent.
