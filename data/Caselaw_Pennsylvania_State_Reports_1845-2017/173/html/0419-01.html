The suit was for the unpaid balance of a cash subscription to stock, and the offer was to show that no subscription in cash was made by defendant, but on the contrary that paid-up stock was to be given him in compensation for services. There is no inherent incapacity of a corporation to purchase property or labor and pay for it by stock instead of money. If the corporation here had paid defendant $1,000 in cash to leave his former situation and undertake its presidency, on condition that he invest the money in its stock, there could be no question of the validity of the transaction, yet it would in substance have been exactly the same.</p>
