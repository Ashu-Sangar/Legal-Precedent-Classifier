About a year afterwards, seeking to obtain more goods on credit he stated to plaintiffs that his financial position was, if anything, better than the year before. He accordingly obtained the goods. The written statement was substantially correct as of the time it was made, but afterwards defendant greatly enlai’ged his business with no increase of capital. From his own testimony it appeared that he had gone to New York where plaintiffs did business with the avowed purpose of purchasing $60,000 worth of goods on a credit of from thirty to ninety days, and that on the very day of his interview with plaintiffs he had bought a large portion of this amount. <em>Held, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a judgment on a verdict for plaintiff.</p>

The evidence to sustain and in denial of it was very contradictory; the material point in dispute being, whether defendant had made the false statement on 9th of August, 1892, when this particular bill was purchased. Prior to September, 1891, defendant had made a written statement to plaintiffs in exact accord with that set out in the declaration of claim. Bryce Gray, a partner in the plaintiff firm testifies, that on the 9th of August, 1892, when <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>the last purchase was made, he called defendant into his private room, where in answer to his questions he positively stated his financial condition was if anything better than the year before, when he made the written statement. Rosenthal, the defendant, positively denies this, and asserts Gray asked him nothing about his financial condition at that time and he made no statement concerning it. The written statement seems to have been substantially correct as of the time it was made, but afterwards defendant greatly enlarged his business with no increase of capital, so that his purchases of goods were principally on credit; he admits that they amounted to about $65,000, all on credit, at this last visit to New York. His own evidence shows that his financial condition had greatly changed in the year between the written statement and the last purchase. Assume as argued that his actual indebtedness had not greatly increased before his last visit to New York, nevertheless, he went there with the avowed purpose of purchasing $60,000 worth of goods on a credit from thirty to ninety days, and on the very day of the interview with Gray had bought a large portion of this amount; his actual indebtedness was then not less than $80,000, which he intended should be $60,000 before he left, and his intention was carried out. If he under such circumstances represented to Gray his financial condition was, if anything, better than the year before, it was a gross falsehood, for instead of owing $7,500, he owed, or as he knew in a day or two would owe, ten times that amount; true, his assets would be increased by the value of the stock on hand, but this value was wholly problematical, depending on success in the venture of largely increased business with no corresponding increase of capital.</p>

The plaintiffs had <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>shown purchases made on credit in June and July, these followed by showing continued purchases down to September aggregating nearly $90,000 on credit, then insolvency resulting in a sale of the entire stock for less than $20,000, and the store eventually put in name of defendant’s wife. Plaintiffs claimed that all of the transactions taken together indicated a scheme conceived by defendant to obtain large quantities of goods on credit from plaintiffs and others by false representations, and then in an indirect way profit by a bankruptcy. In this view the evidence was admissible, not as tending to establish that indebtedness was created by the subsequent purchases, but that these purchases constituted part of one scheme to defraud, conceived by him before he practiced it on plaintiffs to their-injury.</p>
