Now there is enough to put the plaintiffs on their guard as to whose store it was, from the orders that they got in the name of A. J. Connor, and if they recover (unless you find that it was actually the store of the wife and not of the husband) they will have to recover on account of Mrs. Connor’s statement and allegation to the plaintiffs. Mr. Schewe says that she called there and talked the matter over and told him that she was married, that she was carrying on a store and that the credit would be as good as of old. It seems she had carried on a store when she was a widow and had dealt with these plaintiffs and had paid her bills. The account was satisfactory and Mr. Schewe was anxious to get it back. He says that she told him, substantially, that she was carrying on the store. He says her credit was good, and I think he said he told her he would send around a salesman next week for an <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>order. Now he says that she said nothing about her husband being in the business; he understood it as her own. But she denies this. She says that she told him her husband was running it. She says that her husband was there and when the first order was given (or at least by implication) that she introduced her husband and that he gave an order. I think perhaps she was misunderstood in regard to that; that that was at some later time than the first order, because she at another time said the first order was given in the store and that it was given to Charles Voskamp. Charles Voskamp said he took the first order and took it from her. She says it was from the older daughter, who is dead. He says he got nearly all the orders from her; that sometimes the daughter, and later the husband, gave orders. She says she rarely ever gave an order. It is a question for you as to who is mistaken in this matter.</p>
