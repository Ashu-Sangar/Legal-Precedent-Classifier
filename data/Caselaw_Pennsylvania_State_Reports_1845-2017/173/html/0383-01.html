A short time before these two agreements were made Meyerhoff had a survey made when he discovered that the whole of the alley was located on his ground. He then went to Briscoe and the first agree<a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>ment was made. Briscoe says that at this time Hyland, who was his tenant of 220 South street, agreed to this, but when Hyland was asked to give up possession of the alley which he enjoyed under the lease, he refused. The second agreement was then executed and Briscoe than gave Meyerhoff $200 for the whole of the party wall. Meyerhoff then built, or improved, his property, in doing which he left the two-foot ten inches wide alley as it had been up to the joists of the second floor. These joists he extended across the alley and some inches into the wall of Briscoe’s property. From these joists upward to the roof Meyerhoff built the eastern wall of his house exactly over the middle of the alley. He also about this time erected a new dividing fence between his property and Briscoe’s, and in all probability the new fence extended southward on a line with the western wall of Briscoe’s property. Prior to this the old fence extended southward from the middle of the alley. The new fence, however, did not extend the whole length of the lot on a line which gave Meyerhoff full nineteen feet three inches breadth to his property, for the evidence shows that defendant’s privy extended over the plaintiff’s property about six inches.</p>

The plaintiff contends that the parties did not intend that Meyerhoff was to give up any part of the frontage of his property, whilst the defendants contend that it was the intention of the parties that Meyerhoff was to build his new eastern wall on the center of the alley, and that this should be the eastern boundary fine of Meyerhoff’s property to the depth of forty-one feet. from South street. The meaning of the two contracts or agreements seems very plain to the master, and the testimony before <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>him, taken as a whole, only confirms his views. When Meyerhoff concluded to improve his property he had a survey made, when he discovered, as he says, that the whole of the alley was •on his ground. He also knew at that time that Briscoe or his tenants claimed the right to use the alley and exercised that right in having access to the property on the east. The language of the deeds from Coburn, who was the common ancestor in the title of both parties, as weE as that of all the deeds of the parties between Coburn and each of them, shows that every■one thought that the alley was half of Briscoe’s and half of Meyerhoff’s property, for they all describe the alley as extending fifty feet from South street two feet ten inches wide and “ then narrowing from each side to a point at the distance of fifty-three feet from said street.” This is further confirmed by the fact that at the time Meyerhoff had his survey made, preparatory to beginning his improvements, the old fence extended from this point to the alley southward to the end of both plots. With this knowledge he went to Briscoe, and the first agreement, vacating the alley, was made under the impression that Hyland, the tenant, agreed to the vacation of the alley. After it was made it was discovered that the then tenant Hyland would not agree to the vacation of the alley, so the second agreement as to the manner of building over the alley was made. The first agreement, after reciting the title of each of the parties to their lots, witnesses that each promises and agrees with the other, his heirs and assigns, “ That the said hereinbefore mentioned alley shall be closed and vacated, to the same force and effect as if the said alley had never been laid out and opened, and that the boundary line between the ground of the .said William Briscoe and Louis Meyerhoff for the depth of forty-one feet from said South street shall be the centre of said .alley as the same is now laid out and opened and about to be vacated; and that from the said depth of forty-one feet from the said South street, the ground of the said Louis Meyerhoff, •shaE be of the full width of said nineteen feet three inches, notwithstanding any variations of said alley from the regular lines, as the same may have been laid out and opened on the said ground used by the said Briscoe.” It does not seem possible to doubt what is meant by the above language. It plainly ■says that hereafter it is agreed that the “ boundary line between <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>the ground of the said William Briscoe and Louis Meyerhoff for the depth of forty-one feet from said South street shall be the centre of said alley, as the same is now laid out and opened.” If when this agreement was made Meyerhoff had discovered that the whole of this alley was on his ground, then he must certainly have understood that for the depth of forty-one feet from South street he was giving up to Briscoe one half of it, for he was agreeing that the boundary line between him and Briscoe should be the center of the alley for forty-one feet from South street. That this is evident appears from the immediately following clause of the agreement, wherein he stipulates that from the depth of forty-one feet from said South street his ground shall be of the full width of said nineteen feet three inches. He was giving up half the alley for forty-one feet from South street, and he was getting the whole of the rest of the alley, which was about twelve feet longer, and also getting his lot widened to the full width of nineteen feet three inches.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b410-5" data-blocks='[["BL_410.5",410,[248,1250,1174,452]]]'>The meaning of the second agreement is equally plain. It explains why Meyerhoff did not immediately build up his east wall from the center of the alley to the second story, and it also confirms the view that the first agreement intended that the wall huilt over the center of the alley was to be the eastern boundary line of his property for forty-one feet from South street, for he expressly calls it an east party wall. It also shows that Briscoe was to have the right “ to use the whole of the said east party wall without any charge therefor.”</p>
