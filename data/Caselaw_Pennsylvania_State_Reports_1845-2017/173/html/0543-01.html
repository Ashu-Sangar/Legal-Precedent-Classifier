From the admitted facts it appears that in September, 1883, Irvin conveyed the tract to Flynn. In November, 1883, Flynn conveyed to Jose, excepting and reserving the coal and minerals, and at the same time conveyed the one half part of all the minerals reserved to H. B. and J. F. Powell. In the same year Jose conveyed to John Lantzy, one of the defendants. At the time of the conveyance by Irvin to Flynn the taxes for 1882 and 1883 were unpaid, and in 1884 the land was sold for these taxes and purchased by Lantzy. In 1888 Lantzy conveyed the coal to the Blubaker Coal Company, the other defendant. In 1894 the plaintiff purchased of Flynn the remaining half interest in the coal, and brought this action of ejectment. The land was unseated, and the legal title to the entire property was in Irvin at the time the taxes for 1882 and 1883 were assessed.</p>

The regularity of the proceedings which resulted in the sale is not questioned, and the validity of the title depends upon the question whether the defendant Lantzy was forbidden by any rule of legal policy to acquire a title at a sale for taxes charged in part against his own land, and whether the title so acquired, if otherwise good, is affected by any equity growing out of the relation which the owner of the surface and the owner of the minerals bore to each other.</p>

Davis, the party who was precluded from acquiring a title at a tax sale was either in possession of the land when the tax was assessed and upon that ground was chargeable with its payment or by contract or otherwise it had become his duty to other parties concerned to make payment, and “ To preclude any person from making and relying on a purchase of land at a tax sale there must be something in the circumstances of the case which imposes on him a duty to the state to pay the tax, or something which renders it inequitable as between him and the holder of the existing title that he should make the purchase.” In speaking of taxes on unseated lands which were not a charge against the owner it is said in Coxe v. Gibson, <a href="/pa/27/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="27 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="979456" data-case-paths="/pa/27/0160-01">27 Pa. 160</a>, that there was nothing in reason or law to prevent the holder of a defective title from purchasing a better one at a tax sale. The taxes under which the sale was made in this case were on unseated lands, and there was no personal responsibility on the owner therefor; the land alone was liable: Hunter v. Cockran, <a href="/pa/3/0105-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="3 Pa. 105" data-case-ids="400563" data-case-paths="/pa/3/0105-01">3 Pa. 105</a>; McCormack v.

      <a id="p549" href="#p549" data-label="549" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*549</a>Was there a community of interest which gave rise to a duty, or anything in the relation of the parties which made the purchase by Lantzy inequitable ? The rule which applies to a trustee or to one occupying a fiduciary relation is stated in the notes to Keech v. Sanford, 1 Leading Cases in Equity, p. 62, 4th Am. ed., to be this: “ Whenever one person is placed in such relar tions to another, by the act or consent of that other or by the act of a third person or of the law, that he becomes interested for him or interested with him in any subject of property or business, he is prohibited from acquiring rights in that subject antagonistic to the person with whose interests he has become associated.” And the rule is said to apply as far as the principle and morality and policy upon which it is founded extend. In this state it has been enforced against joint tenants and tenants in common in a number of cases, among them Weaver v. Wible, <a href="/pa/25/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="25 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="975855" data-case-paths="/pa/25/0270-01">25 Pa. 270</a>; Lloyd v.

But the owner of mineral rights holding by virtue of a reservation in a deed is neither a tenant in common nor a joint tenant with the owner of the surface. Each has a separate estate: Neill v.

They were separately the subjects of possession, enjoyment, incumbrance and taxation. There was no community of interest between the owners. The whole was subject to a claim for taxes which existed before they acquired title, and which neither was under any obligation to the state to pay. If either had paid it he could .not have recovered of the other his proportionate share: Neill v. Lacy, <a href="/pa/110/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="110 Pa. 294" data-case-ids="543708" data-case-paths="/pa/110/0294-01">supra.</a> And <a id="p550" href="#p550" data-label="550" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*550</a>no right to contribution could be enforced as in the case of a mortgage, and there was no means by which the tax could be apportioned. Lantzy was in a position in which he was obliged to pay a claim which he did not personally owe, and which was in part a charge upon the land of another from whom he could not require repayment, or to buy or lose his title. A vendee under articles who buys at a sheriff’s sale to save his title is not a trustee for the vendor: Bispham’s Equity, sec. 93; Thompson v. Adams, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20484" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="55 Pa. 484">55 Pa. 484</a>, although the vendor may be permitted to recover under the contract.</p>

It was their separate, not their joint, interests which were in peril. They were not interested for or with each other, and no relation of confidence existed between them which gave rise to a duty which equity will enforce through the medium of a trust.</p>
