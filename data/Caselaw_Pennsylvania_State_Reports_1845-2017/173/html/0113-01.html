    <p id="b137-3" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[136,520,1168,493]]]'>Again in Baxter v. Allen, <a href="/pa/77/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="77 Pa. 468" data-case-ids="436285" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0468-01">77 Pa. 468</a>, it was held that a judgment of record at the time of the defendant’s death, though not then a lien on his land, is not a debt whose lien is limited to five years from his decease, unless suit he brought according to the 24th section of the act of February, 1834. In such cases suit is unnecessary because the debt is already in judgment. As to all volunteers it remains unaffected by the lapse of time, until the presumption of payment arises. Heirs and. devisees are regarded as mere volunteers: Shannon v. Newton, <a href="/pa/132/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="132 Pa. 375" data-case-ids="970496" data-case-paths="/pa/132/0375-01">132 Pa. 375</a>.</p>
    <p id="b137-4" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[135,1032,1169,492]]]'>To the same effect are Middleton’s Ex’rs v. Middleton, <a href="/pa/106/0252-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="106 Pa. 252" data-case-ids="455650" data-case-paths="/pa/106/0252-01">106 Pa. 252</a>, and other cases; but enough has been said to show that the judgment originally obtained against plaintiffs’ ancestor, Mrs. Drusadow, in her lifetime, had not lost its lien on the lot in question, and that it was unnecessary to bring in her heirs by scire facias, as it would have been had there been no judgment against Mrs. Drusadow in her lifetime. Upon the facts as presented, the defendant should not be required to accept the title that plaintiffs offer to give her. To say the least it is not marketable.</p>
