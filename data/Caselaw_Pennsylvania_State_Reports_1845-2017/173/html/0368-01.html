As confirming this view, it will be observed that in his will the testator nowhere specifically disposes of articles of furniture, while he does make several specific bequests of personal effects of the nature of jewelry and wear<a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>ing apparel, as in the eighth and ninth clauses. The phrase “ except such of the same as are herein otherwise disposed of ’’ indicates the character of the preceding kind of articles, jewelry, wearing apparel and personal effects as one and the' same, and the subsequent bequest of similar articles, and the reference to such subsequent bequests in the phrase under consideration, would seem to determine conclusively the meaning of the phrase “ personal effects ” in accordance with the contention herein.</p>

      <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>In a will written with the intelligent regard for legal accuracy which characterizes this will, we may take it for granted that every material word was intended to contribute its share. in the expression of the testator’s meaning. The fact that, as to all of its many and varied dispositions, with the single exception of the gift to the niece, we are left without any manner of doubt as to the exact purpose of the testator, is proof of the care with which the instrument was prepared. He gave to her in fee, by apt words, his real estate in the city of New Orleans, and he added, “ also all my jewelry, wearing apparel and personal effects, except such of the same as are herein otherwise disposed of.” In choosing the word “ effects,” he used a word of the widest scope, which, as Lord Mansfield said, “ is synonymous with worldly substance ” (Hogan v. Jackson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Cow.%20299" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Cow. 299">1 Cow. 299</a>), and which, therefore, embraces every form and species of personal estate, and has even, in exceptional cases, passed realty. When ,a testator accompanies a word of general meaning, like “ effects,” with particulars which are embraced within that meaning, he is influenced by one of two motives — a fear that the particulars may be overlooked, or an intent to restrict the meaning of the general word. It is very certain that this decedent was not .actuated by the former consideration; he knew that if he gave his effects to the legatee, he gave her all the personalty he possessed, and he would hardly commit the superfluous folly of particularizing his jewelry and clothing. But, while he could not increase a term which was universal, he could diminish it. And he did this in a double way; by associating it with particu-^ lars, and by prefixing to it the adjective “personal.” The phrase “ personal effects ” has obtained, by frequent use, as distinctly a defined meaning as the phrase “household effects.” It designates articles associated with the person, just as the ■opposite phrase denotes articles belonging to the house. But it gets this meaning by being contrasted with household effects, ns when the testator bequeaths his personal and household^ goods. In this instance, the testator intended to give, specifically, only his personal belongings, and not those of his house, and he did it by connecting personal effects with articles so <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>intimately personal to himself as his jewelry and apparel. He excepted from the personal effects “ such of the same ” as were .otherwise disposed of. We concede that if the excluded articles were not such as were associated with his person, a grave doubt would be cast upon our reasoning. On the other hand, if they proved to be ejusdem generis with the items he enumerated, they would emphasize his meaning. They were a watch and a small tea-set, the latter going to the daughter of the legatee. This tea-set had been in constant use by the testator, and was kept in or adjacent to the dining room; and the only other silverware he owned, consisting of spoons, tongs and a cream jug, was sometimes placed in a box in an upper story. He lived alone hr the house, and he used the utensils, or most of them, upon his table for his own convenience. This strictly personal use by the testator gave them a distinctive character wholly different from that of other articles of domestic use or ornament. It was the same as if they had been marked with bis name, and had been the subject of a personal gift to him; the same, indeed, as the pen or the inkstand upon his desk, or the watch which he gave to his nephew; so that, as well by the articles which he named, as by those which he excepted, the testator seems to have intended by his “ personal effects,” not his personal chattels in general, but only such as were associated with his person. The contestant is either afraid of her own logic, or is too magnanimous to push it to its proper conclusion. If the term “personal effects ” is not limited to the meaning we have assigned to it, it must denote everything that is personal, for, except in . the way- which has been suggested, the testator restricted it by no bounds whatever. But the ex-ceptant has anchored midway in her voyage after results, and demands only, in addition to the jewelry and clothing, the furniture which was in the dwelling of the decedent. She can, however, only establish her title to that by showing that she is equally entitled to his money and stocks and every other item of his personal property. There is no escape from this position.If the excepted plate was furniture, then the gift of personal effects included the remaining furniture. But certain bequests of money were also excluded; the remaining moneys would therefore go to the exceptant, and money comprehends the securities which belong to the estate and likewise pass as effects. <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>Each of tbe cases cited will be found to bave turned upon the need of avoiding an intestacy, or, as in Kendall v. Kendall, upon the unmistakable anxiety of the testator to enumerate every species of property, in order that the legatee might take everything. Reimer’s Estate, <a href="/pa/159/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="159 Pa. 212" data-case-ids="850207" data-case-paths="/pa/159/0212-01">159 Pa. 212</a>, which was weighted with a dissenting opinion, was a gift to testator’s brother of “ any and all of my household goods, books, clothing, furniture, etc'., that he may desire; the balance of the personal effects to be divided among the children of my sister.” If -the brother took the specified articles, as he was entitled to, there would have been nothing, under a restricted meaning of “personal effects,” to go to the children, and there would have been an intestacy as to the great bulk of the personal estate.</p>
