The affidavit of defense admitted the hiring for a year, and alleged that defendant had quit work within the year; and further alleged that the commissions were to be based on the net profits for the entire year. At the trial he testified that he had served for the whole year. Bo objection was made to this testimony, nor did the defendant plead surprise, and the court charged that if plaintiff left before the termination of the year he was not entitled to commissions. A verdict was rendered for plaintiff on which judgment was entered. <em>Eeld, </em>that after such testimony had been received .without objection, and the case submitted to the jury on the evidence thus before them, it was too late to complain of the introduction of testimony that was not strictly relevant under the issue presented by plaintiff’s statement and defendant’s answer.</p>

If you find it in favor of the plaintiff you have to inquire further, and that is this, the contract was for a year. If he did not remain a year, if he left before the year was up, even a week before, the contract being whole, he cannot recover anything for his commissions, and especially so if he left to attend the fitting up of a competitive store alongside to take the custom. That was not good faith, not only a violation of contract, but it was anything else than good faith. Now the defendant asserts that he did do that, and the plaintiff denies. It is a question of fact for the jury. I simply say to you, if he did leave the employ for that or any other purpose, without the consent of the defendant, Mr. Smit, before his year was up, of course that ends his claim for commissions for the year, because he did not perform his part of the contract.] [1]</p>
