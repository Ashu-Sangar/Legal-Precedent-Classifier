Several times subsequent thereto, he, the deponent, tendered the instrument and demanded the return of the promissory note, and the plaintiff declined and refused to take the said instrument and surrender up the said note, and although the plaintiff further agreed to send for the instrument and remove the same when requested so to do, and knows where the same now is and that the same has always been since the maturity of the said note at his disposal, he still persists in the repudiation of his contract and agreement.</p>
