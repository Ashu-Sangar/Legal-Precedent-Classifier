    <p class="summary" id="b471-8" data-blocks='[["BL_471.17",471,[137,1375,1174,805]]]'>From tbe evidence presented, decedent entertained liberal views upon the subject of the connubial relation. Nor was he alone in this respect, for the two women with whom he consorted, and by each of whom he became the father of a family of children, were equally disposed to consider neither a marriage contract a prerequisite, nor an already existing contract of marriage unannulled an obstacle to cohabitation with him in the relation of husband and wife; both of whom, however, subsequently observed tbe formality of a religious ceremony of marriage with decedent. In the one case, her husband by a prior marriage was still living, undivorced from her; while in the other case she was a widow and had cohabited with decedent as his wife during several years prior to the ceremony of marriage with him. From all the facts proved, there is no question that at the date of decedent’s death the last-mentioned claimant was his lawful wife.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b471-9" data-blocks='[["BL_471.18",471,[142,2198,1170,199]],["BL_472.1",472,[261,353,1173,969]]]'>It was satisfactorily shown that Michael A. Clark, the decedent, some time between 1861 and 1864, and Ann McCartney, who was the undivorced wife of Patrick McCartney, a soldier in the United States army, lived and cohabited together as husband <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>and wife. Ann McCartney was never divorced from her husband, and when he was discharged from the army, and returned to this city, he discovered his wife to be living with decedent. Without making any trouble over the situation of affairs, after a short stay Patrick McCartney left this city without holding any communication with his wife. Pie remained away during many years and never returned until within three years ago; and although he had a sister in this city he did not correspond with her during this long absence. Upon his return to this city he was curious to see his wife again. Having discovered decedent’s residence, he called there, saw Iris wife, and recognized her. And when he addressed her she recognized him, but would hold no communication with him, and ordered him away, with threats of personal violence. He visited his sister, and after a brief stay again left the city, returning to his residence in the Soldiers’ Home, in the state of Maine, where he is still an inmate. He appeared before the auditing judge, much to the surprise of his sister, who did not know of his coming to this city, she being in attendance as a witness.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-4" data-blocks='[["BL_472.5",472,[260,1330,1171,247]]]'>Decedent and Ann McCartney lived together as husband and wife in this city about thirty years, and until his death, and became the parents of five or six children.

Ann McCartney was not free to contract a subsequent marriage, as her husband was still living.</p>

Clark became acquainted with Theresa Gorman, then a girl of about sixteen or seventeen years of age, who resided with her parents in the same neighborhood wherein he resided. This was about 1870. On February 28, 1881, she became the wife of Francis J. O’Neill, but who died on October 19, 1888. In the latter part of 1884 she resided at New Centreville, Chester <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>county, Pa., and there Michael A. Clark visited her and began to live and cohabit with her, visiting her twice or three times a week. At the same time he maintained a residence in this city, which he occupied 'with Ann McCartney, who was reputed to be his wife, and his children by her. From that time until July 12,1891, he continued to occupy this illicit connection with Mrs. O’Neill, and one child, of whom they were the parents, was born during this period.</p>

Clark and Mrs. O’Neill were married in the Roman Catholic Church at Villa Nova by the rector. On August 25, 1891, a second child was born, and both the children were afterwards baptized in said church, Michael A. Clark and the mother of his children being present. At this time Michael A. Clark maintained his children and their mother at a residence occupied by them at Berwyn, Pa., at which place he visited them weekly, remaining a day, and then returning to his other residence in this city, where he also maintained his second family. His last visits to his family at Berwyn were on Sunday and Monday, August 18 and 14,1893. He remained until August 17, when he returned to this city, was shortly thereafter taken ill, and died at his home in this city on September 1, 1893.</p>
