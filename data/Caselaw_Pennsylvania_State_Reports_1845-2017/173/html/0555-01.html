Guggenheimer, purchased a large quantity of cloaks and reefers from the plaintiff. Guggenheimer represented in effect that defendant had $20,000 to $25,000 invested in her business; that she owed very little for merchandise, as nearly all her purchases were made for cash, and that those which were not made for cash were discounted before the time was up; that she was doing a larger business than ever before; that the advertisements in the newspapers about her selling out were a mere blind, and that she was doing a rushing business. On the strength of these representations plaintiff alleged that he sold the goods, and allowed one week’s credit. On June 16,1894, Fannie Daniels made an assignment to Meyer G. Guggenheimer for the benefit of creditors. On June 12, 1894, four days prior to the assignment, plaintiff issued a writ of replevin for the goods which he had sold to defendant.</p>

The latter testified that he bought the goods in question for the defendant and that he had authority to buy either for cash or on credit, whichever he saw fit to do. The goods were therefore actually purchased for the defendant by her agent, they were delivered to her and nearly all of them were found in her possession at the time the writ of replevin was issued and served. The plaintiff testified that at the time of the purchase certain representations were made to him by Guggenheimer as to the financial responsibility of the defendant, and that he stated certain reasons why she could not pay immediate cash for the goods, but that the money would be paid the following week. If these representations were made as stated by the plaintiff, the subsequent events which occurred very quickly after the sale, tended strongly to prove that they were false. The goods were sold on May 29, 1894, and on June 16th following, the defendant made a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors. The question of the making of the representations and of their truth or falsity, was as a matter of course, exclusively for the jury. The witness denied making them but the plaintiff testified positively, and with emphasis, giving precise details, that they were made, and that it was only upon the faith of the representations that he opened the account and shipped the goods. That the defendant was responsible for the acts and declarations of her agent under whose contract of purchase she received the goods is too plain for argument, and is not at all disputed. Whether the agent had authority to make the representations in question or not, is quite immaterial. The test of liability is that the goods were received by the defendant under the contract made by the agent. In Wheeler &amp; Wilson v. Aughey, <a href="/pa/144/0398-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="144 Pa. 398" data-case-ids="823749" data-case-paths="/pa/144/0398-01">144 Pa. 398</a>, we held that, “ If an agent obtains possession of the property of another by making a stipulation or condition wMch he was not authorized to make, the principal must either return the property, or if he receives it, he must be subject to the condition upon which it was parted with by the former owner.” In Jones v. National Building Association, <a href="/pa/94/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="94 Pa. 215" data-case-ids="486234" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0215-01">94 Pa. 215</a> <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>we said, Paxson, J., “ The contention on the part of the association plaintiff is, that the secretary had no authority to make the'representations by which said Jones was induced to sign the note as surely; that it was therefore a fraud and not binding on said association; that is, the latter could repudiate the fraud and yet hold on to its fruits. This cannot be done. Common honesty and the law of the land alike forbid it. Whether the association was incorporated or unincorporated, whether the secretary was or was not authorized to make the representations to Jones, it is clear that the association cannot have the benefit of the security and at the same time repudiate the contract by means of which they obtained it. No principle of law is better settled than that a man cannot reap the fruits of his agent’s fraud: Musser v. Hyde, <em><a href="/watts-serg/2/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 314" data-case-ids="1853531" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0314-01">2 </a></em><a href="/watts-serg/2/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 314" data-case-ids="1853531" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0314-01">W. &amp; S. 314</a>; Hunt v.
