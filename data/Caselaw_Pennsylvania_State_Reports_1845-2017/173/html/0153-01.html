The praecipe and writ contained several errors in describing the land for which the action was intended to have been brought; and, doubtless on that account, the defendants filed a disclaimer of “ any estate in the lands described in the plaintiff’s writ, ... as the same is a different tract or parcel of land from that of the defendants’ lands.” A verdict for plaintiff for six cents and costs was directed by the court, and judgment was subsequently entered thereon and a habere facias possessionem issued. That writ was returned unexecuted because of the errors in the description. About six months thereafter, without notice to defendants, the plaintiff procured an order of court amending the record, and thereupon issued an alias habere facias. Subsequently, rules taken by defendants to stay the alias habere and to strike off the amendment were made absolute by the court.</p>

Withdrawal of the disclaimer, in connection with the amendment of description, would introduce a new issue not passed upon at the trial.
