On November 10,1894, the court made absolute a rule, taken by the plaintiff, to show cause why judgment should not be entered against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. On November 17, 1894, the defendant obtained a rule on plaintiff to show cause why the assessment of damages should not be amended, meanwhile proceedings to stay. Depositions were taken on this rule and December 22,1894, it being agreed by counsel for plaintiff and defendant that the rule should be treated as a rule to open judgment, the rule was made absolute by the court.</p>

It was further averred that at the time of this conversation George E. Gaskill, the contractor employed by plaintiff to put in the boiler, engine and stack of said plant, stated that the boiler, engine and stack were then worth just what he had charged for it, to wit, $645.47; that the plaintiff and defendant agreed that if the defendant could find a purchaser for the dynamo attached to said plant, he, the defendant, would try to sell the dynamo for the plaintiff; that the defendant did find a purchaser for the price of $500, at which price the defendant agreed to sell it, erect it, and guarantee it for a year; that the plaintiff agreed that it would accept the person found by the defendant as the purchaser thereof; that the amount due $1,402.50 should be reduced by deductions therefrom as follows: Value of engine, boiler and stack, $645.47, price of dynamo $500, potential indicator, three-pole switches, and other attachments pertaining thereto, $40.00, an endless belt, $12.00; that the balance of $205.03 defendant did not think he ought to pay, as the plant failed in its purpose, as set forth in the affidavit of defense.</p>

    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.9",353,[129,1081,1179,445]]]'>In November, 1894, judgment in default of sufficient affidavit of defense was entered against the defendant. On his application, a week thereafter, a rule to amend the assessment of damages was granted. By agreement of counsel for both parties that rule was “ treated as a rule to open the judgment ” theretofore entered; and on December 22, 1894, the same was made absolute. The action of the court in thus opening the judgment and letting the defendant into a defense is assigned as error.</p>
    <p id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.10",353,[130,1545,1180,599]]]'>The proceeding under the rule, as modified by agreement,, was virtually an appeal to the equity power of the court which, in all judgments by default, may be invoked by the defendant. In such applications, “ it is proper for the court to weigh the evidence and decide according to the preponderance thereof, and this court will not reverse for the exercise of a sound discretion:” Wernet’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/91/0319-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="91 Pa. 319" data-case-ids="488363" data-case-paths="/pa/91/0319-01">91 Pa. 319</a>. That appears to have-been done in this case. The record fails to show that the discretion, with which the court is invested in all such cases, was not properly exercised. There is nothing in either of the assignments of error that requires further notice. They are both dismissed.</p>
