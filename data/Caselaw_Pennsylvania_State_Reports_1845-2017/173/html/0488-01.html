Plaintiff and a friend who was driving in a one horse buggy approached them from the opposite direction. Ahead of plaintiff and his friend, on the right hand or same side of the road about three feet from the gutter, was a two horse Germantown wagon being driven southward at a slow pace. As the driver of the buggy turned to the left to pass the wagon in front, the horseback party, four abreast, came up. There was space for all, but as they met, the width between the Germantown wagon and the nearest horse, on which defendant’s son was riding, seemed narrow for plaintiff’s buggy to pass, and defendant’s son at his father’s suggestion attempted to fall back behind the other three riders just as plaintiff’s driver pulled his horse again to the right to get in front of the Germantown wagon. This movement threw the hind wheel of the buggy towards the left of the roadbed. The horse on which defendant’s son was riding backed and, swerving a little, ca,me into collision with the left hind wheel of the buggy. The wheel broke, plaintiff’s horse took fright and ran away, and plaintiff was thrown out and severely injured. Held, that neither defendant nor defendant’s son was guilty of negligence, and that plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>

      <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>When an accident happens whereby serious injury results to some one, human sympathy is quickened, and usually jumps at once to two conclusions, first, that the accident might have been avoided, and second, that some one was negligent or it would not have happened. The first is generally correct; the second very often is not. Take the case before us: If public parks are to serve their purpose, are to be resorted to by the public of a great city, in search of health and pleasure, there is some degree of risk incident to the use, which risk can only be absolutely avoided by not going near them. Horses do not always obey the voice of, nor axe they always controllable by the reins of the most careful and expert riders and drivers. Every one using the driveways of the park is in some danger, not only from his own animal, but from those of' others, which at times become uncontrollable. To be wholly free from such danger, one must neither ride nor drive. And still further, by very exceptional care in the use of driveways, some accidents might be avoided; here, if the plaintiff had stopped on the right hand side of the road until the horseback riders had passed; or, if the latter had stopped until plaintiff had passed; or, if instead of trotting their horses, they had both slowly walked them, the accident would not have happened. But with a clear roadway thirty-eight feet wide, there was ample room, without apparent danger, for greater speed than a walk. And while it may be said the accident could have been avoided, up to this point, there is no evidence of want of care according to the circumstances, on part of either, in getting into the situation which resulted in the injury. All that can be said is, the accident was avoidable by the exercise of extraordinary caution by either, a degree of care to which neither was bound; there was a remotely possible danger in a buggy passing four horses on a roadway almost wide enough for the passage of two troops of cavalry, but so remotely possible, there was no want of care in either attempting it at the moderate gait plaintiff alleges each was going. It is not negligence not to foresee and avoid the barely possible; the natural and probable consequences of one’s acts must be foreseen and provided against.</p>

Where is the negligence in this ? Where the want of care according to the circumstances ? Cohen is endeavoring to make room for Collins’ buggy, that a collision may not occur. Assume the fact to be as plaintiff alleges, that Cohen’s horse backed across the road when checked by the reins in the hands of “his rider; it is not pretended he tried to imperil himself and horse by placing the haunches of the latter in the way of a fast moving buggy wheel. To fix the liability of the father, plaintiff strenuously contends, the son was obeying the father’s command to fall back. This is doubtless true; the son attempted to obey and checked.his horse; the animal backed partly across the road. Is defendant to be held answerable, because, in a sudden emergency, thrust upon him by the rapid movement of the horse and buggy, the dumb animal did not fall back in a straight line, as his rider attempted to direct him ?</p>

Both plaintiff’s and Collins’ testimony is, that they had turned out to the left to pass the Germantown wagon, and when in the act of turning to the right, in front of it, their buggy was partly across the roadway; when they first turned to the left, neither of them saw the horseback riders; then, almost at the instant they saw them occurred the collision, the buggy striking the haunches of Myer Cohen’s horse. And the declarations of plaintiff immediately after the accident are wholly corroborative of his testimony at the trial; the only variance is, he now draws another inference from the same facts. C. S. Albany, Park Guard No. 8, rode with plaintiff in the ambulance the evening of the same day as the accident, the 17th of August, and made report of it to his superior the next day; he says he did not know Mr. Miller and he testifies his written report is true. This is the report:-</p>

No one with opportunity for observation of judicial proceedings, has failed to notice the lamentable infirmities of human recollection, and the tendency after the lapse of time to believe that which it is the interest of the witness to have appear as the truth. Hence, the judicial value given to testimony reduced to writing at the time the facts stated in it occurred.</p>
    <p id="b514-11" data-blocks='[["BL_514.11",514,[267,1788,1169,393]]]'>Dr. Rath, a witness called by and who attended plaintiff at the hospital, and rode with him in the ambulance when the statement was made to officer Albany, testifies thus : “ Q. Did he ever tell you anything about it? A. Nothing particular, only that he stated it was merely an accident and nobody to blame for it. Q. Where did he say that to you ? A. The first time on the way to the hospital in the ambulance; I went with him.”</p>

Do you know this gentleman, Mr. Albany ? (Indicating a person in the courtroom.) A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you remember seeing this gentleman there ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did he go up <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>to the hospital with you ? A. Yes, sir. Q.

And as you turned out from behind you ran into the horse coming from the opposite direction ? A. No, sir. Q. You did not say that? A. I don’t remember saying that. Q. Didn’t you say you did not see tiie horse coming or the accident could have been avoided? A. That part I might have said. I don’t remember that statement at all. The first I knew of that statement was one year ago — seventeen months after the accident occurred. I called on Dr. Rath to subpoena him for this case, when it was coming up for trial a year ago. Dr. Rath told me about this statement — (Objected to by plaintiff’s counsel.) Q. Did you ever tell Dr. Rath or the Cohen party or any one, in any way, that it was your own fault? A. No, sir.”</p>
    <p id="b515-5" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[133,1182,1173,600]]]'>The substance of this testimony is, that he does not recollect the statement to Albany, and he positively denies that he said the accident was his own or Collins’ fault. While he denies stating the inference testified to by Dr. Rath, that “nobody was to blame,” he testifies now to the facts which warrant precisely that inference and no other. Myer was not reckless or careless, but attempted to do that, which under the circumstances, care suggested. In attempting to do this, the peculiar position of the vehicle and the uncontrollable movement of the horse resulted in an accident for which blame attaches to neither; if to any one, it is to Collins, who says, while driving, he never looked to the left side of the road.</p>
    <p id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.6",515,[132,1799,1171,597]]]'>A careful examination of every word of plaintiff’s evidence fails to disclose any negligence on part of defendant. The jury, evidently, undertook to compensate plaintiff for a most grievous injury out of defendant’s pocket, because the latter and his party happened to be out riding at that particular place, when plaintiff and Collins desired to drive around a wagon in front of them. The cause of action against the owner of the Germantown wagon would have been just as well founded; if he had not been in front of plaintiff, the accident would not have happened; if defendant and his family had not been coming towards them it would not have happened; and this is the sum of the evidence to sustain the verdict.</p>
