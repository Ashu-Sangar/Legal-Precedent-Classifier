He further claims that it was being .used by the tenants of the defendants in a way that was not authorized under the lease, and that they were allowing other parties to use it. A man by the name of Seaton was mentioned as one of the parties who was using the gas. He claims that in other words if the defendant had used the gas in a reasonable and proper manner there was still sufficient left for his use for domestic purposes, and that the defendants were bound to supply him with gas for such purposes under the terms of the lease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b108-5" data-blocks='[["BL_108.5",108,[254,862,1164,1525]],["BL_109.1",109,[145,351,1168,355]]]'>Now, as I have said, the defendants claim that there was not more than a sufficient amount of gas obtained from the premises for the operation of the lease in a reasonable and proper manner, and they have offered testimony tending to show that there was only a sufficient amount for their own purpose for the operation of the lease in this way. They claim that there was, in fact, a shortage of gas during the greater portion of the time, and they offered evidence showing that during the operation of the lease they had to- purchase gas from other parties. I refer now to the gas furnished by Mr. McKirdy, evidence of which was given in the case. They had some testimony to show that during the operation of the lease they purchased wood from Mr. Fanlter, the plaintiff here, to operate the lease, and that they not only did not have a surplus of gas after they had used it for their own purpose, but that there was a shortage and that they had to purchase other gas and other fuel in order to operate their leases properly. They claim further that in the operation of the leases in a proper way it was necessary for them to have these .pipes for the escape of the gas, in order to regulate the pressure in the wells that were producing oil; that this escape of the gas through the pipes, in the manner that has been related by the witnesses, was nothing more than a reasonable, proper and safe manner of conducting the operations under this lease. They claim that the pressure of the' gas in the wells, if allowed to accumulate to a great extent, interfered with the flow of the oil. They claim that this safety pipe appliance, which has been testified to in your hearing, was necessary in the proper operation of the lease; that without such an appliance the pressure of the gas accumulating in the wells interfered with the flow of the oil and <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>hence interfered with the proper operation of the lease. If that is the case, they are entitled to maintain those safety appliances, because they are only required to operate the lease in a reasonable and proper manner, and if such appliance was necessary for the proper operation of the lease, then they were justified in using that appliance, even if some of the gas did escape and go to waste.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b109-3" data-blocks='[["BL_109.5",109,[146,713,1175,1482]]]'>But the plaintiff says that the wasting of the gas was wholly unnecessary, and he has witnesses to testify in your hearing that this waste was unnecessary and that the escape of the gas through the pipes, or the shutting of it in the well, did not interfere or affect in any way the flow of the oil from the well. So that is a question of fact for you to determine. But if you find that such appliances as were used by the defendants were needed in the proper operation of the well, then they were justified in using those appliances, even if some of the gas did escape. And the plaintiff again complains of that. [But if the waste was wholly unnecessary, if the use of the gas in the operation of the lease was in an unreasonable and improper manner, and the plaintiff here was deprived, by that improper or unreasonable use of the gas, of the gas which he was to have under the terms of the lease for domestic purposes, then he is entitled to recover for that. So that, gentlemen, is the first, and it seems to me the most important question for you to determine.] [5] The other item is claimed for gas sold. It seems that while the gas was not piped off the premises, yet there was an arrangement by which the defendants furnished steam for the pumping of the well on an adjoining farm, this Passavant well. The plaintiff claims that that was a use of the gas that was equivalent to the sale of the gas off the premises, because they received pay for that gas. But the defendants claim that under this arrangement for the pumping of the Passavant well they received, it is true, $35.00 in cash, but they also received gas from that very same well which served to furnish the heat for the pumping, and that no portion of that $35.00 was for gas used from these premises.</p>

If any portion of that gas, or if any of the cash payments that were made went to pay for the gas produced upon these premises, for that much of it the plaintiff is to be allowed his proportion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AvD" data-blocks='[["BL_110.5",110,[261,609,1166,502]]]'>But the defendants claim that there was no portion of the cash payment made for the gas. That while they received the $35.00 a month for the pumping of that well, they also received gas from the same well in lieu of the gas that was furnished from the Fanker farm, and that no portion of that cash payment of $35.00 a month, is the plaintiff entitled to. If any portion of it is for the gas from the Fanker farm, to his portion of that is the plaintiff entitled. But as I have said, the burden is upon him to show what, if any, portion of the cash payment was for the gas.] [6]</p>

    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.9",111,[152,751,1169,1271]]]'>This action was brought on a lease of land for oil and gas purposes. After providing for the payment of a royalty on the oil produced, the lease contains the following clause, which is the basis of this suit: “ It is further agreed that if gas is obtained in sufficient quantities and utilized off these premises, the consideration in full to the party of the first part shall be the free use thereof for domestic purposes, and one eighth of the gas sold for each and every gas well drilled on the premises herein described and piped off the same.” A number of wells —producing oil in paying quantities, and also some gas in greater or less quantities — were drilled. It was claimed by plaintiff that gas had been obtained in sufficient quantities and. utilized off the premises to entitle him to receive free use thereof for domestic purposes. He also claimed that defendant company sold gas obtained from these wells, for the purpose of pumping a well on an adjoining farm. These items of claim were resisted by the defendant company, but there was some evidence tending to sustain each of them. The testimony, it is true, was conflicting, but it was sufficient to warrant its submission to the jury on questions of fact which were exclusively for their consideration. It was carefully submitted to them by the learned president of the common pleas in a clear, well guarded charge in which the provisions of the lease were properly construed, and the questions of fact involved correctly presented.</p>
