The building was subsequently leased, and the lease provided that improvements put upon the premises by the lessee should be left thereon upon the surrender of the premises. In 1887 plaintiff filed a mechanic’s lien against the building. The bill of particulars appended to the lien averred that plaintiff had contracted “to partition off by a wooden partition, eleven feet by eleven feet four inches from one of the rooms in the building, on the premises, two hundred and sixty feet northward from the north side of Columbia avenue, a space of the foregoing dimensions for office purposes.” At the trial of the scire facias the evidence as to the nature of the construction sustained the averment in the bill of particulars. The court charged that if the work done by the plaintiff was a part of the original building the verdict should be for the plaintiff. <em>Held,, </em>to be error, as the work lacked every mark of being part of the original structure.</p>

Hall, two of these defendants, became the owners of it, and they, on the 18th of June, 1886, leased it to Emil Baumblatt for a term of three years at an annual rental of $600 for the first year and $1,200 for each of the remaining two years. There is no covenant on part of lessee to build or improve. There is, however, this stipulation: “All improvements put upon said premises by the said lessee are to be left thereon upon the surrender of said premises, and are to become the property of the said lessor. But nothing herein contained is to be taken as rendering the said lessor of the said premises liable for such improvements or for such repairs.”</p>
    <p id="b332-4" data-blocks='[["BL_332.5",332,[244,902,1172,557]]]'>After being in possession nearly a year under his lease, Baumblatt employed Charles M. Hall, plaintiff, to do some work at the building, which was done, and Hall, not being paid therefor, he, on November 23, 1887, filed a mechanic’s lien in the sum of $90.00 against the owners, joining with them Baumblatt as contractor. The bill of particulars appended to the lien avers, that Baumblatt contracted with Hall, “ to partition off by a wooden partition, eleven feet by eleven feet four inches from one of the rooms in the building on the premises, two hundred and sixty feet northward from the north side of Columbia avenue, a space of the foregoing dimensions for office purposes.”</p>

On these facts, the learned judge of the court below submitted the case to the jury in the following charge: “ If the work done by the plaintiff was a part of the original building, your verdict should be for the plaintiff. If however it was simply repairs or alterations or an addition to tie original building, your verdict should be for the defendant.”</p>
