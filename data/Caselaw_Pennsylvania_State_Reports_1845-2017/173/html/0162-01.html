      <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>The defendants were engaged in making an excavation for new buildings at their works at Homestead. The excavation was to be about fifty feet square and fifteen feet deep. The plan adopted was to dig a trench eight feet wide around the outside of the full depth, and afterward remove the core. The purpose of this was to provide means for bracing the sides in case of necessity. The work was laid out by the engineer, and its execution was under the direction of John Molamphy, superintendent of labor. A considerable amount of work had been done on the southern and eastern side, and perhaps some, but not much on the northern and western. The work was being prosecuted at night as well as by day. The deceased was engaged on the night gang, and had been at work three or four nights. He was not an ordinary laborer, but was so employed in absence of work at his usual employment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b183-5" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[112,1131,1179,556]]]'>A great many excavations had been made in this ground, which was the site of the City Poor Farm which had been purchased from the city of Pittsburg, some of them to a greater depth than fifteen feet. The ground was generally clay or shale with a layer of sand at the depth of about eleven feet. It was generally found necessary to shore the sides of the cut and brace them upon reaching the sand; and in some instances before doing so. An ample supply of plank and braces was provided, and on the ground, ready for use when necessary. Carpenters were within call, charged with the duty of putting the braces in place.</p>

They were instructed to call on Mr. Molamphy or the carpenters whenever bracing was needed in daytime or at night. When the day turn went off duty on the day of the accident, about six o’clock, the eastern trench was about .six or seven feet deep. About this time Mr. Molamphy and the boss carpenter were there and decided that it was not necessary to brace at that time. The night gang went to work and about eleven o’clock they had reached a depth of ten or eleven feet in the eastern trench, when a portion of the inner wall fell, resulting in the death of Durst and the serious injury of another ■workman. It did not clearly appear whether or not they had .at that time reached the sand, though it is possible they had not.</p>

The engineer of the defendant company had procured a diagram showing the location of these pipes, but it did not appear whether he had shown it to any other official. They, however, knew that these pipes were there, having encountered them in other excavations, and Mr. Molamphy had given instructions to the foreman that no pipe which might be discovered should be cut until it had been examined specially with reference to its use. During the afternoon of October 18,1893, a pipe sewer was discovered crossing the southern trench, and running north and south through the core parallel with the eastern trench and about eighteen inches to two feet from the side of the cut, and about six or seven feet below the surface. After the embankment had fallen away this pipe was exposed. This was known to the foreman of the day gang but he did not inform Mr. Molamphy of the fact. It further appeared that the ground in this trench was hard clay or shale.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b184-4" data-blocks='[["BL_184.5",184,[276,1283,1177,865]]]'>This we think is a full and fair statement of the case as shown by the testimony. There was no evidence as to any difficulty caused by sewers in other excavations nor that by the nature of the ground there was any apparent danger from the proximity of this sewer to the cut — nor any indication of danger from any source which would have been discovered by proper care, so that plaintiff’s case depended solely on the fact that the sewer was close to the cut, that the defendants knew or should have known that it was there and should have provided against it. Upon motion a compulsory nonsuit was granted. Upon motion to take off nonsuit, counsel for plaintiff have furnished us with an admirable brief referring to all the important cases upon this subject, but after a full consideration of these cases and the able argument of counsel, we are of the opinion that the court did not err in entering the nonsuit. The principles of the law governing such cases are well established- — the difficulty arises in their application to particular cases.</p>

This includes accidents caused by the negligence of coemployees.

The danger could only arise as the work progressed and be caused by the work done. In such a case we do not think it is the duty of the employer to stand by during the progress of the work to see when a danger arises. It is sufficient if he provides against such dangers as may possibly or probably arise and to give the workmen the means of protecting themselves. They should look out for such dangers and use the means provided: McKinzie v. Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=46%20Leg.%20Int.%20506" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="46 Leg.

But it is said that the accident in this case occurred because of the proximity of a sewer to the place of working; that this was known to the company or ought to have been known, before the deceased went to work that evening. That the location of the sewer and its relation to this trench might have been known by using the plot in the possession of the engineer, and making accurate surveys of the ground, is certain. It is possible that it might have been known from the course of sewers struck in other excavations, but it does not appear to have been actually known to Mr. Molamphy, the superintendent. It was known to McMillan, one of the foremen, but he did not tell Mr. Molamphy. But with all this, plaintiff’s case fails in proof that a failure to ascertain the exact location of this sewer and to know that it had been struck that afternoon was negligence of duty on part of the company. There is no evidence that the existence of sewers in the ground was in itself an element of danger and rendered excavations unsafe. That would depend on the size and character of the sewer and nature of the ground.</p>

There was no evidence that there was any indication of weakness before the accident happened, presumably there was not, or the foreman would have ordered the shoring. There was no evidence of the condition of the ground afterwards; whether it fell from the top only or from under the sewer as well. So that the fact that the accident was caused by the sewer would only be an inference, from the fact that after the fall it was exposed. In other words it would be to infer negligence from the happening of the accident merely: Heating Co. v.

In such a case he is only bound to reasonable care. He is not bound to provide against danger that an ordinarily prudent man would not anticipate. To hold defendants responsible, the evidence should show that the sewers presented a dangerous obstruction to excavation, and that any ordinary skilled and prudent man would have known it. As before said, this would depend on the size and <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>character of the sewer, and the nature of the ground, and could only be ascertained in the progress of the wort. There was no evidence in the case upon this subject, and the testimony as to the nature of the ground would tend to show that no such danger would be apprehended. So that in order to convict defendants of negligence, it would be necessary to infer, from the mere happening of the accident, that it was caused by the sewer, and that the danger was apparent and was known or should have been known to the defendants. Unless this last fact is found, then the duty of notification would not arise. Defendants of course could not be required to notify an employee of a danger they did not apprehend or have reason to apprehend.</p>
