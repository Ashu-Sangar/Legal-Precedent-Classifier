Defendant filed an affidavit of defense in which he averred that the note had been given under an agreement that it should be paid out of the profits arising from the business which plaintiff and defendant were carrying on ; that plaintiff had filed a bill for the dissolution of the partnership and tbe appointment of a receiver, against the protest of defendant, and without any cause warranted by the condition of the business; that this action of the plaintiff injured the credit of the firm and defendant, and resulted in a loss to defendant largely in excess of the amount of the note, and rendered it impossible for him to acquire or receive the profits out of which the note was to be paid. <em>Held, </em>that the affidavit was insufficient to prevent judgment.</p>

Afterwards, on or about November 2, 1893, the court dissolved the partnership and appointed a receiver. This action was instituted by the said Thomas Lee alone. Deponent protested against it at the time, and still believes that it was unnecessary and unwarranted by the condition of the affairs of the copartnership as they existed at that <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>time, and as a proof of that fact the receiver has substantially wound up the affairs of the copartnership, wherein all creditors have been paid in full, and a large balance awarded to the said Thomas Lee.</p>

The goods on hand were sold at from thirty per cent to thirty-five per cent below their value. Outstanding accounts became worthless, and the real estate, which had been taken by the firm at a valuation of 155,000, and upon which had been expended by the firm for machinery and improvements about $10,000, was sold at sheriff’s sale, after the appointment of the receiver, for $29,600.</p>

And this would have produced to the deponent thirty per cent thereof, equal to $9,000. It is a fact, however, that no profits were received by deponent from the business except the $3,000 hereinbéfore mentioned, which was paid over to the said Thomas Lee at or about the time of the making of the notes in this suit, and before the maturity thereof, and no profits have been received since, and nothing was awarded to deponent out of the partnership estate in the hands of the receiver except his claim for wages.</p>
