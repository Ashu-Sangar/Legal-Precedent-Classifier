Judgment was entered upon the judgment note. Defendant denied that he was a member of either firm and alleged that plaintiff and M. were partners under both firm names. He claimed that the acceptance by the plaintiff of the judgment note and entry of judgment thereon was a satisfaction of the note upon which suit was brought. <em>Iield </em>(1) that the case was for the jury; (2) that the acceptance of the judgment note was not necessarily a release of defendant on the note in suit; (3) it was not competent for defendant to prove that he and M. made an agreement whereby M. assumed all liabilities and indebtedness incurred in the business, and that plaintiff had possession of the agreement, and knowledge of its contents; (4) that an instruction that plaintiff could not recover unless he proved affirmatively that defendant was a partner of M. was'all that defendant was eutitled to; (5) the findings of fact necessarily implied in the verdict were conclusive of plaintiff’s right to recover.</p>

    <p id="b459-9" data-blocks='[["BL_459.13",459,[114,1594,1172,502]]]'>This case hinged on questions of fact which it was the. exclusive province of the jury to determine according to the weight of the evidence relating thereto. So far as they were material, the questions presented by the testimony were accordingly submitted by the learned trial judge with instructions which appear to be adequate and free from substantial error; and a verdict for plaintiff was rendered. In the absence of error, on the part of the court, the findings of fact necessarily implied in the verdict are conclusive of plaintiff’s right to an affirmance of the judgment.</p>

K. Miles &amp; Co., and the Union Export Trading Company. In default of this, the plaintiff cannot recover.” <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>With, a single exception, the remaining points thus refused constitute the subjects of complaint in the first to tenth specifications, respectively. We have considered the questions involved in these specifications and find nothing in any of them that would justify a reversal of the judgment; nor do we think that either of them requires discussion. There was no error in rejecting the offer of evidence recited in the last specification.</p>
