He was not formally elected a member or manager.

Goldbeck had a large interest in the Identity Indicator Company, Limited, a partnership association formed under the act of June 2, 1874; that on July 24, 1891, he assigned to D. C. Chalfant a one eighth interest in said company for the consideration of $250 in cash and a note for $250 payable in sixty days from the date of the agreement. On the same day Goldbeck and Chalfant entered into an agreement in writing by which it was stipulated that if ■Chalfant should not within sixty days from date be elected a member and manager of the said company, Chalfant should reassign the one eighth interest to Goldbeck, and Goldbeck should refund to Chalfant the purchase money. Chalfant was never formally elected a member or manager, but with the consent of all parties interested he assumed control of the affairs of the •company, and continued to control them for seven months from the date of the assignment. During this time he received $25.00 per week for his services. On February 1, 1892, Chalfant executed a reassignment to defendant of said one eighth interest, and subsequently brought an action upon the contract to compel Goldbeck to refund the $500 purchase money paid.</p>

At the same time, or very soon afterwards, after the contract had been entered into by agreement and arrangement of all the parties in interest, — the plaintiff, the defendant, and all the parties interested in the company, —the plaintiff took possession of the business of the company, and it appears from the evidence that he exercised all the rights of manager, he controlled tins whole business, he made contracts, he made arrangements for the conduct of the business, and he did everything except the mere formal signing of the checks, which was done by the treasurer.</p>

[He had a right, inasmuch as he was not formally elected a member and manager, to demand the return of the note, and the return of the money which he had paid. He could, at least, have made complaint of some kind to the defendant that he had not literally carried into effect the contract entered into with him. In addition to that he could have shown that he considered a literal compliance with the terms of the contract to be of importance by insisting upon its literal compliance or the return of the money; or he could have made manifest, in some way, that he considered the literal compliance with the contract of some use, importance and value to him. There is no evidence that he did any of these things, which the law gave Irim the right to do. If he considered it to be important that the contract should have been complied with, he should have made it manifest in some way.</p>

So that you see he was, in effect, placed precisely in a position such as he would have been in, had there been a literal and formal compliance with the contract, had he been formally elected a member and manager.

Was he satisfied, instead of being formally elected a member and manager, with the condition of affairs which gave him absolute control over the business, and which gave him all the powers which a member would have — all the powers of a manager, and in addition to that received a regular salary of $25.00 per week ?

Without referring specially to the testimony, it is sufficient to say that the facts and circumstances properly in evidence tended to prove such mutual waiver, and thus presented a question of fact for the exclusive determination of the jury. It follows that there was no error in refusing plaintiff’s points recited in the first six specifications, nor in charging the jury as set forth in the remaining specifications. Considered as a whole, in the light of the testimony, the charge was neither unfair, nor misleading. The question of mutual waiver, on which the case hinged, was properly submitted to the jury, and the presumption is that it was rightly determined in favor of defendant.
