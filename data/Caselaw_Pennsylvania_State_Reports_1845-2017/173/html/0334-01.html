Section 12 of that act provides : “ That no corporation formed under the said act shall enter upon and occupy any street, lane, or alley in any incorporated city without the consent of such city having first been obtained.” It is clear, therefore, that this defendant possessed by virtue of its incorporation no right to build any part of its road, either main road or branch, without having first obtained the consent of the city of Philadelphia. The ordinance of May 31, 1877, referred to in its answer does not expressly or by implication affect any portion of the railroad which is the subject of this litigation, that is, the railroad commencing at the intersection of Cedar street and Lehigh .avenue, and running along Commerce, York, Gaul, Almond and Aramingo streets, as described. In that ordinance (see section 1) the city of Philadelphia consents only to the construction and ■operation by The River Front Railroad Company of a railroad upon Delaware avenue, between Dock street and the south side of Callowhill street, and nowhere else. It contains no assent whatever to the construction of the railroad referred to in this ■suit as a branch to the said defendant’s main line, and the only assent by the city of Philadelphia to the construction of this so-called branch is to be found in the ordinance referred to in the bill of complaint, approved June 23, 1884. The Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company was organized under the act of assembly approved April 4, 1833, entitled “ An act to authorize the governor to incorporate the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company,” and by the act approved April 12, 1864, entitled “ An act to extend so much of the provisions of the act to incorporate the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, approved April 13, 1846, as relates to the maldng of lateral or branch railroads, to the Lebanon Valley and Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Companies,” the powers conferred on the Pennsylvania Railroad Company as to laterals or branch roads were extended to the Philadelphia <em>&amp; </em>Reading Railroad Company. Neither the charter of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railroad Company, nor the act referred, to of 1864, contains any provision expressly requiring the consent of a municipality in order to enable that company to enter upon its streets. The master, however, is of the opinion that without such assent neither of the railroads defendant was competent to construct and operate a railroad <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>upon the said streets of the city of Philadelphia, independently of the requirement contained in the act of 1868, which by its terms applied only to railroad companies formed and created thereunder. Municipal consent is requisite to enable any railroad company, whether incorporated by special act of assembly or under the general railroad laws, to enter upon and occupy the public highway of the city, unless its charter contains authority therefor, in express terms or by necessary implication.
