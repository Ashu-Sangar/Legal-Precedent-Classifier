    <p class="syllabus" id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.8",421,[104,938,1174,1454]]]'>On a bill in equity restraining the removal of the tracks of a short line oí railroad, the court granted a preliminary injunction, and subsequently dissolved it. An appeal was taken from the decree dissolving the preliminary injunction. Forty-nine days before the first day of the next term of the Supreme Court, one of the Supreme Court justices granted a rule to show cause why a special supersedeas should not be granted returnable the first day of the following term, “ all proceedings and operations on the ground to stay meanwhile.” Under the uncontested facts the delay could not cause any appreciable injury to the plaintiffs, and a bond sufficient to protect defendants had been filed when the appeal was taken. The defendants were partners. The senior partner lived in Philadelphia, and had no connection with the operations on the ground in Union county, where the railroad was situated. A junior partner had charge of these operations. The senior partner was, however, actively engaged in the partnership affairs in other localities. A copy of the rule for a supersedeas was served on defendants’ attorney in Union county, and also upon the senior member of the firm in Philadelphia, but no service was made upon the junior partner, or upon any one where the operations of removing the railroad were being conducted. Neither the attorney northe senior partner notified the junior partner of the rule, and the operations were continued and the railroad removed before the return day of the rule. <em>Held </em>(1) that under the circumstances of the case there was no reason for requiring additional security to be entered when the rule for the supersedeas was granted; (2) that inasmuch as the railroad had been removed, and an order for a supersedeas pending the appeal would have nothing to operate on, the Supreme Court would suspend the decree on the rule until final hearing of the appeal; (3) that service of a rule upon defendants’ attorney, was not service upon the defendants, and the attorney was under no obligation to notify the defendants of the rule; (4) that the senior partner was guilty of contempt of court in not notifying the junior partner of the rule, and in not taking steps to have the order of court obeyed; <em>(5) </em>that the fact that no special bond had been filed when the rule for supersedeas was awarded did not invalidate the order, and furnishes no reason why an attachment ought not to issue for disobedience of it.</p>

After hearing testimony, on November 6,1895, in opinion filed, the court dissolved the injunction; from this decree plaintiffs appealed to this court, filing bond with approved surety in sum of $10,000, and followed this on November 18, by application in vacation to <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>Justice Mitchell of this court for an order of supersedeas pending the appeal; on this application same day he indorsed this order: —“ Rule granted to show cause why special supersedeas should not be granted, returnable to Monday, January 6th, 1896, all proceedings and operations on the ground to stay meanwhile.”</p>
    <p id="b424-4" data-blocks='[["BL_424.5",424,[284,660,1170,1528]]]'>It will be noticed, no additional bond was required preliminary to the order; but this was wholly within the discretion of the Justice awarding the rule. He simply directed the situation of the parties as it existed before the dissolution of the preliminary injunction should be maintained forty-nine days longer. As such short delay, under the uncontested facts, could not result in appreciable damage to defendants, and as the bond already filed was amply sufficient, there was no reason for exacting additional security. And the rule having been awarded in vacation, it was made returnable before this court the earliest day possible, that is, the first day of the term. On the same day it was awarded, copies of the rule and order of supersedeas were served on William Whitmer, senior partner of Whitmer &amp; Sons, defendants. He resided in Philadelphia, and, so far as appears, had no connection with the operations of the partnership on the grounds in Union county; he was an active member of the partnership, however, in other localities. On the 19th of November, the day following the granting of the rule, a copy was handed to Andrew A. Leiser, Esq., attorney for defendants, at his office at Lewisburg. Charles Steele, a member of the partnership, resided at Sunbury, where was the partnership office; he was in charge of the work on the ground, employed the men and directed their operations, and on him the preliminary injunction issued by the court below, and after-wards dissolved, had been served. From some wholly unexplained neglect, no service of the order of supersedeas was made upon him or on those he employed. He, and the employees of his firm, continued taking up and removing the tram railway, after the order was served on William Whitmer, and in a few days the work was completed.</p>

    <p id="b425-4" data-blocks='[["BL_425.6",425,[121,826,1179,1022]]]'>As already noticed, the order to cease operations was served only on William Whitmer, residing in Philadelphia, and on Mr. Leiser, counsel for the defendants, in Union county. As to Mr. Leiser, he being in no sense a party to the proceedings, the order was not directed to him, and except as a matter of courtesy towards him, as opposing counsel, we see no reason why it should have been served upon him. He is a highly respectable member of the bar, and states distinctly, under oath, that he gave no notice of the order to his clients, because he assumed it had been served personally (as, in our opinion, it ought to have been) on Mr. Steele, the partner in charge of the work, and on whom had been served all the papers in the preceding litigation. This was an altogether warranted assumption by a lawyer; he had no reason to suppose his adversaries would not also procure service on the partner in active charge of the work, who was well known to them, and on whom previous service of the injunction was had. He was justified in presuming, if they wanted the work promptly and effectively stopped, the man who was carrying it on would at once he served with the order to stop it.</p>

True, he was in Philadelphia, and the subject of the litigation was in Union county; but he was a leading member of the firm which was asserting a right to tear up the road, and which he knew was at that time engaged in that very work. As a partner, it was within the scope of his authority to at once transmit an order to those in charge to stop work. He says, he told the officer <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>who served the order, that the case was in the hands of his attorney; he then states further, that personally, he had nothing to do with the removal of these rails, or with operations on the ground, the whole matter being in charge of his partner, Steele, and he wholly disclaims any intention to disregard the order. Taking these statements as true, and we have no reason to disbelieve them, they show such an indifference to the plain order of the court, and Iris own duty connected therewith, as to almost equal flagrant intentional violation of law. There is no evidence that he even attempted to communicate with Steele, his active partner on the ground, or with his counsel at Lewis-burg ; he, one of defendants, having, by law, the duty to obey and the right to command his copartners to respect the order, neither utters a word nor performs a single act significant of a desire to secure obedience to a writ issued in a suit of which William Whitmer &amp; Sons are parties defendant. In fact, he did not perform his duty as a suitor or a citizen. He doubtless hopes for a favorable decree on the merits of his cause, and expects the courts to enforce, with the whole power of the commonwealth, that decree, yet an interlocutory temporary order in favor of the adverse party he treats as not worth noticing by telegram or letter to his partner. Taking into view every circumstance which tends to exculpate, his own statement under oath to a great degree inculpates him; therefore, as to him, the rule is made absolute.</p>
    <p id="b426-4" data-blocks='[["BL_426.5",426,[253,1636,1169,504]]]'>One other matter calls for notice in connection with this decree. One of the reputable counsel for respondents to this rule has orally argued before the court, and gravely attempted to maintain this proposition in the printed paper-book: (1) That the order of Justice Mitchell of the 18th of November, 1895, was irregular, because previous thereto no special bond had been filed, and therefore (2) no attachment ought to issue for disobedience of it. Or, more concisely, if a party to whom a writ is directed questions its regularity, he can disobey it with impunity.</p>

We decided, the act of 1832 was still in force, and wisely confided to the orphans’ court the duty of fixing the security on appeals involving the large and complicated interests in litigation in that court, rather than in the prothonotary of this court. Every act of the judges displayed obedience to the law, and a willingness to submit to the orders of this court, as an appellate tribunal. If we had been of opinion the act of 1832 was repealed by the act of 1881, and had made absolute the rule for a peremptory mandamus, and the judges, on service of the writ, had refused to obey the command, or had treated it with contemptuous indifference, their conduct would have borne some resemblance to the attitude of defendants in this case.</p>

The remedy suggested here is to disobey them; while not altogether new, it is a somewhat rare one; it was proclaimed in 1776 in a paper known as “ The Declaration of Independence; ” we do not know that in this country it has been successfully resorted to since.</p>
