They lived together as man and wife, until Katrina’s death, at Yerona, Allegheny county, Pennsylvania, on December 2, 1893. There was no issue born of the marriage, and Henry Berg, believing his wife to be intestate, took out letters of administration upon her' estate and proceeded to administer thereon. His final account showed personal property in his hands as administrator to the amount of more than $13,000, which property, as shown by said account, he distributed to himself as the husband of the decedent. The account was confirmed absolutely by the orphans’ court of Allegheny county, on March 15,1895. The real estate left by the decedent is estimated to be worth the sum of $50,000.</p>

Hunter, a member of the bar, testified that on November 11,1891, Henry Berg and his wife called at his office in reference to some mortgages; that the conversation turned upon a remarkably short will of a person named Thompson, and that witness said that he could write even a shorter one. He scribbled on a piece of paper the following: “ I give all my property to my husband, and appoint him executor of this my will.” He handed the paper to Mrs. Berg, and that was the last he saw of it. On June 18, 1895, this paper was discovered signed at the end thereof “ Cassie Berg.” Three witnesses testified to the genuineness of the signature, and their testimony was corroborated by two experts.</p>

She always felt uneasy about' that Cassie Berg. She used to write her name with a “ C,” and she said one little hook might upset everything.

There is not even a reasonable suggestion of testamentary incapacity, dr of undue influence. The only question is as to' the proper execution of the instrument by the alleged testatrix. As to that, the genuineness of her signature thereto is clearly and satisfactorily established by the testimony of three disinterested witnesses familiar with her handwriting; and they are corroborated by the testimony of the experts. There appears to be nothing in the record that requires further comment. For these and other reasons, given by the learned judge of the orphans’ court, there was no error in refusing the issue and dismissing the appeal from the decision of the register.</p>
