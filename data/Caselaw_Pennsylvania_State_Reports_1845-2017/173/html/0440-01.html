    <p class="summary" id="b463-3" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[109,466,1177,555]]]'>The testamentary gift was in trust to pay the income to the two grandchildren of the testator equally for their respective lives, and on their several deaths in trust as to the corpus for the use of such of their children as should be living at their death, and the issue per stirpes of any who should be dead; and in case either of said grandchildren should die without leaving any children or issue of any deceased child living at ■such death, or if leaving such child or issue all of them should die under the age of twénty-one, without .issue, then the part intended for the one so dying should go the survivor of such grandchildren.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[106,1030,1178,1221]]]'>The limitation over was construed by the auditing judge to be upon the death of issue generally, a contingency which would have been undoubtedly too remote. But the issue intended were only those of a child who had died in the lifetime of the grandchild, and not as a then living child, the language of the will being, “ In case either of my said grandchildren shall die without leaving any children or the issue of any deceased child living at their death.” This contingency must certainly be determined at the death of the grandchild. The alternative contingency “ if leaving such child or issue all of them shall die under the age of twenty-one years, without issue,” must as certainly happen within the period of twenty-one years after the death of the grandchild. The case is perhaps anomalous, because it is entirely possible that the daughter of the deceased grandchild (whose share is now in dispute) may marry and have a child and die in her minority, and that the child shall also die within twenty-one years after the death of its grandparent. We shall then have representatives of two generations, both of them born after the death of the testator, and both of them dying within the time prescribed by the rule. This possibility was noted in the adjudication, but inasmuch as it must happen, if at all, within twenty-one years after the end of a life which was in being at the death of the testator, it cannot impair the validity of the limitation.</p>
