But the said plaintiff, Blanton, declined this proposal, and declared to this defendant that the said plaintiff had been in business for a long time, and knew the values of all the assets, and would give him a correct inventory thereof with the proper values. The defendant assented to this proposal, but only upon condition that the inventory and values of the assets should subsequently be found to be correct. The said plaintiff, Blanton, then valued his sháre of the assets of the said firm at the sum of five thousand five hundred dollars ($5,500), and at the same time informed this defendant that he was anxious to leave Philadelphia, and asked this defendant to execute the agreement referred to in the plaintiff’s statement of case. The defendant then and there informed the said plaintiff that in order to accommodate him he would execute the said agreement, only upon condition that the inventory made by the said plaintiff was a true one, and upon condition that the values put upon the assets of the firm should subsequently prove to be just and true ; and the defendant further says that it was upon the representation made by the plaintiff that the inventory made by the plaintiff and the values put upon the assets of the firm were just and true, that he was induced to execute said agreement and to pay the said $2,000 on account thereof, otherwise he would have never entered into said agreement.</p>

Subsequently, that is, after the execution of said agreement, this defendant, pursuant to Blanton’s representation, went to Atlantic City to have the said order put into the shape of a formal contract, but, to this defendant’s great surprise, he was informed that no such order was ever given to said plaintiff, Blanton. The said plaintiff, Blanton, also represented to this defendant that he had an order from John Q. Manard for four power machines, whereas, as a matter of fact, the order was only for two machines.</p>

Unfinished orders which said plaintiff, Blanton, repr resented to be worth $2,929.62, were found to be worth, at a correct valuation, only $2,765. That the terms of the contracts for unfinished work made by plaintiff, Blanton, with different parties, were not properly disclosed to this defendant at the time of the execution of said agreement, but having assumed them the said defendant was obliged to execute them at considerable loss to himself, particularly in the case of the contract made with Messrs. Wrenn &amp; Sons. That had the true nature of said contracts been made known to said defendant, he would not have assumed them.</p>

This, the defendant says, is contrary to all custom, and ruinous to business; that the said machine did not prove satisfactory to said Wrenn &amp; Sons, and the defendant was obliged to make good said contract at a great loss to himself.</p>
