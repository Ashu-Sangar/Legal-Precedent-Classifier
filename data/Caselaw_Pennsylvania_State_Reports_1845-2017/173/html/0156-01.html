    <p class="summary" id="b179-5" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[112,514,1180,1789]]]'>While it is true that the net income of the trust estate is directed to be disposed of in the discretion of testatrix’s husband, it is plain from the whole will that her children were the intended objects of her bounty and he but the trustee. The estate is in the first instance given in trust to be equally divided “ among her children,” the trust is then directed to be managed as the trustee shall “consider most” to their “advantage,” and when all shall have attained twenty-one years, distribution to be made to them with all convenient speed of the proceeds of the “entire estate,” “so that my intentions hereinbefore expressed that my children all share equally .... be fully carried out .... and the objects of my bounty may then have each of them entire control of their several separate estate.” The gift being expressly to them and the management of the trust for their “ advantage ” alone, the inference is that they were intended to have the benefit of the whole. A gift of the corpus is a gift of the income. True, the disposition of the income is intrusted to the discretion of the father; but this followed the express gift of the whole residuary estate to the “children,” and was coupled “ with the hope and belief, however, that he will use the same in such manner as will be advantageous ” to them, and was limited in duration to their minority. The mere direction that the income should be “paid” to the father and used in his discretion, was not intended to cut down their beneficial estate, but related simply to the manner of use by the children. The testatrix had already made in express words, and independently, provision for him, and if she had intended to give him any beneficial interest in this, would doubtless have said so. The express gift to the children alone, excludes any implication of an intent to vest a beneficial interest in him. The manifest purpose was to give him as head of the family control of the income, so that he might use it in his discretion as he might deem “ advantageous ” to the children until the youngest should attain majority. No beneficial interest was given him or intended to be given him.</p>

Can any one take the place of the father as the head of the family, or in determining the amount of “ income ” that may be used to the “ advantage ” of the children, or when the mansion shall be sold ? To ask these questions is to answer them in the negative. These are matters of personal trust as to which there can plainly be no substitution.</p>

The father would in that event be under a moral obligation which he might repudiate, but should he be presumed to have violated his wife’s trust and disappointed her “ children’s ” just expectations in the interest of his individual creditors ? Is there not as much reason to declare this a question of personal privilege as the plea of usury, coverture, statute of frauds and the like, of which creditors can take no advantage ? What equity have the creditors ? Them demand involves at least a breach of moral duty on the part of their debtor and injury to “ children ” for whose “ advantage ” the testatrix expressed her “ hope and belief ” the income should be used, and ought not in equity and good conscience to be made nor allowed: Shay v.
