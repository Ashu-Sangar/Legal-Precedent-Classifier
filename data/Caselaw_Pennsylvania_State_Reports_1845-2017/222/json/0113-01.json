They require good faith, but fraud is not presumed in them any more than in other cases. There must be some evidence of gross disproportion or other fact from which fraud may be inferred before the onus changes. As said by the learned judge below: \u201c The sum given in the present case was an outright gift; the wife took no chance; she Avas provided for in any and every event; whether her husband died rich or poor, Avhether he or she survived, was to her, so far as her temporal wellfare was concerned, a matter of no moment. A woman about to be married might readily accept outright a sum equal to one-sixth of her husband\u2019s estate, and at the same time be willing to accede to a proposition that she would relinquish at the time of his death that which the law would give her and which by right she should have and get.\u201d\nThe widow was clearly not a competent witness. As said by the learned judge below: \u201cThe contract did not prove itself ; two ivitnesses were called who identified the signatures of Joseph B. Robinson and of Helen M. Clawson; without this identification, the contract was not in evidence; the widow was then called, and her testimony was in effect a contradiction of the testimony of the tivo preceding witnesses; true, she did not deny her signature, but she did deny that in placing her signature to the paper in question, she intelligently signed the contract. In brief, her testimony was that Mr. Robinson had promised her the sum of $25,000 as a gift, telling her he was worth $100,000; had never explained to her that she was to renounce any legal rights as to dower, etc., and that the agreement he originally showed her was not as long as the one she was given to sign, in fact, was on one sheet of paper, and that, when she did sign, she did so upon the supposition that it was the previous contract rewritten, and not a new and a different one.\u201d But even if she had been competent she was claiming against her husband\u2019s estate in contradiction of her formal written agreement of which a duplicate had been in her possession for several years. The testimony was entirely inadequate for such purpose.\nJudgment affirmed",

T., 1908, by Helen O. Robinson, from decree of O. O. Phila. Co., July T., 1906, No. 287, dismissing exceptions to adjudication in Estate of Joseph B. Robinson, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Brown, Mestrezat, Potter and Elkin, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to adjudication.\nFrom the record it appeared that on October 2, 1902, Joseph B. Robinson was married to Helen M. Clawson. Prior to the marriage an antenuptial contract had been executed and acknowledged by the parties under which Mrs. Robinson was to receive $26,000 in consideration of her releasing all claims of dower and other rights in her husband\u2019s estate. The sum of $25,000 was subsequently paid to her. There was evidence that the decedent had told his wife that he was worth $100,000, but as a matter of fact he was worth about $150,000. The auditing judge, Lamorelle, J., refused to consider the testimony of the widow, to the effect that she had signed the paper in question under the belief that it was another and a different contract previously read to her. The auditing judge refused the widow\u2019s claim to participate in the estate.\nExceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court.\nError assigned was in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.\nJ. Quincy Hunsicker, with him John H. Schwacke and J. Quincy Hunsicker, Jr., for appellant.\nIn all cases of contracts between parties sustaining confidential relations affirmative proof is necessary on the part of the beneficiary. The burden is upon those claiming under the contract to prove affirmatively that no advantage was taken of the confidential relation ; that the contract was fair, adequate and equitable: that the contract was executed with a full knowledge of its provisions and their legal effect, and there must be the clearest proof of uberrima fides : Greenfield\u2019s Estate, 14 Pa. 489; Wistar\u2019s App., 54 Pa. 60; Kline\u2019s Est., 64 Pa. 122; Darlington\u2019s App., 86 Pa. 512; Miskey\u2019s App., 107 Pa. 611; Shea\u2019s App., 121 Pa. 302; Plankinton\u2019s Estate, 212 Pa. 235.\nJohn G. Johnson, with him Walter E. Rex, for appellee.\nThe testimony of the widow was not admissible to contradict her antenuptial contract: Hunt\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 590; DeSilver\u2019s Est., 32 Pa. Superior Ct. 174.\nThere was an absence of proof of inadequacy of consideration, such as raised a presumption that the antenuptial contract was fraudulent: Shea\u2019s App., 121 Pa. 302; Kline\u2019s Est., 64 Pa. 122; Tiernan v.
