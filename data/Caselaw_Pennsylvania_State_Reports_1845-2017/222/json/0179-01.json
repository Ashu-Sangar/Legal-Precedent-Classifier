        "text": "Opinion bx\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThe question presented by this appeal arises under the following clause of the testator\u2019s will: \u201c I also give to my niece, Clara R. Moyer, the life insurance policies which I hold on the life of A. C. Moyer, she to pay the premiums on the same till they mature.\u201d A. C. Moyer was the husband of Clara R. Moyer, and the testator held by absolute assignments two policies of insurance on his life. The testator paid the premiums for a number of years and charged them in ledger accounts headed \u201c A. C. Moyer Life Insurance policy, New York Life\u201d and \u201c Mutual Life Insurance Co., N. Y. Investment in policy on A. C. Moyer\u2019s life.\u201d The insured died before the testator, who received the proceeds of the policies and deposited them in his account in the bank of which he was president. He used the money received from the insurance with other money in the purchase of bonds, which he placed in a safe deposit box where he kept his securities. The auditor found that at the time of the assignment of the policies the testator was a creditor of the insured and had an insurable interest in his life; that there was nothing to indicate that the bonds purchased in part with the money received from the insurance companies were not the absolute property of the testator; and that the legacy was specific and was adeemed by the maturity and payment of the policies before the death of the testator. These findings were affirmed by the orphans\u2019 court.\nIt is conceded that under the findings of fact, the appellant can succeed only on the ground that the legacy was not specific and adeemed by the payment of the policies. It is argued with much earnestness and ability that the words in the bequest, \u201c she to pay the premiums on the same till they mature,\u201d disclose an intention on the part of the testator not to give his niece the insurance policies freed of any charge upon them, but to give her the proceeds of the policies less the amount of the premiums paid by him; and that the legacy was a bequest of a sum of money-payable out of a particular fund and was demonstrative and not adeemed by the payment of the policies.\nIn order to guard a legatee against the risk of ademption and in order that the legacy may be liable to contribution and abatement in case of a deficiency of assets, courts incline against construing legacies as specific. But this well-recognized doctrine must not be 'allowed to contravene the plain import of the will: Notes to Ashburner v. Macguire, 2 Leading Cases in Eq. *267. The bequest of the \u201c Life insurance policies which I hold on the life of A. C. Moyer\u201d is clearly specific. The added words, \u201c she to pay the premiums on the same till they mature,\u201d refers to payments that might become due after the policies passed by the will to the legatee. If they had been in force at the death of the testator, his niece would have received -them free of any charge for premiums paid by him. We think the conclusion expressed by the learned judge of the orphans\u2019 court, that it was \u201c the intention of the testator to give the policies to his niece on the condition and understanding that after his death his estate should no longer be chargeable with the maintenance of the same,\u201d is correct.\nThe decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.",

He used the money received from the insurance with other money in the purchase of bonds which he placed in a safe deposit box where he kept his securities, without indicating that the bonds were not his own. Held, that the legacy was specific and was adeemed by the maturity and payment of the policies before the death of the testator.\nIn order to guard a legatee against the risk of ademption and in order that the legacy may be liable to contribution and abatement in case of a deficiency of assets, courts incline against construing legacies as specific. But this well-recognized doctrine must not be allowed to contravene the plain import of the will.\nArgued April 21, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 132, Jan. T., 1908, by Ben. J. Hiltner, Administrator of Clara R. Moyer, deceased, a Legatee, from decree of O. C. Centre Co., No. 7,555, dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report in Estate of E. J. Pruner, deceased.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Brown, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nExceptions to report of S. D. Gettig, Esq., auditor.\nThe facts are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nJErroi' assigned was in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nO. M. Hewit, for appellant.\nThe character of a legacy, whether specific or demonstrative, is essentially a question of intention: Hoke v. Herman, 21 Pa. 301; Smith\u2019s App., 103 Pa. 559; Snyder\u2019s Est., 217 Pa. 71.\nIt is a rule of construction, becoming more firmly fixed in our jurisprudence from year to year, that courts are averse to construing legacies to be specific, and this is so mainly because of the principle of ademption: Smith\u2019s Appeal, 103 Pa. 559; Fryer v. Morris, 9 Ves. Jr. 360; Ives v. Canby, 48 Fed. Repr. 718; Corbin v. Mills, 19 Gratt. (Va.) 438; Nooe v. Vannoy, 6 Jones\u2019s Eq. (No. Car.) 185; Coleman v. Coleman, 2 Ves. Jr. 639.\nJohn G-. Love, with him P. J. Little and Harry Keller, for appellee.\nThe legacy was specific: Walls v. Stewart, 16 Pa. 275; Blackstone v. Blackstone, 3 Watts, 335; Ludlam\u2019s Estate, 13 Pa. 188; Hoke v.
