        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nIt appeared from the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he was injured by stepping into an open box or sluiceway constructed at the side of a city street and in a passageway provided from the end of a sidewalk to a bridge. The street ivas unpaved except for the space of five feet at the gutter at one side between the roadway and the footwalk. The bridge was of the width of the roadway only, and to prevent pedestrians from stepping off the end of the sidewalk into the stream there was a hand rail that extended diagonally from the outside of the sidewalk to the bridge. The sluiceway was eleven inches wide, ten inches deep, and extended from the bridge ten inches into the gutter, and was directly in the line in which travel was directed by the hand rail. It was not a gutter at a crossing where a break in the continuity of the pavement might be expected, but a hole in the footwalk provided, into which anyone directed by the hand rail was in danger of stepping. The plaintiff had no knowledge of the sluiceway and stepped into it late on a stormy night when the ground was covered with snow and he was following the course indicated by the hand rail. The case made out by him was clearly for the jury.\nThe main contention of the appellant is that a verdict should have been directed against the plaintiff because of a variance between his allegations and his proofs. The negligence alleged in the plaintiff\u2019s statement was that at a point where a street crossed a stream by means of a wooden bridge, the defendant had permitted to remain for several weeks \u201can unguarded opening or depression between the earthen part of the highway and the bridge planking.\u201d It is argued that the sluice-way was a' part of a special construction for the drainage of the street and not in a fair sense of the words \u201c an unguarded opening or depression,\u201d and that since it was surrounded by the stone pavement of the gutter it was not \u201c between the earthen part of the highway and the bridge planking.\u201d This contention cannot be sustained. The defect in the street proved was substantially that described in the statement.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

City of Pittston, Appellant.\nNegligence \u2014 Municipality\u2014Defect in street \u2014 Pleading\u2014Statement of claim \u2014 Allegata and probata.\nIn an action against a city to recover damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff by stepping into an open sluiceway in a passageway from the end of a sidewalk to a bridge, it appeared that from the end of the sidewalk to the bridge was a hand rail, and that anyone walking over -the passageway at night and guided by the hand rail was in danger of stepping into the sluiceway. Plaintiff\u2019s statement averred that at a point where a street crossed a stream by means- of a wooden bridge, the defendant had permitted to remain for several weeks \u201can unguarded opening or depression between the earthen part of the highway and the bridge plank.\u201d Held, that there was no variance between the allegations and the proofs, and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover.\nArgued April 15, 1908.\nAppeal, No. 84, Jan. T., 1908, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Luzerne Co., March T., 1905, No. 286, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Peter Conroy v. City of Pittston.\nBefore Mitchell, C. J., Fell, Mestrezat, Potter and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass to recover damages for personal injuries. Before Lynch, P. J.\nThe facts are stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.\nThe locality of the accident appears from the following drawings:\nDefendant presented this point:\n6. The declaration in this case alleges the defect in the highway to have been an unguarded opening between the earthen part of the highway and the bridge planking. The proof in this case is that a sluiceway eleven inches wide and nine and three-quarters inches deep extended from the end of the bridge into a paved gutter ten inches, the paving extending on three sides of the sluiceway. There is no evidence of an unguarded opening or depression between the earthen part of the highway and the bridge planking. Therefore, the verdict must be for the defendant; the answer of the court being:\nDenied without reading to the jury. [1]\nYerdict and judgment for plaintiff for $2,500. Defendant appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1) in denying point as above and (5) in refusing binding instructions for defendant.\n8. J. Strauss, with him George F. O'Brien, for appellant.\nJames L.
