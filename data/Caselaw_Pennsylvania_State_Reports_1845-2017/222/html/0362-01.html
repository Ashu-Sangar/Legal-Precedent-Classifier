He drove slowly past the end of the lane, and when he had gotten 180 or 200 feet down the road he heard a warning to “look out,” and immediately after was struck by the runaway team.</p>

The mere fact of a runaway does not by itself imply negligence, nor would even leaving a team standing in a private lane do so. But in this case the affirmative evidence is that when last seen only a few moments before the collision, there was a man standing at the horses’ heads.</p>
