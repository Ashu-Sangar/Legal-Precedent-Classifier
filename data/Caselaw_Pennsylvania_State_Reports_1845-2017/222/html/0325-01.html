Indeed, the contrary was alleged, while at the same time it was, in effect, averred that the appointment of a receiver was necessary to protect the interests of creditors and to prevent a wasteful sacrifice of the assets. The regularity of the appointment of the said receiver is not questioned, but we are asked by the attorney general, for reasons stated in his petition, to supersede, that is, annul the decree made by this court, and to direct the receiver named by us to turn over all the assets and property <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>of the said corporation which have come into his possession, to Charles F.

L. <em>4. </em>We do not question the validity or the propriety of the action taken by the Dauphin county court. The act of assembly just referred to was designed to furnish, and does furnish, a method, under which the banking business of state banking institutions can be regulated and controlled, with a view to securing honest and safe management of such institutions. A system of procedure is provided for that purpose, arid the' purpose is most laudable and salutary. We would not deliberately interfere with the successful operation of any of. the means or machinery furnished by the statute to accomplish the end in view. If by reason of the provisions of the statute, all proceedings instituted in a regular manner for the purpose of protecting the interests of creditors, in which a court of competent jurisdiction has appointed a receiver to take and hold the assets of a corporation, are avoided and nullified, then, undoubtedly, it is our duty to do what the attorney general asks us to do, and to direct our officer to stay his hands and turn over to the receiver appointed in Dauphin county all the assets that have come into his possession. Whether or not that be the effect of the statute, and our duty depends upon the proper answer to this single question, is the jurisdiction of the court in Dauphin county, which took cognizance of the matter at the instance of the commonwealth, exclusive; do proceedings there instituted necessarily supersede and avoid all other proceedings regularly .and previously instituted in a court of competent jurisdiction for the settlement of the affairs of a corporation? In other and fewer words,-the question is,-did the action of the Dauphin county court, resulting in the appointment of a receiver, operate to prevent this court and its receiver from moving forward in an orderly and ordinary way towards the end of litigation, which had been here begun before the Dauphin- county court took a step in the matter?</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[132,688,1179,314]]]'>We are not able to agree with that view of the question, not because we think it to be of any importance who shall receive the fees or commissions that may accrue to a receiver, but because we fail to find in the statute any provision which gives to the proceedings brought in the name of. the commonwealth any such exclusive force as is claimed for them.</p>

We are not asked to dissolve the corporation. We are not asked to give time for making good an impaired capital, or to make a decree based upon proofs of unsafe or improper conduct of business; On the contrary, we are asked only to give a relief which is customary and often afforded, and which has no reference whatever to the remedies of a. public character that the statute affords. So far as we can see, there is nothing in any proper action which we have taken or may hereafter take, in the case, that will interfere with the commonwealth’s effecting all that ought to be done, in any interest which needs to be guarded, without impinging upon the previously acquired jurisdiction of this court. We have said that we do not find in the statute any grant of exclusive jurisdiction over the case to the court of' Dauphin county. This might be owing to some want of perception on our part, but we may go further and say that no such express grant has been pointed out to us by the attorney general. In the absence of that which would deprive us of the jurisdiction already taken of the case as it stands before us, we know of no rule of law or requirement of public policy, which demands that we should vacate the decree made by us.</p>
