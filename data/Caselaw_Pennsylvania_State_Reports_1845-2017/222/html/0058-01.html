The thirteenth clause of the said agreement, to evade which this bill was filed, is as follows: “ In the event of the death of any one or more of said copartners, the deceased party’s estate shall not continue to retain the decedent’s partnership interest, but the said interest shall, within thirty days after such death, be considered as absolutely withdrawn and severed from the business of said firm, and the surviving partners shall purchase all the right, title and interest therein of the decedent for a sum equal to his share of the net assets of the firm, at the inventory last preceding the said death, minus such amounts as he may have drawn in cash or merchandise and plus such amounts as he may have contributed over and above his share, as set forth in article two of this agreement, from the time of his death back to the last preceding inventory; and further plus an amount equal to ten per cent (10) of the aforesaid decedent’s partnership interest, in consideration of the decedent’s part of the good will of this firm. Provided, however, that the said last preceding inventory shows the net profits of this firm, for the one year preceding such inventory, to have been not less than ten per cent (10) of the said total capital, as set forth in the second section of this agreement; and in case such profits shall have been less than 10 per cent, as last aforesaid, then the decedent’s estate shall be entitled to and receive only one hundred ($100) dollars in consideration for the décedent’s part of the good will of the firm.” The fourteenth clause provides how payment is to be made by the surviving partners for their purchase of a deceased partner’s interest in the business. The terms of payment on such a purchase differ from those on a purchase of the interest of a withdrawing or retiring member of the firm.</p>

There is no averment that this sum is not all that ought to be paid for that interest under the thirteenth clause of the agreement, which provides how its value is to be ascertained; but a mere claim is made that Jacob’s interest in the partnership was worth more at the time of his death, that it was then “ fairly worth $1,750,000,” as the good will of the firm had largely increased from 1897, and, at the time of his death, “ was worth the sum of at least $6,000,000.” According to this, the assets of the firm, exclusive of the good will, were worth, at the time Jacob died, $1,000,000, and in the sum of $288,750, which the three surviving partners are willing to pay the appellants, there is included an item of $38,750 for the interest of the deceased in the good will; and this is all the appellees are required to pay for it, if its value was arrived at in the way pointed out by the deceased partner himself. There is no averment that the value was not so arrived at, and if Jacob’s estate, in the judgment of those now representing it, is not getting all that his interest in the good will may be actually worth, it is, as the learned judge below aptly said, “ because he so agreed.”</p>

There is no averment that, as the business grew and expanded, he ever asked for a change or modification of the clause providing how his interest should pass to his brothers in the event of his death. The agreement remained unchanged and unmodified, just as it was written, until he died, and it became operative. The business grew and expanded, as the partners manifestly hoped when they put their compact of co-partnership into writing, but because it may have grown even beyond their expectations the terms of their partnership were not changed nor their rights as partners affected. Until they themselves changed their agreement it continued to be the law of their partnership existence, though the number of their de<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>livery wagons increased from ten, in 1897, to fifty-four, in 1905, their employees in the shipping room from six to twenty, their total floor space from 200,388 feet to 465,400, and their business was divided into fifty-two departments at the time of Jacob’s death. The increase of the business of the firm went on under the eyes of each of the partners, but the partnership which had existed prior to 1897, and which they continued by their agreement of November 24th of that year, continued until Jacob’s death, unchanged by any other agreement between them. Though they made no change in their written agreement, the court below was asked by this bill to change it, or to hold that it ought not now, in equity, to be regarded as binding.</p>

This clause was as fair to each of the four parties as it was to the other three, and we repeat as1 to it what we said of another agreement between partners, stipulating that, on the death of one the survivor should have the right to purchase his interest in the business at a valuation provided for by them in their agreement: <em>“ </em>It was a value fixed irrespectively of the actual value, which would change from year to year, and which they considered it just that the survivor should pay and the estate of his deceased partner receive. Neither could know to whom the option to purchase would fall; and if, during the running of the agreement, because of large additions or deductions, the price might become inequitable, either party had the remedy in his own hands, as without his assent they could not be made. The agreement was in force over eleven years before the death of one of the parties. ... We are left then to the construction of the agreement as it is written. Considering the condition of the property at the time, the mutual interest of the parties and the end they had in view, their desire to make certain the price at which the survivor could take and their knowledge that the cost would not be a criterion of the value, we think that they meant to say that the valuation of $25,000 was to remain, subject only to the conditions which they im<a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>posed, the fixed value for the purpose of the agreement.

We see no want of equity in the agreement, nor any hardship to result from' its performance which should lead a chancellor to deny the prayer for specific performance. There was no inequality of terms; it applied to both alike, and the advantage to be gained by the survivor was not more certain than that which would result to the estate of the deceased : ” Bohr bach er’s Estate, <a href="/pa/168/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="168 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="868491" data-case-paths="/pa/168/0158-01">168 Pa. 158</a>.</p>

This averment is but an inference on the part of the appellants that Isaac, Morris and Henry have arbitrarily, without right, and unjustly and unfairly, taken Jacob’s one-fourth interest in the firm. The thirteenth clause of the agreement provides how they may take it, and the averment is not that they have taken it in violation of that clause. While all facts fairly pleaded are admitted by a demurrer, it does not admit argumentative conclusions or doubtful inferences from undisputed facts: Getty et al. v. Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, <a href="/pa/194/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="194 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="912439" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0511-01">194 Pa. 511</a>. “ The averments of the bill as to the purport and meaning of the provisions of the indenture, the object of their insertion in the instrument, and the obligations they imposed upon the corporation and the trustees, and the rights they conferred upon the plaintiff when his contract was approved, are not admitted by the demurrer. These are matters of legal inference, conclusions of law upon the construction of[the in denture, andaré open to contention, a copy of the instrument itself being annexed to the bill, and, therefore, before the court for inspection. A demurrer only admits facts well pleaded; it does not admit matters of inference and argument, however clearly stated; it does not admit, for example, the accuracy of an alleged construction of an instrument when the instrument itself is set forth in the bill, or a copy is annexed, against a construction required by its terms; <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>nor the correctness of the ascription of a purpose to the parties when not justified by the language used. The several averments of the plaintiff in the bill as to his understanding of his rights, and of the liabilities and duties of others under the contract, can, therefore, exert no influence upon the mind of the court in the disposition of the demurrer. This is not the case of a bill to set aside or reform the contract as not expressing the actual intention of the parties. It is a case where the contention arises solely upon the meaning of the indenture in its bearing upon the contract, and that must be ascertained by applying to its language the ordinary rules of interpretation: ” Dillon v.

In consideration of these services the agreement proceeds in the second clause to provide what the party of the second part shall receive from the party of the first part. It is not a participation in the assets and business of the firm of Kaufmann Brothers, but payment by them to each of said parties of a sum “ as salary for each and every year ” equal to a certain percentage of the net profits of “ their business ” — Kaufmann Brothers’ business — “ the parties of the first part.” ' The agreement then describes in detail how the percentage of the profits is to be ascertained. With these details we need not burden this opinion. Nothing in the provision that each of the seven employees is to receive for his services a certain proportion of the net profits constitutes him a partner as to Kaufmann Brothers themselves, in whose services he had been and in whose services he was to continue as an employee. “ That there is a distinction between partnership as respects the public, and partnership as respects the parties, is an elementary principle of this branch of the law, so plain that its only difficulty is in its application to particular cases. Where the agreement is silent, there is often room for doubt, as to the precise relation in which the parties stand to each other, and then a joint interest in the stock is considered a discriminative circumstance; but where they explicitly declare there is to be no partnership, it is unnecessary to ‘inquire further; for among themselves, the law permits them to determine their respective interests by their own stipulations; <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>it is a matter with which third persons have no concern. . . .

That this exception to the general rule is founded upon a distinction without any difference has been generally conceded, and it is used by Baron Bramwell in Bullen v. Sharp with great force as an argument against the soundness of the rule itself. It is entirely too late now to question either the rule or the exception. We are bound to stand super antiquas vias, by our own decided cases; for nothing is truer, or more important, than the maxim: Omnia innovatio plus novitate perturbat, quam utilitate prodest. The interest of Tracy, Benton &amp; Go. in the profits being, by the terms of the agreement, ‘ a commission upon the sale of the merchandise consigned to them, equal to one-half of the net profits upon such sale,’ did not make them partners, nor attach to them either the rights or responsibilities of such partners: ” Edwards v.

The demurrer admits the truth of what actually appears therein, but not the argumentative • conclusion in the bill of a contribution to capital, if, as a matter of fact, no such contribution was intended by said parties. Instead of making any contribution to the capital of the firm, the agreement is that each, of the parties of the second part shall deposit with the parties of the first part, “Jacob Kaufmann, Isaac Kaufmann, Morris Kaufmann and Henry Kaufmann, partners, doing business as Kaufmann Brothers,” a certain sum of money, “'which sum shall remain on deposit with the parties of the first part; without interest, until the termination of this agreement, when same shall be repaid to the party of the second part, provided, however, that the said deposit shall continue so long only as the net assets of the parties of the first part in the said business shall not fall below the sum of one million fifty thousand ($1,050,000) dollars.” Why this provision as to a deposit was made is not material in this proceeding. It can well be understood that it might have been required by the parties of the first part as an assurance from the party of the second part that he would faithfully comply with his contract; and the provision as to the reduction of the deposit, upon the reduction of the net assets of the firm, may very naturally have been inserted at the instance of the party of the second part for his own protection. But, as stated, the reasons for the insertion of the clause are not material. It is sufficient that it was inserted, requiring but a “ deposit ” from the party of the second part, to be returned at a definite, fixed time, without regard to what may happen to the capital of the parties of the first part. It may be impaired or totally wiped out, but no portion of the deposit made by the party of the second part is to be in any manner impaired, but paid back, dollar for dollar, by the parties of the first part.</p>

The separate identity and existence of Kaufmann Brothers, composed of Jacob, Isaac, Morris and.Henry, are preserved all through the agreements of 1903 and 1905. They avow their right in each agreement, recognized by the party of the second part, to sell out or incorporate their business, and to take in new partners, the provision as to them being “ any male member of the immediate families of any of the parties of the first part may become a partner in the said business, as may also the party of the second part hereto, or any other party whose salary at the date of the execution of this agreement is based on the total profits of said business, to wit: the following persons: Morris Baer, Theodore Kaufmann, Max L. Blum, Hugo Baum, Nathan Kaufmann and Julius Baer.” Instead, then, of creating a new partnership, as is averred in the bill, the clause just quoted is a distinct admission by each of the parties of the second part that the partnership of Kaufman Brothers was to remain unchanged by the agreement of 1903, and that by it he did not become a member of the firm. Immediately following the provision that one-or all of the seven parties named may in the future become members of the firm, is a stipulation that it shall not be binding upon the surviving members of the firm of Kaufmann Brothers who - may purchase the interest of a deceased brother.</p>

Complaint is made by the appellants that, by the agreement of 1903, Jacob’s estate may continue to be tied up by liability to the seven employees, but this is a liability of any deceased partner, and it cannot affect such partner’s distinct agreement as to how his interest in the firm, upon his death, shall pass to his survivors.</p>
