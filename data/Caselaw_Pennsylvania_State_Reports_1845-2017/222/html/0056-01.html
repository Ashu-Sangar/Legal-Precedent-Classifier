Miller, equally, share and share alike. In case any one or more of my last named children — wishes her, or his or their money out of said estate, it is my will that they choose three disinterested persons to appraise said estate at cash value. It is my will and desire that if either — shall die without a lawful heir, her or his or their share of the estate to fall to the last named heir or heirs.” Where there is a devise of a fee simple absolute in the first instance and the gift is immediate, words of survivor-ship will be referred to the death of the testator and not to death generally, whenever it may occur. The first taker is entitled to the benefit of every implication and his estate will not be cut down unless the intention to do so clearly appears : Mickley’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/92/0514-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="92 Pa. 514" data-case-ids="491071" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0514-01">92 Pa. 514</a>; Mitchell v.
