It is claimed by the appellee, his administrator, that this judgment comes within the protection of the resolution of January 21,1843, P. L. 367, and the provisions of the supplement thereto of April 4, 1862, P. L. 235. There is some force in the position of appellant that, as the record fails to show that the judgment is within the protection of the resolution, it is not within the provisions <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>of the supplement; but it is not necessary for us to now pass upon this question, for a single averment of the appellant in its affidavit of defense clearly stands in the way of appellee’s right to a summary judgment against it as a terre-tenant. After the Clarke judgment had been obtained various writs of scire facias were issued on it to bring in other railroad companies as terre-tenants, and against them judgments were entered. On November 24, 1905, this sci. fa. was issued, with notice to the appellant as a terre-tenant. In its affidavit of defense, deemed insufficient by the court below for no reason given, the laconic order, if intended for an opinion, being simply, <em>“ </em>Rule absolute for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense,” the first averment is: “ Said Lehigh and New England Railroad Company has never held and does not now hold any property, real or personal, which it derived either directly or indirectly from said defendant.” A reason given in the supplemental affidavit of defense why judgment should not be entered is : “ Because at the time of the issuance of said scire facias or at any time before or since, the Lehigh and New England Railroad Company did not own or hold or claim to own or hold and had not in its possession any real or personal estate that was ever owned or held by the Pennsylvania and New England Railroad Company, the above named defendant, or upon which the judgment recited in the said scire facias was a lien.”</p>

Easley, Colwell, the defendant below, had been summoned as a terre-tenant. His plea was, “ The judgment sought to be revived by scire facias is no lien on the lands of J. A. Colwell, and never was.” In reversing the court below for striking this off, and in holding that the plea was good, we said, after reviewing the authorities : “We are warranted in saying that a plea, by one summoned as a terre-tenant, that' his land was not and never had been bound by the judgment, would be good. . . . From the reasoning thus borrowed from our books we are led to conclude, 1. That when one is brought into court, who has had no connection with the debtor’s title, he should be discharged either by nonsuit or a verdict in his favor, for he is not a terre-tenant; he cannot be bound by the judgment and he ought not to have been summoned; 2. If he has had connection with the debt- or’s title, though the lien of the judgment may not have attached at the time of his purchase by reason of its previous expiration, he may nevertheless be warned as a terre-tenant, <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>and may defend under the plea that the judgment is not, and never was, a lien upon his land. It follows that the court erred in striking out the second plea of the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b276-4" data-blocks='[["BL_276.4",276,[265,502,1181,1007]]]'>But this is not the ordinary proceeding by scire facias against a terre-tenant. The writ is issued under the act of 1862, which provides who, and who only, may be summoned by it, namely, any person or any incorporated company claiming to hold or own the real or personal estate which belonged to the original defendant, and when such person or incorporated company is summoned into court, “ the case proceeds as in other cases of scire facias on judgment against, terre-tenants.” Instead of claiming to hold or own any real estate that ever belonged to the Pennsylvania &amp; New England Railroad Company, the averment is that the appellant “ has never held and does not now hold any property, real or personal, which it derived either directly or indirectly from said defendant.” This is certainly a defense under the act of 1862, and, if made out, the appellee may not have judgment against the appellant either de terris or de propriis as to costs. The averment may not be true, and on the trial the appellant may not be able to sustain it, but, for the present, we must assume it to be true, as there is nothing in the record conclusively showing that it is not.</p>
