If the provisions of this act were carried out (and in the absence of allegations to the contrary, we must presume that they were), the chairman of the county committee would give notice to the county commissioners of the names of the party officers to be filled, and the commissioners in turn would advertise this fact in at. least two newspapers of general circulation. <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>If any person desired to become a candidate for the nomination for register and recorder in any party, it became his duty, if he desired to have his name printed upon the official ballot, to prepare and circulate a petition for that purpose, have it .signed by fifty qualified electors, and file it with the county commissioners at least three weeks prior to the primary.</p>

If the commissioners complied with the law (and we are bound to presume that they did) in preparing the Democratic ballot, they would- leave a blank space as above provided.</p>

As Harry B. Henderson’s name was not on the ballot, twenty electors, being a plurality of the votes cast for the office of register and recorder following the letter of the law, voted for him. The vote so cast was counted by the election board, returned by them to the county commissioners, and computed by them .and a certificate granted to said Harry B. Henderson that he was the legal nominee for register and recorder on the Democratic ticket.</p>

The first, second, fifth and <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>seventh reasons are in effect that it was not intended or allowed by the “Uniform Primary 'Act” that the Democratic party should be allowed to place on nomination a recognized Republican as its candidate for the said office.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.4",337,[138,570,1177,358]]]'>We remark that there is no such provision in the act of assembly. If the legislature had intended any such limitations of the right of franchise, it would have been very easy to have written in the act after the word “person,” the words, “of the same political affiliation.” In the absence of any such qualification we must presume that the legislature meant just what it said.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[138,948,1180,587]]]'>It is argued that by so construing the law it will permit one political party to interfere with the nominations of the other. Not so. No Republican interfered in any manner with the Democratic electors. But a plurality of the latter, not having an avowed candidate of their own, thinking that Mr. Henderson was the man best qualified to fill the office, expressed their desire to have him fill it, by the way pointed out by the law, viz., by writing his name in the blank space provided for that purpose. We see nothing in the letter or spirit of the law to prevent them from indicating by their votes whom they desired to have placed on their ballot as their candidate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-7" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[136,1547,1181,467]]]'>It is argued that the nomination of Mr. Henderson is against the spirit of the act. But no authority has been cited nor can any be found to sustain this contention. On the contrary, in Magee’s Nomination, 18 Pa. C. C. Rep. 225, it is said by Judge McPherson, “ At least in the absence of a rule to the contrary, a nominating convention of one party is certainly at liberty to choose a candidate of a different political faith. This power has been exercised repeatedly without challenge and indeed its existence is not denied.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-8" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[125,2033,1191,368]]]'>We all know that it is of frequent occurrence for one party to indorse the candidate of another. In our own county, last year, Thos. W. Williams, the Republican candidate for county •surveyor, was placed upon the Democratic ticket, just in the same manner as Mr. Henderson is now placed, and his name was printed on the official Democratic ticket in the fall without challenge.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b338-3" data-blocks='[["BL_338.3",338,[278,369,1179,684]]]'>
      <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>The third reason is that there is no petition filed by at least fifty electors to have Mr. Henderson’s name placed upon the ballot, and the sixth reason is that there is no certificate of nomination filed. The respondent does not claim to have his name on the ballot by petition or certificate, but under that provision of the act which allows an elector to write his name in the blank space provided for that purpose. The fourth reason is that the “Uniform Primaries Act” does not authorize the elector to vote for any person whose name is' not printed on the ballot. This reason is contradictory of the form of the ballot above quoted, and also the provision in the act that declares “The voter may designate his choice, as indicated by the instructions shown on the form of ballot above set forth.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[276,1071,1181,906]]]'>We are also of the opinion that the complainant as an elector has entirely mistaken his remedy in objecting to “the nomination certificate or paper under the Act of 21st of April, 1903, sec. 1, P. L. 224.” This act was passed prior to the “Uniform Primary Act,” and its cumbersome methods are not applicable to the present law. The objections before us are not so much to the nomination papers as to the counting of the votes. Section 9 of the act of February 17, 1906, provides: “ Any person aggrieved by any decision of the county, commissioners relative to the counting of votes, may appeal therefrom to the court of common pleas of the proper county, whose duty it shall be to hear such appeal, and to make such order as right and justice shall require. Uriah H. Cook is the party aggrieved, and could have taken an appeal as above provided. Or Cook might have proceeded by writ of mandamus against the county commissioners to compel them to have his name printed on the ballot, and thus raised the legal questions involved.</p>

Henderson, having received the plurality of votes cast by the Democratic party at the primary election, he is the legal candidate of that party for the office of register and recorder, and it is the duty of the proper officers to print his name on the official ballot as such candidate.</p>
