The auditor and the court below held that the power of appointment reserved by the deed of trust, was not exercised. Clearly the paper signed by Miss Neill on May 3, 1904, is not her will; for, under the provisions of section 16 of the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 249, it must be deemed to have been revoked by her subsequent marriage. And, as the court below points out, even if it be considered as a paper in the nature of a will, yet it lacks an essential to the execution of a power, in that the paper itself does not show the intent of the person attempting to execute the power. The language relied on to sustain the appointment is: “All the rest of rr^ money to be given to my husband (or the man who is to be my husband) George Lewis <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>Mayer.” There is an entire absence of any reference to the power which it is claimed she intended to exercise, and there is no description of the property which would identify it with that included in the trust deed.

When the donee of a power refers to it, or when he disposes of the subject of it by such a description as identifies it, the intent to execute it is free from uncertainty.” But both of these requirements are lacking in the present case. Nor can it be said that the paper is meaningless unless it be held to refer to the trust estate; for it seems that only one-half of Miss Neill’s estate was put into the trust, and she had at the time of her death a considerable estate, which was subject entirely to her own personal control and disposal, outside of that which had been placed in trust. We see no reason why the paper in question may not be regarded as an intended disposition of her property which was not included in the trust.</p>
