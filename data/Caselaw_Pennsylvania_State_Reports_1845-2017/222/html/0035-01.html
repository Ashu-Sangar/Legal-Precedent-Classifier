Locke, <a href="/pa/205/0616-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="205 Pa. 616" data-case-ids="930056" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0616-01">205 Pa. 616</a>, the testator devised a house <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>and lot to his daughter “ For and during her natural life, and at her death, I devise and bequeath the same unto her children or issue in fee simple.” Held, that she took a fee simple. In the opinion of the court, it is said, “We concede that generally the words £ child ’ and £ children ’ prima facie are words of purchase and not of limitation. See the many cases cited in Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>. But if the remainder, even where these words are used, is to go to the general or lineal heirs as pointed out by law, they are synonymous with £ heirs of the body,’ and by analogy to the rule in Shelley’s case, the estate for life in the first taker is enlarged into a fee or into an estate tail by implication. Here the devise at the daughter’s death is to her children or issue in fee simple, precisely as if he had said to my daughter and the heirs of her body, the very ones the law pointed out as the general or lineal heirs of the'first taker.” In Simpson v. Reed, <a href="/pa/205/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="205 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="930043" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0053-01">205 Pa. 53</a>, the word's of the will are: “ I give to my daughter, Martha Bell Simpson, the equal, undivided one-fifth part or share of all my real estate for life only; remainder after her death to her child or children in fee,” etc. Held, that she took an estate in fee tail general, which the Act .of April 27, 1855, P. L. 328, resolved into a fee simple. In the opinion Justice Dean says: “Did the testator here use the words ‘child’ or ‘children’ in the sense of heirs -of the body or issue ? Prima facie they are words of purchase and not of limitation, and the devisee took but a life estate: Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>, and the many cases therein cited; but is the remainder to go to the general or lineal heirs of the first taker as the law determines <em>% </em>Of course the estate -of the first taker must be a freehold estate for life or for years; it is then to go to her child or children in fee, the lineal heirs of the first taker whom the law identifies. ‘ Any form of words sufficient to show that the remainder is to go to those whom the law points out as the general or lineal heirs of the first taker will enlarge the estate in fee or estate tail by implication. . . .’ A long list of those cases in which the words ‘ child ’ and ‘ children ’ have been held to be words of limitation by analogy to the rule in Shelley’s case is given by Agnew, J., in Yarnall’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/70/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="70 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1028227" data-case-paths="/pa/70/0335-01">70 Pa. 335</a>. . . . The word ‘ child,’ since the daughter had no child at the time, was not a designatio person®, but comprehended a class, and the daugh<a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>ter took an estate tail: Jones v. Davies, 4 Barn. &amp; Adolph, 43.” In McKee v. McKinley, <a href="/pa/33/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="33 Pa. 92" data-case-ids="988373" data-case-paths="/pa/33/0092-01">33 Pa. 92</a>, the words of the will were: “ To my daughter .... during her lifetime .... after her death to her children, if any surviving, or issue of such children, and in case of no children or issue of children, then to return to my relatives or lawful heirs.” In referring to this case in Simpson v. Reed, <a href="/pa/205/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="205 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="930043" data-case-paths="/pa/205/0053-01">205 Pa. 53</a>, Justice Dean says: “ It was held that the devise was to the daughter for life and then to her children in fee, and in default of these to testator’s heirs; that this was only another way of devising to the plaintiff for life, with the remainder to her heirs, or to the plaintiff and her heirs; that the roundabout way the testator takes to say ‘ heirs ’ does not affect the substance. It appears that at the date of the will the daughter was single and did not contemplate marriage. She having no children, and no particular ones being in the mind of the testator, for he could not know what children or how many would be the issue, we think he intended the ‘issue’ to take in lineal descent. Therefore, the daughter took an estate in fee tail general, which the statute of 1855 resolves into a fee simple.”</p>

A freehold estate is given to them. A remainder of each undivided fourth of the estate is given, on the death of each one of the four nieces, to “her children and their heirs and assigns forever,” without a bequest over in case of such niece’s failure to have children. Each share is to go to the lineal heirs, as pointed out by law, on the death of each niece, and the word “ children ” is synonymous with “ heirs of the body.” The Avord “ children ” is not a designatio personae, as none of the nieces had any children and all were unmarried at the time of testator’s death. The use of the words “ children and their heirs and assigns forever,” therefore, was only another way of devising the undivided part of the land to each niece and the heirs of her body, and the roundabout way which the testator takes to say “heirs ” does not affect the substance. The estate which the plaintiffs, and the deceased sister took under the will, according to the rule in Shelley’s case, is a title in fee tail general, which is resolved into a title in fee simple by the act of 1855. They are, <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>therefore, able to convey such title to the defendant as they agreed to convey, and entitled to recover the purchase money which the defendant agreed to pay. We, therefore, enter judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum of $4,000.</p>
