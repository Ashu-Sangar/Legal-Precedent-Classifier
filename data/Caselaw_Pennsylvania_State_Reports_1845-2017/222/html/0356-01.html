If, in such situation, he diverts his attention to such an extent as to run over another child, the question of his negligence is one for the jury.</p>

There was evidence that immediately before the accident, the motorman’s attention had been diverted by a little girl running parallel with the tracks, and in somewhat dangerous vicinity to them.</p>
