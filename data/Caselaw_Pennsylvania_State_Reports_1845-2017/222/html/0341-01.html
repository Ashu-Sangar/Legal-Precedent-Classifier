The evidence develops the fact that he was in the employ of the defendant company in its railroad yards at Patton, in this county, and that while endeavoring to uncouple a car from the engine of the defendant company, under the direction of the engineer in charge of that engine, his hand and foot slipped, causing him to fall on the track, and the engine passed over a portion of his body.</p>

To this rule there are a number of exceptions. Where the em<a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>ployer knows of a latent defect in any instrumentality employed for certain work it is his duty to inform the employee, and if the employee is of tender years, or if the work is of such nature as would render him ignorant of the particular danger it is the duty of the employer to inform him; but where the defect is patent, that is, where proper instruments are not employed or the instrument is defective and the defect bé patent, obvious, so that the employee can observe it and is familiar with its dangerous character, unless he complains to the employer and obtains a promise that the defects will be removed he is not excused from liability for injury if he attempts to recover from his employer; therefore, he is not excused from liability to perform his duty, and his duty is to quit the employment if he does not care to take further risks, and if he sees fit to continue in the employment without complaint, or without some promise to repair, he takes the risk of that employment and does not come within any exception to the general rule.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b371-3" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[130,1336,1177,368]]]'>In this case counsel for plaintiff admits and rightly admits that the plaintiff knew there was no footboard upon this engine and no grab iron, and also knew that it was not intended for yard purposes, and knew that there was more or less danger connected with the act of uncoupling or separating any cars from the engine when it was in motion. This much the plaintiff himself has admitted.</p>

So, after a full examination of these authorities, we have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff in this case must be held to have taken the risk of that employment when he knew of the danger and continued in the employment of the defendant company without complaint. We believe if we should take any other action than that of sustaining this motion at this time we would be guilty of reversible error.</p>
