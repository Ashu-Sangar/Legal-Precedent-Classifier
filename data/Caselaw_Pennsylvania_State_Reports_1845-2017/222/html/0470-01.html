    <p class="summary" id="b499-5" data-blocks='[["BL_499.10",499,[131,733,1179,1117]]]'>At the trial it appeared that the action was brought to recover damages for death of plaintiff’s husband employed as a brakeman by the defendant. The accident happened between eight and nine o’clock on the evening of April 5, 1900, while the deceased was attempting to couple a caboose to a steam shovel attached to the rear of a train of seventeen cars. It was shown that the coupler on the steam shovel was somewhat unusual in form, but it also appeared that the deceased was an experienced brakeman. The evidence tended to show that the deceased had knowledge of the character of the coupler, and knew that if he got his head or any part of his body between the ends of the cars, in attempting to make the coupling, it would be crushed. A yard conductor advised the deceased to push the caboose up by hand to the steam shovel, and when the deceased rejected this advice he was told twice to get down and keep down, so as not to get caught in the crush between the cars. In spite of this warning the deceased did not keep his head down, and it was caught between the ends of the cars and crushed. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $10,000. The court subsequently entered judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto.</p>
