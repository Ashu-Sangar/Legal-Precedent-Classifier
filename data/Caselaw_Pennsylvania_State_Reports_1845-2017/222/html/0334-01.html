He wanted to feel at all times at liberty to come and ask her anything, and have her do anything for him, and if she would accept money he would be at liberty to do it; that she should put her bill into his estate; that he wanted her to get this money in a lump; that it would be more good to her that way; he wanted her to be paid and well paid, and to put her bill in big enough, and she agreed to do it. 1 heard this altogether half a dozen times, the last time two weeks before his death; he said he wanted her to be paid and her bill to be put in big enough, the day he took sick he said he never paid her anything, he said he wanted to hold her to her contract.” Witness also testified to the claimant writing letters for the deceased, and doing some housework for him, and that her services would be worth $25.00 per month.

Charles Wilcox, secretary of the Keystone Building &amp; Loan Association, produced all the letters written by Miller to it from 1898 to 1904. None'of them were in the handwriting of Mrs. Shirley. E. S. Ralston testified that he wrote a number of letters for Miller from August, 1896, to the fall of 1899.

Mrs. Eddinger testified that she wrote letters for Mr. Miller in 1899, also received letters from him; they were not in the handwriting of Mrs. Shirley; these letters were from 1899 up until nearly the time of his death, oftener than every two or three months. George M. Hill, Esq., testifies he wrote letters for Miller; that Mrs. Shirley was jointly interested with Mr. Miller in the property in regard to which letters were written to Jack &amp; Taylor, and Mr. Maher; and that his (Miller’s) business was such that it did not require much letter writing.</p>

We search the record in vain for any substantial service rendered by the claimant. It is true, she wrote some letters for her uncle when he was too old to write them for himself, and that she washed some curtains and napkins, and did some trifling household duties for him, and her aged aunt. But this was only what is done every day by relatives without any hope or desire of pay, but through affection, sympathy, or an effort to secure compensation by a legacy. As to the latter, the efforts of Mrs. Shirley were not without success. She was not mentioned in the will of February 16, 1894, but by the codicil of January 31, 1899, she was given a legacy of $500, and by the codicil of February 18, .1899, to the heirs- of Mary J.

Her sisters are very willing witnesses, and we search in vain their testimony to show any substantial service rendered. Mrs. Gephart was there from May 5, 1904 to July 7, 1904, the. time these old people were .in dire distress, and during a period for which Mrs. Shirley is awarded compensation, and when, if ever, she should have gone to their assistance. Mrs. Gephart says: “I did all the work, from feeding the horse to cleaning up Mr. Miller. I did everything that was to be done, taking care of him, feeding him, washed his clothes; there was no other nurse or domestic there. Mr. Ralston would come down, but would go right out again. One day I had to ask Mrs. Shirley to come up to help to change him. Mrs. Gephart is called as a witness for Mrs. Shirley, and is asked what services she rendered. The only one narrated is that she wrote some letters. Nor are we satisfied that the alleged contract will stand the legal test, so often applied to cases of this character, although there can be no doubt that if we take as verity the testimony of all the witnesses in regard to it, and disregard the circumstances surrounding it, that it is established. “But in civil cases, as well as criminal, a verdict may well be founded on circumstances alone, and these often lead to a conclusion more satisfactory than direct evidence:” 1 Greenleaf on Evidence (15th ed.), sec. 14.</p>
