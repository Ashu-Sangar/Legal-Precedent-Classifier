He was not bound to do so. How detailed a judge’s reference to the evidence shall be, is largely in his discretion, even in criminal cases. Though he may not omit all mention of the crucial or controlling facts yet he is under no obligation to discuss every item of the evidence even upon such facts. To do so would many times tend to confuse rather than to assist the jury.</p>

And even in regard to the charge upon the law it must be read in connection with the general rule as shown in the later case of McMeen v. Com., <a href="/pa/114/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="114 Pa. 300" data-case-ids="550035" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0300-01">114 Pa. 300</a>, that the omission to charge upon a point to which the attention of the court is not called and request made is not error.</p>
