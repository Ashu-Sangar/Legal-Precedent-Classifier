        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nAppellant Betty Legg appeals from a Superior Court Order, reversing an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (PCRA Court), in which the PCRA Court granted Appellant\u2019s petition for collateral relief pursuant to the Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq. The issue before us is whether Appellant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present the diminished capacity defense at Appellant\u2019s murder trial. We conclude that trial counsel was ineffective where available expert testimony indicated that Appellant was suffering from major depression and anxiety that would have prevented her from rationally forming the specific intent to kill. Therefore, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court and reinstate the PCRA Court\u2019s Order, granting Appellant a new trial.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe record establishes that Appellant and the victim, Ernest Legg (Mr. Legg), were married in 1956. In 1960, Appellant learned that her husband was having an affair with another woman, Amy Stephenson. Nonetheless, the Leggs reconciled and stayed together until 1980 when Mr. Legg suddenly left. The Leggs obtained a divorce in 1985. They, however, continued to have sexual relations. In early 1986, Appellant learned that Mr. Legg had rekindled his relationship with Stephenson in 1985.\nAppellant repeatedly called Stephenson demanding that she leave Mr. Legg alone. Sometimes she would call and then hang up the telephone. She also followed Mr. Legg and Stephenson by car. Due to her mounting anger toward Stephenson and her fear that she might harm Mr. Legg, Appellant voluntarily sought psychiatric assistance on June 11, 1986. She went to the Northern Communities Mental Health/Mental Retardation Center (Northern Communities MHMR), which recommended immediate in-patient hospitalization. That same day, Appellant was admitted to St. John\u2019s Hospital psychiatric ward because she was actively suicidal and was talking about killing her husband. St. John\u2019s diagnosed her with recurrent major depression and treated her with tranquilizers. After two days, Appellant left St. John\u2019s, against medical advice and discontinued her medications. Appellant then saw a clinical psychologist, Lois Dabney-Smith, Ph.D., several days later for one session but did not return for further treatment.\nOn her birthday, July 27,1986, Mr. Legg took Appellant out for dinner. They later engaged in sexual relations, which led Appellant to believe that they were going to be able to resolve their differences. Then, on August 6,1986, due to Appellant\u2019s repeated telephone calls, Stephenson filed charges of harassment against Appellant. The criminal complaint stunned Appellant. Shortly before 4:00 p.m., on August 8, 1986, she drove across town to meet Mr. Legg at his place of employment. She had a gun that she always kept under the front seat of her car for protection. As Mr. Legg exited his place of employment, she approached him, carrying the gun in a bag. Mr. Legg allowed her to join him in the front seat of his car. Appellant begged him to tell her the truth about Stephenson, but Mr. Legg denied any romantic involvement with her. The couple began arguing. She pulled the gun from the bag.\nAccording to Appellant, she had only intended to scare Mr. Legg into telling her the truth. She claims that when Mr. Legg saw the weapon, he grabbed her wrist and the gun went off; as she tried to remove her finger from the trigger, it fired a second time. Mr. Legg exited the car and collapsed. He died of gun shot wounds in the arm and back. After the shooting, Appellant claims that she was in \u201cshock.\u201d She drove to the Public Safety Building, where she worked as a dispatcher, to report the incident. She informed the desk sergeant, \u201cI shot my husband\u201d and handed him the gun.\nShe was then arrested and charged with criminal homicide, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501, and a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6101. On March 24, 1987, Appellant waived her right to a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial before the Honorable Alan S. Penkower in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court). An attorney of the Office of the Allegheny County Public Defender represented Appellant. At trial, defense counsel primarily relied on the defense of accident or homicide by misadventure. Alternatively, counsel asserted a heat of passion defense. Trial counsel did not raise a diminished capacity defense. The trial court convicted Appellant of first degree murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence and we denied her Petition for Allowance of Appeal.\nOn February 27, 1991, Appellant filed a PCRA petition requesting a new trial, asserting, inter alia, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the diminished capacity defense. Judge Penkower also presided at the PCRA hearing. At the hearing, Appellant, her trial counsel, and psychologist Dr. Herbert I. Levit, testified concerning her diminished capacity, after which the PCRA Court granted her a new trial. The Superior Court reversed the PCRA Court, holding that trial counsel reasonably relied on the defense of accident or homicide by misadventure, which could have produced an acquittal, and avoided the defense of diminished capacity, that would have admitted guilt and resulted in a sentence for criminal homicide. We granted allocatur on the issue of whether the Superior Court erred in reversing the PCRA Court\u2019s determination that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue a diminished capacity defense.\nDISCUSSION\nTo establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to the PCRA, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543, an appellant must prove that (1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel\u2019s action or inaction was not grounded on any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interest; and (3) counsel\u2019s omission or commission so undermined the trial that the verdict is unreliable. Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 534 Pa. 483, 633 A.2d 1098 (1993).\nHere, Appellant argues that, as found by the PCRA Court, the diminished capacity defense would have been a critical issue at trial and defense counsel\u2019s failure to explore, investigate, and present available psychiatric evidence const\u00f3tuted ineffective assistance of counsel. Initially, we note that \u201c[i]n asserting a diminished capacity defense, a defendant is attempting to prove that he was incapable of forming the specific intent to kill; if the defendant is successful, first degree murder is mitigated to third degree.\u201d Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 124, 661 A.2d 352, 359 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1121, 116 S.Ct. 931, 133 L.Ed.2d 858 (1996). Thus, the defendant admits general criminal culpability, but seeks to reduce the degree of guilt to third degree murder. Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327, rehearing denied, 463 U.S. 1236, 104 S.Ct. 31, 77 L;Ed.2d 1452 (1983). Diminished capacity, however, is an extremely limited defense. Travaglia. Psychiatric testimony that addresses \u201cmental disorders affecting the cognitive functions [of deliberation and premeditation] necessary to formulate a specific intent\u201d is admissible. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. at 28, 454 A.2d at 943. However, psychiatric evidence that a defendant lacked the ability to control his actions or that he acted impulsively is irrelevant and inadmissible on the issue of the defendant\u2019s specific intent to kill. Id.\nAt the PCRA hearing, Appellant\u2019s expert, Dr. Levit, testified that she was actively homicidal and suicidal at the time of her hospitalization two months before the shooting. He stated that she sought help because she was reaching a point where she could no longer control her behavior. R. 340a. According to Dr. Levit, Appellant suffered from major depression with anxiety at the time of the shooting. Such a disorder, he explained, would have distorted her perception of the situation with her ex-husband and impaired her judgment. R. 334a-35a. Dr. Levit opined that the shooting resulted from her depression and anxiety associated with her feelings of anger and betrayal. R. 344a. He clarified that due to her depression, anxiety, and the intensity of her anger and feelings of betrayal, she lacked the ability to rationally formulate the intent to kill Mr. Legg. R. 349a, 367a-68a. Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony spoke to more than an inability of Appellant to control herself, and directly related Appellant\u2019s underlying mental defect to her inability to formulate a specific intent to kill. Based on this testimony, the PCRA Court held that Appellant\u2019s claim has arguable merit. The Commonwealth concedes that she satisfied the first prong of an ineffectiveness claim.\nThe second prong of Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim, whether trial counsel had a reasonable basis for not presenting a diminished capacity defense, depends on whether trial counsel knew or, through reasonable investigation, should have known of Appellant\u2019s psychiatric history. See Commonwealth v. Walker, 540 Pa. 80, 656 A.2d 90 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 854, 116 S.Ct. 156, 133 L.Ed.2d 100 (1995)(counsel not ineffective for failing to call witnesses he had no way of knowing were available); Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 511 Pa. 299, 513 A.2d 373 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1070, 107 S.Ct. 962, 93 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1987)(counsel has duty to make reasonable investigations). Trial counsel testified that, although he knew that Appellant was experiencing anxiety and depression because of the impending trial, he did not know that she had been diagnosed with major depression and hospitalized before she shot Mr. Legg. R. 387a-89a. However, the record shows that the Public Defender Investigator, who interviewed Appellant after her arrest, noted in his report that Appellant had been to St. John\u2019s Hospital and had seen \u201cDr. Dabney.\u201d Trial counsel, a Public Defender, inexplicably testified that he never reviewed the investigator\u2019s report. R. 420a. Trial counsel also could not recall whether he interviewed the psychologists or counselors from the Allegheny County Behavior Clinic and Northern Communities MHMR who examined Appellant post-arrest to determine her competency to stand trial. R. 407a. Counsel acknowledged at the PCRA hearing, however, that the Behavior Clinic\u2019s report referenced a previous mental disorder and hospitalization. R. 388a. Counsel, thus, had available to him sufficient indicia of Appellant\u2019s pre-arrest mental disorder to warrant further investigation. A reasonable investigation would have revealed Appellant\u2019s diagnosis and treatment history.\nWith respect to counsel\u2019s strategy, the Superior Court held that counsel had rationally chosen to pursue the defense of an accident, which could have resulted in an acquittal or a finding of guilt less than first degree murder, and to avoid the defense of diminished capacity. Because counsel did not investigate or could not recall investigating Appellant\u2019s mental history, we cannot agree with the Superior Court that he made a rational decision to avoid a diminished capacity defense. In fact, counsel\u2019s testimony indicates otherwise. When questioned whether he would have proceeded differently if he had known that Appellant suffered from major depression and had homicidal and suicidal ideations, he replied, \u201cAbsolutely. First [sic] comes to mind is the defense of diminished capacity, if that can be developed.\u201d R. 389a-90a.\nFurther, the Superior Court determined that counsel had reasonably relied on the defense of accident instead of diminished capacity, which would have admitted guilt and required a sentence for criminal homicide. We disagree with the Superior Court\u2019s assessment of counsel\u2019s strategy. Although counsel may have hoped for an acquittal, proof of an accidental killing coupled with evidence of malice, implied from Appellant\u2019s use of the gun, may have produced a verdict of third degree murder. See Commonwealth v. Hobson, 484 Pa. 250, 398 A.2d 1364 (1979). Therefore, the evidence presented actually offered the trial court five possible verdicts concerning the homicide charge: first degree murder; third degree murder; voluntary manslaughter; involuntary manslaughter; and acquittal. Particularly when the facts supported a finding of first degree murder, we find no reasonable justification for counsel\u2019s failure to also advance a diminished capacity defense that may have produced a verdict of third degree murder. Therefore, we conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to investigate and present a diminished capacity defense.\nThe cases relied upon by the Commonwealth, Commonwealth v. Cross, 535 Pa. 38, 634 A.2d 173 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 833, 115 S.Ct. 109, 130 L.Ed.2d 56 (1994), and Commonwealth v. Mizell, 493 Pa. 161, 425 A.2d 424 (1981), are distinguishable. In each of those cases, this Court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to advance a diminished capacity and/or insanity defense in the defendant\u2019s murder trial. We reasoned that an insanity or diminished capacity defense, which would have admitted the commission of the act, would have directly conflicted with each defendant\u2019s claim of innocence. Each defendant in Cross and Mizell maintained that he had not committed the homicide(s) in question. In contrast, and contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, Appellant does not deny shooting her husband. Thus, the sole question and dispositive issue at trial, here, was Appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting. The Commonwealth sought to prove, inter alia, that Appellant committed an intentional killing with malice. Appellant asserted that she did not intend to kill her husband \u2014 that the shooting was an accident \u2014 or, alternatively, that she shot her husband, but acted in the heat of passion. A diminished capacity defense, which suggests general culpability for the shooting but negates the specific intent to Ml, would not have directly conflicted with Appellant\u2019s position.\nConsequently, we turn to the last prong of Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim, whether she was prejudiced as a result of trial counsel\u2019s omissions. The PCRA court held:\nTrial counsel\u2019s failure to present expert testimony at trial concerning defendant\u2019s ability to formulate the specific intent to kill such as would tend to reduce the degree of homicide from first degree to third degree murder, deprived the trier of fact of mitigating evidence regarding defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting. The Court concludes that trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence of the crime of first degree murder could have taken place under the circumstances.\nPCRA Court Findings and Order of Court of March 31, 1994. Although the Superior Court did not decide the prejudice issue, in analyzing the merits of Appellant\u2019s claim, the court appears to have reweighed Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony and concluded that it was speculative. The PCRA court, however, was in the better position to evaluate the doctor\u2019s testimony, and the effect of the omission of that evidence on the deliberative process. Commonwealth v. Lutz, 492 Pa. 500, 424 A.2d 1302 (1981)(appellate court is not to engage in de novo evaluation of testimony; that is task for PCRA court). Although evidence of a specific intent to kill may disprove a defense of diminished capacity, Commonwealth v. Tempest, 496 Pa. 436, 437 A.2d 952 (1981) (superseded by statute on other grounds), that evidence here was not so overwhelming that we can conclude that counsel\u2019s failure to raise a diminished capacity defense resulted in no prejudice to Appellant. Instead, because defense counsel deprived the trial court of its right to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the testimony relating to Appellant\u2019s diminished capacity defense, we defer to the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.\nAccordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court and reinstate the PCRA Court\u2019s decision granting Appellant a new trial.\nCASTILLE, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NIGRO and SAYLOR, JJ., join.\n. According to Appellant, she received the gun from her grandmother\u2019s estate several years earlier. Appellant had no formal weapons training and had never test fired the gun, but knew it was loaded. She did not have a license to cariy it.\n. Homicide by misadventure, which is excusable, is defined as:\nthe accidental killing of another, where the slayer is doing a lawful act, unaccompanied by any criminally careless or reckless conduct. \"Three elements enter into the defense of excusable homicide by misadventure: [1] The act resulting in death must be a lawful one; [2] It must be done with reasonable care and due regard for the lives and persons of others; and [3] the killing must be accidental and not intentional, or without unlawful intent, or without evil design or intention on the part of the slayer.... Even though the homicide is unintentional, it is not excusable where it is the result or incident of an unlawful act, such as pointing or presenting a gun, pistol or other firearm at another person in such a manner as to constitute an offense under the laws of the state....\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Hobson, 484 Pa. 250, 258-59, 398 A.2d 1364, 1368 (1979) (citations omitted).\n. The heat of passion defense, a partial defense to murder, is defined as: a homicide intentionally committed under the influence of passion. ... The term \"passion\u201d as here used includes both anger and terror provided they reach a degree of intensity sufficient to obscure temporarily the reason of the person affected.\nCommonwealth v. McCusker, 448 Pa. 382, 388 n. 4, 292 A.2d 286, 289 n. 4 (1972). A killing committed in the heat of passion constitutes voluntary manslaughter. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503; McCusker.\n. As discussed below, a diminished capacity defense alleges an inability to form the specific intent to kill. Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 124, 661 A.2d 352, 359 (1995), cert. denied, Travaglia v. Pennsylvania, 516 U.S. 1121, 116 S.Ct. 931, 133 L.Ed.2d 858 (1996).\n. Appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing pre-dated the 1995 amendments to Section 9543 of the PCRA.\n. Underlying Appellant's ineffectiveness claim is her contention that trial counsel had abandoned the accident defense during trial; therefore, he was ineffective in failing to present a diminished capacity defense. The Superior Court referred to the following excerpt of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument in holding that counsel had not abandoned the accident defense:\nI would argue, Your Honor, certainly the first shot is an accidental shooting when he reaches for the gun. I can't argue, Your Honor, accidental shooting or homicide by misadventure, because I understand the law is when you are involved in an unlawful act, i.e. possession of a firearm in close proximity of someone, with the purse, et cetera, and she has testified it was her intention to pull it out to scare him, that that unlawful act would bar Your Honor from rendering a verdict of not guilty of criminal homicide by virtue of that defense.\nThat does not preclude Your Honor from finding that verdict out of your mercy dispensing powers, so I\u2019m not arguing that on the basis of the facts alone. At most, you have what I suggest is an unintentional killing based upon exactly the facts you heard here, and that woman\u2019s testimony, Judge.\nR. 303a. The focus on whether trial counsel abandoned or actively pursued the accident defense is misplaced. Although counsel stated his belief that Appellant\u2019s unlawful possession of a firearm would preclude the court from rendering a verdict of not guilty by virtue of an accident or homicide by misadventure, R. 303a, he nonetheless called upon the court to exercise its mercy dispensing powers to find Appellant not guilty or guilty of involuntary manslaughter by virtue of an accidental shooting or homicide by misadventure, R. 303a-305a. Alternatively, counsel suggested that, at most, Appellant may have committed voluntary manslaughter as a result of the heat of passion. R. 304a. As discussed below, nothing precluded trial counsel from presenting the alternative argument of diminished capacity.",

        "text": "CASTILLE, Justice,\ndissenting.\nThe majority of this Court grants appellant a new trial by holding that appellant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present a diminished capacity defense. I dissent from this holding for two reasons. First, a diminished capacity defense would have conflicted with the defenses that trial counsel reasonably chose to pursue; therefore, trial counsel would have acted unreasonably by arguing diminished capacity. Second, even if trial counsel could reasonably have advocated a diminished capacity defense from a tactical standpoint, appellant still cannot establish by a reasonable likelihood that such a defense would have been available from a legal standpoint. Thus, appellant fails to prove that she was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s putative ineffectiveness.\nAs the majority correctly notes, appellant must establish each of the following in order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d): (1) that the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) that counsel\u2019s action or inaction was not grounded in any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interest; and (3) that counsel\u2019s omission or commission so undermined the trial that the verdict is unreliable. Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 534 Pa. 483, 633 A.2d 1098 (1993). Because the bulk of the majority\u2019s discussion focuses on counsel\u2019s reasonableness, I will first discuss my disagreement with the majority regarding that issue.\nTrial counsel is generally not precluded from advancing alternative defenses on behalf of a criminal defendant, even when those defenses are inconsistent. See Commonwealth v. Hilliard, 471 Pa. 318, 338, 370 A.2d 322, 332 (1977) (citations omitted); Commonwealth v. Jorgenson, 512 Pa. 601, 606 n. 3, 517 A.2d 1287, 1290 n. 3 (1986); but see Commonwealth v. Harris, 542 Pa. 134, 140, 665 A.2d 1172, 1175 (1995)(defense of self-defense not permitted because it was mutually exclusive of the defense of accident or mistake). Nevertheless, it is axiomatic that trial counsel may reasonably make a strategic decision to decline to put forth inconsistent defenses, especially when one defense would undermine the other. See Commonwealth v. Stoyko, 504 Pa. 455, 471, 475 A.2d 714, 723 (1984); Commonwealth v. Holloway, 524 Pa. 342, 352, 572 A.2d 687, 692 (1990); Commonwealth v. Pfaff, 233 Pa.Super. 153, 163, 335 A.2d 751, 756 (1975).\nHere, trial counsel\u2019s primary argument was that the shooting had been accidental and that the trial judge should render a verdict of involuntary manslaughter or even exercise his \u201cmercy dispensing powers\u201d to render an' outright acquittal. See Trial Trans, at 214-218 (Record at 301a-305a). Asserting the defense of diminished capacity would have been inconsistent with and would, in fact, have undermined this strategy.\nBy asserting the defense of diminished capacity, a defendant concedes general criminal liability and seeks to reduce the degree of guilt from first to third degree murder. See Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 124 n. 10, 661 A.2d 352, 359 n. 10 (1995); Commonwealth v. Walzack, 468 Pa. 210, 221, 360 A.2d 914, 920 (1976). Thus, if appellant had attempted to prove her diminished capacity at the time of the shooting, she would necessarily have conceded her guilt as to third degree murder, a felony of the first degree carrying a prison term of up to forty years. However, appellant\u2019s primary argument at trial was that she was entitled to an even lesser verdict of involuntary manslaughter, a misdemeanor of the first degree, and possibly even an acquittal under the circumstances of this case. This strategy was precipitated by appellant\u2019s own version of the shooting, to which she testified in relevant part as follows:\nQ: Why did you [take the gun out]?\nA: Because I wanted to frighten him into telling me the truth.\nQ: Tell the Judge exactly what happened with that gun as far as you can remember?\nA: When I took the gun out of my purse he seen it and upon seeing I had the gun ... he grabbed my wrist and the gun went off. I had my finger on the trigger and the gun went off.\nQ: Had you intentionally aimed the gun at him prior to him grabbing?\nA: No, I didn\u2019t aim it at him because no sooner I had lifted it out, he seen it and grabbed my arm.\nQ: Can you tell the Court in more detail what happened with his body when you first heard that bang?\nA: When he first heard the bang, he sort of turned, and in doing so, when the second shot went off, I\u2019m trying to get my finger off the trigger of the gun when the second shot went off. I didn\u2019t even know how the thing had gone off until I heard it because I ... was very amateur with it and about it.\nQ: You did hear two bangs?\nA: Yes, I did, sir.\nQ: With the second bang he wasn\u2019t grabbing the gun?\nA: No, sir.\nQ: You were trying to get your finger off?\nA: I was trying to get my finger off and the gun was like pointing downwards. I was holding it down trying to pull my finger out of where the trigger is.\nQ: Mrs. Legg, at any time, the first shot or the second shot, did you point that gun at him when you pulled the trigger?\nA: I never got the opportunity actually to directly point the gun at him. I just pulled it out of the purse and when he seen it he grabbed my arm. I don\u2019t even think if it was pointed at him it would be directly pointing. I don\u2019t think the gun was ever in the position at all.\nSee Trial Trans, at 158-163 (R. at 245a-250a).\nIn light of this testimony, trial counsel reasonably argued that the shooting was accidental and that no felony liability should ensue. Therefore, it was reasonable for counsel to decline .to advance a diminished capacity defense, for to do so would .have been to concede felony liability and thus foreclose the strategy which was more consistent with appellant\u2019s version of events.\nIn order to understand precisely how damaging the diminished capacity defense would have been to trial counsel\u2019s primary strategy, it is necessary to review the PCRA hearing testimony of Dr. Levit as to appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the shooting. Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony amply demonstrates that by presenting the defense of diminished capacity, appellant would necessarily have placed into evidence her own long-standing homicidal impulses towards the victim \u2014 evidence that would have proved ruinous to trial counsel\u2019s effort to convince the factfinder that the shooting of appellant\u2019s husband had been accidental.\nDr. Levit, in attempting to establish the framework for the defense of diminished capacity, testified with respect to appellee\u2019s admission to the Northern Communities Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center (\u201cNorthern Communities\u201d) in June of 1986, and St. John\u2019s hospital in July of 1986, several weeks before the shooting. First, Dr. Levit was asked about one of the incidents that gave rise to appellee\u2019s perception that she needed treatment:\nQ: ... [L]ooking at the St. John\u2019s report, it indicates ... that she had begun to have suicidal thoughts and that she had waited in his garage with a loaded gun and that she intended to take his life and to turn herself in, but that Mr. Legg had not appeared at that time ... so what comment can you offer with respect to the fact that she had apparently made this plan at a prior time ... ?\nA: I account for that on the basis that she was a depressed, angry, anxious woman who felt extremely betrayed and frustrated and rejected....\nN.T. at 39-40 (R. at 357a-358a). With respect to appellee\u2019s subsequent admission and treatment at St. John\u2019s and Northern Communities, Dr. Levit testified as follows:\nQ: In your report \u2014 if I can interrupt for one second, Dr. Levit, in your report on page two there is, I believe, a correction that needs to be made. You have in the report that she was hospitalized in St. John\u2019s in July of 1986? A: This is what Mrs. Legg remembers ... She was also talking homicide then. And I don\u2019t understand why the hospital did not warn her husband. They should have some responsibility to do that.\nN.T. at 14 (R. at 332a).\nQ: Looking at the Northern Communities reports on that first page, she indicates there, also, that she had a club with her and planned to assault him in the parking lot but that he didn\u2019t show up. So we have another instance where she had apparently intended to cause severe harm to her husband but ... he didn\u2019t show up.\nA: There is no question that she had homicidal feelings toward her husband. That is well documented. But if you want to look at it from what \u2014 as an oxynervon, psychologically valid, if this was an intentional, volitional act, it would not \u2014 there would not have been an argument. She would have went over and shot him.\nN.T. at 39-40 (R. at 357a-358a).\nDr. Levit\u2019s analysis of the treatment reports, which would necessarily have been placed in evidence for purposes of the putative diminished capacity defense, would have been catastrophic with respect to trial counsel\u2019s attempt to portray the shooting as accidental. The treatment reports revealed a long-running history of appellant\u2019s homicidal urges frustrated only by her inability to carry them out. Regardless of whether this psychological history arguably supported a diminished capacity defense, its introduction at trial would clearly have subverted the strategy of portraying the shooting as a complete accident. Instead, this history would have provided additional fodder for the Commonwealth to show that the shooting was premeditated and was, in fact, first-degree murder.\nEven more damaging than Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony with respect to appellant\u2019s psychological history was his testimony with respect to her state of mind at the exact time of the shooting. Dr. Levit testified as follows with respect to appellant\u2019s emotional response on the day of the shooting to the harassment charges filed that day by the other woman whom appellant believed was involved romantically with the victim:\nQ: Now, you have indicated that it was a culmination of the more recent events which had occurred which ultimately essentially sent her over the edge and caused her this great anxiety which ultimately resulted in her husband\u2019s death; is that right?\nA: That\u2019s correct.\nQ: [But] we don\u2019t know in fact whether that [the filing of the harassment charges] was the final thing that caused her to actually shoot him, or whether had he shown up at either of these two prior occasions he ... could also have been killed?\nA: The only thing we know for sure is that on that specific date, August 8 of 1986, that he was killed as the final aspect of this particular relationship, with the escalation of all these feelings.\nQ: Now, when you say she would not have had the capacity to understand what was going on on that particular day, or that her judgment was impaired, how do you believe she perceived the events which occurred? Did she perceive that, in fact, it was an accident and during the argument and ensuing struggle that the gun went off, or did she perceive that she did shoot him but she didn\u2019t know what she was doing when she did it?\nA: What Mrs. Legg told me when I examined her was that it was an accident. Now, whether in fact this was an accident or an essentially irrational moment, this happened wrong, none of us will ever know.\nId. at 44-45 (R. at 362a-363a)(emphasis added).\nDr. Levit\u2019s testimony clearly undercuts appellant\u2019s account of the shooting as accidental, as he acknowledges that she had been pushed \u201cover the edge\u201d and concludes by stating that he is not even sure whether he believes the veracity of appellant\u2019s own testimony that the shooting was accidental. A factfinder could very well have decided, based on this testimony, that the shooting was the ultimate fulfillment of her homicidal urges which had been growing for a period of several months. In any event, a factfinder would certainly have been even less likely to decide that the shooting was accidental, given the reluctance of appellant\u2019s own expert to give unflagging support to her account in this regard. In fact, a compelling claim of ineffective assistance of counsel could have been advanced in' this case if trial counsel had attempted to present a diminished capacity defense while simultaneously attempting to seek a verdict of involuntary manslaughter.\nThe majority notes that the evidence adduced at trial could have supported five separate verdicts \u2014 first-degree murder, third-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter and acquittal. The majority concludes that \u201c[particularly when the facts supported a finding of first-degree murder, we find no reasonable justification for counsel\u2019s failure to also advance a diminished capacity defense that may have produced a verdict of third-degree murder.\u201d The existence of first-degree murder as a possible verdict is quite simply irrelevant in determining whether trial counsel reasonably declined to advance a diminished capacity defense. The relevant question is whether the alternatives that trial counsel did in fact pursue, and which necessitated the rejection of certain other inconsistent alternatives, were reasonable. For the reasons stated, I believe that the strategies pursued in this case, based on appellant\u2019s own version of events and aimed at obtaining misdemeanor liability at worst, were indeed reasonable.\nAlthough I dissent primarily on the basis of my disagreement with the majority as to whether trial counsel acted reasonably in not presenting a diminished capacity defense, I would be remiss if I failed to address the majority\u2019s determination under the third prong of the ineffectiveness test \u2014 that the alleged unreasonableness \u201cso undermined the trial that the verdict is unreliable.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 534 Pa. 483, 633 A.2d 1098 (1993). Under this prong, appellant must establish by a reasonable probability that but for the act or omission on question, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. Commonwealth v. Lark, 548 Pa. 441, 698 A.2d 43, 47 (1997). Thus, appellant is required to establish by a reasonable probability that the diminished capacity defense would have proven successful if trial counsel had advanced it.\nThe only testimony advanced in support of the diminished capacity defense at the PCRA hearing was that of Dr. Levit. Therefore, we must determine whether this testimony would likely have established the defense of diminished capacity. Even upholding the PCRA court\u2019s finding that Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony is to be fully credited, the testimony itself fails to support the legal conclusion that appellant suffered from diminished capacity as that term is properly understood in our jurisprudence.\nThe defense of diminished capacity can only be established if the proponent proves that at the time of the killing, he was suffering from a mental disease, illness or delusional mental state that wholly precluded the cognitive functions of planning, premeditation and deliberation. See Commonwealth v. Terry [II], 513 Pa. 381, 394, 521 A.2d 398, 404 (1987); Commonwealth v. Terry [I], 501 Pa. 626, 631, 462 A.2d 676, 679 (1983). See also Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 28, 454 A.2d 937, 943 (1982)(psychiatric testimony must speak to overall inability to formulate or carry out a plan or design; such testimony is irrelevant to a diminished capacity defense if it only goes to defendant\u2019s irresistible impulse with respect to the particular crime). Neither social maladjustment, lack of self-control, impulsiveness, psycho-neurosis, emotional instability, chronic malaria, \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d nor all of such conditions combined, bear upon the narrow and extremely limited defense of diminished capacity. See Zettlemoyer, supra, at 38, 454 A.2d at 948. See also United States v. Pohlot, 827 F.2d 889, 903 (3d Cir.1987)(only in the most extraordinary circumstances does a defendant actually lack the capacity to form mens rea as it is normally understood in American law; even the most psychiatrically ill have the capacity to form intentions, which satisfies the mens rea requirement).\nDr. Levit\u2019s questionable testimony, even if credited, supports at most the legally incognizable \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d defense. For example, the following exchange occurred when Dr. Levit was asked why appellant was able to seek treatment for her own homicidal ideations if she was incapable of forming the specific intent to commit murder:\nQ: Could you explain for the Court why in two months prior to the homicide she was able to prevent or to seek care for her homicidal ideations?\nA: I can try. The series of events will be escalating. This is not unusual in this kind of situation. The charges of harassment occurred during this two-month period of time which further intensified her frustration and her hostility, her anger. She knew that she was a very angry person. She knew she was thinking of suicide and homicide. The part of her thinking which was still reasonable wanted to prevent these ... but during this two-month period the whole emotional tone built up and kept escalating. She kept preoccupying herself with these feelings, these thoughts, the depression, anxiety.\nThis testimony simply does not convey that appellant suffered from the inability to formulate the requisite mental state and to \u201ccarry out a plan or design.\u201d See Zettlemoyer, supra, 500 Pa. at 28, 454 A.2d at 943. Rather, it conveys that her formulation of that mental state may have been due to factors of which she was fully aware but that were, according to Dr. Levit, beyond her ability to control. Even more revealing is the following exchange:\nQ: Now, I want to call your attention to ... Miss Leggt\u2019s] ... chief complaint [in the St. John\u2019s hospital records] that, \u201cI need to be locked up or else I will be in jail.\u201d ... Is it consistent with someone who is experiencing the type of disorders that she was experiencing to have some awareness of her emotions and feelings and impulses?\nA: Oh, yes, it is. Mrs. Legg was not psychotic. She knew what was happening. She couldn\u2019t particularly control it, but she knew what was going on and it frightened her.\nSee N.T. at 21 (R. at 339a).\nThe inability to control one\u2019s actions is simply not a defense to the charge of murder in this Commonwealth. This Court has always diligently stood guard against the sometimes ingenious attempts by defense counsel to infiltrate our jurisprudence with the \u201cirresistible impulse\u201d defense in the guise of diminished capacity. See, e.g, Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, supra, 500 Pa. at 28, 454 A.2d at 943. The Court drops its guard today, and allows itself to be swayed by the insupportable legal conclusions drawn by a psychologist, as is further evidenced by the following exchanges:\nQ: Could you explain to the Court what, if any, effect a person\u2019s major depression and anxiety would have on their ability to perceive, especially the series of events within the last year?\nA: There would be a distortion in perception. There would be swings, perhaps, of mood. Judgment would intermittently be impaired ... When the charges of harassment came, when the other problems started building up, just in the last couple of weeks, this was much more devastating than what had happened before. This was a very sharp escalation which caused her significantly more pain, more anger, more feelings of betrayal- and anxiety and more depression. And it intensified both the suicidal and homicidal feelings.\nSee N.T. at 29-30 (R. at 347a-348a). \u201cSwings of mood,\u201d \u201cdistortions of perception,\u201d \u201cimpaired judgment,\u201d \u201canxiety,\u201d and \u201cdepression\u201d are not mutually exclusive with the commission of first-degree murder. Nor is the experience of an \u201cescalating\u201d life stressor that \u201cintensifies homicidal feelings.\u201d Even more revealing is Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony concerning appellant\u2019s psychological response to appellant\u2019s argument with her husband in the automobile which immediately preceded the shooting:\nQ: ... [T]he two of them argued [in the car] about whether he was continuing to see Amy Stevenson. And in her testimony she said that he lied to her and denied that he was seeing her ... how would a person who is experiencing psychological distortions respond to that particular stimuli? A: With a great deal of anger, with a great deal of frustration. With, again, intensified feelings of betrayal. With a lot of anxiety and a lot of depression. This was just sort of the last straw.\nQ: Would a person who is experiencing this condition have an ability at that time that they were in the car together arguing to coolly reflect upon her behavior?\nA: Absolutely not.\nQ: Why not?\nA: Because she was sufficiently upset and agitated at that time that when you look at this through the eyes of severe depression, anxiety, et cetera, all the anger that goes with them, her judgment was significantly impaired in my opinion and she simply was not able to formulate that kind of intent.\nN.T. at 30-31 (R. at 348a-349a),\nThis exchanges reveals the fundamental misunderstanding, that defense counsel, Dr. Levit, the PCRA court, and a majority of this Court share with respect to the concept of specific intent. Appellee did not need to be able to \u201ccoolly reflect on her behavior\u201d in order to be convicted of first-degree murder. The only mental abilities she needed to possess were the ability to understand the natural consequence of shooting someone twice at close range and the ability to specifically intend to pull the trigger while possessing this understanding. Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony does not in any way negate either of these abilities.\nMoreover, appellee\u2019s own treatment records, revealing that she had lain in wait on prior occasions specifically intending to kill her ex-husband and that she understood that she was fully capable of killing him, demonstrate quite convincingly that she possessed the ability to formulate the specific intent to commit murder. Attempting to account for these instances, Dr. Levit testified:\nThere is no question that she had homicidal feelings towards her husband. That is well documented. But if you want to look at it from what \u2014 as an oxynervon, psychologically valid, if this was an intentional, volitional act, it would not \u2014 there would not have been an argument. She would have went over and shot him ... she had well over a year in which she could have killed this man if there was true intent.\nN.T. at 39-40 (R. at 357a-358a). This striking bit of illogic apparently purports to establish that the lapse of over one year between the first hatching of a plan and its final culmination negates the possibility that the execution of the plan was intentional if the killing could have culminated at some earlier time. The doctor proceeds to reason his way to the remarkable conclusion that intentional murders are categorically not preceded by arguments, apparently since he believes that no murderer would want to waste time arguing if the murderer already intended to kill the victim. The unstated belief that seems to drive this conclusion by Dr. Levit is that all true first-degree murderers necessarily effectuate the termination of their victim in the most expeditious and efficient manner possible. Under the doctor\u2019s flawed reasoning, failure to kill in such a \u201cprofessional\u201d manner must therefore mean that the killer lacked a true intent to kill. I would find this reasoning amusing were it not for the fact that a majority of this Court evidently accepts that this peculiar logic tends to successfully establish the defense of diminished capacity. Thus, the only proper reaction is alarm, since it seems as though, under this logic, any slaying that does not bear the indicia of a dispassionate, \u201cprofessional\u201d-type assassination will now be a likely candidate for a successful diminished capacity defense in this Commonwealth.\nAn exposition of Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony would be incomplete if it did not include reference to the excerpt that most tellingly reveals his misunderstanding of the legal concept of diminished capacity. The PCRA court asked Dr. Levit, who had not read the trial transcript, about appellant\u2019s admission at trial that she had removed the gun with the specific intent of frightening the victim into telling the truth, and how this admission related to her ability to formulate other intentions, such as the intention to commit murder. The following dialogue ensued:\nTHE COURT: Assuming that [this] statement was made during the course of the trial, how does that bear upon what her state of mind might have been prior to actually confronting her husband ... ?\nDR. LEVIT: I think, again, from my point of view, trying to get someone to tell you the truth, trying to intimidate someone to be honest with you when you are feeling so angry, so depressed, so betrayed by that specific individual is totally different from wanting to kill them. This is a totally different situation. I can go window shopping and have no intent to buy.\nTHE COURT: You oftentimes wind up buying anyway?\nDR. LEVIT: That is true, but without intent.\nSee N.T. at 53 (R. at 371a).\nAssuming for the moment that it is true that people often purchase things without having formulated the specific intent to do so \u2014 a concept which I find mystifying, unless perhaps the doctor is making reference to shoppers who are hypnotized or perhaps sleepwalking \u2014 this testimony vividly reveals Dr. Levit\u2019s fundamental misunderstanding, in a legal sense, of the defense that his testimony purports to establish. Dr. Levit\u2019s psychobabble evidences his belief that, from a legal standpoint, appellant\u2019s ability to formulate the specific intent to intimidate someone with a gun for an articulated reason is irrelevant in determining whether appellant could further formulate the specific intent to cause that person\u2019s death. Quite to the contrary, however, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that the defense of diminished capacity is an extremely limited one that requires a defendant to establish that, at the time of the murder, one\u2019s ability to specifically deliberate and to carry out a plan was categorically negated by one\u2019s mental illness. See Terry [II], supra, 513 Pa. at 394, 521 A.2d at 404; Terry [I], supra, 501 Pa. at 631, 462 A.2d at 679 (1983); Zettlemoyer, supra, 500 Pa. at 28, 454 A.2d at 943 (1982). Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony does not explain or attempt to explain how, at the time of the shooting, appellant mysteriously lost her deliberative faculties and planning abilities which she possessed mere seconds before she killed her husband. Therefore, appellant cannot possibly prove by a reasonable likelihood that her deliberative faculties had indeed abandoned her at the moment of the shooting. Consequently, appellant has failed to meet her burden of establishing prejudice for purposes of the PCRA.\nIn sum, trial counsel acted quite reasonably in foregoing a diminished capacity defense in order to pursue a verdict of either involuntary manslaughter or acquittal, since the diminished capacity defense was patently inconsistent with these more desirable defenses that appellee\u2019s own testimony supported. Even if counsel had not acted reasonably, appellant would not thereby have suffered any prejudice, since a diminished capacity defense would not have proven availing on this record. Thus, under the relevant PCRA standards governing ineffective assistance of counsel claims, collateral relief in this matter is clearly not warranted.\nLastly, it is necessary to point out the effect that today\u2019s decision by the majority could have in upsetting fairly won convictions for first-degree murder in the future. By the majority\u2019s reasoning, any first-degree murder convict is entitled to a new trial when he can establish three facts: (1) that trial counsel was aware, or should have been aware, that a defendant had a medical history that included psychological problems; (2) that trial counsel neglected to present a diminished capacity defense, even if it would have conflicted with a defense that was reasonably presented; and (3) that a psychiatrist has concluded at a PCRA hearing that based on a review of the record and personal meetings, the appellant could not have formulated the required specific intent at the time of the murder. I fear that these three factors will henceforth converge with alarming frequency in PCRA petitions. Moreover, by stretching the defense of diminished capacity to encompass the facts of this case, the majority has, perhaps inadvertently, set a precedent which will allow defendants to raise the defense of \u201cthe devil made me do it\u201d to charges of first-degree murder. I do not believe that the particular facts of this case warrant the upheaval of the law of diminished capacity in the Commonwealth. Therefore, I dissent.\nNIGRO and SAYLOR, JJ., join this dissenting opinion.\n. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543 (appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing predated the 1995 amendments to section 9543 of the PCRA).\n. A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in. a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504.\n. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1102, 2502.\n. Trial counsel testified that he was not aware that diminished capacity was a possible defense, due to his failure to investigate appellant\u2019s medical history. However, even if he had reviewed appellant\u2019s prior history of medical treatment, he would have had \"some reasonable basis\u201d for declining to present the diminished capacity defense in light of its inconsistency with his chosen strategy. Cf. Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 101, 331 A.2d 435, 438 (1975)(as long as counsel's strategic decision had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests, it does not amount to ineffectiveness). The majority itself properly realizes that the test is not merely whether counsel was unreasonable for failing to investigate the defense, but whether he also would have been unreasonable in failing to present the defense if he had investigated it.\n. Trial counsel\u2019s summation included an appeal to the \"heat of passion\u201d defense, but this defense was only raised as a possible defense in the event that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of appellant was credited by the factfinder. Trial Trans, at 217 (Record at 304a). Immediately after raising this possibility, trial counsel concluded his own argument by stating:\nI suggested to the Court that as I said before, based on her character, your mercy dispensing powers, and the fact that the shooting was not intentional, but was reflexive, that your verdict would be involuntary manslaughter or not guilty of criminal homicide. Id. at 218 (Record at 305a)(emphasis added). Furthermore, in suggesting that the \"heat of passion\u201d defense might be an acceptable verdict under the prosecutor\u2019s theory of the case, trial counsel did not concede the issue of general criminal liability, as he necessarily would have by arguing diminished capacity. See Commonwealth v. Travaglia, supra, Commonwealth v. Walzack, supra. Thus, the fact that voluntary manslaughter was available and was argued as a possible defense verdict does not in any way implicate counsel\u2019s reasonableness in declining to pursue a defense of diminished capacity as well.\n. Dr. Levit, a psychologist who testified on appellant\u2019s behalf at the PCRA hearing, had no contact with appellant until over five years after the events at issue. He relied on his interpretations of behavior clinic reports, reports from St. John's Hospital, discovery material, and belated psychological tests that he performed on appellant in forming his opinions. See Notes of Test, at 10 (Record at 328a).\n. As explained infra, neither this testimony nor the remainder of Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony supports a diminished a diminished capacity defense.\n. The majority also alludes to the PCRA hearing testimony of trial counsel, who, when asked whether he would have proceeded differently had he known that appellant suffered from major depression, replied, \"Absolutely. First [sic] comes to mind is the defense of diminished capacity, if that can be developed.\u201d Maj. Opin. at 11. Trial counsel\u2019s self-interested testimony in support of a new trial for his former client, while somewhat suspect, is nevertheless irrelevant. The inquiry is not whether he would have acted differently under a subjective test, but whether he in fact acted reasonably in the first instance under an objective standard. For the reasons stated above, I believe that he did.\n. To some extent, analysis of whether there was actual prejudice will inevitably dovetail with analysis under the first prong of the ineffectiveness test, whether the underlying claim is of \"arguable merit.\u201d In this vein, the majority points out that, based on Dr. Levit\u2019s testimony, the Commonwealth has stipulated that the diminished capacity defense was of \"arguable merit.\u201d However, the issue of whether certain testimony, if credited, supports a defense of diminished capacity is a question of law. This Court is not bound by stipulations as to questions of law. See Matter of Green, 470 Pa. 164, 368 A.2d 245 (1977); Miller v. Commonwealth, 498 Pa. 103, 109, 445 A.2d 88, 91 (1981)(Roberts, J., dissenting)(citing Sanford\u2019s Estate v. C.I.R., 308 U.S. 39, 51, 60 S.Ct. 51, 59, 84 L.Ed. 20 (1939)). Therefore, the stipulation of the parties that the underlying issue is of arguable merit has no preclusive effect in our determination as to whether appellant suffered prejudice through trial counsel's failure to advance the underlying claim.\n. Dr. Levit testified similarly at a subsequent point in the hearing, after the Court asked him why he believed that appellee could not formulate the specific intent to kill:\nBecause at that time the combination of her symptoms was sufficiently intense that her judgment was markedly impaired, that her reasoning and thought process and abilities had essentially been suspected, and that she could not in my opinion formulate rationally this kind of intent.\nN.T. at 49 (R. at 367a)(emphasis added). Again, it would be virtually impossible to secure a conviction for first-degree murder if the prosecutor had to prove that the accused\u2019s specific intent to commit the murder had been rationally formulated. In a very real sense, it is never a rational thought process that causes someone to formulate the intent to take a life. However, a rational thought process is not a prerequisite to the ability to form a specific intent in our legal system. See, e.g., United States v. Pohlot, 827 F.2d 889, 903 (3d Cir.1987)(only in the most extraordinary circumstances does a defendant actually lack the capacity to form mens rea as it is normally understood in American law; even the most psychiatrically ill have the capacity to form intentions, which satisfies the mens rea requirement).\n. The logical possibility that an argument can itself trigger the specific intent to kill escapes Dr. Levit\u2019s legal analysis.",
