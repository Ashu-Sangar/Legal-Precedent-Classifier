        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCASTILLE, Justice.\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether a person who has voluntarily elected to forego underinsured motorist coverage on his own vehicle is precluded from recovering underinsured motorist benefits from separate automobile insurance policies issued to family members with whom he resides as a result of a \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause excluding underinsured motorist coverage for bodily injury suffered while occupying a motor vehicle not insured for underinsured motorist coverage. Because we hold both that this \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language precludes the recovery of underinsured motorist benefits under the facts of the case and that this exclusionary language is not against public policy, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nThe relevant facts are not in dispute. On June 25, 1993, appellant Eichelman was injured when his motorcycle was struck by a pick-up truck being negligently operated by another individual. The truck driver\u2019s automobile insurance policy provided property damage and bodily injury liability coverage in the amount of one-hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Upon receipt of appellant\u2019s notice of claim, the negligent truck driver\u2019s insurance carrier tendered the full limits of its coverage on the policy. Appellant accepted the tender by the truck driver\u2019s insurance carrier. However, appellant avers that the $100,000 failed to totally cover his injuries.\nAppellant\u2019s motorcycle was insured with Aegis Security Insurance Company (\u201cAegis\u201d) at the time of accident. The Aegis policy did not provide underinsured motorist coverage because appellant had expressly waived such coverage.\nHaving voluntarily foregone underinsured motorist coverage in his own insurance policy on his motorcycle, appellant then made a claim for such coverage under two insurance policies that appellant\u2019s mother and her husband maintained with appellee, Nationwide Insurance Company. At the time of the accident, appellant was thirty-one years old and lived at his mother\u2019s residence. Appellant claimed that he was entitled to the underinsured motorist coverage provided by the two policies issued by appellee because each policy provided underinsured motorist coverage for the named insured and any relative who resided with the named insured. Appellee does not dispute that appellant qualified as a relative under each policy.\nAfter reviewing the two insurance policies, appellee denied coverage to appellant under the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause in each policy which limited underinsured coverage as follows:\nCOVERAGE EXCLUSIONS\nThis [underinsured] coverage does not apply to:\n6. Bodily injury suffered while occupying a motor vehicle owned by you or a relative not insured for Underinsured Motorists coverage under this policy; nor to bodily injury from being hit by any such motor vehicle.\nR. 44a. Appellant responded to appellee\u2019s denial of his claim for underinsured benefits by filing a complaint requesting a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to such benefits under the two policies issued by appellee and further asserting that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause is against public policy. After the close of discovery, appellant filed a motion for summary judgment. On June 16, 1995, the trial court granted appellant\u2019s motion. In doing so, the trial court, relying on the Superior Court\u2019s memorandum opinion in Hart v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 436 Pa.Super. 652, 647 A.2d 270 (Pa.Super.1994), held that such a \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause contravenes public policy and is void as applied to appellant.\nOn June 4, 1996, the Superior Court reversed the trial court and found that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d at issue in the case sub judice was valid. In making this ruling, the Superior Court noted that the Hart decision on which the trial court relied was subsequently reversed by this Court\u2019s per curiam order in Hart v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 541 Pa. 419, 663 A.2d 682 (1995). Thus, the Superior Court held that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause in the two policies issued by appellee barred appellant from recovering underinsured motorist benefits. This Court granted allocatur in order to more fully address whether the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d clause in the two insurance policies issued by appellant is enforceable under Pennsylvania law.\nAppellant in this case has never argued that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in the insurance policies issued by appellee to his mother and her husband is unclear or ambiguous. Neither does appellant dispute that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in these two insurance policies clearly and unambiguously bars appellant\u2019s recovery of underinsured motorist benefits from these two policies since he suffered his injuries while operating a motor vehicle not insured for underinsured coverage. Instead, the present dispute centers on whether the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d provision violates public policy.\nGenerally, a clear and unambiguous contract provision must be given its plain meaning unless to do so would be contrary to a clearly expressed public policy. Antanovich v. Allstate Ins. Co., 507 Pa. 68, 76, 488 A.2d 571, 575 (1985). When examining whether a contract violates public policy, this Court is mindful that public policy is more than a vague goal which may be used to circumvent the plain meaning of the contract. Hall v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., 538 Pa. 337, 347, 648 A.2d 755, 760 (1994). As this Court has stated:\nPublic policy is to be ascertained by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interest. As the term \u201cpublic policy\u201d is vague, there must be found definite indications in the law of the sovereignty to justify the invalidation of a contract as contrary to that policy ... Only dominant public policy would justify such action. In the absence of a plain indication of that policy through long governmental practice or statutory enactments, or of violations of obvious ethical or moral standards, the Court should not assume to declare contracts ... contrary to public policy. The courts must be content to await legislative action.\nId. at 347-48, 648 A.2d at 760 (citations omitted). This Court has further elaborated that:\nIt is only when a given policy is so obviously for or against the public health, safety, morals or welfare that there is a virtual unanimity of opinion in regard to it, that a court may constitute itself the voice of the community in so declaring [that the contract is against public policy].\nMamlin v. Genoe, 340 Pa. 320, 325, 17 A.2d 407, 409 (1941).\nWhen examining whether the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in the two insurance policies issued by appellee violate public policy, this Court must be mindful of the legislative intent behind the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (\u201cMVFRL\u201d) and its underinsured motorist provisions. As this Court recently stated:\n[T]he repeal of the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.101, and the simultaneous enactment of the MVFRL, reflected a legislative \u201cconcern for the spiral-ling consumer cost of automobile insurance and resultant increase in the number of uninsured motorists driving on public highways.\u201d\nRump v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 551 Pa. 339, 710 A.2d 1093 (1998). The purpose behind underinsured motorist coverage is to protect the insured from the risk that a negligent driver of another vehicle will cause injury to the insured and will have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate the insured for his injuries. Paylor v. Hartford Ins. Co., 536 Pa. at 587, 640 A.2d at 1235-36. For the reasons described below, this Court, after considering the above factors, can discern no overriding public policy that forbids a \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d like that at issue in this case.\nOne factor this Court must examine is whether there is a unanimity of opinion that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language contained in the two policies issued by appellee violates public policy. As evidenced by a recent trilogy of decisions from this Court discussed below, there is a lack of unanimity that such language violates public policy.\nThe trilogy of decisions by this Court began in Paylor v. Hartford Ins. Co., 536 Pa. 583, 640 A.2d 1234 (1994). In Paylor, the insureds were killed in a single-vehicle accident while operating their motor home, which was insured under a policy issued by Foremost Insurance Company. The decedent insureds also maintained a policy with Hartford Insurance Company covering three other vehicles that they owned. The estate of one of the decedent insureds recovered the policy liability limits from Foremost and then sought to recover underinsured coverage from the Hartford policy. Hartford denied underinsured coverage based on the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d in the Hartford policy. The decedent insureds\u2019 estate brought a declaratory judgment action seeking underinsured coverage and a declaration that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d violated public policy and the MVFRL. This Court reviewed several cases involving the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d and concluded that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d barred underinsured coverage because the decedent insureds chose to insure the motor home for substantially less than they insured their other three automobiles and therefore the underinsured coverage in the Hartford policy on those cars should not be converted into additional liability coverage for the motor home.\nLess than one month after the Paylor decision, this Court expanded the applicability of the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d in Windrim, v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 537 Pa. 129, 641 A.2d 1154 (1994). In Windrim, the appellant, while driving his uninsured automobile, was injured by the negligence of an unknown hit-and-run driver. The Appellant sought uninsured coverage under a Nationwide policy maintained by his mother, with whom he had been living at the time. Nationwide denied coverage based on the \u201chousehold exclusion.\u201d This Court held that the exclusion was valid as applied on the basis that relatives living with the named insureds could decide not to purchase insurance for their own vehicles and instead attempt to rely on uninsured motorist coverage under the named insured\u2019s policy.\nIn this Court\u2019s third decision in the recent \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d trilogy, this Court issued a per curiam order in Hart v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 541 Pa. 419, 663 A.2d 682 (1995). The facts of Hart were distinguishable from Windrim in that the motor vehicle which Hart was driving was insured under a separate policy from that which he sought to obtain underinsured benefits. Nationwide invoked a \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d in the policy from which Hart sought underinsured benefits. Moreover, the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in Hart was virtually identical to the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language at issue in the case sub judice. While the lower courts voided the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d as against public policy, this Court reversed those decisions on the basis of its holding in Windrim. Thus, the above examination of this Court\u2019s case law does not suggest that there is a unanimity of opinion against enforcement of the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language contained in the two policies issued by appellee.\nHaving determined that there is a lack of unanimity of opinion against the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language at issue, this Court must then examine whether such language is contrary to the public health, safety, morals or welfare of the people. Here, this Court cannot discern, nor does appellant express, how the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in the two policies issued by appellee is so obviously against the public health, safety, morals or welfare of the people that the clause should not be enforced on public policy grounds.\nFinally, this Court must determine if the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language is against the legislative intent behind the MVFRL. As noted above, underinsured motorist coverage serves the purpose of protecting innocent victims from under-insured motorists who cannot adequately compensate the victims for their injuries. That purpose, however, does not rise to the level of public policy overriding every other consideration of contract construction. As this Court has stated, \u201cthere is a correlation between premiums paid by the insured and the coverage the claimant should reasonably expect to receive.\u201d Hall v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., 538 Pa. 337, 349, 648 A.2d 755, 761 (1994). Here, appellant voluntarily chose not to purchase underinsured motorist coverage. In return for this choice, appellant received reduced insurance premiums. As appellant admitted in his answers to interrogatories, he was not aware that his mother and her husband had insurance policies which could have possibly covered him. Moreover, it is not readily apparent that appellee knew of appellant\u2019s existence when it issued the two insurance policies or that the insurance premium charged to his mother and her husband reflected an intent on their part to provide underinsured motorist coverage to appellant. Thus, this Court concludes that giving effect to the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d in this case furthers the legislative policy behind underinsured motorist coverage in the MVFRL since it will have the effect of holding appellant to his voluntary choice.\nAllowing the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language to stand in this case is further bolstered by the intent behind the MVFRL, to stop the spiralling costs of automobile insurance in the Commonwealth. If appellant\u2019s position were accepted, it would allow an entire family living in a single household with numerous automobiles to obtain underinsured motorist coverage for each family member through a single insurance policy on one of the automobiles in the household. If this result were allowed, it would most likely result in higher insurance premiums on all insureds (even those without family members living at their residence) since insurers would be required to factor expanded coverage cost into rates charged for underinsured motorist coverage. Thus, allowing the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language of the two insurance policies at issue to bar recovery by appellant of underinsured motorist benefits is consistent with the intent behind the enactment of the MVFRL.\nTherefore, the Court concludes that a person who has voluntarily elected not to carry underinsured motorist coverage on his own vehicle is not entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits from separate insurance policies issued to family members with whom he resides where clear and unambiguous \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language explicitly precludes underinsured motorist coverage for bodily injury suffered while occupying a motor vehicle not insured for underinsured motorist coverage. As stated, it is only in the clearest of cases that a court may make an alleged public policy the basis of judicial decision. See Guardian Life Ins. Co. v. Zerance, 505 Pa. 345, 354, 479 A.2d 949, 954 (1984). The case sub judice is not the clearest of cases, so it is beyond judicial authority to declare the clear and unambiguous \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in the policies issued by appellee to be void as against public policy. If anything, the above analysis demonstrates that allowing the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language to stand supports the legislatively stated public policy of reducing insurance costs. Therefore, this Court finds that the \u201chousehold exclusion\u201d language in the two insurance policies issued by appellee is valid. Accordingly, this Court affirms the order of the Superior Court reversing the trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment and remanding the matter to the trial court.\n. Aegis sent appellant a notice of cancellation for misrepresentation and fraud approximately five days before the accident. The notice of cancellation, however, provided that coverage was cancelled effective July 23, 1993. Thus, appellant\u2019s policy with Aegis was in effect at the time of the accident subject to this appeal.\n. Underinsured motorist coverage provides \"protection for persons who suffer injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle and are legally entitled to recover damages therefor from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1731(c). While all motor vehicle liability insurance policies issued for vehicles registered in the Commonwealth must offer underinsured and/or uninsured motorist coverage, the 1990 amendments to the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law made the purchase of underinsured and/or uninsured motorist coverage optional. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1731(a).\n. Appellant\u2019s mother was a named insured on a policy issued by appellee which covered a 1993 Toyota Camry. The mother\u2019s husband was a named insured on a separate policy issued by appellee which covered a 1993 Toyota Corrolla.\n. This Court\u2019s per curiam order in Hart cited Windrim v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 537 Pa. 129, 641 A.2d 1154 (1994), as the grounds for reversing the Superior Court.\n. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1701, et seq.",
