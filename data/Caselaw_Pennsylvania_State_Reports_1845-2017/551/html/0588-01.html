Appellants claim that they were entitled to notice of the proposed subdivision in order to assert their rights; however, appellants received no notice of the subdivision proceedings.</p>

The Commonwealth Court focused on the <em>Michener </em>court’s statement that “[cjourts in trying a zoning case will ordinarily exclude evidence of private restrictions, and in trying a private restriction case will exclude evidence of zoning. This is done on grounds of immateriality.” <em><a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 A.2d 367">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 A.2d 367">at 404</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=115%20A.2d%20367" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="115 A.2d 367">115 A.2d at 370</a>. Since this court’s holding in <em>Michener, </em>courts of this Commonwealth have consistently interpreted that holding to exclude evidence of private restrictions in all zoning cases.</p>

      <em>Michener </em>is factually distinguishable from the instant case in that the parties before the court in that case were not the parties who possessed the private right sought to be enforced. The <em>Michener </em>court held that it was error for the trial court to consider deed restrictions in denying a zoning variance. The parties who possessed the right to enforce the deed restrictions were not parties to the action. Here appellants are the parties in interest seeking to enforce their own private right. In addition, <em>Michener </em>did not involve the issue of whether the adjacent landowner was entitled to notice of the zoning pro<a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>ceedings. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court’s reliance on <em>Michener </em>is misplaced.</p>
    <p id="b690-4" data-blocks='[["BL_690.4",690,[215,404,1159,736]]]'>By failing to give appellant’s notice of the subdivision proceedings, they were denied the right to object based upon the infringement of their water rights. Further, the failure to provide notice allowed appellants’ rights to be adversely affected without providing them with an opportunity to be heard. In this case, giving notice to appellants would have promoted judicial economy by disposing of both the proposed subdivision plan and the effect of the plan on appellants’ water rights in a single proceeding which may have resulted in an accord being reached that accomplished appellees’ purposes while maintaining appellants’ rights. Because I believe that appellant’s should have been given notice and the opportunity to present their objections in the zoning proceeding, I would reverse.</p>

By allowing standing, however, the parties can establish a record of facts related to the property at issue. In addition, the parties may be able to settle their differences without further litigation. The trial court would then be presented with any remaining issues related to the property in one proceeding. Thus, in the interest of judicial economy, I dissent.</p>
