Accordingly, as noted in footnote one, we rejected the presumption of prejudice adopted in <em>Penn Piping </em>and required that actual prejudice be shown before a case is dismissed for lack of prosecution. We find that the weakness of the presumption of prejudice is exemplified in a Rule 1901 dismissal. It strains logic to conclude that prejudice is required for a Rule 1901 dismissal, and at the same time presume prejudice after two years of inactivity. In order for a particular case to come to the attention of the prothonotary for Rule 1901 purposes, the case must have already been inactive, at least on the docket, for a period of two years.</p>

Appellants argue that Appellees were not prejudiced by the death of Dr. Kruper because he was not the treating physician, was not deposed and was not listed as an expert witness. These same arguments were made before the trial court and rejected. The trial court obviously credited the Appellees’ version of the importance of Dr. Kruper as a witness.</p>
