Kauffman telephoned K.K.’s mother and requested that K.K’s mother, K.K. and Nester come to the CPS office for a meeting concerning the allegations in the report. At 4:00 p.m., they arrived in the lobby of the CPS office. Kauffman first interviewed K.K. alone in a separate room for approximately forty-five minutes. She next interviewed K.K.’s mother alone for forty-five minutes. Kauffman then interviewed Nester alone for approximately one hour and fifteen minutes.</p>

Kauffman offered to help Nester, K.K. and K.K.’s mother to get treatment and counseling.

Nester then voluntarily accompanied Kauffman to an interview room. There were no police present and Kauffman did not tell Nester that he was under arrest or otherwise not free to leave. Kauffman never promised Nester that he would not be charged if he confessed. Nester also never asked Kauffman to stop questioning him. Nester’s interview lasted only one hour and fifteen minutes, which is not unduly long. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b266-5" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[226,921,1162,1048]]]'>Second, Kauffman’s offer to assist Nester in getting treatment was not improperly coercive. This Court has held that an offer of <em>leniency </em>in prosecution conditioned on a confession is an impermissible inducement for a confession. <em>Commonwealth v. Laatsch, </em><a href="/pa/541/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="66" data-cite="541 Pa. 169" data-case-ids="470762" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0169-01">541 Pa. 169</a>, <a href="/pa/541/0169-01" class="citation" data-index="67" data-cite="661 A.2d 1365" data-case-ids="470762,7884855" data-case-paths="/pa/541/0169-01,/a2d/661/1365-01">661 A.2d 1365</a> (1995). However, in this case, Kauffman said that she would help Nester get treatment and counseling. She did not offer him leniency in a criminal prosecution. More importantly, the offer of assistance was not a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the confession because Kauffman did not tell Nester that if he confessed then he would receive treatment instead of being criminally prosecuted. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Purnell, </em><a href="/pa-super/412/0462-01" class="citation" data-index="68" data-cite="412 Pa.

      <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>Third, Kauffman’s statement to Nester that he would have to talk to police if he did not talk to her and it would be harder to talk to the police was not so coercive as to overwhelm Nester’s ability to make a free and unconstrained decision to confess. Not all psychological persuasion is prohibited. <em>Miller </em>(3d Cir.); <em>see also Commonwealth v.

There is ample factual support in the record for the foregoing conclusions. Child Protective Services organizations are government agencies with a statutory duty to report complaints to police who investigate for criminal prosecution. During the course of the interview with Appellee, the Child Protective Services caseworker failed to inform Appellee of her statutory duty to report to the police, or the criminal consequences of any incriminating statements made by Appellee. The “Rights” Letter provided to Appellee by the caseworker, likewise, did not advise Appellee that the contents of the interview would be reported to police, and any statements made by Appellee would ultimately be utilized against him in criminal prosecution. The caseworker failed to convey to him the seriousness of the allegations, or that the allegations could mandate a minimum prison sentence. Appellee testified during the suppression hearing that the caseworker told him if he did not talk to her, he would have to talk to the police and it would be harder talking to the police than it would be to her.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> As noted by the trial court, the caseworker’s statements regarding a police interview are misleading.
