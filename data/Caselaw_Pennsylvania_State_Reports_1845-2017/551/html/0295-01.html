We find no case law that controls our decision in this matter. <em>Township of South Park, </em>cited by the City, is not instructive on this issue. There, the township enacted an ordinance that taxed patrons engaging in amusements within its borders.

However, as in <em>Township of South Park, </em>the tax in <em>Weatherly </em>applied to all amusements within the area of the taxing authority.

Consistent with the dictionary definition, the Commonwealth Court, here, held that “taxable” on nonpublic property does not imply that there must be an actual tax on leases of nonpublic property.

In <em>Life Assurance, </em>we held that a nondiscriminatory tax does not become constitutionally tainted by <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>the cumulative effect of other taxes according distinctive treatment to various classes of taxpayers. The specific tax in question levied an identical gross premiums tax on domestic life insurance companies and foreign insurance companies. The domestic companies argued that the imposition of a gross premiums tax on domestic companies resulted in an unequal tax treatment because the domestic companies were already subject to net income and capital stock taxes, which were not applicable to the foreign companies. We held that because the gross premiums tax did not distinguish between domestic and foreign companies, it was not rendered unconstitutional by reason of classifications made by other legislation. Thus, in <em>Life Assurance, </em>the differing pre-existing tax burdens did not render the domestic and foreign taxpayers dissimilar for purposes of our analysis of the nondiscriminatory gross premiums tax. By extension, here, the nonuniform treatment of lessees of exempt and nonexempt property arising from Resolution 276 is not legitimized by reason of other legislation according the lessees distinctive treatment.</p>

In support of this position, the School District presented the trial testimony of John J. Buckley, Jr., President of Harristown Development Corporation, which leases nonexempt property to retail tenants in the City. He stated that the corporation’s leases contain “pass through” costs, in addition to minimum rent, which allocate to the tenant a share of the corporation’s real estate taxes. R. at 102a-104a. The trial court made no specific findings on this issue. However, assuming the credibility of Mr. Buckley’s testimony, it does not establish any concrete distinction between the rental consideration paid by lessees of exempt and nonexempt property. Although the rental consideration for nonexempt property may incorporate a percentage of the owner’s real estate tax liability, not contained in the rent of exempt property, we will not presume that, in a competitive <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>market, a comparison of the rental rates for nonexempt and exempt property reflects such a difference.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>
