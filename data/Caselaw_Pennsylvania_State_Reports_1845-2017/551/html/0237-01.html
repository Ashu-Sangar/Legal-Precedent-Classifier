    <p id="b339-11" data-blocks='[["BL_339.11",339,[243,1625,1151,635]]]'>On March 14, 1992, Randy Hunter, Jr. (Hunter), while driving a family-owned automobile, was acting in his capacity as a volunteer fireman for the Center Township Volunteer Fire Company when his vehicle struck and killed Evelyn Houser (Houser). At the time of the accident, the vehicle operated by Hunter was owned by his father and insured with appellee, Motorists Mutual Insurance Company (Motorists). Hunter’s policy with Motorists had a limit of liability of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. The fire company was insured by appellant Indemnity Insurance Company of North America (Indemnity) with an applicable combined single limit of liability of $300,000.</p>

Clearly, under the statute, Hunter would be entitled to indemnification from the fire company for any expenses he incurred as a result of the accident which occurred while Hunter was engaged in the business of the fire company, and this Court has consistently upheld the right of public employees to indemnification.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

      <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>The issue raised in this appeal, however, is whether Hunter’s <em>insurer </em>(Motorists) is entitled to indemnification from the fire company’s <em>insurer </em>(Indemnity) where the fire company’s insurance policy with Indemnity expressly shifts financial responsibility to Motorists as the primary carrier. The policy concerns behind the indemnification statute are not served by placing all of the responsibility for the loss on Indemnity because the financial loss for the accident is not personal to Hunter in this case, but rather would be borne by Motorists to its limits of liability. Further, the indemnification statute does not address indemnification of insurers of public employees, only indemnification of the employee himself. Thus, a finding that Hunter’s insurer is not entitled to indemnification does not offend the statutory indemnification provisions.</p>
