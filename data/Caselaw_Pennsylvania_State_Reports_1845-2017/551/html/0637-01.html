As he passed the street corner, Officer Kelly detected the odor of marijuana. He then drove around the block to get a closer look and observed several members of the group smoking marijuana.

As the <em>Terry </em>court recognized, the interaction occurring between an officer on the beat and a citizen in a typical stop and frisk situation requires the officer to make a swift on-the-spot decision assessing the potential nature of criminal activity, the conduct of the suspect, the potential danger to others in the area and, of course, the potential danger to the officer. Given the immediacy of the situation, I do not read <em>Terry </em>to require the officer to specify that the suspect was possibly reaching for a weapon, or that the officer observed a bulge. Rather, I read <em>Terry </em>to require that the officer set forth reasonable suspicion to support the decision to frisk. Reasonable suspicion is more than a hunch but less than probable cause. <em>Terry, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. at 21</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. at 1880</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">20 L.Ed.2d at 905</a>.

The officer specifically testified that he knew the hard object <a id="p653" href="#p653" data-label="653" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*653</a>was not a weapon but after squeezing it he was certain it was crack cocaine.

Rather, the officer determined that the item was contraband only after conducting a further search, one not authorized by <em>Terry </em>or by any other exception to the warrant requirement. Because this further search of respondent’s pocket was constitutionally invalid, the seizure of the cocaine that followed is likewise unconstitutional.</blockquote>

In those cases, and their progeny, the Superior Court has created a special exception to <em>Terry </em>for stop and frisk situations involving drug activity. The Superior Court has taken judicial notice of the fact that drug dealers are likely to be armed and dangerous. From that premise the Superior Court then concluded that once an officer has a reasonable belief that drugs are involved, he may frisk for weapons without further articulating a reason for the frisk.</p>

To carve out an exception to this requirement for all drug cases would completely dissipate the protection for our citizens to be free of unwarranted searches which necessarily factors into the <em>Terry </em>analysis. Balancing the privacy rights of our citizens against the need for the police to be free of the limitations of <em>Terry </em>when investigating possible criminal activity of a drug related nature, I believe that the balance tips in favor of privacy.</p>

In <em>Dickerson, </em>two police officers stopped and frisked the suspect after observing him acting suspiciously while departing from an apartment building known for drug sales. The search revealed no weapons, but the officer who conducted the search testified that as he patted down the front of the suspect’s body, he felt a small lump in the front pocket. The officer “examined it with [his] fingers and slid it and it felt to be a lump of crack cocaine in cellophane.” <em><a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="161" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">at 369</a>, <a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="162" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">113 S.Ct. 2130</a>. The officer reached into the suspect’s pocket and retrieved a small plastic bag containing crack cocaine. After noting that the propriety of the stop was not at issue, the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the officer who conducted the <a id="p655" href="#p655" data-label="655" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*655</a>search was acting within the lawful bounds marked by <em>Terry </em>at the time he gained probable cause to believe that the lump in the suspect’s jacket was contraband. The record revealed that the officer did not immediately upon initial contact recognize the lump in the suspect’s pocket as being crack cocaine. Rather, the officer determined that the lump was contraband after “squeezing, sliding and otherwise manipulating the contents of the defendant’s pocket” — a pocket which the officer already knew contained no weapon. <em><a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="163" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">at 377</a>, <a href="/us/508/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="164" data-cite="508 U.S. 366" data-case-ids="12205" data-case-paths="/us/508/0366-01">113 S.Ct. 2130</a>. Thus, the United States Supreme Court concluded that the officer’s continued exploration of the suspect’s pocket after having realized that it contained no weapon was unrelated to the sole justification of the search under <em>Terry </em>: the protection of the police officer and others nearby. Accordingly, the Court held that the search of the suspect’s pocket was improper. Thus, pursuant to <em>Dickerson, </em>an officer may lawfully seize contraband found on a suspect provided that the officer has reasonable suspicion to search the suspect for weapons and the officer immediately recognizes the item as contraband without conducting some further search of the object.</p>

In order to perform a real-life pat-down on the street, an officer does not simply extend his hands in a stiff and robotic fashion. A slight amount of hand-cupping and finger pressure is necessary for an officer to perform a pat down in order to be able to ascertain in his own mind whether an object is a weapon. The officer <em>sub judice </em>did not squeeze the item and roll it between his fingers as did the officer in <em>Dickerson. </em>Rather, the squeezing was immediate and slight, consistent with a permissible pat-down search. Surely the United States Supreme Court did not intend for officers to conduct pat-down searches with their fingers stiff and straight as if fused at the knuckles. Such a result would be not only absurd, but would be inconsistent with the reasoning of <em>Terry </em>which permits a thorough and careful pat-down for weapons in order to protect the safety of the officer and the public. <em>Terry, </em><a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="165" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">392 U.S. at 29</a>, <a href="/us/392/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="166" data-cite="392 U.S. 1" data-case-ids="6167798" data-case-paths="/us/392/0001-01">88 S.Ct. 1868</a>.</p>

He stated that after doing this, “there was no doubt in my mind it was marijuana after feeling it.” The officer also admitted that he felt the package through the jacket with his fingertips, the palm of his hand, and the entire hand. He testified that the first time he felt the package, it was obvious to him that it was a bag, and that he did not have to determine the contents of the package because he already knew what it was when he felt it.
