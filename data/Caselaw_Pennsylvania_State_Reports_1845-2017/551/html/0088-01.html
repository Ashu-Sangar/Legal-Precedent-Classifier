On July 16, 1992, officers of the City of Pittsburgh Narcotics Task Force were investigating possible drug trafficking activity at a public housing project in the West End section of Pittsburgh. Two of the officers noticed a group of four men, including appellant, huddled together on a set of steps. Appellant was holding a white plastic object in his right hand and was showing it to the other three men.</p>

When the officer reached the top of the steps, he saw appellant racing across an open field. During the course of the pursuit, appellant threw a plastic bag into the weeds. After appellant was apprehended, the plastic bag was retrieved and found to contain several pieces of crack cocaine. Appellant was subsequently arrested and taken to a police car, where he was given his <em>Miranda </em>rights. After waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights, appellant told police that he was a poor man and needed to sell drugs in order to make some money. He also stated that he had only been selling drugs for a few months. During the course of the statement, appellant was asked whether he had a vehicle with him, and if so, where it was located. Appellant indicated that he did have a vehicle and agreed to lead the officers to it. A search of the vehicle yielded a loaded pistol.</p>
