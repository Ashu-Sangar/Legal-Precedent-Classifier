For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the Superior Court’s ruling affirming the trial court’s denial of appellant’s suppression motion.</p>

The evidence establishes that appellant, a licensed physician, and the patient met in 1975 when appellant began treating the patient. Appellant stopped providing medical treatment to the patient for a number of years. However, in 1983, appellant, in violation of the Health and Safety Act, began writing pharmaceutical prescriptions for the patient for the controlled substance Dilaudid, a narcotic analgesic and powerful pain killer to which the patient was addicted. In some instances the patient paid appellant in cash and at other times appellant and the patient engaged in a bartering system whereby appellant supplied the patient with Dilaudid in exchange for the <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>patient’s delivery to him of various stolen appliances such as video equipment and television's.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[247,457,1159,537]]]'>In 1986, appellant decided to expand this enterprise and conspired with the patient to sell Dilaudid illegally to addicts on appellant’s behalf. Appellant began writing Dilaudid prescriptions for the patient for batches of 100 pills. So as not to be detected, appellant directed the patient to have the prescriptions filled at different locations. Upon redeeming the prescription, the patient would sell the pills to other drug addicts and would then divide the proceeds from the illegal sales with appellant. Appellant also continued to write illegal prescriptions for the patient’s own addiction.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[246,1035,1159,698]]]'>In May 1988, the patient was arrested on unrelated drug charges. However, the charges were dismissed on June 27, 1988, for lack of evidence. Nevertheless, the patient, who overcame his addiction to Dilaudid while in custody on the pending charges, decided he wanted to change his way of life for the better and began cooperating with police in their investigation of appellant’s illegal drug dispensing activity. Hence, shortly after his release, the patient approached Detective Lynch of the Philadelphia Police Narcotics Unit. The patient detailed the extent of appellant’s illegal drug operation based upon his personal experiences and told Detective Lynch that he was willing to cooperate with the police in an investigation of appellant’s activities.</p>
    <p id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.6",104,[244,1776,1160,585]]]'>On July 8, 1988, the patient, now informant, in coordination with the police investigators, arranged a meeting with appellant in the parking lot of appellant’s medical office. At that location, appellant again resumed his illegal activities and wrote a prescription for the patient for 100 Dilaudids and the two agreed that they would share the proceeds of the sale of the drugs. The police then accompanied the patient to a pharmacy where the prescriptions were filled. Later that same day, the patient telephoned appellant and told him that he would pay appellant his share of the profits from the sale of the Dilaudid on July 11, 1988.</p>

The Court held that when “applying [the principles of <em>Blystone</em>] to the instant case[, one] is led to the conclusion that the circumstances do not establish that [the trooper] possessed a justifiable expectation that his words would not be subject to interception.” Thus, the Court held that there was no violation of the Act.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_12" id="ref_footnote_1_12">12</a>

Communications between physicians and patients are statutorily protected, although such privilege was admittedly waived here by the patient/informant. The fact that such communications are of a confidential nature supports the view that a heightened expectation of privacy exists. As stated by the majority, "[t]he purpose of the physician-patient privilege is to create a confidential atmosphere in which the patient will be encouraged to disclose all possible information bearing on his or her illness so that the physician may render effective treatment.” Op. at 1257-58, citing <em>In re June 1979 Allegheny County Investigating Grand Jury, </em><a href="/pa/490/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="76" data-cite="490 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1763827" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0143-01">490 Pa. 143</a>, <a href="/pa/490/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="77" data-cite="490 Pa. 143" data-case-ids="1763827" data-case-paths="/pa/490/0143-01">415 A.2d 73</a>, 77 (1980).

For example, Barbieri testified here that he felt strictly applying the <em>Schaeffer </em>search warrant requirement would defeat the purpose of the one-party consensual wiretap. In particular, he noted that the service requirement of Pa.R.Crim.P.2004 would alert the unknowing party that their conversation was being recorded. In an effort to bypass this problem while still complying with the law, Barbieri interpreted the intent of the <em>Schaeffer </em>opinion to be the determination of probable cause by a neutral judicial authority. Notes of testimony, March 29, 1990, at__ (R.R. 74A). Therefore, he applied for an Order from the Court of Common Pleas authorizing the search based on Judge Abraham’s determination of probable cause. However, I note that there is no provision in the Wiretap Act for judges of the Courts of Common Pleas to authorize wiretaps. Although the Commonwealth was attempting to follow the requirements of <em>Schaeffer, </em>the Superior Court’s Opinion in <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>that case did not offer sufficient guidance to law enforcement officers concerning how to comply with the so-called warrant requirement. Moreover, as Barbieri conceded, Judge Abraham’s Order did not comply with the requirements for a search warrant; for example it was not limited in time to two days and it was not served on Alexander. <em>Schaeffer </em>does not explain whether these deficiencies are fatal to the constitutionality of the search.</p>
