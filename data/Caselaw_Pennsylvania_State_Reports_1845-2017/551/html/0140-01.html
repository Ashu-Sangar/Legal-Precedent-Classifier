While molesting her, he strangled her to death.

The essence of this claim is that it was error for the trial court not to instruct the jury that before it could consider evidence of appellant’s confession, the Commonwealth must have established beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was alive when the appellant penetrated her genital organ with his finger. The claim is meritless. As earlier discussed, the confession was properly admitted under the rule of <em>DiSabatino </em>that “where independent evidence establishes the corpus delicti of only one ... crime, the confession may be admissible as evidence of the commission of the other crime.” Here, the confession established that the victim was alive when the penetration occurred. The court <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>did not err, therefore, in failing to instruct the jury that the confession could not be considered unless the Commonwealth had established that the victim was alive at the time of the sexual assault, for the confession was admissible and established that the victim was alive.</p>

Moreover, the appellant asserts that failure to mention in the jury charge that sympathy or mercy are relevant to the jury’s determination is itself a fatal error. Additionally, this error was compounded, according to appellant, by the prosecutor’s closing comments, which denigrated the appellant’s evidence which may have engendered sympathy and mercy. The prosecutor allegedly ridiculed the appellant’s pleas for mercy and argued: “Does the fact that lie [appellant] sat right over here, took this seat and said please save my life, don’t kill me, does that mitigate.... This case is not to be tried on sympathy.”</p>

    <p id="b252-5" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[230,743,1160,938]]]'>Criminal homicide constitutes first degree murder when it is committed by an intentional killing. 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(a). An intentional killing is a “willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing.” 18 Pa.C.S. § 2502(d). In <em>Commonwealth v. Harvey, </em>this court stated: “[I]f a deadly force is knowingly applied by the actor to the person of another, the intent to take life is as evident as if the actor stated the intent to kill at the time the force was applied.” <a href="/pa/514/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="514 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1804578" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0531-01">514 Pa. 531</a>, <a href="/pa/514/0531-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="514 Pa. 531" data-case-ids="1804578" data-case-paths="/pa/514/0531-01">526 A.2d 330</a>, 334 (1987). Here, the evidence established that appellant knowingly applied a deadly force to the victim. The Commonwealth’s forensic pathology expert testified that death was due to asphyxia resulting from a deliberate, forceful compression of the neck lasting four to five minutes, and that the pressure continued even after the victim lost consciousness. N.T. 372-90. This evidence, coupled with appellant’s confession, is sufficient to establish that the killing was intentional. The claim that the evidence is insufficient, therefore, is without merit.</p>
    <p id="b252-6" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[223,1721,1164,628]]]'>Next, appellant asserts that it was error not to grant a mistrial after the prosecutor asked a police witness whether, in his experience, suspects in homicide cases tend to minimize their involvement. Defense counsel’s objection was sustained, his motion for a mistrial was denied, and the jury was instructed to disregard the question. Appellant’s complaint is that the police witness was asked to express his opinion on the credibility of the appellant’s case, and whether the case is credible is a matter for the jury. Further, appellant alleges that since evidence of the guilt phase was introduced in the .sentencing hearing, his plea for mercy or sympathy was improperly attacked.</p>

Although testimony by appellant’s brothers and sisters was not allowed, appellant himself testified as to his image of his father as an alcoholic who attempted suicide. This appears to establish appellant’s state of mind, at least with respect to his idea of his father, but if it did not, appellant could have been asked simply how his state of mind was affected by his image of his father. The trial court was understandably reluctant to engage in protracted questioning about what other persons told the appellant, particularly when appellant himself was able to testify about his own state of mind. The admission of evidence is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and an appellate court may reverse only upon a showing that the trial court clearly abused its discretion. <em>Commonwealth v.

This information was beyond the knowledge of the average layman and, when combined with expert testimony on the reaction of the victim to manual strangulation, N.T. 370-90, the testimony was relevant to establish that the strangulation was intentional and not inadvertent, as claimed by the appellant. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing this expert testimony.</p>

    <p id="b255-5" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[208,588,1152,689]]]'>Finally, appellant asserts that the death penalty statute is unconstitutional in listing as aggravating factors “killing while in the perpetration of a felony,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(6), and “killing of a victim who is a child under the age of 12,” 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(d)(16). In particular, appellant claims that because the statute does not define whether the killing must be with specific intent or without, it is not narrowly drawn and is unconstitutionally vague. Additionally, the word “felony” is not defined to include only those felonies which pose such danger that society would be justified in imposing a sentence of death. Finally, appellant contends that the aggravating circumstance that the victim is a child under the age of twelve is not sufficiently narrow.</p>

Appellant’s first claim, therefore, is meritless. As to the assertion that the statute is defective because it does not define whether the killing must be with specific intent, that claim is also meritless, for the death penalty statute does not apply to any case in which the killing is without specific intent. In order for the jury to even consider the case under the death penalty statute, they must have already made a finding in the guilt phase that the killing was committed with specific intent. Since specific intent is a fact in the case by definition, the omission of a specific intent requirement in the sentencing statute is of no legal consequence.</p>
