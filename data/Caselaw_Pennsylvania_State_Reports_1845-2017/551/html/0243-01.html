Gary and Kelly Schroeder bought a truck containing these parts from Sheets in 1988. On May 5, 1991, Gary Schroeder was driving the truck southbound on a state road when he lost control. The truck crossed into the northbound lane of the roadway, struck an embankment, and turned over. At the time, the Department of Transportation (PennDOT) was doing construction work and had cut away the berm of the road. There were no eyewitnesses to the accident.</p>

The roof on the driver’s side was partially crushed. Schroeder was trapped inside. While the officer tried to help him, a fire ignited in the engine area and consumed the cab. According to the officer, Schroeder was alive until the fire broke out. Schroeder died at the scene.</p>

Mar-gala <em>&amp; </em>Sons Salvage arranged to buy the wrecked truck through an insurance adjuster. Margala &amp; Sons picked up the truck at the towing facility on June 14, 1991. On June 18, Kelly Schroeder’s attorney asked Margala not to destroy the truck’s cab until arrangements could be made to examine it. Margala agreed to store the truck for a fee. On July 26, Schroeder signed the truck’s title over to her insurer, Great American Insurance Company. On August 6, Great American transferred ownership to Margala. By February of 1992, Margala had sold some of the truck’s parts.</p>

She alleges that when Gary Schroeder tried to bring the truck back onto the roadway, it slid sideways across the road, struck the embankment, and flipped. Schroeder alleges that PennDOT’s negligence included, among other things, the creation of a dangerous road condition and the failure to warn of its existence. Schroeder further asserts claims of negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty against Navistar and Sheets for manufacturing and selling a truck that was not crashworthy.</p>

Alleging that Schroeder failed to preserve the truck for purposes of litigation, including the cab primarily at issue with respect to product liability, Appellees separately filed summary judgment motions in August of 1994.

      <em>Roselli </em>does not apply here. As discussed further below, Schroeder alleges a design defect common to all trucks like her husband’s truck—not the malfunction of one product. The burden of proof for these product liability claims is not the same.

      <em>DeWeese </em>is also a product malfunction case. More importantly, it did not produce a majority opinion. Judge Olszewski <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>authored an opinion discussing <em>Roselli </em>and finding summary judgment warranted because the plaintiff could not identify the product manufacturer. In a concurring opinion, Judge Ford Elliot agreed that summary judgment was warranted because of the plaintiffs inability to identify the manufacturer but disagreed with Judge Olszewski’s reliance upon <em>Roselli. </em>She believed that <em>Roselli </em>was wrongly decided. Judge McEwen concurred in the result. At most, <em>DeWeese </em>stands for the principle that summary judgment is warranted when a plaintiff cannot identify a product manufacturer.

In addition, Appellees may present evidence about the truck’s alleged modification after its sale. While Appellees may be unable to present some evidence related to causation without examining the truck in the accident, the burden of proof remains with Schroeder to prove that a product defect caused her harm. Thus, summary <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>judgment is not warranted for the product liability defendants on the basis of spoliation of evidence.</p>

As discussed above, summary judgment is not warranted due to Schroeder’s fault. In addition, applying the second <em>Schmid </em>factor, PennDOT suffers less prejudice from the loss of the product than the product liability defendants. While PennDOT also may be unable to establish other theories of causation of the accident, PennDOT can defend the claims brought against it since they have to do with the condition of the roadway and not the truck itself. Thus, under the third <em>Schmid </em>factor, a lessor sanction such as instructing the jury on the spoliation inference is proper. Since Schroeder’s claims against PennDOT have to do with the condition of the roadway, summary judgment for Penn-DOT based upon the spoliation of the truck is particularly inappropriate.</p>

In this case, when the operator is unavailable to testify and there are no eyewitnesses to the accident, Penn-DOT’s sole means of challenging appellant’s theory of causation is to have an expert reconstruct the accident.
