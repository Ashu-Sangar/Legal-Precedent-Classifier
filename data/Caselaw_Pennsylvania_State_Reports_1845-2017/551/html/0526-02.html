Racial and gender groups have been singled out for discrimination to such an extent in communities of this nation that eognizability for these groups is generally recognized by the courts. The eognizability test, though, remains as the first inquiry in a <em>Batson </em>challenge and the evolution of <em>Batson </em>leads to no other conclusion. Thus, where the prosecutor, in a case allegedly involving organized crime, has exercised peremptory challenges to disqualify prospective jurors of Italian descent, the person challenging such use must first establish that Italian-Americans are a “cognizable group” before proceeding with the remaining steps of the <em>Batson </em>analysis.</p>

For example, in the matter under consideration, would an Anglo-Saxon woman married to an Italian-American man be considered Italian-American for purposes of the jury selection process? To discriminate against a white woman because she married an African-American man would obviously violate equal protection doctrine; thus, it would seem reasonable for defense counsel to argue that a peremptory challenge was impermissibly exercised against a woman because she had married an Italian-American. What degree of consanguinity would trigger the required race-neutral proffer by the challenging party? Taken to its logical extension, trial counsel would be able to delve interminably into each prospective juror’s family background to discover a hint of ethnicity in an attempt to trigger a <em>Batson </em>challenge. These are some of the problems that the logic of traditional equal protection doctrine seems to compel courts to address in the wake of <em>Batson.</em>

Quite simply, no ethnic group in this country shares this same history of categorical, state-sanctioned exclusion from jury participation. In the aggregate, I believe that these are compelling indications that the United States Supreme Court would not — and should not — make ethnicity a prohibited basis of discrimination in the jury selection process. However, in light of the inherent tension of my proposed conclusion with traditional equal protection doctrine, which affords greater protection against ethnicity-based discrimination than against gender-based discrimination, I will not leap to this conclusion ahead of the United States Supreme Court.</p>

The prosecutor replied that he thought he saw “fear in [Giorgi’s] demeanor and his voice when organized crime was mentioned and that in conjunction with his Italian background led me to believe he would not be a juror suitable with this case.” The defense then moved to strike the panel, and the court denied the motion.</p>

The prosecutor interjected that refusing the strike would prejudice the Commonwealth because Ms. Bratolla had already overheard his attempt to strike her. Only in the face of this apparent prejudice did the trial court relent and permit the strike. Thus, what the prosecution could not get through the front door it forced through the back.</p>

The majority would leave the issue of a particular ethnic group's cognizability for <em>Batson </em>purposes to the trial courts' sound discretion. I cannot agree with this proposition.

There is little question that granting ethnic groups cognizable status under <em>Batson </em>will pose difficult problems for our courts to face. Over twelve years ago, when the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Batson, </em>Justice White correctly predicted that "much litigation [would] be required to spell out the contours of the Court's holding today.” <em>Batson, </em><a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="202" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">476 U.S. at 102</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="203" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">106 S.Ct. at 1726</a>, <a href="/us/476/0079-01" class="citation" data-index="204" data-cite="476 U.S. 79" data-case-ids="12787" data-case-paths="/us/476/0079-01">90 L.Ed.2d at 91</a> (White, J., concurring). The people of this Nation share a wealth of ancestries <a id="p552" href="#p552" data-label="552" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*552</a>unmatched anywhere in the world, making precise determinations as to any individual's particular ethnic background an extremely difficult task. In his Concurring Opinion, Justice Castille observes that a quagmire of trials within trials might arise if ethnic groups are given cognizable group status for <em>Batson </em>purposes. While I agree with his observation, I cannot agree with his personal conviction that ethnic groups should not be afforded the protections of the Equal Protection Clause in jury selection. Difficulty in application of the protection for ethnic groups is a formidable obstacle. This obstacle, however, cannot extinguish the right of qualified jurors and indeed all Americans to a justice system devoid of discrimination in violation of the Constitution. Perhaps our system of justice would be best served by elimination of peremptory challenges altogether, as Justice Zappalla suggests in his Concurring Opinion. However, until and unless such a result is reached, we must do justice unto the people on whose confidence our judicial system depends.</p>
