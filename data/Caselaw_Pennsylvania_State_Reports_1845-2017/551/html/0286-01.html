Prior to the commencement of the second sentencing hearing, appellant filed a motion requesting a jury instruction that a sentence of life imprisonment means incarceration for the remainder of the defendant’s natural life without the possibility of parole. The trial court granted appellant’s motion conditioned upon the Commonwealth’s raising the issue of appellant’s future dangerousness. In its opinion issued November 30, 1995, the trial court concluded that if it were to issue the instruction, the Commonwealth could request an instruction that the Governor of Pennsylvania may pardon a prisoner or commute a life sentence.</p>

He further asserts that it was error for the court to agree to include the additional instruction that the Governor of Pennsylvania could pardon or commute the life sentence of any prisoner. An examination of <em>Simmons </em>and its progeny reveals that appellant’s claims are devoid of merit.</p>

During closing arguments at the penalty phase, the prosecution argued that in fixing the defendant’s punishment, the jury should consider his future dangerousness. The defendant’s counsel asked the court to instruct the jury that, under South Carolina law, a sentence of life imprisonment did not carry any possibility of parole. The trial court refused to grant the requested instruction, and the defendant was sentenced to death.</p>

The Court reasoned that the jury reasonably may have believed that the defendant could be released on parole if he were not executed, thereby creating a false choice between sentencing the defendant to death and sentencing him to a limited period of incarceration. The Court held that where the defendant’s future dangerousness is at issue, and state law prohibits the defendant’s release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible. <a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">512 U.S. at 155</a>, <a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">114 S.Ct. at 2189</a>.</p>

There, the defendant argued that his trial counsel had been ineffective for failing to request a jury instruction that a life sentence means that he must spend his natural life in prison without the possibility of parole after the jury had asked the trial court for the definition of a life sentence. We held that under <em>Simmons, </em>a jury must be informed that life means life without the possibility of parole only when the prosecutor injects concerns of the defendant’s future dangerousness into the case.

Rather, the prosecutor specifically stated in chambers that he would not be arguing appellant’s future dangerousness to the jury and he made no mention of it in his closing argument.

First, as discussed <em>supra, </em>appellant was not entitled to a <em>Simmons </em>instruction, and the erroneous instruction was not given to the jury. Further, at the conference in chambers, appellant’s counsel’s limited the scope of his objection to the proposed instruction to the court’s giving notice about commutation. (N.T. 619, 625). Appellant’s coun<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>sel did not object on the basis that the court’s proposed instruction was untruthful. The Commonwealth and the court mentioned several times throughout the conference that the governor could commute a sentence at the recommendation of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, and appellant’s counsel did not object or seize the opportunity to correct their mistakes. See N.T. 612, 620. Additionally, the transcript of the conference reveals that it was the mere mention of the possibility of commutation, and not the court’s misstating which agency may recommend commutation, that gave rise to counsel’s decision not to seek a <em>Simmons </em>instruction.
