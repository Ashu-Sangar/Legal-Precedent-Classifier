Jurisdiction and standing issues are currently before the Court. The trial court held that it has no jurisdiction over this action and that the policyholders lack standing to pursue their claims. The Superior Court reversed on both issues. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>

Covenant policyholders considered the merger proposal at a special meeting in July of 1994. The voting policyholders approved the merger by votes of 13,873 to 1,630.</p>
    <p id="b673-4" data-blocks='[["BL_673.4",673,[217,453,1153,786]]]'>In September of 1994, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner, in response to Provident’s application, approved the merger. The Commissioner made findings of fact related to the merger plan, including that Provident intended to pay retention bonuses to officers and employees, would establish a marketing division to preserve Covenant’s heritage, and would create a new Board of Directors. The Commissioner determined, among other things, that the merger plan complies with the Business Corporation Law, that it was approved by the Boards of Directors and a majority of the policyholders, and that it is not injurious to the interests of policyholders or creditors. The Commissioner found none of the statutory grounds to disapprove the merger present. However, the Commissioner did find that certain retention bonuses constituted conflicts of interest.</p>

Count I of the Complaint is a derivative claim brought on Covenant’s behalf against its directors alleging a breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, and abuse of control in connection with effectuating the merger. The policyholders allege that they are seeking to enforce rights that Covenant failed to enforce. They further allege that they did not make a demand on Covenant’s directors to bring legal action because such a demand would have been futile.</p>

The court stated that objections to the merger’s fairness should have been brought in an appeal in Commonwealth Court. In addition, the trial court held that the policyholders lack standing to pursue derivative relief on Covenant’s behalf because after the merger, Covenant no longer exists. Furthermore, the trial court held that the policyholders failed to make a demand upon Covenant before filing suit and insufficiently allege that a demand would have been futile.</p>

It agreed with the policyholders that the claims in the Complaint sound in tort and thus were not within the Insurance Commis- • sioner’s jurisdiction but are properly before the trial court. The Superior Court further held that the policyholders did not lose standing to maintain a derivative action due to the merger. While the Superior Court agreed that the allegations about the futility of a demand are insufficient, it allowed the policyholders to amend their Complaint. This Court granted the Petition for Allowance of Appeal of Covenant, its directors, and Provident (Appellants).</p>

      <em>Cuker, </em>which established that a demand is excused only if irreparable harm to the corporation is shown, changed the law on demand requirements in derivative actions.

      <em>Cuker </em>does not specifically address the purpose of the new demand requirement.

The new, arguably more stringent demand requirement furthers this principle. However, plaintiffs in all pending derivative actions filed before <em>Cuker </em>relied upon their ability to file suit without making a demand if such a demand was futile. Excusing demand under <em>Cuker </em>only if irreparable harm to the corporation is shown will presumably lead to motions to dismiss in other cases where plaintiffs relied upon the former rule. Given the unjustness of this result, we hold that the demand requirement in <em>Cuker </em>does not apply to this case.
