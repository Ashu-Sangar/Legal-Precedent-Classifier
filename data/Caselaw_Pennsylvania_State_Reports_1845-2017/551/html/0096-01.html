During Dr. Hostetter’s July 1995 examination, however, Jermyn was oriented as to time and place and was able to recount where he had been in the past few months.

She also testified that Jermyn experiences auditory hallucinations, lives in a state of denial, and refuses treatment. Dr. Erwin further indicated in her testimony that Jermyn stated to her during her examination in the fall of 1993 that his mother was still alive, and that, although he understood that a warrant for his execution could be signed, he believed executions are illegal in this Commonwealth.</p>

She further indicated that the discharge summary states that Jermyn believes his mother is still alive, refuses to believe he has a death sentence, and refuses to take his antipsychotic medications.

Noting defense counsel’s objection for the record, the trial judge refused to order Dr. Erwin to undertake the examination. Defense counsel then indicated his desire for a continuance so he could have another psychiatrist examine Jermyn. The trial court refused this request.

Dr. Erwin had examined Jermyn in the fall of 1993 and did not conduct an examination of him in the summer of 1995. Dr. Hostetter and Dr. Kruszewski had examined Jermyn fairly close in time to the September 6, 1995 hearing, with Dr. Hostetter examining Jermyn on July 22, 1995, and Dr. Kruszewski examining him on August 6, 1995.

The trial judge indicated that he would have allowed a continuance, but was not going to do so in view of the September 8, 1995 time constraint. While this ruling might seem unduly restrictive of Jermyn’s defense, his counsel has now had an opportunity for over one year between the trial court’s ruling and his filing of Jermyn’s brief with this court in which to examine Jermyn’s Department of Corrections medical records. Jermyn has included in his brief to this court excerpts taken from Jermyn’s Department of Corrections medical records after the defense’s thorough review of these records. Jermyn points to portions of these records which indicate that he is a paranoid schizophrenic who suffers from delusions; that he refuses to take his medications and believes his physicians are trying to hurt him; that he believes his mother is still alive; and that he refuses to believe he has a death sentence. These excerpts pertain to evidence which the trial court already had before it by way of the expert testimony at the <em>Ford v. Wainwright </em>hearing. Jermyn thus points to no different information which would have justified a continuance. The trial court’s refusal to allow defense counsel a continuance in order to thoroughly review Jermyn’s medical records was, therefore, harmless error at best. <em>Story, <a href="/pa/476/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="476 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="1736904" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0391-01">supra.</a></em>

In his closing argument to the jury, Jermyn’s defense counsel vigorously reminded the jury of Dr. Phillips’ testimony concerning Jermyn’s mental illness. While defense counsel could have rounded out the picture of Jermyn’s traumatic youth and family life and its effect on his mental illness with more testimony, such as that of the Isralows or mental health professionals other than Dr. Phillips, counsel did make the jury aware of Jermyn’s traumatic life with his parents and his mental illness in relation to the insanity defense.

The Dissenting Opinion authored by Mr. Chief Justice Flaherty, relying on <em>Godinez </em>and <em>Starr, </em>recognizes the legal correctness of the argument advanced by Jermyn that, <em>if </em>he was determined by the trial judge to be incompetent to represent himself, then he also was not competent to stand trial. Critical to the success of Jermyn's argument, however, is whether the trial judge made a determination on Jermyn’s competency to represent himself. While the judge's statement on the record, to which Jermyn points and the dissent relies, was “he cannot competently defend himself”, (N.T. Jury Trial, p. 414), we cannot agree <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>with the dissent’s conclusion that this statement is a clear, unequivocal finding concerning Jermyn’s competency by the trial judge.</p>
      <p id="AHk" data-blocks='[["BL_223.2",223,[236,1710,1121,629]]]'>The trial judge made this statement in the context of ruling on Jermyn’s request to remove his counsel, which was made just prior to the close of Jermyn’s case. Although the trial judge made the statement upon which the dissent focuses, the trial judge indicated he was denying the motion because of the conflict which would be created by allowing Jermyn to assume self-representation under the circumstances of this case, where an insanity defense was a crucial part of the defense, and because he did not want to conduct an inquiry into Jermyn’s competency to represent himself at such a late point in the presentation of his defense under such circumstances. Thus, with all due respect to our colleague in the dissent, reviewing the trial judge's statement in the context of the trial proceedings as they are reflected in the record, we must conclude that the trial judge, by stating that he was finding Jermyn incompetent to defend himself, actually was denying Jermyn’s motion to remove his counsel for a number of intertwined reasons and was not rendering a decision as to Jermyn’s mental competency.</p>

Although it was not certain that the trial court would have accepted the equivalence of competency for self-representation and for standing trial because <em>Godinez </em>and <em>Starr </em>had not then been decided, a motion for mistrial stood a reasonable probability of success. Certainly, if the issue of the equivalence of competency for self-representation and competency to stand trial had been raised prior to the decisions in <em>Godinez </em>and <em>Starr, </em>a trial court or an appellate court would very likely have found the standards to be identical. It is clear that the holdings in <em>Godinez </em>and <em>Starr </em>were not surprising or unanticipated changes in the law. In any event, a motion for mistrial would not have been a futile act; counsel’s failure to seek a mistrial appears to be an unjustifiable, erroneous oversight in trial tactics. There is no possible justification for the omission which would have been in Jermyn’s best interests. Thus the resulting prejudice is glaringly obvious. Jermyn was entitled to a termination of the trial due to his incompetence to stand trial, but instead, the trial proceeded to a sentence of death.
