For the reasons that follow, we hold that he may not be criminally liable.</p>
    <p id="b515-11" data-blocks='[["BL_515.11",515,[218,1431,1156,634]]]'>On December 12, 1993 Fowlin was present in a nightclub in Easton, Pennsylvania. He was armed with a handgun. Three men, two of whom were also armed with handguns, accosted Fowlin in the club, and one of the three sprayed pepper gas in his eyes. At approximately the same time, a second man drew a handgun. Fearing that he was about to be killed, Fowlin drew his own handgun and fired repeatedly in the direction of the attackers.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Although he was nearly blinded by the pepper spray, he killed the assailant who had drawn the gun and wounded one of the others. He also wounded a bystander. At the time of the shooting, approximately 200 people were present in the nightclub.</p>

Fowlin <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>was charged with various crimes associated with the incident, but the district attorney subsequently withdrew all charges with respect to his attackers on the grounds of justifiable self-defense. However, the district attorney did not dismiss charges of recklessly endangering another, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2705, and aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. § 2702(a)(1) and (4) with respect to the bystander.</p>
    <p id="b516-5" data-blocks='[["BL_516.4",516,[222,693,1159,367]]]'>Because the charges with respect to the bystander were not withdrawn, Fowlin filed a habeas corpus petition, which required the trial court to determine whether there was a prima facie case against him which would justify going to trial. The issue was whether a person who lawfully employs self defense could be criminally liable for unintentionally inflicting injury upon a bystander while employing self-defense.</p>
    <p id="b516-6" data-blocks='[["BL_516.5",516,[222,1090,1163,743]]]'>The trial court determined that there was no Pennsylvania case on point and that in cases from other jurisdictions the majority rule is that when one acts in justifiable self-defense, the inadvertent death or injury of a bystander does not result in criminal liability with respect to the actor. The court rejected this line of cases, holding that some limits on the employment of self-defense were required as a matter of public policy. Accordingly, the trial court held that in order to avoid criminal liability, the person defending himself must not only be properly engaged in defending himself, but he must not act recklessly. The trial court then proceeded to determine that it was likely that on the facts of this case, a jury could find that Fowlin had acted recklessly, and therefore, denied the application for habeas corpus.</p>
    <p id="b516-7" data-blocks='[["BL_516.6",516,[222,1864,1160,473]]]'>The trial court then certified the question to the Superior Court pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b), because its order concerned a controlling question of law on which there was substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate appeal from the order could materially advance the ultimate termination of the case. The Superior Court granted Fowliris petition for permission to appeal an interlocutory order, and an evenly divided Superior Court affirmed the trial court’s denial of the habeas corpus petition.</p>

Section 3.09 of the Model Penal Code provides that a person who acts in justifiable self-defense but recklessly or negligently injures an innocent person may be found criminally liable, and 18 Pa.C.S. § 505(a) and § 505(b)(3) implicitly impose limits on the use of force for self-defense which are similar to the limits of the Model Penal Code, viz., that the actor conduct himself in a prudent and reasonable manner when using force in self-defense.</p>

He further points out that although one may be criminally liable for recklessness or even negligence in certain circumstances, see 18 Pa.C.S. § 503(b), this court has held that one may not be liable for crimes involving recklessness if the alleged recklessness occurs in the course of justifiable self-defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a>

In short, the law of Pennsylvania does not require one to stand by helplessly while he is injured or killed by an assailant. And as Judge Cirillo aptly points out, when one is the victim of an attack, the assailant, not the victim, picks the time, the place, the manner, and the circumstances of the attack. Leisurely assessment of the circumstances and the danger to others is almost never a feature of such an assault, and most often, the best the victim can do is to mount a defense which hopefully will preserve his life. In many cases, the victim has only seconds to act in order to avoid injury or death. In this case, Fowlin was accosted by three <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>men who assaulted him with pepper spray and simultaneously drew a handgun.

First, we note that there is no other reported Pennsylvania case with similar facts. Second, the right of self-defense is not absolute, and it may not be used to absolve a person who acted without justification in a claimed self-defense shooting. As indicated above, if the victim acts outside of the parameters established by the law, then his act is not justified and he may be prosecuted for injury to bystanders or others which he may inflict.

However, neither <em>Hilbert </em>nor <em>Heatherington </em>involved a situation where the defendant who exercised his right to self-defense also injured a bystander. The issue in <em>Hilbert </em>was whether the lower court erred in charging the jury that the appellant was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she was acting in self-defense when she stabbed the victim. This Court held that because self-defense negated a specific element of the crime of murder, which the Commonwealth was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, the lower court impermissibly required the appellant to carry the burden of proof concerning the defense. In so holding, this Court stated: “A claim of self-defense, if believed, would negate any element of ill-will, <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty or recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty necessary to constitute malice.” <em>Hilbert, </em><a href="/pa/476/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="476 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1736844" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0288-01">476 Pa. at 300</a>, <a href="/pa/476/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="476 Pa. 288" data-case-ids="1736844" data-case-paths="/pa/476/0288-01">382 A.2d at 730</a>. Similarly, in <em>Heatherington, </em>this Court held that the trial court’s instruction was erroneous where it suggested to the jury that even if the Commonwealth proved all material elements of murder, including malice, a claim of self-defense, if believed by the jury, would result in acquittal because malice and self-defense are mutually exclusive. <a href="/pa/477/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="477 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1738301" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0562-01">477 Pa. at 569</a>, <a href="/pa/477/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="477 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1738301" data-case-paths="/pa/477/0562-01">385 A.2d at 342</a>.</p>

The majority incorrectly reasons that based upon <em>Hilbert </em>and <em>Heatherington, </em>any recklessness displayed by appellant towards the bystander was negated because he acted in self-defense with respect to his attackers. This reasoning would apply only if appellant were to be found liable under the doctrine of transferred intent. However, here the Commonwealth does not seek to transfer appellant’s intent with respect to his attackers, but rather seeks to impose criminal liability because of appellant’s intent with respect to a third party.

Thus, the concept found in the Model Penal Code that justification does not provide a defense to recklessness is embodied in the law of justification codified in the Pennsylvania Crimes Code. Additionally, the law of justification in this Commonwealth, while modeled after the Model Penal Code, was essentially a codification of the common law rules of self-defense. <em>Commonwealth v.

This is a dangerous precedent. As the Superior Court aptly pointed out, such blanket authority for the use of self-defense defies logic, especially in contemporary society where possession of lethal weapons and confrontations involving them have become all too commonplace. Under the majority’s reasoning, one would be justified and could not be found criminally liable for detonating a hand-grenade in a crowded shopping mall in order to defend himself against an attacker. Such a result is contrary to Pennsylvania’s statutory scheme of justification, which sets limits for the use of self-defense. The majority decision here recognizes no such limits.</p>
