She became irritated by Hawk and moved away. Hawk did not attempt any further conversation with her in the bar. At approximately 12:15 a.m., the victim left the bar with a glass of soda in her hand and began walking to her home two blocks away. While she was opening her front door, she heard someone behind her say, “ho.” She shut the door and turned around. She saw Hawk at the foot of the steps. He grabbed her around the waist before she could reopen the door. Hawk sat her on the step and put his arm around her and would not let her go.</p>

She responded that her boyfriend was upstairs, and that Hawk should leave. When he said he wanted to buy a can of soda from a gas station next door, the victim stated she was going upstairs. According to the victim, Hawk insisted that she come with him because he had a “silencer.” She understood a “silencer” to mean a gun.</p>

According to the victim, he penetrated her vagina twice with his penis. She tried to resist but was unable to call for help because he put his hand over her mouth. Afterwards, they left in different directions at the same time. The victim went immediately to the police station and reported that she had been raped. A police detective corroborated that the victim came into the station at 12:41 a.m.</p>

According to Hawk, he and a friend, Steven Easton, left the bar at 10:45 p.m. They went to Hawk’s sister’s house, arriving at approximately 11:05 p.m., and stayed until approximately 1:45 a.m. Hawk and Easton drank and socialized with his sister and another acquaintance, Jack Boone. Boone then drove Hawk to his home at approximately 2:00 a.m. Easton and Hawk’s sister corroborated his alibi testimony.</p>

Given these various possibilities explaining negative test results, Justice Cappy dissents finding the expert’s testimony too speculative to aid the jury in determining whether penetration occurred. However, I find the expert’s testimony regarding the negative rape kit test results relevant. At the very least, the testimony supports a reasonable inference or presumption regarding the existence of a material fact — whether or not penetration occurred.

These questions can narrow the possibilities advanced by the expert in explaining the negative test results.
