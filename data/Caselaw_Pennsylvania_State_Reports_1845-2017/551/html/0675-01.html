    <p id="b777-4" data-blocks='[["BL_777.4",777,[214,385,1153,144]]]'>In this Court’s Opinion affirming Duffey’s judgment of sentence on direct appeal, Mr. Justice McDermott summarized the facts of this case as follows:</p>
    <blockquote id="b777-5" data-blocks='[["BL_777.5",777,[257,559,1108,362]]]'>In the afternoon of February 17, 1984, the body of Kathy Kurmchak was found in the ladies restroom of Genetti’s Manor, a restaurant located in Dickson City, Pennsylvania. The victim, then age 19, was a waitress at the restaurant. She was found slumped in the corner of the bathroom stall in a pool of blood; she had sustained approximately thirty stab wounds.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b777-6" data-blocks='[["BL_777.6",777,[257,950,1111,419]]]'>A subsequent police investigation revealed that a yellow Chrysler LeBaron was seen parked behind the restaurant that day. Routine questioning of all employees revealed that appellant, Steven Duffey, then an employee of Genetti’s Manor, had stopped by the establishment that day to drop off a W-4 tax form. It was determined that appellant drove a yellow Chrysler LeBaron and the car behind the restaurant was identified as belonging to him.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b777-7" data-blocks='[["BL_777.7",777,[256,1392,1113,583]]]'>Appellant was then asked to come to the state police barracks for further questioning. He was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and he gave a statement corroborating an earlier statement that he had dropped off a W-4 form and returned home to watch television. He was informed of inconsistencies in his statement, such as the fact that his car was seen behind Genetti’s Manor at the time that he claimed he was watching television. He was also informed that a search warrant was obtained for his car and that the police were looking for blood, clothing fibers, etc. Appellant then decided to make a more complete statement.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b777-8" data-blocks='[["BL_777.8",777,[258,1997,1109,357]]]'>Appellant was again read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He then recounted in great detail how he parked behind Genetti’s Manor and proceeded into the restaurant. He found Kathy Kurmchak alone in the office. Appellant quietly entered the kitchen where he found a large butcher knife. Appellant slipped the knife into his pants and made his way back into the office.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b778-3" data-blocks='[["BL_778.3",778,[273,317,1116,408]]]'>
      <a id="p678" href="#p678" data-label="678" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*678</a>He approached Kathy Kurmchak and demanded money. He obtained several dollars from the coat check tip jar and Ms. Kurmchak produced several more dollars from her wallet. Appellant then said to the victim “come with me for a walk” and both proceeded to the ladies bathroom. Appellant told Ms. Kurmchak to walk over to one of the stalls, to open the stall door and to take off her pants. He then told Ms. Kurmchak that he wanted to have sex with her.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b778-4" data-blocks='[["BL_778.4",778,[270,750,1119,575]]]'>Kathy Kurmchak responded “no way” to appellant’s suggestion. She then inquired, “what are you going to do, stab me?” Appellant took her watch from her wrist and stabbed Ms. Kurmchak. The victim grabbed the knife with her hands and said “don’t, don’t.” Appellant stabbed her two or three more times and she started to slide down the wall of the bathroom stall. Appellant stabbed the victim five or six more times and the victim began to gasp. Appellant then stabbed her in the throat. Appellant exited the building. He buried the knife in the swamp behind the restaurant, got in his car, and drove home.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b778-5" data-blocks='[["BL_778.5",778,[268,1343,1117,416]]]'>Appellant next gave a question and answer-type statement to the police. He recounted how he went to Genetti’s Manor that morning to drop off his W-4 form. There were two women present at the time. He returned later to find that one woman had gone. He drove to the rear of the building and parked his car. He then went back into the restaurant to rob it because he thought the victim had the key to the safe.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b778-6" data-blocks='[["BL_778.6",778,[266,1776,1120,363]]]'>Appellant went to the kitchen and found a knife. He walked to the office and stood by the door for about twenty minutes. The urge then came over him to “get it done.” He proceeded into the office and demanded money from the victim. She gave him three one dollar bills and a handful of quarters from the tip jar, as well as four or five dollars from her purse.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b778-7" data-blocks='[["BL_778.7",778,[265,2156,1117,204]],["BL_779.1",779,[263,279,1113,251]]]'>Appellant again recounted how he marched the victim to the ladies bathroom. He told her to turn around. She refused and asked “what are you going to do, stab me?” He responded “yes, if I have to.” He further stated, “give me <a id="p679" href="#p679" data-label="679" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*679</a>your watch.” He stuck the watch in his pocket and took the knife by the handle. He then demonstrated for the officer who was taking the statement, how he held the knife, how the victim tried to grab it, and how he stuck it into her stomach.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b779-5" data-blocks='[["BL_779.4",779,[266,558,1108,475]]]'>Appellant recounted how the first stab wound was beneath the victim’s breast. She looked at him and said “don’t, don’t.” He stabbed her two or three more times and she began to “creep” down the wall. She slid down and hit the flush on the toilet, and blood began to run out of her into the toilet. Appellant further stated: “I then stabbed her around the throat because she was gasping and trying to say something. After I stabbed her near the throat she slid down the rest of the way to the floor.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b779-6" data-blocks='[["BL_779.5",779,[267,1054,1109,304]]]'>Appellant then stated “I stood there and felt her face and shirt to see if she was breathing. She was still breathing. I walked out [of] the stall by backing up. I looked back at her and her mouth was open like she was gasping for air. There was blood all over the place.” The rest of appellant’s statement detailed his actions after he left the crime scene.</blockquote>

Indeed, the PCRA Petition stated that Duffey was unrepresented and without resources to obtain a lawyer. It further stated that Duffey had asked the PCCRC to assist him in obtaining qualified counsel and requested the court to appoint <a id="p685" href="#p685" data-label="685" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*685</a>counsel if the PCCRC could not obtain qualified counsel to represent him.</p>
    <p id="b785-4" data-blocks='[["BL_785.4",785,[257,376,1154,641]]]'>Our review of the record reveals that PCCRC was attempting to help Duffey in obtaining counsel, and in the meantime assisted him in preparing <em>pro se </em>pleadings for post-conviction relief and to obtain a stay of his execution. The record demonstrates that no attorney entered an appearance on behalf of Duffey, and that Duffey apparently signed the PCRA petition himself. It is true that Attorney Wycoff sent a letter to the trial court on Duffey’s behalf, but writing a letter for an unrepresented inmate falls far short of entering an appearance in the record pursuant to Rule 302. Accordingly, we have no difficulty concluding that Duffey’s first PCRA petition was filed <em>pro se.</em>

To the contrary, an attorney’s signature is a legal certification that gives good cause to support the pleading, and an attorney cannot avoid that certification through the addition of creative language describing the attorney as a mere “preparer” on behalf of a <em>pro se </em>defendant. Thus, when an attorney signs and files a pleading for an unrepresented defendant, that attorney will be deemed to represent that defendant. We do not condone counsel’s attempts to file a notice of appeal without entering an appearance in this case. The attorneys from PCCRC who signed those notices of appeal became Duffey’s attorneys of record for the appeal when they filed them on November 30, 1994.</p>
