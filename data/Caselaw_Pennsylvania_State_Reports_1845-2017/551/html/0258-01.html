Mr. Sunn Life was standing at the cash register when appellant held the shotgun to the back of his head and asked Mr. Sunn Life “What you got to say now m_?” Appellant pulled the trigger and Mr. Sunn Life was declared dead at the scene, the result of a massive shotgun blast to the side of his head.</p>

Viewing the jury question, what is life imprisonment?, and the trial court’s response thereto, against the backdrop of this argument made by appellant’s counsel, we would be hard pressed to find error.

Third, the statement by the trial court did not imply that the jury verdict would not be final as it was subject to appeal, rather, the statement explained that the legislature has the power to modify the law governing parole of persons sentenced to life imprisonment. The trial court’s statement is thus a reflection of a given fact of a democratic society: the law is always subject to change by the will of the people. Clearly the fears of an unreliable verdict, arrived at by a jury free to indulge any bias that may persuade them to impose a death sentence where they feel no responsibility for its ultimate imposition, which compelled the decision in <em>Caldwell, </em>are not present in the instant case.

That statement could not possibly be interpreted by the jury to minimize their role in fixing the punishment for appellant at life imprisonment or death.

The failure of a defendant to display remorse for the suffering of the victim’s family and friends is as equally relevant to the character of the defendant as is the defendant’s family history and socio-economic background.

The record of voir dire does not create such an inference. Since the trial court denied the <em>Batson </em>objection when raised, the record is absent any explanation for the use of the peremptory challenges.

    <p id="b384-6" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[244,515,1160,901]]]'>In terms of Appellant’s argument concerning the trial court’s instruction responding to the jury’s inquiry as to the meaning of “life imprisonment,” I agree with Justice Cappy’s disposition of the issue since it is consistent with precedent. As Justice Cappy’s opinion states, Simmons holds that a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction defining “life imprisonment” only when the issue of a defendant’s future dangerousness has been raised during the penalty phase of the trial. <em>Simmons v. South Carolina, </em><a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="93" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">512 U.S. 154</a>, <a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="94" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">114 S.Ct. 2187</a>, <a href="/us/512/0154-01" class="citation" data-index="95" data-cite="512 U.S. 154" data-case-ids="39205" data-case-paths="/us/512/0154-01">129 L.Ed.2d 133</a> (1994); <em>Commonwealth v. Christy, </em><a href="/pa/540/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="96" data-cite="540 Pa. 192" data-case-ids="472219" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0192-01">540 Pa. 192</a>, <a href="/pa/540/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="656 A.2d 877" data-case-ids="472219,7880936" data-case-paths="/pa/540/0192-01,/a2d/656/0877-01">656 A.2d 877</a> (1995) (acknowledging applicability of <em>Simmons </em>to cases in Pennsylvania decided subsequent to Simmons). However, I would suggest that the better practice and policy is to require trial courts to give a <em>Simmons </em>instruction in all death penalty proceedings, regardless of whether counsel raises the issue of a defendant’s potential future dangerousness during the penalty phase.</p>
    <p id="b384-7" data-blocks='[["BL_384.7",384,[245,1438,1159,637]],["BL_385.1",385,[236,270,1151,422]]]'>Under this practice, a jury considering the death penalty would automatically be informed, before deliberations began, of what life imprisonment actually means in Pennsylvania at the time of the instruction. In my opinion, a standard <em>Simmons </em>instruction would, in the first instance, serve to clarify that issue for the jury.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_1" id="ref_footnote_3_1">1</a> For example, since commutation is, at this time, a possibility in Pennsylvania for those serving life sentences, and therefore proper for the jury’s consideration, trial judges giving a <em>Simmons </em>instruction could be equipped with statistical information relating to the percentage of life sentences which had been commuted within the last several years.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_3_2" id="ref_footnote_3_2">2</a> Not only would the jury be aided by knowing those <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>percentages during their penalty deliberations, but the defendant should be entitled to have the jury aware of what statistical possibility exists that a life sentence imposed on him would result in commutation. Moreover, I can see no prejudice that the Commonwealth would suffer if every defendant facing a sentence of death received a <em>Simmons </em>jury instruction explaining, as thoroughly as possible, what “life imprisonment” means in Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b385-5" data-blocks='[["BL_385.5",385,[233,735,1152,741]]]'>Secondly, I also agree with Justice Cappy that Appellant’s <em>Batson </em>claim must fail. Here, Appellant asserts that the prosecutor improperly used his preemptory challenges in a discriminatory manner to strike black and women jurors during voir dire. Significantly, however, the final composition of Appellant’s jury included five black women, three black men, two white women and two white men. In his majority opinion, Justice Cappy states that the empaneling of a jury which is balanced by race and gender is entitled to <em>some </em>weight in reviewing a <em>Batson </em>claim. I would suggest, instead, that a racially and gender balanced jury, while not negating a <em>Batson </em>claim in and of itself, should be afforded <em>substantial, </em>rather than only <em>some, </em>weight when a court is presented with a <em>Batson </em>claim.</p>
    <p id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[229,1528,1156,639]],["BL_386.1",386,[227,272,1154,99]]]'>Here, the ultimate composition of the jury in Appellant’s case consisted of eight black persons (and four white persons) and seven women (and five men). Given this break-down, it could only logically be argued that any racial and gender disparity in Appellant’s jury actually resulted from there being more women than men, and more blacks than whites. Yet, Appellant claims that the prosecutor engaged in a pattern of purposeful discrimination against women and blacks during jury selection. To me, simple common sense dictates that we give the empaneling of a racially and gender balanced jury, and certainly one consisting of a majority of members of the racial or gender group alleged to have been purposefully <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>excluded, substantial weight when determining whether an appellant’s <em>Batson </em>claim has merit.</p>
