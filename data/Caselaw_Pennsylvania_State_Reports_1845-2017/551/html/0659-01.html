    <p id="b760-15" data-blocks='[["BL_760.14",760,[206,1954,1157,364]]]'>The issue before this Court is whether appellant should be granted a new trial where the trial court refused to order the Commonwealth to disclose to appellant the identity of a confidential informant involved in one of appellant’s drug transactions. We affirm the order of the Superior Court and hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to order the Commonwealth to identify the informant.</p>
    <p id="b761-4" data-blocks='[["BL_761.3",761,[240,307,1156,770]]]'>
      <a id="p661" href="#p661" data-label="661" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*661</a>The relevant facts are as follows: In conjunction with the Franklin County Drug Task Force, the Pennsylvania State Police conducted undercover investigations into the sale of controlled substances in Franklin County. The police employed confidential informants to identify areas in the county where there was drug activity. As a result of these investigations, appellant was arrested and charged with six counts of delivery of a controlled substance for selling cocaine to three undercover state troopers on six separate occasions. The trial court granted appellant’s subsequent motion to sever. In accordance with appellant’s request, all charges were to be tried separately except for charges pertaining to two transactions which occurred on the same day. The issue in this matter arises from appellant’s non-jury trial on the two counts of drug delivery which occurred on September 23, 1993.</p>
    <p id="b761-5" data-blocks='[["BL_761.4",761,[242,1101,1152,971]]]'>In the first transaction, Pennsylvania State Police Officer Paulette Crosby was working in an undercover capacity at 8:15 p.m. at the intersection of Black Avenue and Liberty Street in Chambersburg Borough. Trooper Crosby was driving an unmarked vehicle with a confidential informant in the passenger seat. After spotting appellant on a bicycle talking to another man and a woman, the trooper drove toward the group and stopped her vehicle. Appellant walked over to the passenger side of the vehicle and asked the informant if Trooper Crosby was “his girl.” Trooper Crosby asked appellant if he had “a sixty,” meaning sixty dollars worth of crack cocaine. Appellant left briefly, returned to the vehicle several minutes later, and passed three pieces of crack cocaine to the informant in exchange for sixty dollars. The informant handed the cocaine to Trooper Crosby. At trial, Trooper Crosby positively identified appellant as the person who had sold her the drugs. Trooper Crosby also identified appellant as the individual from whom she had purchased drugs on two prior occasions.</p>

Shortly before 10:00 p.m., Pennsylvania State Police Officer Crystal Rodgers, working undercover in an automobile with a different confidential informant in the back seat, approached appellant in a parking <a id="p662" href="#p662" data-label="662" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*662</a>lot of a Chambersburg market. Appellant was again on his bicycle, speaking to an unknown individual. Appellant asked Trooper Rodgers what she wanted, and she asked for “a hundred,” meaning one hundred dollars worth of crack cocaine. After entering the front passenger seat of the vehicle, appellant took out a piece of crack cocaine and placed it on his thigh. Trooper Rodgers took the cocaine and handed appellant ten $10.00 bills. At trial, Trooper Rodgers positively identified appellant as the person who had sold her cocaine. In addition, Trooper Rodgers testified that she knew appellant from an earlier incident on September 9,1993, when appellant had also sold her drugs.</p>
    <p id="b762-5" data-blocks='[["BL_762.4",762,[218,957,1159,734]]]'>Immediately following each sale, the troopers dispatched a description of appellant over police radio to Corporal Richard Swartz of the Chambersburg Borough Police, who was assisting the Franklin County Drug Task Force as part of his normal police duties. The troopers described appellant as a black male, with an Afro-type haircut and beard, wearing a black leather cap and tan pants. Additionally, Trooper Crosby, who knew appellant as “Butch” from her prior drug dealings with him, dispatched to Corporal Swartz that appellant went by that name. In each instance, Corporal Swartz proceeded to the area of the drug transaction and located appellant on his bicycle. At trial, Corporal Swartz unequivocally identified appellant as the person matching the suspect’s description in the area of the crime on the night in question.</p>

For example, the appellant in <em>Carter </em>was convicted of selling narcotics to an informant in the presence of an under<a id="p665" href="#p665" data-label="665" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*665</a>cover officer. At trial, the only Commonwealth witnesses were the purchasing officer and an agent for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics who was sitting in a car parked half a block away at the time of the sale. Not only were the identifications of the appellant by both witnesses based on a single viewing, but the defense consisted solely of appellant’s claim of mistaken identity.

The appellant raised a mistaken identity defense, testifying that he had not met the trooper prior to his arrest and that he had not been in the apartment complex where the incident occurred.

Further, Trooper Rogers specifically remembered appellant as the same person who had sold her drugs on September 9,1993, and Trooper Crosby recognized appellant from her prior transactions with him. Furthermore, appellant was in the passenger seat of Trooper Rodgers automobile during the transaction. The trooper observed appellant for a significant amount of time and at a close distance. These numerous viewings substantially undermine the need for disclosure of the identity of the confidential informant on the ground of misidentification.

At the suppression hearing, the state trooper refused to reveal the information, because members of a violent motorcycle gang had threatened reprisals against a witness in the appellee’s case. On the basis of this evidence, this Court affirmed the position that it took in <em>Miller; </em>under such circumstances, in order to protect the identity and the safety of the informant, no disclosure was required. <em>Id. </em>at 11, <a href="/pa/518/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="539 A.2d 1291" data-case-ids="1811590,1811684" data-case-paths="/pa/518/0001-01,/pa/518/0002-01">539 A.2d at 1295</a>.</p>
    <p id="b768-5" data-blocks='[["BL_768.5",768,[232,1436,1156,366]]]'>Here, balancing the considerations as we must under <em>Carter, </em>we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in withholding the identity of the confidential informant. There was minimal risk of misidentification on the part of the police, and there was a concurrent risk that the informant would be placed in danger of physical harm if his identity were to be revealed or confirmed. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>

Further, at the hearing on the motion, appellant’s counsel specifically informed the court that he sought only the identity of the confidential informant involved in the case with Trooper Rodgers on September 23, 1993.

According to the dissenting opinion of the Superior Court, the identifications of appellant arising from drug transactions which occurred prior to September 23, 1993 should not be considered in determining whether the trial court properly denied appellant's motion for disclosure, because the charges arising from those transactions were severed from this case. Despite the severance, however, the fact that the troopers were acquainted with appellant prior to September 23, 1993 remains relevant to the reliability of their identifications of him and thus relevant to the disclosure issue.</p>

We will not consider reversing the trial court on the basis of an issue that was not preserved by the appropriate and timely objection. <em>See Commonwealth v.
