Phillips’ boyfriend, Brown, had also been residing with them since early July of 1993. At approximately 10:00 p.m. on August 3, 1993, Phillips went to a friend’s house and left Rafael asleep at home with Brown. Rahim was staying -with a relative. Phillips stayed out all night and did not return until about 5:00 a.m. the next morning.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> When she returned, she fell asleep on the floor.</p>

At nearly 6:00 p.m. on August 6,1993, while searching the nearby abandoned Rosen Housing Projects at 23rd and Diamond Streets, the police found Rafael’s body in an elevator shaft sixteen to twenty feet under a heavy metal grate. Dr. Bennett Preston, an Assistant Medical Examiner for the City of Philadelphia, examined Rafael’s body at the scene and later conducted an autopsy. He noted bruises on his forehead, the back of his head, the left upper abdomen, the right outer abdomen, the left lower abdomen, the side of the liver, abrasions on the left upper back and back of the right thigh, a lacerated spleen, and evidence of bleeding in the abdominal cavity. The skin on Rafael’s rectum was completely torn away from his anus, showing that someone forcibly placed a hard, blunt object into his anus. Rafael also had suffered massive injuries to his colon.</p>

He opined that the child was alive during the infliction of these wounds and finally lost consciousness because of blood loss.

A pillow with blood stains found in Phillips’ apart<a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>ment suggested to the doctor that the boy’s face was shoved into the pillow to stifle his screams.</p>

From various interviews, they discovered from a neighbor that he had been seen knocking on the door of his mother’s residence. The neighbor had a brief conversation with Brown, during which he cried and told her that he loved his mother and that he would be going to jail. Brown also called his sister and told her that he hurt Rafael but did not want to go to jail. That same morning, he visited his employer and told him that he got himself in trouble and would miss a few days of work. He also asked for his paycheck for the week. His employer denied this request.</p>

At the time of his arrest, he gave the police two aliases and a false address and social security number. After Brown and other inmates in the Atlantic County prison saw a news story about Raphael’s murder that showed a picture of Brown’s face, he asked prison officials to separate him from other inmates because he was afraid they would harm him. Brown asked the prison to contact Philadelphia authorities, and he eventually waived extradition and was returned to Philadelphia.</p>

He claimed that he unsuccessfully attempted to awaken Rafael in the apartment at 6:00 a.m., attempted C.P.R., and when he could not revive him, carried Rafael outside. The defendant also stated that he left him under the grate because he could not find help and was frightened.</p>

However, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Dr. Preston’s testimony that someone penetrated Rafael’s anus with a penis or an object similar to a broom handle established at best a 50 percent likelihood that Brown raped Rafael with his penis. This evidence is not sufficient, as a matter of law, to establish Brown’s guilt of rape beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Commonwealth v.
