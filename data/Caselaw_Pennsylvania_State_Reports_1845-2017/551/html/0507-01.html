During this ride, appellant stopped the van and proceeded to rape the victim on the floor of the van amidst his plumbing supplies. After he ended his assault, he inserted a brush dipped in plumber’s glue into her vagina and told her that if he could not have her, no one would.</p>

Appellant was sentenced to probation, which included the condition that he stay away from the victim. Notwithstanding the court’s order that appellant stay away from the victim, approximately six weeks later appellant moved back into the victim’s home with the victim. Appellant and the victim proceeded to have a child in 1984.</p>

Accordingly, the evidence presented here of appellant’s prior forcible sexual assaults against the victim was relevant to establish the element of threat of forcible compulsion, and not merely to establish appellant’s bad character. However, recognizing that evidence of prior criminal acts has the potential for misunderstanding on the part of the jury, we conclude that such evidence must be accompanied by a cautionary instruction which fully and carefully explains to the jury the limited purpose for which that evidence has been admitted. In this case, such an instruction was given. The trial court below correctly informed the jury that appellant was not on trial for the two prior incidents and that the victim’s testimony, if accepted by the jury, was admitted for the sole purpose of showing that the act in question was performed against the victim’s will and without her consent. The jury was further instructed that they would have to consider whether these prior incidents, in combination with the other evidence presented, would have prevented a reasonably resolute female from resisting if she was in the same situation as the victim. This limiting instruction properly explained the purpose for which the evidence was to be used by the jury, and it is presumed that the jury followed the instruction absent evidence to the contrary. <em>Commonwealth v.

      <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>Notwithstanding this conclusion, I agree that evidence of Appellant’s prior sexual assaults of the victim was admissible. Generally, evidence of prior criminal activity is excluded because it is irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Here, the evidence is relevant to an element of the crime, that the sexual intercourse occurred through threat of forcible compulsion. The evidence was not being offered to establish a predisposition on the part of Appellant to commit a criminal act or as evidence that Appellant did in fact commit a prior criminal act. Under these circumstances, I am constrained to agree that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting such testimony.</p>
