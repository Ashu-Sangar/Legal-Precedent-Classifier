On cross examination, Gold was questioned by Appellant’s counsel regarding how the property could be accessed if it were developed for use as an office building. Gold testified that the easement across Martin’s<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> property could be utilized to access the property. Further cross-examination revealed <a id="p694" href="#p694" data-label="694" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*694</a>that Gold based this opinion on his assumption that Martin’s property had direct access to Aten Road. Therefore, he presumed that traffic accessing Appellant’s property could travel from Aten Road, a public roadway, across the easement over Martin’s property and onto Appellant’s land.

Appellant’s counsel, therefore, asserted that Gold’s opinion that the parcel was suitable for development as an office building was in error since there was no access to the property that could service ingress and egress.</p>

He stated that since 1952, when Appellant’s predecessor in interest acquired the subject property, employees would access the property, on average, two or three times per month, either by foot or by vehicle, in order to service the billboards. He noted that in order to access the property, persons servicing the signs would travel Aten Road, enter Park Ridge’s property, then travel across Martin’s land. He stated that Appellant entered Park Ridge’s property without oral or written permission and for the limited purpose of servicing its signs. Orcutt again testified that Appellant’s parcel is landlocked as there is no access to the property for any purpose other than to maintain billboards. Appellant also presented the testimony of Russell Hoffman, one of its former posting supervisors, who confirmed Orcutt’s testimony regarding the frequency and manner with which Appellant’s employees accessed the property.</p>

Gelman noted that in his view the best use of the property would be for advertising purposes because of the limited access to Appellant’s property via its prescriptive easement over Park Ridge’s property. The Township did not present any testimony at the hearings on Appellant’s current variance application and only Orcutt’s testimony was subject to cross-examination.</p>

On October 27, 1994 the Board filed its findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of its decision. The Board found that Appellant’s property would be suitable for development as an office building, a permitted use under the Township’s zoning ordinance, <a id="p696" href="#p696" data-label="696" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*696</a>but for the fact that the property does not have vehicular access. The Board concluded that any hardship Appellant suffered because of its limited access to the property was self-created since Appellant was, or should have been, aware of this obstacle at the time it became title owner of the property. Thus, as Section 910.2(a)(3) of the Municipalities Planning Code<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> provides that any alleged unnecessary hardship must not be created by a person seeking a variance, the Board denied Appellant’s application.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a>

The common pleas court, in reversing the Board, noted that because Appellant’s property is not accessible, it cannot be developed for any permitted purpose under the Township’s ordinance. The court observed that the only access available to Appellant is by way of easements over Martin’s property and Park Ridge’s property and that the limited scope of these easements cannot be expanded to accommodate the traffic that would be associated with an office building. Finally, the court criticized the Board’s conclusion that Appellant’s hardship was self-created, noting that Appellant should not be penalized for failing to obtain greater access at the time of purchase than it needed to support its legitimate billboard use.</p>

The Commonwealth Court concluded that although Appellant’s variance <a id="p697" href="#p697" data-label="697" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*697</a>request was premised upon its assertion that it had no other viable use of its land under the zoning ordinance, the Township “presented sufficient credible evidence to establish that [Appellant’s] land is suitable for the construction of an office building, a use that would be permitted under the ordinance.” <em>POA Company v.

As such, by entering into an agreement that specifically limited the use of its easement across Park Ridge’s property, POA intentionally created the hardship that it now claims prevents it from complying with the zoning ordinance; that self-inflicted hardship cannot now provide a basis for granting a variance ....</blockquote>

In <em>Poster, </em>the lot size of <a id="p701" href="#p701" data-label="701" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*701</a>a residential parcel was reduced in size by two-thirds through condemnation proceedings. Poster subsequently leased the remaining land and applied for a use variance to erect two outdoor advertising signs on the property. The land was zoned for residential use and Poster’s variance request was denied based on the zoning board’s finding that the property was suitable for residential use.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_14" id="ref_footnote_1_14">14</a>

    <p id="b801-5" data-blocks='[["BL_801.4",801,[215,711,1154,628]]]'>In reversing the common pleas court’s decision affirming the zoning board, we found that the size and dimension of the land, after the condemnation, prevented the construction and use of a residence. This Court pointed out that the property’s size and dimension permitted a very limited number of productive uses, the most likely and practical one being outdoor advertising. Thus, we concluded that the Board erred in reaching a contrary conclusion, noting that “[t]his is a case wherein any productive use of the land will be denied altogether. It is a case of the existence of a substantial hardship peculiar to this particular land.” <em>Poster, </em><a href="/pa/408/0248-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="408 Pa. 248" data-case-ids="1308397" data-case-paths="/pa/408/0248-01">408 Pa. at 252</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=182%20A.2d%20521" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="182 A.2d 521">182 A.2d at 524</a>.</p>
    <p id="b801-6" data-blocks='[["BL_801.5",801,[213,1390,1156,525]]]'>Similarly, here, the partial condemnation of Appellant’s property has left Appellant with a landlocked parcel with very few productive uses. Moreover, the lack of access to Appellant’s - property renders it unsuitable for any of the uses contemplated by the Township’s zoning ordinance and, as in <em>Poster, </em>the most likely and practical use of the property appears to be for outdoor advertising. Thus, we conclude that Appellant has suffered a substantial hardship because of the unique nature of its land and that the grant of a use variance is justified.</p>

Also before us is the Township's motion to dismiss Appellant's appeal to this Court for mootness. The Township argues that the appeal is moot because the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation denied Appellant’s application for an outdoor advertising permit to <a id="p698" href="#p698" data-label="698" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*698</a>erect the billboard at issue here, and Appellant exhausted its appeals regarding this determination. See <em>POA v. Department of Transportation, allocatur denied, </em><a href="/citations/?q=550%20Pa.%20674" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="550 Pa. 674">550 Pa. 674</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=703%20A.2d%20468" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="703 A.2d 468">703 A.2d 468</a> (1997). As noted by Appellant, the Department denied the permit for two reasons, 1) because the proposed sign was within 500 feet of an interchange; and 2) because there was no local zoning approval to erect the billboard. On appeal, the trial court and the Commonwealth Court upheld the Department’s decision since the record evidence demonstrated that the proposed billboard was within 500 feet of an interchange. The question of whether local zoning approval should have been granted is not moot, however, since Appellant is free to seek a permit for a sign location on its property that is not within 500 feet of an interchange once such a determination is made. Accordingly, the Township’s motion to dismiss for mootness is denied.</p>
