The Borough implicitly suggests that the word “annually” not be given literal effect in determining when crediting of accounts is to occur under Section 110; or that the legislature intended a process for the crediting of accounts in Section 412 different from the crediting that occurs under Section 110.</p>

Section 412 clearly directs that a withdrawing municipality receive only such amounts that are standing <em>to the credit </em>of its member accounts as of the date the Board approves the application for withdrawal.

For example, a municipality that withdraws after the close of business on December 31st of a given year will receive excess interest, whereas a municipality that withdraws one day earlier will be denied excess interest. Additionally, the Board freely acknowledges that a municipality that <em>joins </em>the PMRS at midyear will receive a pro-rated share of excess interest, so long as it remains a member on December 31st. The Borough contends that there is no logical reason why a municipality that <em>withdraws </em>at mid-year should not be entitled to the same form of prorated distribution for the period of its participation. Centrally, the Borough argues that application of the Board’s construction of the PMRL results in an unjust forfeiture.</p>

Moreover, in this case, the Borough received multiple benefits for participation in the PMRS, including a guaranteed fixed rate of return on contributions in the form of regular interest and assumption by the PMRS of various liabilities that otherwise would have been obligations of the Borough.

      <em>See generally </em>53 P.S. § 881.104(10)(establishing the Board’s rulemaking authority). Rather, we hold only that the Board’s rule is a valid interpretive rule, because: 1) Section 110 does not direct the crediting of excess interest to municipality and member accounts other than annually; 2) Section 412 does not direct distribution of excess interest to a withdrawing municipality such as is not credited (or due to be credited) to the relevant municipal and member accounts; and 3) the Board’s rule denying excess interest to a municipality withdrawing prior to December 31st of a given year tracks these provisions of the PMRL.</p>

While the statute does not specify December 31st as the date on which excess interest becomes due, the Board's selection of that date is merely a mechanism for applying Section 412 and is not an improper expansion upon it; rather, it is consistent both with the PMRL and the Board’s fiscal operations (the Board conducts its accounting on a fiscal year basis, and its fiscal year is the calendar year). <em>See generally California ex rel.
