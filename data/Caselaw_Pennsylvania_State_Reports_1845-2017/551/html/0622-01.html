For the reason set forth herein we find that the trial court did abuse its discretion and thus, reverse the decision of the Superior Court and remand this matter to the trial court for a new trial.</p>
    <p id="b724-11" data-blocks='[["BL_724.10",724,[218,1382,1162,472]]]'>On July 20, 1994 the trial court dismissed the charges of assault and harassment pending against appellee. The charges arose from an incident on June 27, 1991 when the police responded to appellee’s residence on an emergency call for assistance. The call for assistance was prompted by appellee’s physical assault on his wife. Appellee then proceeded to physically attack the police officer who responded to the call. As a result of this incident appellee was held for trial, which was set for December 2,1991.</p>

On January 20, 1992 the trial court granted the District Attorney’s motion pursuant to Rule 1100, Pa.R.Crim.P., to extend the time for trial until “sixty (60) days after availability” of appellee. Appellee was apprehended on May 3, 1994. Trial was scheduled for June 6, 1994. The case was not called for trial during the <a id="p625" href="#p625" data-label="625" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*625</a>June 6, 1994 trial term.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Appellee’s ease was thus automatically moved to the next available trial term, August 1, 1994.

    <p id="b725-4" data-blocks='[["BL_725.4",725,[240,603,1152,836]]]'>On July 20, 1994 a hearing was held on appellee’s motion to dismiss. At the hearing the trial court determined that the sole reason appellee’s case was not called for trial during the June 6th term was the unavailability of the prosecuting attorney assigned to the case. The subpoenaed witnesses were however available, as were appellee and the public defender. The assigned prosecutor was unavailable because he was on vacation. At the conclusion of the hearing the trial court granted the motion to dismiss “because the Commonwealth disobeyed our January 20, 1992, Order which required the Commonwealth to bring Defendant to trial no later than 60 days after he became available for trial.” (Trial Court Opinion at p. 4) The Superior Court, in a memorandum opinion, relying solely upon the opinion of the trial court, affirmed the decision of the trial court, with Ford Elliot, J., dissenting.

This court adopted Pa.R.Crim.P., Rule 1100 as an administrative means of protecting the constitutional right to a speedy trial. Allegations that an accused has not been brought to trial in a timely fashion are normally addressed with reference to Rule 1100 and its constitutional underpinnings. However, in the case at bar, appellee’s speedy trial rights were not prejudiced by the District Attorney’s failure to bring appellee to trial within the sixty day limitation set in the January 20th court order, thus, Rule 1100 is not at issue.

Here, at the request of the prosecutor, trial of this case was to take place within sixty (60) days after availability of appellee. On the original date set for trial, a date within the confines of the sixty (60) day framework, all of the witnesses, the accused, and his counsel appeared but, because the assigned prosecutor was unavailable, as he was on “vacation,” the trial did not take place. It is less than desirable, in a jurisdiction which does not have a twelve month criminal court trial calendar, and instead, disposes of its criminal cases by means of periodic terms of court, that a prosecutor’s personal vacation would take precedence over the trial of a criminal case to which he had been assigned some weeks prior. Furthermore, it is clearly disingenuous for that prosecutor to then argue that the trial court has no authority to enforce the order setting the date for trial. There are no extraordinary circumstances in the case <em>sub judice </em>which would condone a failure to abide by the subject order of court.

In <em>Konya </em>the appellant filed a complaint in mandamus seeking to compel the District Attorney to bring criminal charges against the witnesses who allegedly perjured themselves in bringing about appellant’s criminal conviction. Appellant therein failed to perfect service of the complaint. The Commonwealth Court found that appellee had suffered no prejudice from the defective service, therefore the court ordered appellant to properly perfect service of the complaint within fourteen days or suffer dismissal of the complaint in mandamus. Appellant failed to comply with the Commonwealth Court’s order and the complaint was dismissed. This court affirmed the decision of the Commonwealth Court. In that case we found no abuse of discretion by the Commonwealth Court, even though appellee suffered no actual prejudice due to the imperfect service of process. Unlike appellee herein, the appellant in <em>Konya </em>had been specifically warned by the court that failure to comply with the order to perfect service would lead to dismissal of the complaint.</p>
    <p id="b728-4" data-blocks='[["BL_728.4",728,[200,1556,1162,744]]]'>However, the discretion to dismiss is not unfettered and, as it is such a severe sanction, should be used only in instances of absolute necessity. Dismissal of criminal charges punishes not only the prosecutor, who was the offender in this case, but also the public at large, since the public has a reasonable expectation that those who have been charged with crimes will be fairly prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Thus, the sanction of dismissal of criminal charges should be utilized only in the most blatant of cases. Given the public policy goal of protecting the public from criminal conduct, a trial court should consider dismissal of charges where the actions of the Commonwealth are egregious and where demonstrable prejudice will be suffered by the defendant if the charges are not dismissed.</p>

In a county where there are jury trial terms of limited duration, and where no July term was scheduled, vacation time of trial attorneys should be secondary to the needs of the criminal justice system to properly and speedily provide due process to those accused of criminal acts. Accepting the improper act of the prosecutor, we must acknowledge the fact that no prejudice accrued to this defendant by virtue of the delay in his trial. This defendant in particular would be hard pressed to complain of a one month delay after having fled the jurisdiction for three years. The severe sanction of dismissal of all criminal charges was an unreasonable response to the admittedly discourteous and inexcusable affront to the court occasioned by the prosecutor’s action in this case.</p>

The Commonwealth apparently could have proceeded to trial on June 6, 1994 by reassigning the case to another assistant district attorney. However, the law as set forth in <em>Steltz </em>does not require a District Attorney’s Office to rearrange its schedule to meet that of a criminal defendant who was a fugitive for two and a half years, where, as here, the Commonwealth’s inability to proceed as scheduled resulted in a delay of only two months (until August 1, 1994), and the defendant was not at all prejudiced. In <em>Steltz, </em>after being arraigned on three counts each of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, and corruption of minors, appellee was released on his own recognizance. Trial was scheduled for February 9, 1987 (the rule 1100 run date expired on February 28, 1987). After a jury was empaneled, appellee failed to appear and could not be located by his attorney. The trial judge recessed until 9:30 a.m. the following day. Appellee still failed to appear. Upon his apprehension eleven days later, a new trial date was set for May 4, 1987, almost three months after the expired Rule 1100 run date. He then filed for dismissal under Rule 1100.

The majority chastises the prosecutor for allowing her personal vacation to take precedence over the trial of a criminal case to which she had been assigned some weeks before the vacation was to take place. There is no evidence in the record, however, about when the prosecutor had planned her vacation, the reason for her vacation from work, why it may have been necessary for the prosecutor to schedule her time out of the office for that particular week, or any hardship she might have suffered if forced to change her plans. Rather, the majority’s criticism of the prosecutor appears to be based on the mere assumption that she could have easily scheduled her vacation for another time. Because there is nothing in the record to support that assumption, the suggestion that the prosecutor was inexcusably at fault for the short delay in the trial of this long-time fugitive who happened to be apprehended shortly before the prosecutor’s vacation is unfair and unfounded.</p>
