Appellant was a designated insured under an automobile insurance policy issued by appellee, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company (“Aetna”). When purchasing this insurance policy, appellant selected the “limited tort” insurance option pursuant to the MVFRL, 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705. The purchase of the “limited tort” option allowed appellant to reduce his insurance premium. In return for this reduced premium, appellant was generally precluded from recovering for a noneconomic loss<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> unless he sustained a “serious injury”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> from the accident. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d).</p>

As a result of the accident, appellant filed a claim under the uninsured motorist provisions of his automobile insurance policy with Aetna for noneconomic damages.

In making this decision, the trial court found that the “provided that” clause in 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d)(l)(iv), which refers to the limitation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(d)(2), only applied to sub-paragraph (iv).

Since, as the parties admit, the legislative history of section 1705 is silent as to the proper scope of the “provided that” language, we are guided by the principles enunciated at 101 Pa.Code § 23.26.</p>
    <p id="b446-13" data-blocks='[["BL_446.14",446,[226,1634,1160,689]],["BL_447.1",447,[213,253,1151,588]]]'>Based on these principles, it is clear that provision (1) of subsection 1705(d) (which provides qualifying language to the general rule set forth in subsection (d) that noneconomic damages are not available unless the party suffers a “serious injury”) is a paragraph since it is illustrated by an Arabic numeral. It is also clear that provisions (i) through (iv) of paragraph (1) (which provide specific exceptions to the general rule of subsection (d)) are subparagraphs because they are illustrated by a lower case Roman numeral. The language in dispute, which is contained in subparagraph (iv), states “provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitations of section 1731(d)(2).” Thus, the plain meaning of the language in dispute is that the “provided that” language applies <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>to all of the provisions of paragraph (1). Therefore, since we must assume that the General Assembly knew what a paragraph meant in terms of constructing a statutory provision, we hold that the plain meaning of the “provided that” language is that the limitations of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(d)(2) apply to all the subparagraphs contained in paragraph (1) of subsection 1705(d). Accordingly, a driver who elects limited tort coverage is unable to collect noneconomic damages from uninsured or underinsured motorist provisions of his insurance policy for any accidents set forth in paragraph 1 of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d) because of the limitation at 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(d)(2).</p>
    <p id="b447-4" data-blocks='[["BL_447.4",447,[209,887,1155,1412]]]'>This conclusion is consistent with the policy behind the enactment of the MVFRL, the concern over the spiraling costs of insurance to residents of Pennsylvania. In three of the four exceptions contained in paragraph (1) of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d), the General Assembly must have concluded that the importance of limiting insurance costs were outweighed by the need to punish or deter tortfeasors who drove under the influence (subparagraph (i)), who intentionally injured others (subparagraph (iii)) and who operated an uninsured vehicle (subparagraph (iv)). In the fourth exception, the General Assembly obviously concluded that it needed to level the playing field between Pennsylvania limited tort insureds and the rights of out-of-state motorists since the MVFRL does not limit the ability of out-of-state motorists from recovering noneconomic damages from Pennsylvania tortfeasors and the allowance of this exception will not affect the insurance rates charged to Pennsylvania motorists. However, the limitation placed on these four exceptions by 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(d)(2) reflects a legislative determination that allowing uninsured claims under the four exceptions would not deter or punish unacceptable conduct or level the playing field between parties. Instead, allowing such a recovery from the “limited tort” driver’s uninsured or underinsured provisions of his policy would act to eliminate the cost savings associated with choosing the limited tort option because it would have an upward effect on insurance rates charged to Pennsylvania insureds.</p>

However, the interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the Court to resolve and when the Court is convinced that the interpretive regulation adopted by the administrative agency is clearly erroneous or is violative of legislative intent, the Court disregards the administrative agency’s regulation. <em>Philadelphia Suburban Corp. v. Board of Finance and Revenue, </em><a href="/pa/535/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="535 Pa. 298" data-case-ids="1841576" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0298-01">535 Pa. 298</a>, 301-02, <a href="/pa/535/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="635 A.2d 116" data-case-ids="1841576,7358591" data-case-paths="/pa/535/0298-01,/a2d/635/0116-01">635 A.2d 116</a>, 118 (1993). As described above, the Insurance Commissioner’s interpretation of the relevant statute in the case <em>sub judice </em>disregards the clear manner in which statutes are arranged in the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. Thus, this Court finds that the Insurance Commissioner’s interpretative regulation is erroneous and may be disregarded. It is for the legislature, not the <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>courts or administrative agencies, to alter the construction which must be afforded to the statutory provisions in question.</p>
    <p id="b449-4" data-blocks='[["BL_449.4",449,[221,412,1155,1440]]]'>Based on the above, we hold that the “provided that nothing in this paragraph shall affect the limitation of section 1731(d)(2)” language of subparagraph (iv) refers to the entirety of paragraph (1) of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d). Thus, the limitation of 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(d)(2) applies and precludes a person like appellant who has selected the “limited tort” option for his automobile insurance policy pursuant to the MVFRL from recovering noneconomic damages under the uninsured motorist provisions of his insurance policy even though the accident was caused by an uninsured motorist whose vehicle was registered in a state other than Pennsylvania. In making this ruling, we emphasize that this does not mean that appellant cannot seek noneconomic damages pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d)(l)(ii) and (iv) in a liability action against the tortfeasor. Instead, this ruling limits only appellant’s ability to seek noneconomic damages from the uninsured motorist provisions of his <em>oum </em>automobile insurance policy with Aetna to instances where he suffers a “serious injury.” By limiting appellant’s ability to recover such damages, this Court is holding appellant to his voluntary choice of limiting his ability to recover such damages in return for a reduced insurance premium. Accordingly, since appellant has admittedly not suffered a “serious injury”, the order of the Superior Court reversing the trial court’s grant of summary judgment and declaration that appellant is entitled to recover uninsured motorist benefits for noneconomic damages pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. § 1705(d)(l)(ii) is affirmed.</p>
