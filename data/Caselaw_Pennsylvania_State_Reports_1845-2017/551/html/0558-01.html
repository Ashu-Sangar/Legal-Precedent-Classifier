In <em>Paylor, </em>the insureds were killed in a single-vehicle accident while operating their motor home, which was insured under a policy issued by Foremost Insurance Company. The decedent insureds also maintained a policy with Hartford Insurance Company covering three other vehicles that they owned. The estate of one of the decedent insureds recovered the policy liability limits from Foremost and then sought to recover underinsured coverage from the Hartford policy. Hartford <a id="p565" href="#p565" data-label="565" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*565</a>denied underinsured coverage based on the “household exclusion” in the Hartford policy. The decedent insureds’ estate brought a declaratory judgment action seeking underinsured coverage and a declaration that the “household exclusion” violated public policy and the MVFRL. This Court reviewed several cases involving the “household exclusion” and concluded that the “household exclusion” barred underinsured coverage because the decedent insureds chose to insure the motor home for substantially less than they insured their other three automobiles and therefore the underinsured coverage in the Hartford policy on those cars should not be converted into additional liability coverage for the motor home.</p>

In <em>Windrim, </em>the appellant, while driving his uninsured automobile, was injured by the negligence of an unknown hit-and-run driver. The Appellant sought uninsured coverage under a Nationwide policy maintained by his mother, with whom he had been living at the time. Nationwide denied coverage based on the “household exclusion.” This Court held that the exclusion was valid as applied on the basis that relatives living with the named insureds could decide not to purchase insurance for their own vehicles and instead attempt to rely on uninsured motorist coverage under the named insured’s policy.</p>

The facts of <em>Hart </em>were distinguishable from <em>Windrim </em>in that the motor vehicle which Hart was driving was insured under a separate policy from that which he sought to obtain underinsured benefits. Nationwide invoked a “household exclusion” in the policy from which Hart sought underinsured benefits. Moreover, the “household exclusion” language in <em>Hart </em>was virtually identical to the “household exclusion” language at issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>While the lower courts voided the “household exclusion” as against public policy, this Court <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>reversed those decisions on the basis of its holding in <em>Windrim. </em>Thus, the above examination of this Court’s case law does not suggest that there is a unanimity of opinion against enforcement of the “household exclusion” language contained in the two policies issued by appellee.</p>

As noted above, underinsured motorist coverage serves the purpose of protecting innocent victims from under-insured motorists who cannot adequately compensate the victims for their injuries. That purpose, however, does not rise to the level of public policy overriding every other consideration of contract construction. As this Court has stated, “there is a correlation between premiums paid by the insured and the coverage the claimant should reasonably expect to receive.” <em>Hall v. Amica Mut. Ins. Co., </em><a href="/pa/538/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="538 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="475549" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0337-01">538 Pa. 337</a>, 349, <a href="/pa/538/0336-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="648 A.2d 755" data-case-ids="475505,475549,7874198,7874309" data-case-paths="/pa/538/0336-01,/pa/538/0337-01,/a2d/648/0755-01,/a2d/648/0755-02">648 A.2d 755</a>, 761 (1994). Here, appellant voluntarily chose not to purchase underinsured motorist coverage. In return for this choice, appellant received reduced insurance premiums. As appellant admitted in his answers to interrogatories, he was not aware that his mother and her husband had insurance policies which could have possibly covered him. Moreover, it is not readily apparent that appellee knew of appellant’s existence when it issued the two insurance policies or that the insurance premium charged to his mother and her husband reflected an intent on their part to provide underinsured motorist coverage to appellant. Thus, this Court concludes that giving effect to the “household exclusion” in this case furthers the legislative policy behind underinsured motorist <a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>coverage in the MVFRL since it will have the effect of holding appellant to his voluntary choice.</p>
    <p id="b667-4" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[240,420,1154,833]]]'>Allowing the “household exclusion” language to stand in this case is further bolstered by the intent behind the MVFRL, to stop the spiralling costs of automobile insurance in the Commonwealth. If appellant’s position were accepted, it would allow an entire family living in a single household with numerous automobiles to obtain underinsured motorist coverage for each family member through a single insurance policy on one of the automobiles in the household. If this result were allowed, it would most likely result in higher insurance premiums on all insureds (even those without family members living at their residence) since insurers would be required to factor expanded coverage cost into rates charged for underinsured motorist coverage. Thus, allowing the “household exclusion” language of the two insurance policies at issue to bar recovery by appellant of underinsured motorist benefits is consistent with the intent behind the enactment of the MVFRL.</p>

As stated, it is only in the clearest of cases that a court may make an alleged public policy the basis of judicial decision. <em>See Guardian Life Ins. Co. v. Zerance, </em><a href="/pa/505/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="505 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1788870" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0345-01">505 Pa. 345</a>, 354, <a href="/pa/505/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="505 Pa. 345" data-case-ids="1788870" data-case-paths="/pa/505/0345-01">479 A.2d 949</a>, 954 (1984). The case <em>sub judice </em>is not the clearest of cases, so it is beyond judicial authority to declare the clear and unambiguous “household exclusion” language in the policies issued by appellee to be void as against public policy. If anything, the above analysis demonstrates that allowing the “household exclusion” language to stand supports the legislatively stated public policy of reducing insurance costs. Therefore, this Court finds that the “household exclusion” language in the two insurance policies issued <a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>by appellee is valid. Accordingly, this Court affirms the order of the Superior Court reversing the trial court’s award of summary judgment and remanding the matter to the trial court.</p>

The notice of cancellation, however, provided that coverage was cancelled effective July 23, 1993. Thus, appellant’s policy with Aegis was in effect at the time of the accident subject to this appeal.</p>

Underinsured motorist coverage provides "protection for persons who suffer injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle and are legally entitled to recover damages therefor from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles.” 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(c). While all motor vehicle liability insurance policies issued for vehicles registered in the Commonwealth must offer underinsured and/or uninsured motorist coverage, the 1990 amendments to the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law made the purchase of underinsured and/or uninsured motorist coverage optional. 75 Pa.C.S. § 1731(a).</p>
