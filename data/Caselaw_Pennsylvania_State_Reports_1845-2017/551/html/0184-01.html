Prior to jury selection, the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>conducted a hearing to determine whether a jury could find that the offenses warranted the imposition of the death penalty. The trial court concluded that due to the youth and lack of maturity of the defendant at the time of the crime, the case should proceed non-capital. Although not referred to as such, the court essentially conducted a pre-trial evaluation of the mitigating evidence and determined that it outweighed any possible aggravating circumstances.</p>

However, the trial court must be able to ensure that the Commonwealth is not seeking the death penalty for an improper reason. The nature of the court’s inquiry is focused solely upon whether the case is properly designated as capital, not whether each aggravating factor alleged is supported by evidence. We note that, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(e)(l)(i), the trial court is required to instruct the jury to consider only aggravating circumstances for which there is <em>some evidence. </em>Thus, if the Commonwealth files a notice of aggravating circumstances which includes at least one aggravating factor that is supported by any evidence, the case is properly framed as a capital case.

Instead of appealing the trial court’s order, however, the Commonwealth petitioned for a writ of prohibition vacating the trial court’s order and prohibiting such pre-trial determinations in the future. Our Court questioned the appropriateness of the remedy of a writ of prohibition and considered the Commonwealth’s petition as an appeal from the trial court’s order.</p>
