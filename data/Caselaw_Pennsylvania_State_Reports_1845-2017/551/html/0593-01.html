After concluding that the police violated the “knock and announce” rule when executing the search warrant at Appellant’s home, the trial court held that the evidence seized during the search should have been suppressed. Additionally, the court found that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a witness during the suppression hearing who could have testified for Appellant regarding the execution of the warrant. For these reasons, the trial court granted a new trial and ordered that the evidence seized be suppressed. The Commonwealth filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court denied on November 12,1993.</p>

Accordingly, the Superior Court reversed the Order for a new trial, reinstated the convictions, and remanded for sentencing.

The time and resources required for a separate hearing would permit a defendant to control the pace and timing of the proceedings. Flight would become a defense tactic used to obtain a continuance that the court might not grant otherwise. In addition, judicial economy would be lost, the flow of the trial would be disrupted, and an unnecessary hardship would be placed on the court, the jury, and the witnesses who are held in limbo while everyone waits for the defendant.

This short adjournment ensures that a defendant’s absence is compelling without permitting him to benefit from deliberate flight. At the same time, it causes little inconvenience to the Commonwealth as the jury and any witnesses may be recessed for 24 hours. Should the defendant not appear within this 24 hour period, following an on-the record inquiry, and in the judge’s discretion, trial may continue.
