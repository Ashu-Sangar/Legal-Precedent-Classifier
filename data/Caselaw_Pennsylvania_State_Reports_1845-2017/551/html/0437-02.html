We conclude that trial counsel was ineffective where available expert testimony indicated that Appellant was suffering from major depression and anxiety that would have prevented her from rationally forming the specific intent to kill. Therefore, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court and reinstate the PCRA Court’s Order, granting Appellant a new trial.</p>

    <p id="b540-11" data-blocks='[["BL_540.10",540,[236,1678,1159,474]]]'>The record establishes that Appellant and the victim, Ernest Legg (Mr. Legg), were married in 1956. In 1960, Appellant learned that her husband was having an affair with another woman, Amy Stephenson. Nonetheless, the Leggs reconciled and stayed together until 1980 when Mr. Legg suddenly left. The Leggs obtained a divorce in 1985. They, however, continued to have sexual relations. In early 1986, Appellant learned that Mr. Legg had rekindled his relationship with Stephenson in 1985.</p>
    <p id="b540-12" data-blocks='[["BL_540.11",540,[237,2184,1159,149]],["BL_541.1",541,[202,296,1154,790]]]'>Appellant repeatedly called Stephenson demanding that she leave Mr. Legg alone. Sometimes she would call and then hang up the telephone. She also followed Mr. Legg and <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>Stephenson by car. Due to her mounting anger toward Stephenson and her fear that she might harm Mr. Legg, Appellant voluntarily sought psychiatric assistance on June 11, 1986. She went to the Northern Communities Mental Health/Mental Retardation Center (Northern Communities MHMR), which recommended immediate in-patient hospitalization. That same day, Appellant was admitted to St. John’s Hospital psychiatric ward because she was actively suicidal and was talking about killing her husband. St. John’s diagnosed her with recurrent major depression and treated her with tranquilizers. After two days, Appellant left St. John’s, against medical advice and discontinued her medications. Appellant then saw a clinical psychologist, Lois Dabney-Smith, Ph.D., several days later for one session but did not return for further treatment.</p>
    <p id="b541-5" data-blocks='[["BL_541.4",541,[198,1121,1155,852]]]'>On her birthday, July 27,1986, Mr. Legg took Appellant out for dinner. They later engaged in sexual relations, which led Appellant to believe that they were going to be able to resolve their differences. Then, on August 6,1986, due to Appellant’s repeated telephone calls, Stephenson filed charges of harassment against Appellant. The criminal complaint stunned Appellant. Shortly before 4:00 p.m., on August 8, 1986, she drove across town to meet Mr. Legg at his place of employment. She had a gun that she always kept under the front seat of her car for protection.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> As Mr. Legg exited his place of employment, she approached him, carrying the gun in a bag. Mr. Legg allowed her to join him in the front seat of his car. Appellant begged him to tell her the truth about Stephenson, but Mr. Legg denied any romantic involvement with her. The couple began arguing. She pulled the gun from the bag.</p>

Mr. Legg exited the car and collapsed. He died of gun shot wounds in the arm and back. After the shooting, Appellant claims that she was in “shock.” She drove to the Public Safety Building, where she worked as a dispatcher, to report the incident. She informed the desk sergeant, “I shot my husband” and handed him the gun.</p>

On March 24, 1987, Appellant waived her right to a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial before the Honorable Alan S. Penkower in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (trial court). An attorney of the Office of the Allegheny County Public Defender represented Appellant. At trial, defense counsel primarily relied on the defense of accident or homicide by misadventure.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> Alternatively, counsel asserted a heat of passion defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Trial counsel did not raise a diminished capacity defense.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> The trial <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>court convicted Appellant of first degree murder and sentenced her to life imprisonment.

    <p id="b543-5" data-blocks='[["BL_543.5",543,[205,504,1154,846]]]'>On February 27, 1991, Appellant filed a PCRA petition requesting a new trial, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the diminished capacity defense. Judge Penkower also presided at the PCRA hearing. At the hearing, Appellant, her trial counsel, and psychologist Dr. Herbert I. Levit, testified concerning her diminished capacity, after which the PCRA Court granted her a new trial. The Superior Court reversed the PCRA Court, holding that trial counsel reasonably relied on the defense of accident or homicide by misadventure, which could have produced an acquittal, and avoided the defense of diminished capacity, that would have admitted guilt and resulted in a sentence for criminal homicide. We granted allocatur on the issue of whether the Superior Court erred in reversing the PCRA Court’s determination that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue a diminished capacity defense.</p>

According to Dr. Levit, Appellant suffered from major depression with anxiety at the time of the shooting.

Dr. Levit opined that the shooting resulted from her depression and anxiety associated with her feelings of anger and betrayal. R. 344a.

Hobson, </em><a href="/pa/484/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="484 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1753739" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0250-01">484 Pa. 250</a>, <a href="/pa/484/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="484 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="1753739" data-case-paths="/pa/484/0250-01">398 A.2d 1364</a> (1979). Therefore, the evidence presented actually offered the trial court five possible verdicts concerning the homicide charge: first degree murder; third degree murder; voluntary manslaughter; involuntary manslaughter; and acquittal. Particularly when the facts supported a finding of <em>first </em>degree murder, we find no reasonable justification for counsel’s failure to also advance a diminished capacity defense that may have produced a verdict of third degree murder. Therefore, we conclude that the record supports the trial court’s finding that counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to investigate and present a diminished capacity defense.</p>

In each of those cases, this Court held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to advance a diminished capacity and/or insanity defense in the defendant’s murder trial. We reasoned that an insanity or diminished capacity defense, which would have admitted the commission of the act, would have directly conflicted with each defendant’s claim of innocence. Each defendant in <em>Cross </em>and <em>Mizell </em>maintained that he had not committed the homicide(s) in question. In contrast, and contrary to the Commonwealth’s assertion, Appellant does not deny shooting her husband. Thus, the sole question and dispositive issue at trial, here, was Appellant’s mental state at the time of the shooting. The Commonwealth sought to prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellant committed an intentional killing with malice. Appellant as<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>serted that she did not intend to kill her husband — that the shooting was an accident — or, alternatively, that she shot her husband, but acted in the heat of passion.

I fear that these three factors will henceforth converge with alarming frequency in PCRA petitions. Moreover, by stretching the defense of diminished capacity to encompass the facts of this case, the majority has, perhaps inadvertently, set a precedent which will allow defendants to raise the defense of “the devil made me do it” to charges of first-degree murder.

Furthermore, in suggesting that the "heat of passion” defense might be an acceptable verdict under the prosecutor’s theory of the case, trial counsel did not concede the issue of general criminal liability, as he necessarily would have by arguing diminished capacity. <em>See Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Travaglia, supra, Commonwealth v.

Dr. Levit, a psychologist who testified on appellant’s behalf at the PCRA hearing, had no contact with appellant until over five years after the events at issue.

The majority also alludes to the PCRA hearing testimony of trial counsel, who, when asked whether he would have proceeded differently had he known that appellant suffered from major depression, replied, "Absolutely. First [sic] comes to mind is the defense of diminished capacity, if that can be developed.” Maj. Opin. at 11. Trial counsel’s self-interested testimony in support of a new trial for his former client, while somewhat suspect, is nevertheless irrelevant. The inquiry is not whether he would have acted differently under a subjective test, but whether he in fact acted reasonably in the first instance under an objective standard. For the reasons stated above, I believe that he did.</p>

To some extent, analysis of whether there was actual prejudice will inevitably dovetail with analysis under the first prong of the ineffectiveness test, whether the underlying claim is of "arguable merit.” In this vein, the majority points out that, based on Dr. Levit’s testimony, the Commonwealth has stipulated that the diminished capacity defense was of "arguable merit.” However, the issue of whether certain testimony, if credited, supports a defense of diminished capacity is a question of law. This Court is not bound by stipulations as to questions of law. <em>See Matter of Green, </em><a href="/pa/470/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="97" data-cite="470 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1723795" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0164-01">470 Pa. 164</a>, <a href="/pa/470/0164-01" class="citation" data-index="98" data-cite="470 Pa. 164" data-case-ids="1723795" data-case-paths="/pa/470/0164-01">368 A.2d 245</a> (1977); <em>Miller v.

Again, it would be virtually impossible to secure a conviction for first-degree murder if the prosecutor had to prove that the accused’s specific intent to commit the murder had been <em>rationally </em>formulated. In a very real sense, it is never a rational thought process that causes someone to formulate the intent to take a life. However, a rational thought process is not a prerequisite to the ability to form a specific intent in our legal system. <em>See, e.g., United States v.
