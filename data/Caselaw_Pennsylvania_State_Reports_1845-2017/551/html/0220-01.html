At that hearing on January 25,1993, the Commonwealth informed the trial court that it had been unable to subpoena Kelly Anderson (Anderson), a manager and bartender at a tavern that Matis allegedly visited on the night of the accident. The assistant district attorney informed the court that Anderson was unavailable because she was on a camping vacation and somewhere en route from Arizona to McKean County. The Commonwealth attempted to subpoena Anderson sixteen days before the trial. When it was unable to serve her, a detective from the district attorney’s office contacted her father, sister, and an employee at the bar. The employee, Barry McGill, testified that Anderson telephoned the bar two or three times while she was vacationing and that he told her to contact the district attorney’s office. McGill also said that Anderson told him that she would call the district attorney, but she never did.</p>

It concluded that her testimony was necessary based on interview notes of a private investigator whom lawyers had hired concerning a related civil claim. To support its argument, the Commonwealth introduced the investigator’s report into evidence. Relying on the private investigator’s notes, the Commonwealth represented to the court that Anderson told the investigator that Matis entered the tavern at 1:45 a.m. and asked for a mixed drink, but that she served him a soft drink instead because he was visibly intoxicated. According to the notes, Matis was with one of the victims, and with his companion he left the tavern at 2:10 a.m., approximately ten to fifteen minutes before the accident.</p>

The court held <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>that the Commonwealth was not diligent in assuring Anderson’s attendance at trial. In addition, the trial court relied on the fact that the Commonwealth did not introduce any expert testimony at the hearing on the motion to continue to establish that Anderson’s testimony was necessary to lay a foundation for the expert’s relation back opinion.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[241,660,1160,736]]]'>The Commonwealth filed a Notice of Appeal of that Order to the Superior Court on January 27, 1993, the date on which the trial was scheduled to begin. The Commonwealth did not seek permission from the trial court to appeal this interlocutory order pursuant to Rule 312 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure. Instead, it filed a notice of appeal containing a certification that the trial court’s Order denying the Motion to Continue substantially impaired the prosecution. The trial court took no action while the appeal was pending because it believed that the filing of the Commonwealth’s appeal divested it of jurisdiction. The Superior Court granted Matis’ Motion to Quash the appeal by Order dated December 8, 1993. The Commonwealth filed a Motion to Reconsider, which the Superior Court denied.</p>

Matis continues to argue that the prosecutor took the appeal to the Superior Court in bad faith and to delay the beginning of his trial. Although the trial court’s Opinion is silent on this issue, the trial court expressly rejected that assertion in court when it stated the following:</p>

In the present case, the trial court denied Matis’ Motion to Suppress Evidence on June 29, 1992. However, because that motion was not returnable at the time of trial, Matis’ trial did not "commence” when the trial court held a hearing on the motion for purposes of Rule 1100.</p>

Dugger, </em><a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">506 Pa. 537</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="55" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">486 A.2d 382</a> (1985). Contrary to the position of the Majority, I do not believe that the filing of a <em>Dugger </em>certification is a sufficient safeguard to prevent the Commonwealth from filing appeals simply to delay trial where, as here, the trial court has denied the Commonwealth’s motion to continue.</p>

In the first situation, the element of finality inherent in the order of the suppression is apparent and sufficient to render the order appealable. In the second situation, although the element of finality in the order is not so apparent it is nevertheless present. Without a right of appeal in the Commonwealth in the second situation, the Commonwealth is completely deprived of <em>any opportunity </em>to secure an appellate court evaluation of the validity of the order of suppression which forces the Commonwealth to trial without <em>all </em>of its evidence.

Thus, in recognition of the practical effects that an order suppressing evidence may have on the prosecution, the majority of the court in <em>Dugger </em>rendered permissible an appeal of a <em>suppression order </em>upon a good faith certification by the Commonwealth that the suppression order substantially handicaps its prosecution. The court specifically noted, however, that “[s]uch certification is required as a means of preventing frivolous appeals and appeals intended solely for delay.” <em>Dugger, </em><a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">506 Pa. at 547</a>, <a href="/pa/506/0537-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="506 Pa. 537" data-case-ids="1790936" data-case-paths="/pa/506/0537-01">486 A.2d at 386</a>.</p>

As the above-recited portions of <em>Dugger </em>make clear, this court was acutely aware of the undesirable consequences of permitting unfettered <em>Dugger </em>certifications from all orders entered adversely to the Commonwealth.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> In short, I think the certification represents an unwarranted extension of <em>Dugger.</em>

The running of Rule 1100 was not tolled during that period of time which elapsed during the Commonwealth’s appeal for the further reason that the trial court explicitly found that the Commonwealth failed to exercise due diligence in bringing Appellee to trial. Finally, I do not believe that <em>Jones v.

Hence, I would agree with the trial court’s ultimate conclusion that the charges be dismissed under Rule 1100 and would, thus, reverse the decision of the Superior Court.</p>

Moreover, the rules providing for interlocutory appeals by permission upon certification of the trial court adequately protect all the parties in circumstances such as the present. <em>See </em>42 Pa.C.S. § 702(b); Pa.R.App. 312, 1301-1323. Under those rules the Commonwealth would carry the burden of demonstrating the necessity for-an interlocutory appeal from the order denying the continuance. To allow the Commonwealth on its own initiative to by-pass these rules by self-certifying such interlocutory appeals would not only run afoul of <em>Dugger, </em>but also circumvent the rules respecting interlocutory appeals.</p>
