        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe primary issue on this appeal is whether, in the absence of sufficient iegal evidence upon which to base a finding of paternity, a person, who maintained a meretricious relationship with the child\u2019s mother, can be found liable for the support of the child because he stood \u201cin loco parentis\u201d to the child?\nIn August 1946, Elizabeth Brooks entered into a lawful marriage with Clarence Morgan, a marriage never legally dissolved. After living together for about four months, Morgan left his wife and disappeared. Of that marriage the record does not reveal affirmatively the birth of any children. In 1948, Mrs.-Morgan entered into a meretricious relationship with one George Smith, a relationship which lasted until 1965. During the time in which they lived together at various addresses in Philadelphia, Smith, a merchant seaman, by reason of his duties, was required to be absent for considerable periods of time.\nOn March 1, 1956, a male child was born to Mrs. Morgan to whom was given the name \u201cGeorge Smith, Jr.\u201d On the line indicated in the child\u2019s birth certificate for the signature of the child\u2019s father, Smith had signed his name. When the child was two years old, Smith said to Mrs. Morgan \u201cLet\u2019s get married and give Georgie a good name.\u201d On July 1, 1959, Smith and Mrs. Morgan went through a marriage ceremony at Elkton, Maryland, and, thereafter, continued to live together.\nDuring the period within which Mrs. Morgan and Smith lived together, Smith contributed to the support of Mrs. Morgan and the child and paid for food, rent, clothing, medical bills, etc. On January 15, 1965, Smith stopped paying any support.\nMrs. Morgan, obviously at the behest of the relief authorities, instituted an action in the County Court of Philadelphia against Smith seeking support for the minor child. An examination of the petition, upon which this action is based, reveals that support is claimed from Smith solely on the theory that he was the father of the child and not upon any theory of \u201cloco parentis\u201d. The record reveals no basis upon which the \u201cin loco parentis\u201d theory can be bottomed. The county court found that Mrs. Morgan had failed to produce competent legal evidence of nonaccess on the part of her lawful husband and that Mrs. Morgan\u2019s failure to produce proof of nonaccess prevented a finding that Smith was the father of the child. The court, however, stated: \u201c. . . nevertheless, we are of the opinion that [Smith] stood in the position of \u2018in loco parentis\u2019 to this child and should continue to maintain and support him as he has done from the time of the child\u2019s birth, March 1, 1956, until January 15, 1965.\u201d Upon appeal from that support order, the Superior Court, by a 4-3 vote, affirmed the order. See: Commonwealth ex rel. Morgan v. Smith, 209 Pa. Superior Ct. 364, 228 A. 2d 6 (1967). To the majority per curiam opinion Judge Hoffman filed a dissenting opinion wherein Judge Montgomery joined and Judge Spaulding noted a dissent. The propriety of that order of the Superior Court is now before us.\nWe, initially, must direct our attention to the matter of procedure. The sole pleading before the court below was a printed form of petition partially filled in with handwriting but it was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement of a \u201cpetition, information, affidavit or any other legal document for the institution of support proceedings.\u201d (See: Act of July 13, 1953, P. L. 431, \u00a7\u00a72, 5, 62 P.S. \u00a7\u00a72043.31, 2043.35).\nIn his dissenting opinion, Judge Hoffman stated that he would reverse the county court \u201cbecause it based its order on a finding that was neither alleged in the complaint nor made the subject of the court hearing. The sole issue at trial was whether [Smith] was the putative father. [Mrs. Morgan] did not suggest that [Smith] was liable for support because of the assumption of parental responsibility nor did [Smith] defend on this issue. Indeed [Smith] did not testify at all, perhaps because he was secure in the knowledge that the presumption of access could not be overcome.\u201d The \u201cin loco parentis\u201d theory was adopted subsequent to the hearing, sua sponte, by the court itself.\nIn the posture in which this case was presented in the county court, we have no recourse other than to reverse this judgment. The phrase \u201cin loco parentis\u201d refers to a person who puts himself in the situation of a lawful parent by assuming the obligations incident to the parental relationship without going through the formality of a legal adoption. The status of \u201cin loco parentis\u201d embodies two ideas; first, the assumption of a parental status, and, second, the discharge of parental duties. Whether a person standing \u201cin loco parentis\u201d is liable for the support of a child is a matter not only of first impression in this Court but of great importance. However, as pointed out in the dissenting opinion, there is nothing on this record upon which to bottom a conclusion that Smith occupied the status of \u201cin loco parentis\u201d and, absent such evidence, we are not now in a position to properly pass upon this question.\nOrder reversed.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Musmanno dissent.\nAlthough Mrs. Morgan, at some unestablished time -after 1946, heard that Morgan was in Washington, D. C., apparently Morgan has not communicated with his wife since 1946.\nAt that time, each party falsely indicated that they had never been married.",
