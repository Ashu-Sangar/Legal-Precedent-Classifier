    <p id="b490-5" data-blocks='[["BL_490.8",490,[238,726,1159,820]]]'>Appellant, Anthony Mussoline, was tided before a judge and jury and convicted of malicious mischief in connection with the dynamiting of a scrap yard owned by one Salvatore Gaudiano. Relying entirely on circumstantial evidence to prove Mussoline’s guilt, the Commonwealth was permitted to establish, inter alia, that three small droplets of blood found 60 feet from the scene of the explosion were of the same type, “A”, as that of appellant. It is uncontradicted that type A is the second most common blood type, appearing in approximately 30% of all human beings. Appellant has advanced several reasons for the inadmissibility of this evidence, including the argument that it was legally irrelevant to the issue of whether appellant was present at the scene of the crime.</p>
    <p id="b490-6" data-blocks='[["BL_490.9",490,[231,1557,1158,824]],["BL_491.1",491,[173,388,1155,322]]]'>In order to place the blood type evidence in its proper perspective, we shall review the Commonwealth’s case in some detail. Three witnesses testified that early on the morning of February 10, 1965, at about 2:30 A.M., they heard a loud explosion in the area of Gaudiano’s scrap yard. No one, however, saw anybody at the scene of the blast at that time. An expert witness testified as to the cause of the explosion and its origin. He concluded that dynamite had been placed under a davenport in the scrap yard office. In order to linlr appellant to this dynamite, testimony was introduced to show that Anthony Mussoline and his brother Barney were engaged in the business of strip mining (appellant apparently pursued this business as a sideline, for his main occupation was that of police <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>officer), that this business made use of high explosives, and that Barney had purchased some dynamite, in the name of the business only, about three weeks before the scrap yard explosion. No attempt' was made to link the dynamite actually used in the blast with that purchased by appellant’s brother.</p>
    <p id="b491-3" data-blocks='[["BL_491.4",491,[167,723,1159,704]]]'>The Commonwealth next sought to show motive. Salvatore Gaudiano, owner of the demolished yard, testified that on the day before the explosion he and appellant had inadvertently met in a local garage, whereupon a conversation ensued concerning a debt owed Gaudiano by appellant. No harsh words were exhanged, nor were any blows struck by either man. Gaudiano did tell Mussoline, however, that if appellant did not pay the money by the end of the week he (Gaudiano) would have Mussoline arrested. Gaudiano concluded his testimony by stating that the debt has since been paid, that he and Mussoline are still friends, and that they continue to do business with each other.</p>

Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it appears that in 1960 Mussoline entered the Hazleton State General Hospital for surgery, pursuant to which his blood was then typed as Landsteiner A, Moss 2, Rh positive. The blood spots found near the scene of the crime were also of this type. A nurse at the Hazleton Hospital testified that on the morning of the crime, at approximately 3:15 A.M., Mussoline came to the accident ward with a two inch long laceration on the inside of his right forearm. He explained to the nurse that he had <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>sustained the injury about two hours before (well prior to the time of the explosion) when he slipped on some ice in his driveway while putting his car into the garage. According to Mussoline, he cut his arm on a piece of jagged concrete. When asked why he had waited so long before coming to the hospital, appellant told the nurse that he first believed the wound to be minor, and only after his wife urged him to obtain treatment did he finally come to the accident ward. 'The story told by the nurse was in all material aspects corroborated by a police officer who had interviewed appellant the following day while investigating the case. In addition to the nurse, the Commonwealth called to the stand the doctor who actually treated Mussoline’s wound. He stated that the bleeding had substantially stopped by the time he saw the wound, and that it was probably caused by a sharp object such as a piece of glass. On cross-examination, however, the doctor admitted that the cut could also have been caused by a piece of jagged concrete. Finally, a police detective related that he had conducted an investigation of the blast area which indicated that no one knew of or saw anyone injured on the night of the crime.</p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[236,1726,1152,645]]]'>We think it clear that under our own case law, as well as that of other jurisdictions, mere proof that a criminal defendant shares a blood type with that of samples found near the crime scene is legally irrelevant to show that the defendant was in fact present at the scene of the crime without <em>some additional, </em>independent evidence <em>tending </em>to show either (1) that the man who committed the crime did lose blood in the process or (2) that the defendant was present at the scene. In short, blood-type evidence such as this can only be used to <em>corroborate </em>other evidence of the defendant’s whereabouts at the crucial time.</p>

In <em>Statti, </em>defendant was indicted for rape. Not only did the prosecutrix positively identify Statti as her assailant, but she also told of how she bit his finger during their struggle. In charging the jury, the trial judge carefully warned that “ ‘if there is blood of the same type as the blood of the defendant found about the person and garments of Mrs. Savicky [the prosecutrix],, you are not to conclude in the same fashion that that means it was of necessity the defendant’s blood. <em>It is merely a circumstance given to you in corroboration of the testimony of Mrs. Saviclcy.’ </em>” <a href="/pa-super/166/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="166 Pa.

Even the other bits of circumstantial evidence presented go only to <em>motive </em>and <em>ability </em>to commit the crime. This evidence in no manner indicates that Mussoline was in fact hear the scrap yard on the night of the explosion. Any inference of <em>that </em>fact must come solely from the blood spots and appellant’s lacerated arm. Since mere guess and conjecture would have to underpin such an inference, the evidence of blood-type cannot be deemed legally relevant to this case.</p>

Thus, the evidence was used to impeach the defendant’s testimony rather than to place him at the scene of the crime.

In this case the prosecution’s evidence consisted of the following: (1) testimony by a bartender that he had seen decedent with defendant on the night of the rape (victim died after the assault and the charge was increased to murder); (2) testp mony of a deputy sheriff and a doctor to whom decedent had recited her entire ordeal; (3) similarity of blood type between decedent’s blood and that found in defendant’s car.

Although evidence of a man’s drinking, for example, may be in one sense “relevant” to the issue of whether he was able to operate his car safely—relevant because it does indeed make the likelihood of his drunken driving greater than that likelihood would be without such evidence, nevertheless, the law presumes this evidence legally irrelevant without some additional corroboration. This is so because the inquiry into truth is only slightly advanced by such evidence, if advanced at all, while the attendant prejudice spawned by the testimony rises markedly. Such, we believe, is the case when a jury is permitted to hear expert testimony on blood typing which is really nothing more, in the present case, than proof that somebody bled near the scene of the crime and that this defendant, along with 30 percent of the entire population, might have been such person. There has not been presented here one shred of evidence that the person responsible for dynamiting Gaudiano’s yard actually lost blood during the process.

Despite this well settled principle, the majority opinion discusses an issue which was never raised in the court below, apparently not raised in the Superior Court, never mentioned or alluded to in appellant’s petition for an allowance of appeal to our Court, and only raises its head for the first time in appellant’s brief in a rather cursory, superficial treatment of the problem. After carefully perusing the entire record before us, I am <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>firmly convinced that the sole objection raised by appellant to the admissibility of the blood test evidence was that its admission violated the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act, May 4, 1939, P. L. 42, 28 P.S. §91b, which permits certain business records to be admitted in evidence under appropriate safeguards as an exception to the hearsay rule of evidence. Moreover, we granted the appeal in this case solely because of the apparent state of confusion with respect to the proper application of the Business Records Act. Needless to say, the confusion will continue to exist since the majority steadfastly avoids deciding the case on the only issue properly subject to our review. Not only does the majority opinion decide an issue not subject to our review and not fully or adequately briefed by either appellant or the Commonwealth but, in addition, compounds the error by reaching an erroneous conclusion on a question (the blood, test) which in no way affects the majority’s ultimate outcome of the case, i.e., the granting of- a motion in arrest of judgment.</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[214,1504,1159,877]],["BL_499.1",499,[176,386,1158,656]]]'>While I agree with the majority that a motion in arrest of judgment would -normally be proper under the facts and circumstances of this case, I must hasten to add that we are powerless to grant such relief.. Although appellant did argue the motion in arrest of judgment in the court below, the record filed with our Court indicates that the motion was- apparently not pursued in the Superior Court, never argued in the petition for allowance of an appeal, and never seriously contended in the briefs or at argument before us. The majority in granting the motion in arrest of judgment apparently relies upon the statement of questions involved in appellant’s brief as a sufficient indication that the motion in arrest of judgment had not in fact been abandoned. It will suffice to quote verbatim appellant’s statement of the questions involved: <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>“Did ithe Court below err in refusing Appellant’s Motion in Arrest of Judgment and Motion for a New Trial: (1) in admitting a hospital record under the Uniform Business Becords as Evidence Statute where neither identity, mode of preparation, or qualifications of the person making the entry had been established; (2) in admitting a hospital record for the purpose of circumstantially proving Appellant’s presence at the scene of the crime; and (3) in admitting a hospital record showing the blood type of the Appellant, in order to determine whether blood found near the scene of the crime was in fact that of the Appellant.”</p>
    <p id="b499-3" data-blocks='[["BL_499.4",499,[165,1054,1164,931]],["BL_500.1",500,[243,398,1152,209]]]'>It is readily apparent from reading appellant’s own statement of the issues presented that the only aspect of the trial being challenged on appeal is the various alleged errors committed by the court below with respect to the admissibility of the blood tests. Moreover, the summary section in appellant’s brief only requests our Court to grant a new trial<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_1" id="ref_footnote_2_1">1</a> and not to reverse the court below with respect to its refusal to grant the motion in arrest of judgment. While the action taken by appellant in not arguing this issue was obviously injudicious on his part, our Court should not, as the majority does, act as a “super advocate” contrary to the myriad of judicial precedents heretofore studiously adhered to by our Court. Consequently, the majority has erred in three respects, namely: (1) discussing the relevance of the blood tests when not properly before our Court; (2) discussing the relevance of <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>the blood tests when a discussion thereof is irrelevant to its ultimate disposition of the case, and (3) the grant of a motion in arrest of judgment when such relief had been abandoned by appellant on appeal.</p>
