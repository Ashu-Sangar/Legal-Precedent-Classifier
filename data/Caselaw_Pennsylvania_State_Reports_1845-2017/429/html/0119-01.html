    <p id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.7",147,[200,1437,1152,975]],["BL_148.1",148,[213,401,1153,1187]]]'>At the original argument of this appeal, another issue was presented. Newfoundland challenged the propriety of the entry of the default judgment on the ground that, if service of process had been made under the terms of the Unauthorized Insurers Process Act, supra, §2b, then this judgment was prematurely entered since, under that statute a judgment could not be taken until 30 days had elapsed after service of the complaint whereas the instant judgment was entered 23 days after service of the complaint. Responding to this contention, Crown took the position that service had not been effected under the authority of the statute but rather under express authority contained in Newfoundland’s insurance policy which designated the Insurance Commissioner as <em>the agent </em>of Newfoundland and, thus, permitted resort to the ordinary rules for the service of process. Such argument brought Crown’s position into direct conflict with Pa. R.C.P. 2180, which, <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>in the instant factual situation, would require personal service rather than service by registered mail as was made in this case. However, this question of defective service should have been raised by Newfoundland, under Pa. R.C.P. 1017(b) (1) and it was not so raised. On the contrary, Newfoundland not only did not question the jurisdiction over its person by reason'of defective service but it filed an answer on the merits. That jurisdiction' over the person may be waived is clear: <em>Yentzer v. Taylor Wine </em>Co., <a href="/pa/409/0338-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="409 Pa. 338" data-case-ids="1883220" data-case-paths="/pa/409/0338-01">409 Pa. 338</a>, 342, <a href="/citations/?q=188%20A.2d%20396" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="188 A.2d 396">188 A. 2d 396</a> (1962) and authorities therein cited. Under Pa. R.C.P. 1032, Newfoundland’s failure to raise the question of defective- service, by way of preliminary objections, as well as its answer oh the merits waived any defect in the service. Moreover, at the reargument of this appeal, Newfoundland did not urge any defect in- service as a basis for a reversal of the instant order. However, we still must consider whether the service was made under the Unauthorized Insurer’s Process Act, supra, or under the terms of the insurance contract for ■ the purpose of determining whether the judgment was <em>prematurely </em>entered.</p>

A removal statute is subject to strict construction and its provisions must be strictly complied with before the jurisdiction of a state court can be ousted: <em>Kovell v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., </em>(N.D. Ohio), <a href="/f-supp/129/0906-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="129 F.

Both the statutory language and ease law indicate that, until <em>prompt </em>notice is given and a copy of the removal petition <em>promptly </em>filed with the clerk of the state court, the state court retains its jurisdiction: <em>Donlan v.

It follows therefore that in the interim between the filing of the petition and bond by the defendant in the federal court, and the giving of notice to the plaintiff and the filing of a copy of the petition with the clerk of the state court, the plaintiff would be free to proceed with the action in the state court. He would in no sense be stayed.” (p. 600). In <em>Beleos, </em>supra, it was held that the requirements of filing of petitions for removal with the clerk of the state court and the giving of notice to the adverse party were not “modal” or “formal” but mandatory conditions precedent to the termination of state court jurisdiction. The district court said “Subsection (e) is designed so that a State Court and a Federal Court cannot both have jurisdiction of the same case at the same time. Until the State Court loses jurisdiction, the Federal Court cannot acquire it.” (p. 628).</p>

That statute, providing a method of substituted service of process upon insurers who are not authorized to do business within the Commonwealth, permits service of process upon an unauthorized insurer by leaving with the Insurance Commissioner or his deputy two copies of the process and the payment of a fee; that the Insurance Commissioner forthwith shall mail, by registered mail, a copy of the process to the unauthorized insurer; that, within 10 days thereafter, notice of such service upon the Insurance Commissioner and a copy of the process shall be sent by registered mail by the plaintiff or counsel to the unauthorized insurer; that the plaintiff or counsel shall file an affidavit of compliance with the statutory provision plus the unauthorized insurer’s return receipt, on or before the date the unauthorized insurer is required to appear in court, with the prothonotary of the court in which the action is pending (§2(b)).

    <p id="b154-16" data-blocks='[["BL_154.17",154,[247,1333,1148,643]]]'>On the state of these docket entries it appears obvious that a judgment had been entered. It is difficult to understand how Newfoundland was not aware of the entry of judgment until January 25, 1965 when it learned of the issuance of a writ of execution. There is no allegation the records had been altered or subjected to tampering and we must presume the Prothonotary in the docketing and preservation of these records performed his duties as a public official. Any layman, let alone' a lawyer, who examined these docket entries after June 25, 1964 would have been put on warning, at the very least, a judgment had been entered.</p>

Despite its allegation that the docket entries caused “confusion”, Newfoundland made no effort in the court below to have this “confusion” dispelled. In fact, it was not until the appeal to our Court that this issue was raised; not having been raised in the court below we must follow our salutary rule which precludes the consideration of any issue belatedly raised at the appellate level for the first time.</p>
    <p id="b155-4" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[168,1436,1150,692]]]'>Newfoundland, by a petition to strike off and a petition to open, have challenged this default judgment. Neither has merit. As to the former petition, the instant record reveals no such infirmity as would justify expunging this judgment from the record. As to the latter petition, we have a classic example of “too little too late”. The petition to open this judgment, filed seven months after the entry of the judgment, offers no reason for the delay in seeking to open this judgment and makes no attempt to indicate that it has a meritorious defense to the claim; under such circumstances the court below properly refused to open the judgment.</p>
