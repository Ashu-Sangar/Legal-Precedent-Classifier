The crime for which defendant was convicted occurred on July 10, 1965. Defendant was arrested on August 20, 1966, and pleaded not guilty to the indictments charging him with the murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter of Dicky Willmore.</p>
    <p id="b26-10" data-blocks='[["BL_26.16",26,[230,1943,1153,488]],["BL_27.1",27,[193,394,1151,269]]]'>The most important contention made by defendant in this appeal is that the trial Judge abused his discretion in refusing to grant defendant’s motion for sequestration of three out of the four Commonwealth witnesses. We note at the outset that two of the witnesses whom defendant requested to be sequestered had testified at a preliminary hearing, as well as at a habeas corpus hearing. The notes of both hearings were available to defendant and his counsel at trial. The <a id="p3" href="#p3" data-label="3" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*3</a>third witness was not present in Court at the time defendant’s motion for sequestration was made, nor was he present during the testimony of the other witnesses. Sequestration was granted by the Court as to the fourth witness, who nevertheless refused to testify at the trial.</p>

Kravitz, </em><a href="/pa/400/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="400 Pa. 198" data-case-ids="1292477" data-case-paths="/pa/400/0198-01">400 Pa. 198</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=161%20A.2d%20861" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="161 A.2d 861">161 A. 2d 861</a>, in discussing the question of sequestration, we said (pages 217-218): “In nearly every criminal.and civil case, one side or the other would like to have some or all of the witnesses of his opponent sequestered. The lack of adequate room space, the long delays which would inevitably be caused by sequestration and other practical considerations, make sequestration of witnesses ordinarily impractical or inadvisable, except in unusual circumstances.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> For the foregoing reasons the question of sequestration of witnesses is left largely to the discretion of the trial Judge and his decision thereon will be reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.”</p>
    <p id="b27-5" data-blocks='[["BL_27.6",27,[181,1463,1155,492]]]'>Moreover, the record indicates that the proposed witnesses to be sequestered did not “mold” or “shape” their testimony to coincide with that of the witness preceding them, nor indeed was there, as defendant contends, repetitive or harmonious testimony elicited from the various witnesses. There is not the slightest merit in appellant’s contention of an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial Judge in refusing to allow the sequestration of the aforesaid witnesses.</p>

Defendant argues that the statement was <a id="p4" href="#p4" data-label="4" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*4</a>prejudicial and reversible because the jury could take it to mean that the Judge was expressing his own opinion as to defendant’s guilt. While we do not agree with defendant’s interpretation of this charge, we once again call to the attention of the Bar and the trial Courts that the trial Judges have the right and power to comment on the guilt of the defendant so long as the jury is clearly told that the opinion of the trial Judge was not binding upon it, and that the Court left that determination entirely to the jury. <em>Commonwealth v.

    <p id="b29-3" data-blocks='[["BL_29.4",29,[194,1070,1157,714]]]'>I must dissent, however, on an issue not discussed in the majority opinion. The appellant contends that it was error for the trial judge to remove from the range of verdicts the jury might return the verdict of involuntary manslaughter. We have recently held that a defendant is entitled to a charge on voluntary manslaughter where there is <em>some </em>evidence which could support such a verdict. <em>Commonwealth v. Pavillard, </em><a href="/pa/421/0571-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="421 Pa. 571" data-case-ids="1900334" data-case-paths="/pa/421/0571-01">421 Pa. 571</a>, 576, <a href="/citations/?q=220%20A.2d%20807" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="220 A.2d 807">220 A. 2d 807</a>, 810 (1966). I believe that a like rule should apply to the question of whether defendant was entitled to an involuntary manslaughter instruction when indicted and tried for such a charge.</p>

He stated that he was accosted by six or seven men who attempted to rob him and that, while in flight, he turned and fired several shots into the group. Involuntary manslaugh<a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>ter consists, inter alia, of the doing of an act not strictly unlawful in itself but which is done in an unlawful manner and without due caution. See <em>Commonwealth v. Aurick, </em><a href="/pa/342/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="342 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1206992" data-case-paths="/pa/342/0282-01">342 Pa. 282</a>, 288, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.2d%20920" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="19 A.2d 920">19 A. 2d 920</a>, 923 (1941). In fact, the reckless discharge of a gun into a crowd is a classic example of involuntary manslaughter. See <em>Commonwealth v. Micuso, </em><a href="/pa/273/0474-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="273 Pa. 474" data-case-ids="1070794" data-case-paths="/pa/273/0474-01">273 Pa. 474</a>, 478, <a href="/citations/?q=117%20A.%20211" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="117 A. 211">117 Atl. 211</a>, 213 (1922). The jury could have concluded that at the time appellant fired he was no longer in danger of his life and that his act was therefore reckless. I thus conclude that there was some evidence of involuntary manslaughter and that it was error to take this offense from the jury.</p>
    <p id="b30-4" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[238,1129,1152,820]]]'>The Commonwealth argues that involuntary manslaughter, a misdemeanor, is not a permissible verdict under a murder indictment and that further it is improper to include both murder and involuntary manslaughter in the same indictment. See <em>Commonwealth v.

I disagree, for Pa. R. Crim. P. 219(a) (effective January 1, 1965) clearly allows joinder of a count of involuntary manslaughter in a murder indictment; in any event, I fail to see the relevancy of this argument.. Appellant was indicted and brought to trial on two indictments—one for murder and one for involuntary manslaughter. Under these circumstances, I believe that if there is evidence to support an involuntary manslaughter verdict, an accused is entitled to an instruction.</p>
