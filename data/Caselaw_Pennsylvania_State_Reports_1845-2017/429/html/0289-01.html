This litigation has its genesis in Wrongful Death and Survival actions brought by appellee against three defendants, none of whom are parties to the present action. On March 26, 1964, the jury returned verdicts of |100,000 in the survival action and $1,418.50 in the wrongful death action against two defendants, one of whom was insured by Erie against liability.</p>

The transcript of testimony and charge of the court were filed July 8, 1964 and on August 3, 1964, additional reasons in support of the motions were filed. Thereafter, the motions were withdrawn or abandoned, and on September 10, 1964, Erie forwarded plaintiff a check in the sum of $20,000, which represented the limit of policy coverage. On September 16, 1964, plaintiff returned the check with a demand for interest on the entire amount of the verdicts and a tender of costs. On October 7, 1964, Erie tendered checks in the amounts of $21,591.91 and $72.25. On October 12, 1964, these checks were returned. Finally, on November 12, 1964 Erie deposited with the prothonotary of the lower court checks in the sums of $21,591.91 and $72.25. Appellee did not enter judgments on the verdicts until April 13, 1965, on which date she also filed a praecipe for writ of execution with attachment and served a copy upon Erie as garnishee.</p>

Erie has appealed.</p>
    <p id="b316-5" data-blocks='[["BL_316.5",316,[239,616,1153,551]]]'>At the outset it must be noted that absent- a situation wherein interest due plus the principal amount of a verdict exceed applicable policy limits of liability, the insurer is liable for any and all interest accruing from the date of the rendition of an adverse verdict to the entry of judgment thereon. In this respect, insurance carriers are subject to the identical liability for interest as any other party defendant who has received an adverse verdict. Act of April 6, 1859, P. L. 381, §1, 12 P.S. §781.</p>
    <p id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[237,1180,1155,485]]]'>However, in the instant case, we are confronted with the issue of determining an insurer’s liability for interest when the interest allegedly due and owing plus the principal amount of the verdict exceed the face amount of the liability coverage under the policy. In these instances only, it is sufficient to say that an insurer is not liable for any interest <em>in excess of the policy Umits of liability </em>unless and to the extent it has contracted with its insured to do otherwise.</p>

We disagree.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.5",317,[169,503,1158,1021]]]'>The policy provides that Erie’s liability for bodily injury caused to one person by the insured shall be limited to $20,000. It further provides that Erie shall pay “all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment. . . .” The instant record discloses that judgment was not entered on the verdicts until April 13, 1965, on which date plaintiff commenced execution proceedings. However, long before entry of judgment, Erie had (1) tendered the policy limit, (2) tendered the policy limit plus interest on one-half of the entire amount of the verdicts plus one-half of the costs, and (3) paid into court the latter sums. Since Erie has complied with the terms of the policy and before the entry of judgment “paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which [did] not exceed the limit of the Erie’s liability,” the court below erred in including in its judgment a requirement that Erie pay interest on the entire amount of the verdicts.</p>

This principle is founded upon the doctrine that when an ambiguity exists in a written contract, the ambiguity must be resolved against the party drafting the contract. However, as regards the instant language, there can be no reasonable basis for differing interpretations. The policy in question makes Erie liable for interest on the entire amount of any <em>judgment </em>which accrues after entry thereof. It does not make Erie liable for interest on the entire amount of the <em>verdict </em>which accrues prior to the entry of judgment. <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>There being no ambiguity between verdict and judgment, we are without authority in either law or logic to judicially vary the clear and precise terms of the written contract.

At reargument on this appeal, appellee strenuously urged that the distinction between verdict and judgment, adopted by our Court in its initial opinion, was never raised by Erie at any time during the course of this litigation and hence the issue was not properly before us. In answering appellee’s contention that we are indulging in a form of super-advocacy, it is only necessary to note that we .are charged here with the responsibility of interpreting a written contract. The mere fact that the interpretation which we deem proper and just had never been raised before should not and does not preclude our Court from arriving at a result consonant with recognized principles of law. We have held on many occasions that litigants may not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court by consent or failure to object. By the same token litigants may not prevent a court from applying relevant principles of law when such principles are germane to a proper resolution of the case at hand. Our conclusion that judg<a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>ment and verdict have distinctly different meanings is indicative of the fact that the majority of this Court will not blind itself to what a proper application of the law demands.</p>
    <p id="b319-3" data-blocks='[["BL_319.4",319,[174,602,1153,795]]]'>There remains only the matter of costs. Erie contends that since there are two responsible defendants, only one of whom it insured, it need pay only fifty percent of the compensable costs. That view, of course, is wrong. Pursuant to the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Act of July 19, 1951, P. L. 1130, §§1-8, 12 P.S. §§2080-2089 (Supp. 1965), a party defendant who pays a verdict has a right of contribution from his joint tortfeasors. That act, however, in no way affects the right of a plaintiff to recover the entire amount of the verdict, interest and costs from any one of the joint tortfeasors. Accordingly, Erie must pay the costs in full, which amount may be deducted from the excessive sum already deposited in court.</p>

Admittedly, an insurance carrier by engaging in dilatory tactics after the rendition of an adverse verdict can cause the insured’s obligation to pay interest to increase substantially while its own obligation remains constant. Therefore, whenever an insurance carrier has in bad faith precluded the entry of judgment on a verdict, it will be held accountable for any interest accruing on the verdict notwithstanding such amount far exceeds the liability limits of its insurance policy.</p>

D. &amp; C. 2d 572</a> (C.P. Philadelphia Cty. 1961). In each case the policy provision at issue was identical to that here involved. The <em>Skinner </em>court held that under the clear language of the Act of 1859 the company was liable for interest from the date of the verdict. I agree, for I think it clear that the Act of 1859 makes the words “judgment” and “verdict” synonymous for these purposes. That these words have different meanings in other contexts is here irrelevant.</p>

On April 7, 1961, a jury returned a verdict of $130,000 in favor of the Kellys as compensation for land condemned by the authority. Believing this award to be inadequate, the Kellys moved for a new trial. When their motion was denied, judgment was entered on the verdict of January 8, 1962 and an appeal taken to this Court. On April 17,1962, this Court affirmed the award; the authority tendered payment of $130,000 on May 8, 1962. On appeal the Kellys contended that they were entitled to interest from April 7, 1961, even though it was their action which caused the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>delay in payment. While admitting that this was a difficult issue, this Court agreed with the Kellys: “Appellee [the authority] argues that it has been prevented from satisfying the judgment by appellants’ attempts to set aside the verdict and judgment. Yet during this entire period, <em>without making any tender of the amount admittedly due, </em>appellee has had full use and benefit of the money.” <a href="/pa/411/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="411 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="1886018" data-case-paths="/pa/411/0210-01">411 Pa. at 213</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=191%20A.2d%20393" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="191 A.2d 393">191 A. 2d at 395</a>.

See <em>Underwood v. Buzby, </em><a href="/f-supp/136/0957-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="136 F. Supp. 957" data-case-ids="4265606" data-case-paths="/f-supp/136/0957-01">136 F.

Plaintiff in <em>Underwood </em>obtained a verdict of $60,000 in an automobile negligence case. Defendant was insured only to the extent of $25,000. After the dismissal of defendant’s post-trial motions, defendant’s insurance carrier paid into court $25,000 plus interest on that amount only from the date of verdict to the date of payment. Plaintiff contended that the carrier was bound to pay into court $25,000 plus interest upon the entire verdict, $35,000 of which was not insured. The district court held that the carrier was required to pay interest on the uninsured portion of the verdict from the date of entry of the verdict to the date of payment into court of the proceeds of the policy plus interest. The policy therein involved provided that the company pay “all interest accruing after entry of <em>judgment </em>until the company has paid, tendered or deposited in court such part of such judgment as does not exceed the limit of the company’s liability thereon. . . .” (Emphasis supplied. )</p>

Supp. at 959</a>): “Very little restrictive language would, have been required to limit the liability of the insurer to interest only upon that portion of the judgment covered by its policy if that were the intention of the insurer. The obligation of the company to pay interest on the full amount of the verdict gives realistic protection to the insured. The company is in charge of the litigation and after verdict may conscientiously feel that its insured is not liable and may wish to appeal from an adverse judgment. . . . [Under this reading of the clause] no harm can come to the insured. While the company’s liability remains fixed at the stated limits of the policy, nevertheless, in law, there is a continuing obligation of the insured to pay interest upon the <em>full amount </em>of the verdict. Under the provisions of the policy as written the company absorbs the accruing obligations of its insured during the time the matter is on appeal. Giving the words selected by the insurer their plain meaning, I feel there is no ambiguity and the insurer is liable for interest on the full amount of the verdict to the date of the payment by the insurer into the Begistry of this Court.” (Emphasis in original.)</p>

No standards are provided, to enable the trial court to determine what constitutes “bad faith.” Furthermore, the insured can enforce the “bad faith” standard only through additional litigation the expenses of which may well equal any interest recovered. What the majority has done is absolve the insurance carrier for interest liability where the carrier unilaterally and <a id="p301" href="#p301" data-label="301" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*301</a>for whatever reason, decides that an appeal will be taken.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[171,518,1157,1001]]]'>Perhaps the most incredible aspect of the majority’s holding is that it conflicts with the interpretation advocated by the insurance industry itself. The clause presently under review was inserted into policies for the express reason of assuring the policyholder that the insurance carrier would assume liability for interest on the entire amount of the verdict. See Ramsey, Interest on Judgments Under Liability Insurance Policies, Insurance L.J., No. 414, at pp. 407, 411 (July, 1957) : “The new family combination automobile policy, issued by The National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, now provides with reference to this question that the insurance company is required to pay: ‘. . . all interest on the entire amount of any judgment therein which accrues after entry of the judgment and before the company has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the company’s liability thereon.’</p>

The respective rating committees have agreed that this is contrary to the intent. As a result, the wording with respect to payment of interest in the new Family Automobile Policy has been restated, in order that it be entirely clear that all interest on the entire amount of any judgment, which accrues after entry of the judgment, is payable by the insurer until the insurer has paid or tendered or deposited in court that part of the judgment which does not exceed the limit of the insurer’s liability thereon. All Automobile and General Liability policies will be changed accordingly upon re<a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>vision.

    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[260,521,1151,326]]]'>The Act of 1859 makes it clear beyond question that when one speaks of entry of judgment in Pennsylvania the judgment entered is computed by adding to the verdict the amount of interest owing. Simply, just as <em>“2 </em>plus 2” and “4” are identical, “verdict plus interest” and “judgment” are in Pennsylvania identical.</p>
    <p id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.6",326,[253,858,1158,1000]]]'>The unnatural result achieved by the majority’s reasoning is best illustrated by the following hypothetical example. Defendant’s policy has a maximum, coverage provision of $20,000 and plaintiff recovers a verdict for precisely that amount. The insurance company, <em>in good faith, </em>files a timely new trial motion which is not resolved until one year later when that motion is denied. Under <em>Moore v. Quigley, </em><a href="/citations/?q=402%20Pa.%20638" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="402 Pa. 638">402 Pa. 638</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=168%20A.2d%20334" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="168 A.2d 334">168 A. 2d 334</a> (1981) plaintiff <em>cannot </em>enter judgment on his verdict <em>until </em>the new trial motions have been adjudicated. The defendant, unless he pays to plaintiff an amount of money sufficient to satisfy the verdict, cannot prevent the running of interest and will be liable for interest of $1,200. Yet the plaintiff recovered an amount covered by defendant’s policy. To avoid this result (one mandated by the majority’s opinion), it is obvious that verdict and judgment mean the same thing for purposes of this policy.</p>

It is now conceded by the appellant that their offer of 50% of the interest and 50% of the cost on October 7, 1964 did not equal their full obligation.</p>

So it held that the insurer’s liability for interest terminated at the time of the July, 1956, tender of $50,000. We think that this view gives what is not a legal tender the effect of a legal tender. The question must be appraised in terms of the rights of the insured against the insurer, because by this garnishment proceeding the plaintiff seeks to reach the indebtedness of the insurer to the insured. A valid tender by the debtor must be ‘sufficient to cover all that the creditor then has a right to recover, whether of debt, interest or costs.
