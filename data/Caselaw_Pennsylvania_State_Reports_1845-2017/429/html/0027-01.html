As an aid to the determination of the intent of the parties when they signed the agreement we may consider the surrounding circumstances.

Where a husband, after the signing of an antenuptial agreement, executes a will conferring additional benefits upon his wife the inference is great that he intended these benefits to be above and beyond that which is given by the agreement. However, where a will precedes the agreement, the opposite inference is more natural—the husband intends that the agree<a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>ment will settle in futuro all rights and benefits to which his wife shall be entitled.</p>

In <em>Darrow, </em>decedent in a 1935 holographic will left his estate to his wife. A 1945 separation agreement provided that neither survivor would claim as “heir to the deceased, nor the heirs of either against the heirs of the other by reason of the parties hereto being husband and wife.” This language, said the Superior Court, should not be extended by implication to include a release of the right to receive a legacy under the will. It seems clear that the contract language in Darrow— that neither party would claim as an “heir” by virtue of their marriage—does not approach the breadth of language contained in the antenuptial agreement at issue for here Mrs. Klein agreed that her rights “of whatsoever character” would be fixed by the agreement.</p>

No <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>burials have been made on this lot. Mrs. Klein at her own expense had the decedent interred in a different cemetery; she contends that the burial lot owned by decedent does not constitute an asset of the decedent’s estate but rather passes to his intestate heirs. Her contention finds support in the common law rule that, in the absence of a clause in a will specifically disposing of a cemetery lot, this lot passes to the heirs-at-law and not to the beneficiary of a residuary clause. See Note, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20U.%20Pa.%20L.%20Rev.%20378" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 378">109 U. Pa. L. Rev. 378</a>, 397-98 (1961). However, a 1953 amendment to the 1947 Wills Act, provides: “If in a will no express disposition or other mention is made of a cemetery lot owned by the testator at his decease and <em>wherein he or any member of his family is buried, </em>the ownership of the lot shall not pass from his lawful heirs by a residuary or other general clause of the will but shall descend to his heirs as if he had died intestate.” Act of June 3, 1953, P. L. 278, §1, 20 P.S. §180.14(15) (Supp. 1966). (Emphasis supplied. ) Clearly, appellant is not entitled to the lot by the terms of this statute for neither decedent nor any member of his family is there buried. The issue thus confronting this Court is whether the 1953 'amendment impliedly requires that, where no member of a decedent’s family is buried on a lot owned by decedent, this lot then becomes an estate asset subject to the provisions of a residuary clause. We 'hold that such is the import of this amendment.</p>

The failure to attach any importance to this factor in prior cases is perhaps explainable in light of the fact that the common law apparently made no distinction between lots upon which there were burials <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>and vacant lots, see Note, 109 U. Pa. L. Rev., supra, although the rationale of the common law cases—preservation of the familial interest in burial lots—would seem to call for just such a distinction. Against this background the 1953 amendment was passed. See §51 of the Statutory Construction Act, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 P.S. §551. If the clause “wherein he or any member of his family is buried” is to be given any significance, it must have been intended 'as a limitation on the common law rule which made no distinction as to the presence or absence of burials. Simply, we conclude that the Legislature decided that the f amilial interest in cemetery lots would be sufficiently preserved if only those lots actually containing remains passed as if on intestacy and thus decide that Mrs. Klein is not entitled to the Laureldale lot.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

After an antenuptial agreement had been signed, the husband in <em>Loesch </em>acquired several mortgages in the name of husband and wife as tenants by the entireties. Treating the acquisition of these mortgages as inter vivos gifts to the wife, the Court held that the wife as surviving spouse could take under the agreement and as the surviving entireties tenant. By analogy, a will following an agreement and containing a bequest to the wife could be regarded as the husband’s attempt to give an additional benefit to his wife payable at his death.

Accordingly, appellant points to §14 of the Wills Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, 20 P.S. §180.14(1) : “Every will shall be construed, <em>with reference to the testator’s real and personal estate, </em>to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator.” (Emphasis supplied.) However, neither the reasoning in <em>Willett </em>nor §14 of the Wills Act support appellant's theory for here the issue is what did decedent intend to give his second wife by virtue of the antenuptial agreement and the 1957 codicil. As to the agreement, it needs no citation to support the rule that the relevant time for the ascertainment of decedent’s intent is the date of signing. And our eases also hold that the <em>intention </em>of a testator is to be determined at the time his will was executed not as of his death. See <em>Farmers Trust Co. v.
