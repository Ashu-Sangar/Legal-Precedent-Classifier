Subsections (6) and (7) of Section 2 of the Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053, as amended, 66 P.S. 1102, read in pertinent part as follows: '(6) “Common Carrier by Motor Vehicle” means any common carrier who or which holds out or undertakes the transportation of passengers or property, or both, or any class of passengers or property, between points within this Commonwealth by motor vehicle for compensation . . . but shall not include . . . (d) any person or corporation who or which uses, or furnishes for use, dump trucks for the transportation of ashes, rubbish, excavated and road construction ma<a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>terials.

    <p id="b641-4" data-blocks='[["BL_641.5",641,[191,947,1159,710]]]'>The commission adopts the position that the exemption or exception provided by the Act is limited to the transportation of materials used in the construction of <em>pubEc </em>roads, and then only if the transportation is to the actual site of the public road construction project. We are in agreement with the Superior Court’s rejection of this narrow interpretation. The opinion of the Superior Court correctly decides the question and we observe no proper cause for further amplification. The language of the statute is plain and unambiguous and there is no need to resort to any rules of construction to find a meaning not contained in that language.</p>

Stiely contends that the constitutionality question was not raised below and is, therefore, not properly before us. A reading of the commission’s order, however, shows clearly that one of the reasons for its conclusion was the possibility that any other conclusion would create constitutional problems. We therefore conclude that the question was raised and considered below and requires resolution here.</p>

It contends that an exemption for a restricted class of vehicles for the transportation of a restricted class of materials to a restricted class of projects is constitutionally permissible, if its interpretation of the scope of the exemption is adopted, only because a public purpose, the construction and repair of public roads, is involved. The argument is that the view of the Superior Court, which we adopt, renders the exemption unconstitutional.</p>

The same considerations which make the exemption reasonable with respect to public roads, apply with equal force to all roads.

Private individuals and companies, as well as municipal subdivisions are likely to be dealing with numerous small operators in the transportation of such freight. The General Assembly could, based on experience, reasonably conclude that regulation of carriers of the enumerated items was not necessary to <a id="p619" href="#p619" data-label="619" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*619</a>the integrated transportation system which the Public Utility Code contemplates.

Moreover, an exclusion can exist even without any statutory mention of the excluded subject matter. For example, if a statute recited that a commission shall be created to regulate horse racing, dog tracks would be excluded from regulation even though not mentioned in the statutory language since dog tracks would not fall within the generic class which is subject to regulation. It is clear, however, that appellee does fall within the general class of carriers subject to commission regulation, i.e., those who undertake “the transportation of passengers or property . . . between points within this Commonwealth by motor vehicle for compensation. . . .”: §2 of the Public Utility Law, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053, as amended, 66 P.S. §1102(6) and (7) (Supp. 1966). The phrase “road construction materials” should be classified as an exception to the general regulatory system and therefore the language at issue should be construed against appellee Stiely.</p>

L. 1053, as amended, 66 P.S. §1102(12), defines the term “highway” as á way or place “open to the use of the public as a matter of right.” It concluded that, if the Legislature intended to limit the “road construction materials” exception <em>to </em>public roads, the word “highway” would have been employed. However, the <em>Arnold </em>case expressly equates the words “road” and “highway.” I can thus attach no significance to the legislative failure to employ “highway” when the same result is achieved by the use of “road.”</p>
