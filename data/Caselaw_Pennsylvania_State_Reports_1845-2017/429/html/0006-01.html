Later, Yarnal filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hear<a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>ing Act alleging denial of right to assistance of counsel to prepare, perfect and execute a direct appeal from his conviction, whereupon he was granted leave to take this appeal.</p>

He now claims that since his conviction was for larceny and not robbery, the theft could not be used to find him guilty of murder during the perpetration of a robbery so as to bring the facts within the felony-murder rule. However, the record reveals that the determination of guilt of murder in the first degree was not based on a finding of murder during perpetration of a robbery, but on the facts which established that Yarnal’s killing of Blair was wilful, deliberate and premeditated murder.</p>
    <p id="b32-5" data-blocks='[["BL_32.6",32,[217,1262,1147,755]]]'>The trial court found that “Robert Virgil Yarnal wilfully and deliberately and premeditatedly, shot and killed Walter Blair; this shooting occurred under such circumstances as rendered such killing completely unnecessary.” The court’s opinion pointed out that Yarnal “deliberately took aim and shot the deceased as he was seated therein, under circumstances which were without any justification or excuse.” Thus, the felony-murder rule was not a factor in the deliberation which resulted in the verdict of murder in the first degree, and thus we find it unnecessary to determine whether the felony-murder rule would have been applicable in view of Yarnal’s prior conviction for the theft of Blair’s automobile as “larceny,” and not robbery.</p>

I believe that Yarnal’s statements were sufficient to constitute a request for assistance of counsel.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> Since Yarnal requested counsel, under <em>Escobedo </em>the sheriff was required to procure such assistance before either further questioning or a re-enactment was constitutionally permissible.

Medina, </em><a href="/pa/424/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="424 Pa. 632" data-case-ids="1905003" data-case-paths="/pa/424/0632-01">424 Pa. 632</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=227%20A.2d%20842" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="227 A.2d 842">227 A. 2d 842</a> (1967). That <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>Escobedo was apparently not warned of his right to remain silent and Yarnal was, is, to me, of no moment. To hold otherwise would be the equivalent of stating that when an accused chooses to exercise his right of silence by consulting with an attorney he can be deprived of that right because he has been told he can remain silent. Simply, a request for an attorney is an exercise of the right of silence—to give the requisite warning yet not permit an accused to benefit by the warning is. tantamount to have given no <em>warning at </em>all.</p>

Printed briefs have not been filed. To the best of my knowledge Indiana County has sufficient funds to print briefs (and, in any event, has not filed a petition with this Court to dispense with a printed, brief). I, therefore, fail to understand why Rule 43, requiring printed briefs, has been ignored; nor can I pass without comment the district attorney’s failure to file printed briefs after he had so promised during oral argument.</p>
