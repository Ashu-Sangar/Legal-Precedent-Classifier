Between Thursday, March 11, 1965 and Saturday, March 13, 1965, ten of the fourteen employees of Sand’s Restaurant were either discharged or voluntarily terminated their employment. The Board concluded that five of these employees were discharged under circumstances violative of the Labor Relations Act and thus ordered that they be reinstated with the usual back pay order; the other five, according to the Board, voluntarily terminated their employment. Only the employer appealed the Board’s decision to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. A reversal of the Board’s action was obtained, ■the court holding that the administrative agency’s findings lacked the requisite evidentially support.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> 3 The Board then prosecuted this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b506-4" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[221,1229,1157,764]],["BL_507.1",507,[189,388,1152,144]]]'>At approximately 8:00 a.m., March 11, Sydney Hetelson, president of appellee corporation, received an anonymous telephone call at his home informing him that a number of his employees had signed cards evidencing an intention to unionize. One half-hour later Hetelson telephoned the restaurant; the call was answered by Katherine King, one of the allegedly discharged employees. Hetelson asked Miss King whether she had signed a card and received a negative answer. He then told her that he knew the names of those employees desiring to join a union and that she was to inform the other employees that, if they'had signed a. union card, they would be fired. According to Miss King’s testimony, Hetelson insisted that he would <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>rather go out Of business than permit unionization and that he planned to inform each of his employees of this intention.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.5",507,[178,555,1161,934]]]'>Hetelson arrived at the restaurant at 11:00 a.m. He thereupon spoke to several employees, questioned each as to whether they had signed a union card and told each that, if they were not satisfied with their salaries or working conditions, they could leave, adding that “the door swings both ways.” The record thus amply supports the Board’s finding that the employer, Hetelson, displayed a strong anti-union animus.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The dispositive issue is whether, on this record, the Board could permissibly infer that five of the employees were discharged as a means of discouraging “membership in any labor organization.” There-is, however, one preliminary determination—although it is undisputed that three of the five (Laura Graves, Robert Myers and Viola Stewart) were discharged by Hetelson, the employer insists that Katherine King' and Bernice McKnight voluntarily terminated their employment.</p>

See Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1168, §8, as amended, 43 P.S. §211.8(c). A constructive discharge occurs only where the employer <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>makes working conditions so intolerable that the employee is forced to resign. See, <em>e.g., National Labor Relations Board v. Saxe-Glassman Shoe Corp., </em><a href="/f2d/201/0238-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="201 F.2d 238" data-case-ids="1277336" data-case-paths="/f2d/201/0238-01">201 F. 2d 238</a> (1st Cir. 1953); <em>National Labor Relations Board v.

    <p id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[240,845,1159,1100]]]'>Mrs. McKnight testified that, when she arrived for work on Friday morning, James Burton, the cook, informed her that she had been fired because Hetelson had received a card bearing her name. She refused to leave stating that only Hetelson could terminate her employment. Hetelson, upon his arrival, told Mrs. McKnight that he was informed that she had joined a union. She replied that she did not understand what Hetelson was talking about but that Hetelson had fired other employees yesterday and that Burton had told her that she had been fired. Hetelson made no reply; Mrs. McKnight then said: “Just make up my money and give it to me.” Hetelson complied, his reply consisting of the sole comment that he did not know what he had done to deserve all this. We believe that the Board correctly concluded that Hetelson’s failure to inform Mrs. McKnight that she was not fired and that Burton was not expressing Hetelson’s wish placed him in the position of ratifying Burton’s statement and in effect discharging Mrs. McKnight.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

She was informed by Burton that she was fired and, when Hetelson arrived, she asked for her pay. However, there is nothing in the record to demonstrate that as to Miss King, Hetelson knew of Burton’s statement. Simply, on this record, Miss King anticipated what she believed would be Hetelson’s action; under these circumstances, she was not discharged, and as to Miss King the court below correctly reversed the Board.</p>

Upon judicial review, however, it is the duty <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>of the court to determine whether the findings of the board are supported by the substantial and legally credible evidence required by the statute and whether the conclusions deduced therefrom are reasonable and not capricious. . . . ‘Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.

      <em>Kaufmann </em>makes clear that our relationship to the Board is <em>not </em>identical to our review of an inferior judicial tribunal. As the Supreme Court has long recognized, effect must be given to the expertise of an administrative agency: “An administrative agency with power after hearings to determine on the evidence in adversary proceedings whether violations of statutory commands have occurred may infer within the limits of the inquiry from the proven facts such conclusions as reasonably may be based upon the facts proven. One of the purposes which lead to the creation of such boards is to have decisions based upon evidential facts under the particular statute made by experienced officials with an adequate appreciation of the complexities of the subject which is entrusted to their administration. [Citations omitted.] In these cases we but restated a rule familiar to the law and followed by all fact-finding tribunals—that it is permissible to draw on experience in factual inquiries.”<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Hetelson’s statements can leave little doubt that he was strongly anti-union; three of the employees (Graves, Myers and Stewart) were discharged on March 11, the same day most of the anti-union statements were made and the fourth (McKnight) on the following day; each of the reasons offered by the employer to justify these discharges, see footnote 5, supra, involved conditions which existed well prior to the discharges.

Both Graves and Myers testified that they intended to leave Hetelson’s employ at the end of March. The Board, however, awarded both employees back pay for a period extending beyond the end of March. Back pay awards must be designed to effectuate the policies of the Act. See Act of June 1, 1937, P. L. 1168, §8, as amended, 43 P.S. §211.8(c). For example, a wrongfully discharged employee is bound to use reasonable efforts to find work and, if he does, not do so, wages he could have earned are deducted from his back pay award. See <em>W. T. Grant Company, Inc. v.

See, e.g., <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Great Dane Trailers, Inc., </em><a href="/us/388/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="388 U.S. 26" data-case-ids="6167386" data-case-paths="/us/388/0026-01">388 U.S. 26</a>, <a href="/us/388/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="388 U.S. 26" data-case-ids="6167386" data-case-paths="/us/388/0026-01">87 S. Ct. 1792</a> (1967).' We need not ■treat the applicability of such a doctrine to the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act for the simple reason that this record contains sufficient evidence to demonstrate the existence of an underlying motive to discourage unionization.</p>

        <em> </em>We do not here hold that Burton was an “employer”, i.e., “any person acting, directly or indirectly, in the interest of the employer,” within the definition of that term in the Act. See Act of June 1, 1937, P. <em>L. </em>1168, §3, as amended, 43 P.S. §211.3(c) ; cf. <em>Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Cadman, </em><a href="/pa/370/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="370 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="1234545" data-case-paths="/pa/370/0001-01">370 Pa. 1</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=87%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="87 A.2d 643">87 A. 2d 643</a> (1952). The Board’s finding that Burton had no supervisory authority or authority to fire employees is not disputed. However, we do not believe that Hetelson could stand mute in face of Mrs. McKnight’s statement that Burton told her she was fired without in effect ratifying Burton’s statement.</p>

He stated that Stewart was discharged because she was too attractive and thus caused “too much carrying on” in the kitchen; that Graves was discharged because she was pregnant; and that Myers was discharged because he planned to leave in three weeks and a replacement was now available. Although the employees bear the burden of demonstrating that their discharges were for the purpose of discouraging union activity, the trial examiner may, we believe, reject the employer’s justification for the discharges on the basis of credibility alone.
