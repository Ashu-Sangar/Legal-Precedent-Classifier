The decedent’s mother, as administratrix of the decedent’s estate, and the decedent’s mother and father in their own right, commenced wrongful death and survival actions against appellee, John Deisher, Inc., the rental agent of the owners of the building in which the apartment was situate, and the owners themselves, Nazareno Pomponi and Virginia Pomponi. The defendants-appellees filed preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer. The court below sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint. This appeal followed.</p>

The complaint alleges that on or about January 4, 1966, some 20 months after appellants had gone into occupancy of the premises, the minor decedent consumed pieces of paint which had peeled from the living room woodwork, thereby sustaining injuries which resulted in her death on January 6, 1966. Appellants alleged that appellees were negligent in failing to maintain the premises in proper living condition; failing to inspect the premises adequately to insure the safety of the tenants; failing to notify the tenants of the dangerous substance with which the living room woodwork had been painted; having caused the living room woodwork to be painted with a toxic substance; and failing to remove and remedy the condition of the woodwork, and permitting the paint to become decayed, chipped, and peeling. Reduced to its essentials, the complaint alleges that appellees were negligent in allowing the living room woodwork paint job to deteriorate to the point where paint peeled and fell therefrom; and in using lead base paint, which is poisonous if consumed. <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>We are in agreement with the court below that no cause of action has been stated.</p>

We there said: “(1) In the absence of any provision in the lease, a landlord is under no obligation to repair the leased premises, to see to it that they are fit for rental or to keep the premises in repair: [citing eases] (2) a tenant takes the premises as he finds them and the landlord is not liable for existing defects of which the tenant knows or can ascertain by a reasonable inspection: [citing cases] (3) a landlord out of possession, however, may be liable (a) where he conceals a dangerous condition of which he has knowledge and of which the tenant has no knowledge or cannot be expected to discover and (b) where he knows or should know of a dangerous condition and leases the premises for a purpose involving a ‘public use’ and has reason to believe the tenant will not first correct the condition: [citing cases] . . .” There is nothing in the complaint to indicate that the landlord was under any duty to make repairs. Without such a duty, we have no option but to agree with the court below that “no liability on the part of defendants can be predicated upon their failure to repair the premises or in allowing the paint to peel.”</p>

They contend that the sustaining of the demurrer foreclosed proof on this subject. It must be pointed out that the complaint makes no allegation of any such promise or inducement; nor was any amendment to the complaint offered subsequent to the filing of the <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>preliminary objections.

    <p id="b219-4" data-blocks='[["BL_219.5",219,[171,835,1166,1376]]]'>Appellants’ only possible basis for recovery must arise from the use by appellees of lead base paint. Such use would support liability only if such use constituted the creation of a dangerous condition of which appellees had knowledge and of which appellants had no knowledge. In this connection, appellants cite a New York decision which we, as did the court below, find to be inapposite. The decision in that case was bottomed on the violation of a law requiring the landlord to make repairs. No such situation exists here. Although the situation is tragic, we cannot help but agree that the use of lead base paint in these circumstances cannot constitute actionable negligence. The court below aptly stated: “Plaintiffs have cited no judicial decisions in this jurisdiction or any statute or ordinance which would justify a conclusion that the use of a lead base paint constitutes negligence. ... In the absence of compelling authority we cannot find that the use of lead base paint constitutes negligence, as we take judicial notice that the use of such paint is common and widespread.” Were we to conclude otherwise, we would be required to ascribe to appellees a knowledge and expertise not ascribable, at least at the time of this incident, to people without special training or experience.</p>

    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.8",220,[237,678,1153,822]]]'>In its opinion sustaining defendant’s preliminary objections, the lower court frankly admits that a valid cause of action would exist if the use of lead based paint “constituted a latent dangerous condition of which defendants had or should have had knowledge and plaintiffs did not.” See <em>Lopez v. Gukenback, </em><a href="/pa/391/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="391 Pa. 359" data-case-ids="1276897" data-case-paths="/pa/391/0359-01">391 Pa. 359</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=137%20A.2d%20771" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="137 A.2d 771">137 A. 2d 771</a> (1958); Restatement 2d, Torts, §358(1). This language is then echoed by the majority of this Court which recites that liability would exist if the use of the paint “constituted the creation of a dangerous condition of which appellees had knowledge and of which appellants had no knowledge.” Yet, both opinions conclude that the appellants’ complaint fails to state a cause of action. In my view, this conclusion is belied by the words of the complaint itself.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.9",220,[240,1512,1152,535]]]'>Paragraph 14 of appellants’ complaint alleges the following: “The aforesaid living room <em>woodwork was in a dangerous and unsafe condition as a result of </em>its decayed, chipped and peeling condition and <em>the fact that it had been painted with a poisonous lead base paint; </em>all of which existed for a sufficient length of time so that <em>the defendants knew </em>or by the exercise of ordinary care should have knoAvn <em>that the said conditions were dangerous and unsafe </em>for persons in the area, . . .” (Emphasis supplied.)</p>

      <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>I am therefore unable to understand why this Court concludes that no cause of action has been stated. Surely, we cannot, by this decision, be sanctioning a rule that lead based paint, as a matter of law, is not a dangerous substance. Nor is it conceivable that the majority could believe that, as a matter of law, defendants <em>could not </em>know of this dangerous condition. For even if it could be argued that <em>constructive </em>knowledge cannot exist because lead base paint has been so widely used, this would still not vitiate an allegation of <em>actual </em>knowledge. Indeed, no matter how unknown to the public a dangerous condition may be, so long as the pleader alleges that the condition is in fact dangerous and that the defendant had <em>actual </em>knowledge of this condition, this should be sufficient to withstand preliminary objections based upon an alleged failure to state a cause of action.</p>
    <p id="b221-3" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[171,1323,1152,689]]]'>Since the majority affirms the lower court’s sustaining of preliminary objections, it does not face two remaining issues: Deisher’s status as a party defendant, and the alleged exculpatory clause in the lease. I note, however, that as to Deisher, the complaint alleges that he acted as an agent for an undisclosed principal. It is elementary to the law of agency that such an agent would be just as liable to these appellants as would be the true owner-landlords. See <em>Schelly v. Gribbin, </em><a href="/pa-super/161/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="161 Pa. Super. 20" data-case-ids="461228" data-case-paths="/pa-super/161/0020-01">161 Pa.

If such paragraph is a valid defense,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_2" id="ref_footnote_2_2">2</a> then surely it is incumbent upon the defendants, not the plaintiffs, to so allege in their pleadings.
