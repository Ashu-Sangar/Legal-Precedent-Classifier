The burden of proof really consists of two separate burdens, the burden of production or going forward, and the burden of persuasion. As to the former, the hearing judge stated at the outset: “The allegation is made by the defendant that the statement was not made voluntarily by him, and so it seems to me that proof or evidence in his behalf should be presented.” We are of the opinion that the hearing judge incorrectly placed the burden of production. <em>Jackson v. Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">378 U.S. 368</a>, <a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">84 S. Ct. 1774</a> (1964) is relevant. The United States Supreme Court did not require an entire new trial because it felt that the hearing before a judge could satisfactorily take its place. In any trial today where a confession is sought to be introduced, the prosecution must show that it is voluntary. The Supreme Court was merely allowing the parties to conserve time by holding a hearing rather than an entire trial, and it should be clear that the burden of production should not be dependent upon the type of procedure employed.</p>

Although there is some slight discovery advantage in being able to follow the other side’s evidence, this is insignificant at a <em>Jaclcson-Denno </em>hearing where the issue of voluntariness has previously been fully litigated at trial. The primary significance of the burden of production is to end the inquiry when the party with the burden can present no evidence. This rarely, if ever, occurs at <em>Jaclcson-Denno </em>hearings, where both sides can usually come forward with an account of the circumstances under which the confession was given.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Such ivas the case here. The situation where the allocation of the production burden is decisive is the virtually inconceivable one in which neither party presents evidence.

Appellant urges that the trial judge, or the hearing judge in a post-conviction case, must find the confession voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt, citing <em>United States v.

Denno, </em><a href="/us/378/0368-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="378 U.S. 368" data-case-ids="6166505" data-case-paths="/us/378/0368-01">supra.</a> The court was there faced with the New York procedure under which the trial judge, making a preliminary ex-<a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>animation as to the voluntariness of a confession offered by the prosecution, excludes it if in no circumstances the confession can be deemed voluntary, but leaves to the jury the ultimate determination of its voluntary character as well as its truthfulness, if the evidence presents a fair question as to its voluntariness. The Court, by a 5-4 decision, overruled <em>Stein v. New York, </em><a href="/us/346/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="346 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="6930835" data-case-paths="/us/346/0156-01">346 U.S. 156</a>, <a href="/us/346/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="346 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="6930835" data-case-paths="/us/346/0156-01">73 S. Ct. 1077</a> (1953), and held that the New York procedure violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is important that we recognize the vice of the New York procedure. This vice was “the danger that matters pertaining to .the defendant’s guilt will infect the jury’s findings of fact bearing upon voluntariness, as well as its conclusion upon that issue.” <em>Jackson, </em>supra, at 383. This would not have been a vice at all if the premise underlying <em>Stein </em>had been accepted.by the <em>Jaehson </em>court. <em>Stein’s </em>premise was that “the exclusion of involuntary confessions is constitutionally required solely because of the. inherent untrustworthiness of a coerced confession. It followed from this premise that a reliable or true confession need not be rejected as involuntary. . . .” <em>Jackson, </em>supra, at 383. The <em>Stein </em>view was rejected utterly by Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s dissent in that case: “This issue must be decided without regard to the confirmation of details in the confession by reliable other evidence. The determination must not be influenced by an irrelevant feeling of certitude that the accused is guilty of the crime to which he confessed.” <a href="/us/346/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="346 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="6930835" data-case-paths="/us/346/0156-01">346 U.S. at 200</a>. The <em>Jaehson </em>court, at 384, characterized the underpinning of <em>Stein </em>as “a short-lived departure from prior views of the Court,” and went on to describe the real rationale for the exclusion of involuntary confessions: “It is now inescapably clear that the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the use of involuntary confessions not only because of the probable unreliability of confessions that are obtained in a manner <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>deemed coercive, but also because of the ‘strongly felt attitude of our society that important human values are sacrificed where an agency of the government, in the course of securing a conviction, wrings a confession out of an accused against his will,’ Blackburn v. Alabama, <a href="/us/361/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="361 U.S. 199" data-case-ids="6167093" data-case-paths="/us/361/0199-01">361 U.S. 199</a>, 206-207 [<a href="/us/361/0199-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="361 U.S. 199" data-case-ids="6167093" data-case-paths="/us/361/0199-01">80 S. Ct. 274</a>, 280], and because of ‘the deep-rooted feeling that the police must obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual criminals themselves.’ Spano v. New York, <a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="360 U.S. 315" data-case-ids="8889" data-case-paths="/us/360/0315-01">360 U.S. 315</a>, 320-321.” Thus, the New York procedure of submitting any disputed issue of voluntariness to the jury was defective because it elided a proper determination of voluntariness. Yet that, according to <em>Jackson, </em>was important not because of the danger that an innocent man would be convicted. The confession might well bé true, though involuntary, and a jury could so find. But such a decision would have demolished the prophylactic rule of <em>Blackburn </em>and <em>Spano, </em><a href="/us/360/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="360 U.S. 315" data-case-ids="8889" data-case-paths="/us/360/0315-01">supra,</a> where confessions were excluded to prevent further coercion of confessions by police.</p>
    <p id="b170-4" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[245,1611,1148,636]]]'>When it is recognized that <em>Jackson </em>is primarily concerned with the prevention of improper police conduct, the determination of a standard for the judge’s ruling on voluntariness becomes easier. No policy of the law says that police hands must be slapped unless they act properly beyond a reasonable doubt. The reasonable doubt standard is a derivative of the presumption of innocence. <em>Com. v. Bonomo, </em><a href="/pa/396/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="396 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1284928" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0222-01">396 Pa. 222</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="151 A.2d 441">151 A. 2d 441</a> (1959).

Nowhere in the law—civil or criminal— has it ever been thought that a trial judge, in passing on admissibility of evidence in a jury case, must use the reasonable doubt standard.” We are inclined to believe that the trial judge’s function at a <em>Jackson-Denno </em>hearing is something more than an evidentiary ruling. The judge is making a finding of fact. But we see no reason why that finding requires a reasonable doubt standard. Mr. Justice Black, dissenting in part and concurring in part in <em>Jackson, </em>finds fault with the Court’s decision in failing specifically to say anything about the burden of proving voluntariness. He points out that the New York rule had always put on the State the burden of convincing the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a confession is voluntary, citing <em>Stein, </em><a href="/us/346/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="346 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="6930835" data-case-paths="/us/346/0156-01">supra,</a> <a href="/us/346/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="346 U.S. 156" data-case-ids="6930835" data-case-paths="/us/346/0156-01">346 U.S. at </a>173 and note 17, and <em>People v.

These essential elements are such things as intent and corpus delicti. The voluntariness of a confession is not one of these elements, for it should be obvious that a confession itself is not an essential element of a conviction. It cannot be argued that every <em>fact </em>found by the jury must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.

The first pole is the “recognition that ‘Questioning suspects is indispensable in law enforcement.’ . . . ‘[T]he public interest requires that in<a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>terrogation, and that at a police station, not completely be forbidden, so long as it is conducted fairly, reasonably, within proper limits and with full regard to the rights of those being questioned.’ ” <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">367 U.S. at 578</a>. And of course the other pole is “a cluster of convictions each expressive, in a different manifestation, of the basic notion that the terrible engine of the criminal law is not to be used to overreach individuals who stand helpless against it.” <a href="/us/367/0568-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="367 U.S. 568" data-case-ids="1785545" data-case-paths="/us/367/0568-01">367 U.S. at 581</a>.</p>

Bruno repeatedly told Spano that unless Spano confessed, Bruno’s pregnant wife and Bruno’s three children would be in trouble. Although this last factor was not present in the instant case, the official pressure was at least as great, as must have be'en the fatigue.
