L. (1965) 1580,19 P.S. §1180-1, requesting an evidentiary hearing to determine whether or not appellant intelligently withdrew a prior post-conviction petition requesting a new trial and an arrest of judgment, which was entered after a hearing held to determine the degree of murder of which petitioner was guilty.</p>

A hearing, at which petitioner was represented by privately retained counsel, was held May 31 through June 2, 1966, to determine the degree of murder. On August 9, 1966, after considering all the evidence, the Court found defendant-petitioner guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced him to not less than nine nor more than twenty years. No appropriate motion was filed, and of course no appeal was taken.</p>

The Defendant : Yes, sir. Judge Biester: The Court makes no definitive ruling with respect to that, and we do not think we should be required to at this time. But you do understand that he has also told you that in the event that you are successful and that we do strike this judgment and after-wards determine that a finding of a second-degree murj der was appropriate, that. since the sentence was no longer of record, we would be compelled to impose a sentence again, be it the same or another sentence, you understand this? The Defendant: Yes, sjir, I understand. Judge Biester: And it is the latter part that induces you to .reach the conclusion that you do not wish to pursue this motion, is that correct? The Defendant : That is correct. Judge Biester : Because of the uncertainty as to what that sentence might be in the event that a sentence was again imposed on second-degree murder? The Defendant: That is correct, sir. Judge Biester: Is that correct? The Defendant: That’s correct, sir. Judge Biester: Is there any part of what Mr. Valimont stated which you do not understand? The Defendant: No, sir. Judge Biester: As he made the statement? The Defendant: As he made <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>it.

Joe, the sole thing that is bothering you with regard to this is the matter that the Court, in resentencing, would have before it, the possibility of moving the sentence up from nine to ten on the minimum, is that correct? The Defendant: Yes, sir. Mr. Valimont : - That’s the sole reason for—that’s the determining reason for you wishing to withdraw these motions, is that correct? The Defendant: Yes, sir. Mr. Valimont: You do not want to take that risk? The Defendant: No, sir. Judge Biester: And no one has said to you, either Mr. Valimont or this Court or the District Attorney or anyone else, what the sentence would be in the event another sentence is imposed?
