Although these cases were decided April 5, 1965, more than nine months before oral argument, appellant’s reargument petition urged that he should not be barred from raising the <em>Pointer </em>claim in a second oral argument because the actual trial of the case predated both <em>Pointer </em>and <em>Douglas </em>and furthermore because Cheeks’ initial appeal had been perfected and the briefs printed also prior to <em>Pointer </em>and <em>Douglas. </em>No reason was offered, however, for counsel’s failure to raise the Sixth Amendment claim for the first time <em>at oral argument, </em>or for his failure to request leave to file a supplemental brief at that time.

In an opinion written by Judge John Lord, Jr., the federal district court denied Cheeks’ petition, without a hearing, on the ground that he had not yet exhausted his available state remedies. See <em>United States ex rel. Cheeks v. Prasse, </em><a href="/f-supp/261/0760-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="261 F.

It was held that Cheeks’ <em>Pointer </em>claim had not been finally litigated by virtue of the denied reargument petition, the federal court believing that such a disposition was not equivalent to a decision on the merits. Having been thus invited by the federal court to seek state collateral relief, Cheeks filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act which was in turn denied without an evidentiary hearing by Judge Reed of Philadelphia County Court of Oyer and Terminer. In a brief opinion Judge <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>Heed concluded (1) that the <em>Pointer </em>claim had been finally litigated when reargument was denied; (2) that, in any event, by failing to raise the <em>Pointer </em>claim at his <em>first </em>oral argument before the Supreme Court, Cheeks had waived the right to 'test this claim collaterally; and (3) that, even on the merits, the alleged <em>Pointer </em>violation could not be established. It is from this adjudication that Cheeks has taken the present appeal.</p>
    <p id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[196,845,1152,587]],["BL_118.1",118,[216,403,1145,93]]]'>Before reaching the merits of appellant’s <em>Pointer </em>claim, it is first necessary to decide whether Cheeks had, in fact, lost the right to raise the claim in a Post Conviction Hearing Act proceeding because of some prior conduct by either himself or counsel. Section 4 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, §4, 19 P.S. §1180-4 (Supp. 1966 )<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> establishes two grounds upon which collateral relief may be denied without reaching the merits of petitioner’s claim. Thus, Cheeks will be considered ineligible for relief if his <em>Pointer </em>claim has been either <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>finally litigated or if the right to raise that claim has been waived.</p>
    <p id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.5",118,[217,512,1156,906]]]'>Judges Reed and Lord have already reached contrary conclusions on the issue of whether appellant’s <em>Pointer </em>claim has been finally litigated, their disagreement turning on the proper significance to be accorded the denial of a petition for reargument. Since we believe that such a disposition does not meet the test set out in §4 for final litigation of a matter, we hold that Cheeks’ <em>Pointer </em>claim has not been finally litigated. In order to hold that an issue has been finally litigated because of action taken by- the Supreme Court, §4 requires a showing that “[&gt;t]he Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has ruled <em>on the merits. </em>of the issue.” (Emphasis supplied.) We agree with Judge Lord that the per curiam denial of reargument cannot amount to a disposition “on the merits” of a claim pressed for the first time in the reargument petition itself.</p>

Furthermore, we believe that a proper interpretation of the term “overlooked” in the rule would require a showing that our Court failed to consider some finding of fact or proposition of law relevant to the disposition of an issue <em>actually raised </em>by the parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> It does not mean that reargü<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>ment may be granted simply because one of the parties “overlooked” a relevant issue. Thus, in the present case, since Cheeks’ petition failed to show either that the Court misapprehended or overlooked any point raised in his appeal, the petition was properly denied without ever reaching the merits of the Pointer claim therein asserted. Section 4 clearly requires a disposition on the merits before any issue can be deemed finally litigated in the Supreme Court. Therefore, appellant does not here trip over that hurdle in the Post Conviction Hearing Act.</p>

The overall import of a §4 waiver is that a petitioner may not raise an issue in a Post Conviction Hearing Act proceeding if he has had any previous opportunity to raise the issue, but failed to do so, provided however that this failure was knowing and understanding and that there are no extraordinary circumstances attendant upon the failure to raise. Tracing the route of Cheeks’ journey through our Commonwealth’s courts, we can see two points at which the <em>Pointer </em>claim could have been raised, but was not. These two points are Cheeks’ initial trial, and his direct appeal to our Court. As to the first, his trial, there can be no waiver. Admittedly no <em>Pointer </em>objection was voiced by counsel when the Commonwealth introduced the confessions of appellant’s accomplices; but this failure to object is easily explained by the simple fact that Cheeks’ trial took place in May of 1964, almost a full year before <em>Pointer </em>and <em>Douglas </em>were decided. It would be manifestly unfair to hold appellant to a waiver when this waiver is alleged to have occurred at a time when neither the defendant nor his attorney had any way of knowing that there existed a right to be waived. The Supreme Court of the United States has already expressed this view in <em>O’Connor v. Ohio, </em><a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">385 U.S. 92</a>, <a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">87 </a><a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a><a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">S.

Court? <em>O’Con-nor </em>cannot control here because the appeal was not heard until nine months after <em>Pointer </em>and <em>Douglas </em>became law. This, we believe, is more than enough time for counsel to have become familiar with such a significant development in constitutional law. Nevertheless, there may still exist a justifiable reason for counsel’s silence during argument on the <em>Pointer </em>issue. Cheeks’ attorney may have believed that any attempt to raise the <em>Pointer </em>issue, on appeal would have been rebuffed by our Court under the well established doctrine that matters not raised at trial cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. This would be especially true during appeals that were argued before counsel or this Court had the benefit of <em>O’Connor, </em>a case not decided until November, 1966, almost a year after the <em>Cheeks’ </em>appeal was argued. Nor, 'at the time of Cheeks’ appeal, had this Court decided <em>Commonwealth v. Jefferson, </em><a href="/pa/423/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="423 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="1903093" data-case-paths="/pa/423/0541-01">423 Pa. 541</a>, 546, <a href="/citations/?q=226%20A.2d%20765" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="226 A.2d 765">226 A. 2d 765</a>, 768 (1967), wherein it was <em>strongly </em>implied that the prior nonavailability of newly established rights would excuse apparent waivers. The only significant flaw in this argument, however, is the fact that appellant’s counsel <em>did </em>seek reargument on <em>Pointer </em>grounds, rather than relying solely upon a collateral proceeding to vindicate his client’s rights. Thus, without'more, we might be forced to hold that Cheeks’ <em>Pointer </em>claim has been waived. But, fortunately for appellant, there <em>is </em>more.</p>

Implicit in our decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Snyder, <a href="/pa/427/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="427 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1910414" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0083-01">427 </a></em><a href="/pa/427/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="427 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1910414" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0083-01">Pa. 83</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=233%20A.2d%20530" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="233 A.2d 530">233 A. 2d 530</a> (1967) is the notion that counsel’s actions can never bind his client when these actions are unmotivated by <em>any </em>reasonable, tactical choice. Moreover, we held in <em>Snyder </em>that a valid §4 waiver must amount to a <em>deliberate </em>bypass of available state procedure. Certainly, then, when the available state procedure is ignored by counsel for <em>no </em>apparent reason whatsoever, this cannot be considered “deliberate” on the part of his client. Thus, if counsel’s failure to raise the <em>Pointer </em>claim on appeal resulted merely from his inability to keep abreast of new developments in the law, no waiver should be imputed to Cheeks. Cf. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, <a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">427 </a></em><a href="/pa/427/0599-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="427 Pa. 599" data-case-ids="1910363" data-case-paths="/pa/427/0599-01">Pa. 599</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=235%20A.2d%20349" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="235 A.2d 349">235 A. 2d 349</a> (1967). Left therefore with Cheeks’ <em>personal </em>failure to raise the <em>Pointer </em>claim on appeal as the <em>sole </em>support for a possible waiver, there can certainly be no penalty assessed against appellant. Not only does a criminal defendant himself have little or no say in his appellate strategy, but even if Cheeks had prepared his <em>own </em>appellate brief, the failure of a layman to appreciate the significance of <em>Pointer </em>within nine months of its decision would certainly constitute exceptional circumstances justifying his failure to timely raise the argument. We therefore hold that appellant’s <em>Pointer </em>claim is properly cognizable, on the merits, in this proceeding, and turn therefore to a resolution of it.</p>

The confession implicated Cheeks. A similar confession of William Dyson, implicating appellant, was referred to, although not actually read, by a detective whose testimony was used to rebut that of a certain defense witness. The third confession, given by Joseph Baird, was also used by the Commonwealth. But Baird <em>was </em>called to <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>the stand, and so the use of his confession cannot support appellant’s <em>Pointer </em>claim. As for the confessions of Smith and Dyson (two men who were not present at trial), it is clear that their use <em>would </em>violate the Sixth Amendment right of a defendant to confront his accusers, provided these confessions were in fact used in lieu of the two men themselves, and were introduced as the “testimony” of two witnesses to the crime. However the Commonwealth asserts that these statements were actually introduced <em>as the statements of the de</em>fendant, on the theory that Cheeks’ own confession incorporated the confessions of his three accomplices. We decided in appellant’s direct appeal that his confession was properly introduced. Thus, two issues must be resolved: whether that confession adopts the statements of Smith and Dyson; and if it does so adopt, whether the use of the accomplices’ confessions nevertheless runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment.</p>

In fact, it can be said that the <em>Pointer </em>rule is really one of Constitutional hearsay. Perhaps the main reason, at common law, for the exclusion of most out-of-court statements of declarants offered at trial for the 'truth of the assertions therein contained was that this procedure robbed the litigant of his opportunity to test the accuracy of those statements by cross-examining their makers. So also, did the Court in <em>Pointer </em>note that “a major reason underlying the constitutional confrontation rule is to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him.” 380 U.S. at 406-07, 85 S. Ct. at 1069. This statement, as well as the hearsay evidence rationale, share at least two common, and in the present case extremely persuasive, requirements. In order to fall within either .the <em>Pointer, </em>or the common law hearsay prohibition the out-of-court statement must be both one whose truth •cannot be 'adequately tested and one used in lieu of some witness. The evidence here challenged suffers from neither of these defects. Not only was the truth of both confessions expressly acknowledged by the very man against whom they were used at trial, but also, since Cheeks chose to acknowledge this truth as part of his own admissible confession it cannot b'e said that the accomplices’ statements were used <em>in place of witnesses </em>against the accused. These confessions were “used as part of Cheeks’ own admission of guilt, their contents having been announced to the jury simply to elucidate precisely what it was that appellant himself declared to be accurate accounts of the crime. Cheeks <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>was no more denied the right to cross-examine his accusers than a man could be denied the right to cross-examine himself.</p>

Wigmore declares that “[i]f a party <em>expressly states </em>that a certain piece of testimony given by another person is correct, there can be no question that it becomes his statement by adoption, and is receivable as his admission.” Wigmore, Evidence, §1075 at p. 108 (3d ed. 1940). (Emphasis in original.) Similar language also appears in McCormick, Evidence, §246 at p. 525 (1954): “One may expressly adopt another’s statement as his own. That is an explicit admission like any other and is to be classed as an express admission.” The reasons underlying such statements, reasons in complete harmony with much of the logic in <em>Pointer, </em>are perhaps best stated in an able opinion by Mr. Justice Kephabt (later Chief Justice) written almost thirty years before <em>Pointer </em>was decided. In <em>Commonwealth v. Oreszak, </em><a href="/pa/328/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="328 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="1179688" data-case-paths="/pa/328/0065-01">328 Pa. 65</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=195%20A.%2045" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="195 A. 45">195 Atl. 45</a> (1937), defendant acknowledged the truth of several statements made by his accomplices by signing the statements himself. This Court sustained the admission of the accomplices’ confessions <em>as admissions of the defendant, </em>and in so doing made some significant observations which we quote with approval: “If he [the defendant] is absent when the statement [of his accomplice] or a portion of it is made, it nevertheless becomes his statement if, knowing its contents, he voluntarily assents to it. If at the time the statement is submitted, he contradicts or denies any part of it, to that extent the joint statement, or any implication arising from the denial, is hearsay and cannot be offered against him. Its evidentiary value is limited to the statements admitted by him to be true and those he contributed. . . .</p>
