On February 23, 1960, he was sentenced to imprisonment for an indeterminate term not to exceed six years. At the time of plea and sentence, he was not represented by counsel. He was paroled on May 3, 1962, but shortly thereafter was convicted of an additional larceny and given a new prison sentence. Under the law he was required to serve the unserved balance of the sentence imposed in 1960, before the computation of the new sentence began.</p>

A finding of such a waiver is not to be made lightly. <em>Moore v.

Where the record of the plea proceedings does not affirmatively show that the defendant was offered and declined counsel after appropriate inquiry by the court, the burden of proving an intelligent waiver is on the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. O’Lock v. Rundle, </em>supra.</p>

During the hearing in this action below, the Commonwealth attempted to show an effective waiver of counsel by offering the record of McKee’s signature at the bottom of a printed statement on the bill of indictment, which included, inter alia, “The defendant . . . waives appointment of counsel . . .”, and the testimony of a then assistant district attorney who was present in the courtroom at the critical time.</p>

'The assistant district attorney involved (now a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County), testified that in every case, without exception, it was 'the practice of the trial judge (since deceased) who accepted the plea to ask a defendant if he had counsel and, if he did not, to tell him that the court would appoint counsel for him. A reading of this witness’s testimony clearly demonstrates that he was relating what ordinarily happened and not what actually happened in the present case. Of. <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Favrman v. Gavell, </em>supra. Moreover, this witness specifically admitted that he did not remember the trial judge advising McKee that if he was indigent the court would appoint counsel to assist him free of charge.
