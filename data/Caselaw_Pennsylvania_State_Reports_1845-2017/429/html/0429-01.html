From all outward appearances, the sidewalk, was completely free and clear of any ice or snow, but a portion thereof was covered by leaves. Appellant then proceeded to traverse the pavement and after stepping on the leaves slipped and fell on a patch of ice hidden thereunder.</p>

As Justice Jones pointed out in <em>Rinaldi v. Levine, </em>supra, relied <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>■upon by the court below, “. ; . the law, wisely, does not require that such abutting owner keep the sidewalk free from snow and ice at all times: to hold otherwise would require the impossible in view of climatic conditions . . . these formations are natural phenomena incidental to our climate. ...” It was these practical considerations which led our Court to .adopt ■a rule requiring proof of hills and ridges in order tp charge a property owner and/or municipality with lia-bility. Since it is virtually impossible for a property owner to keep his sidewalk completely free of ice or snow when general slippery conditions exist, and since under these conditions a pedestrian is better prepared to exercise a greater degree of caution when traversing the ice or snow, courts have been reluctant to permit ■recovery without a showing of hills and ridges.</p>
    <p id="b457-4" data-blocks='[["BL_457.5",457,[172,1272,1154,430]]]'>However, where a specific, localized, isolated patch of ice exists, it is comparatively easy for a property owner to take the necessary steps to alleviate the condition, while at the same time considerably more difficult for the pedestrian to avoid it even exercising the utmost care. We therefore conclude that under the facts and circumstances of this case, it was error for the court below to require proof of hills and ridges.</p>
    <p id="b457-5" data-blocks='[["BL_457.6",457,[166,1716,1158,653]],["BL_458.1",458,[235,388,1156,1152]]]'>Notwithstanding the fact that appellant need not demonstrate hills and ridges, she still must prove actionable negligence on the part of appellees in accordance with the criteria laid down in <em>Zieg v. Pittsburgh, </em>supra, including actual or constructive notice of the accumulation of ice or snow. Appellant attempted to prove the required notice in three ways: (1) that one of the appellees walked by the ice one hour before the accident; (2) that it had not snowed or rained for at least five days prior to the accident, and consequently the ice must have covered the pavement for that period of time, and (3) that a depression in the <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>sidewalk existed for at least one year prior to the accident which appellees knew or should have known existed and which would cause a dangerous icy condition to. remain. This latter offer of proof was rejected by the court below on the basis that it interjected a new cause of action after the statute of limitations had expired. While we are of the opinion that sufficient evidence of constructive notice' was established warranting the submission of the case to the jury,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> we, nevertheless, hasten to indicate our disagreement with the lower court as to the admissibility of the evidence demonstrating the depression in the sidewalk. This evidence was introduced not for the purpose of establishing negligence in permitting the depression to remain, but rather for the sole purpose of establishing notice of its existence and the likelihood that appellees knew or should have known that ice could and would accumulate therein. For these reasons, we conclude that the lower court erroneously granted appellees’ motion for a compulsory nonsuit and direct that a new trial be afforded appellant.</p>
