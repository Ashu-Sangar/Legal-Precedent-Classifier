They were admitted to the dwelling without incident by a member of the household. Harris was not there when the officers arrived, but drove up in an automobile about ten minutes later and parked the automobile on the street “almost directly” in front of the Wilson residence. As he entered the house, he was immediately placed under arrest and handcuffed. An officer then asked Harris, “May I search your car?” Harris replied, “yes” and gave the officer the keys,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> but explained that the automobile did not belong to him.

Such a’ search without, a warrant is justified “by the need to seize weapons and other things which might be used to assault an officer or effect an escape, as well as by the need to prevent the destruction of evidence of the crime—things which might easily happen where the weapon- or evidence is on the accused’s person or under his immediate control.” <em>Preston v.

And whether the search is of a house or of a thing under the accused’s immediate control, it must be “reasonable” as to the area searched. However, what may be unreasonable in the search of a house may be reasonable in the case of an automobile, <em>Carroll v. United States, </em>supra. In other words, the questions involving the validity of searches of automobiles and similar objects readily moved cannot sensibly be treated as similar to those arising out of searches of fixed structures like houses, <em>Carroll v.
