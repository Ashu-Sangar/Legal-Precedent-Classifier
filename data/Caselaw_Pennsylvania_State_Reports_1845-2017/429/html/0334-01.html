He and several other lawyers, all plaintiffs in this case, occupied the building in the practice of the law. The National Janitorial Services, Inc., defendant in the case, entered into a contract with the plaintiffs to perform certain services consisting of cleaning offices, emptying waste baskets, emptying ashes from the incinerator and removing trash and ashes.</p>

The defendant contends that the plaintiffs failed to prove any negligence on its part. It is admitted that on the night of May 7, 1963, Lewis McKinney, an employee of the defendant, was on the Duffy premises performing his janitorial services. In the course of this employment he withdrew ashes from the incinerator and placed them into a cardboard box, which he deposited in the basement of the building., The plaintiffs submitted as their thesis during the trial that it was the consignment of the ashes to the inflammable container which ignited the ruinous fire.</p>

Alman, the Hatboro Fire Chief, and Sergeant Kiggins, the State Police Fire Marshal, testified that in their expert opinion, after inspecting the gutted building, the fire had begun in the cardboard box which nestled close to a small table, that the resulting flames burned through the table up to a gas meter, which melted, causing gas to escape, and that all these elements combined in combustion to precipitate a conflagration.</p>
    <p id="b360-5" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[228,1613,1154,704]]]'>It would not be unreasonable to conclude, and evidently the jury did so conclude, that it was the dumping of the ashes into a cardboard box which produced the blaze which worked the destruction of which the plaintiffs complain. But, the defendant contends, the facts do not warrant such a conclusion. It insists that the ashes thrown into the cardboard box were cold, and that the jury could not find otherwise because McKinney testified he had stirred the ashes with his hand. The defendant argues further that since the plaintiffs called McKinney as their witness, they were bound by his testimony,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and that, therefore, the ashes had to be cold.</p>

Their evaluation of what is reasonable and credible is part of their equipment as jurors, and if they conclude that, when McKinney said he had churned the ashes with his fingers to find out if they were cold, he was adding an ice cube of invention to his memory of that hot night, the jurors cannot be accused of capriciously ignoring his testimony. In that respect, the jurors could well have reasoned that no sensible person would dip his hands into what might well have been hot ashes to find out if they were really hot. There are many ways of skinning a cat, the proverb says, and there are many ways of determining if a stove is hot without sitting on it.</p>

The judge, after questioning the offered witness, concluded that he was not qualified to state an authoritative opinion on the facts of the case. The court said, and the record bears out his statement, that Marks had never attended any institute or seminar dealing with fire causation and had attended the scenes of but few fires in his life. The witness may have been an expert in some other field, but, in the proper exercise of his discretion, the trial judge ruled that he was not qualified to express an opinion as an expert in fire causation.</p>

In an effort to establish defendant’s negligence, based upon the doctrine of <em>respondeat </em>superior, plaintiffs produced as their witness defendant’s employee who allegedly committed the tortious act causing the fire.

In essence the employee viewing his entire testimony testified that (1) the ashes were cold and (2) he never put ashes in the cardboard box under the table next to the gas meter, but on the contrary deposited the ashes in a box located near the door of the heater room some ten to twelve feet away from the alleged origin of the fire. Despite this uncontradicted testimony, the court below and the majority of this Court hold that the question of defendant’s liability was for the jury’s determination, a conclusion which has absolutely no foundation in law, logic or reason. The law is quite clear in Pennsylvania with respect to uncontradicted testimony of a witness produced by a party to the action. In <em>Evans v. Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company of </em>Philadelphia, <a href="/pa/322/0547-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="322 Pa. 547" data-case-ids="1167886" data-case-paths="/pa/322/0547-01">322 Pa. 547</a>, 558, <a href="/citations/?q=186%20A.%20133" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="186 A. 133">186 Atl. 133</a> (1936), Justice Dkew speaking for a unanimous Court enunciated the general rule with respect to the uncontradicted testimony of one’s own witness. He remarked: “. . . It is a fundamental doctrine in the common law that ordinarily a party may not, in the absence of surprise or other special circumstance, discredit his own witness or impeach his general credibility. Since a party may not cast doubt upon his witness’s veracity, he will not be heard to claim that the credibility of the witness’s uncontradicted testimony must be tested by a jury. Even where the wit<a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>ness is an adverse party, called as upon cross-examination, the party calling him is concluded by his testimony, if uncontradicted: Readshaw v.

After carefully and thoroughly perusing the record, I am unable to locate a scintilla of evidence contradicting the two essential facts testified to by defendant’s employee. In order to establish liability, it was incumbent upon the plaintiffs to demonstrate that the ashes placed in the cardboard box were indeed hot, since that was the alleged negli-gent act. However, the only evidence in this regard was the employee’s uncontradicted, unrebutted statements that he stirred the ashes and “they were cold.” Since plaintiffs are bound by the uncontradicted testimony of their own witness, it is obvious that the most important aspect of their case could not be established, namely, that defendant’s employee placed hot ashes in a cardboard box. Secondly, the employee testified, without contradiction, that he never deposited any ashes in the cardboard box under the table directly underneath the gas meter. Being bound by this testimony, plaintiffs likewise have failed to establish any nexus between the employee and the origin of the fire since there is absolutely no evidence suggesting <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>that the employee actually put ashes in the particular cardboard box wherein the fire originated.</p>
    <p id="b367-5" data-blocks='[["BL_367.5",367,[175,481,1159,1268]]]'>Moreover, plaintiffs seek to accomplish something which neither reason nor logic will or should permit. Here plaintiffs offer as their own witness defendant’s employee who then testified completely contrary to plaintiffs’ version of what actually transpired. Notwithstanding this uncontradicted testimony, plaintiffs still argue that their case, in any event, should be submitted to the jury since the jury could choose to disbelieve the employee and infer the opposite to be true. Thus, the jury could only find defendant’s employee negligent by inferring from what they thought was false, that the opposite was true. In other words, plaintiffs seek to bottom their entire case on the theory that the jury should be permitted to reject their own witness’ uncontradicted testimony as unworthy of belief and at the same time use the incredible testimony as positive evidence that the negative is true in order to establish the essential facts of negligence on the part of defendant. If the law were to permit a case of this nature to be submitted to the jury on that theory, it certainly would have the deleterious effect of opening the proverbial “Pandora’s box” for almost every negligence case to be submitted to the jury.</p>
