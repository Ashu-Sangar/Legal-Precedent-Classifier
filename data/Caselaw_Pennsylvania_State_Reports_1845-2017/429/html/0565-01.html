It is clear that the release if otherwise valid is just as much a part of the contract as are any of the terms embraced in the longer document signed the same day. In fact, the document containing the terms of the release specifically recites that it is executed “upon signing your [Jones’] contract for the Wilkes-Barre Barons . . . for the 1966-1967 season. . . .” Cf. Restatement, Contracts, §208(a); 4 Williston, Contracts, §581 (3d ed. 1961) (both texts deal with integration of several memoranda sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds).</p>

The release was clearly appended to appellant’s motion to dismiss the preliminary injunction, yet the chancellor’s opinion recites that “there is no evidence concerning this instrument.” In a vain attempt to give content to this statement, appellee, in its brief, maintains that nothing was offered into evidence relative to this release. But this assertion overlooks the simple fact <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>that nothing was offered into evidence <em>at ally </em>for either side, except insofar as the various documents were appended to the pleadings. For this case was decided by the court below solely on the basis of a complaint and subsequent motion to dismiss the preliminary injunction. No testimony was taken, and no evidence formally introduced for either side. Furthermore, since no reply was filed by appellee to appellant’s motion to dismiss the injunction, there is not even a <em>pleading </em>dispute as to the existence of the release. Therefore, if the chancellor’s statement that there is no evidence concerning the release is based upon the fact that the release appeared only. as an exhibit in a pleading, then, we must ask, how could there have been any evidence of the basic contract itself, for that too appeared only as an exhibit to a pleading? For purposes of deciding whether to grant the requested preliminary injunction, we hold that the release was properly before the court, it having never been alleged by either party, nor held by the chancellor, that the exhibit claimed to be a copy of the release was anything other than genuine.</p>

From this the chancellor concluded that the contract was really between Jones and the league, and that therefore Wende, the only signatory other than Jones himself to the release agreement, had no authority to grant Jones permission to “jump leagues.” Support for this holding is allegedly derived from .the constitution and by-laws of the league. But even a cursory examination of these by-laws and the contract reveals that the league is not a party to the Barons-Jones agreement, despite Rudolph’s signature, and fur<a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>tliermore that the league has only the most general supervisory powers over the contractual arrangements of its member clubs and their players. It is true that the parties agree to be bound by all league by-laws, and'that they further agree to submit themselves to the-discipline of league officials; but the actual by-laws cited by the chancellor as compelling the court’s holding fall far short of supporting the proposition that only the league can release Jones from his contract. In fact, the by-laws relied upon by the court below speak merely to the right of the league to take over franchises which have failed financially.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> Although the Wilkes-Barre Barons have “gone under”, and although that franchise was taken over by the league for the last three games of the 1966-67 season, and then sold by the league to appellee, it is undisputed that the release was signed by Wende long before he lost ownership of the Barons. It is a basic postulate of contract law that the league and/or appellee could succeed to ho greater contractual rights over Larry Jones than those to which he and Wende agreed. Finally, one need look no further than the contract itself to see, in the clearest of language, the following:</p>

    <p id="b597-4" data-blocks='[["BL_597.5",597,[196,727,1154,207]]]'>Wende, therefore, had full and complete authority to permit Jones’ withdrawal from the team if this young athlete felt able to better himself in another league.</p>

But what exactly were these subsequent ratifications? On June 15, 1967, in order to receive $345 in back wages, admittedly owing him by the Barons, Jones was required to sign a document presented to him by the league in which, inter alia, Jones warranted that he would honor “the contract now existing between him and the Wilkes-Barre Franchise,” and further that he would not play basketball for anyone except the Barons unless the franchise owners gave him permission. By this agreement, we believe, Jones lost nothing. First, he merely agreed to honor the contract now existing, but this same contract also contained the release. Second, he agreed to play for no other club without receiving permission. Here again, since the new owners could succeed to no greater rights over Jones than those of Wende, this permission must be deemed to have already been given in advance by virtue of the Wende-Jones release, unless, of course, this June 15 document is really a new contract revoking the old one. But this cannot be so for the simple reason that in the same paragraph of the June 15 writing wherein Jones agreed to play for no one else, he did so “during the existence of his <em>present </em>contract with the Wilkes-<a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>Barre franchise owners.” (Emphasis supplied.)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> Thus, <em>new </em>permission need have been given only for a switch of teams within the same league. For as to any “jump” of . leagues, the original release was never suspended.</p>
    <p id="b598-4" data-blocks='[["BL_598.5",598,[230,618,1158,873]]]'>On June 26, 1967, Jones signed the following statement, written in at the bottom of his original contract: “Above contract is accepted by Larry Jones to inure to the benefit of Community Sports, Inc.” Just as we ■discussed in the preceding paragraph, this amounts to nothing more than a ratification of the original contract—a contract embodying the release. Finally, on July 5, 1967, Jones signed an agreement whereby he contracted to pay appellee $1,500 in the event he should sign- a contract with the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association. A part of this document recited that “Larry Jones is presently under contract with Community Sports, Inc.” Although it begins to sound like a worn out record we must again note that such a document merely ratifies the original contract, release and all.</p>
    <p id="b599-3" data-blocks='[["BL_599.4",599,[174,374,1156,1377]]]'>
      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>It is this July 5, 1967 agreement that prompted the chancellor to conclude that Jones himself acknowledged that he could not enforce the original release. But this conclusion can only be reached by grafting onto the principles of equity the notion that “two wrongs <em>do </em>make a right.” Admittedly, by this agreement, Jones bound himself to pay appellee for a release to the Lakers; but how can this be said to vitiate completely a prior, otherwise valid carte blanche release? The simple truth is that Jones did not have to sign this document at all if he wished to play for the Lakers. Of course, having now signed it, a contract under seal, he would be bound to pay $1,500 to appellee if he should join the <em>Los Angeles </em>team.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> But this in no way means that Jones may not still rely upon the original release to sustain his right to play for Denver. Most likely, without legal advice, and faced with the complexities of his contract being shunted about from Wende to the league and then to appellee, Jones may not have realized that he could have left the Barons without paying for this privilege. However, when, a month later, he began negotiating with Denver, Jones was no doubt told by that club that he did not need the specific permission of appellee to leave the Barons. This, we believe, was correct advice.</p>
