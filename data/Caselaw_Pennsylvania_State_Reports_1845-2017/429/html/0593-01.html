In this collateral attack, Stevens asserts that trial counsel was incompetent and that the evidentiary use of four tacit admissions at his trial resulted in a deprivation of due process. The first of these allegations has already been adjudicated adversely to appellant, see <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v.

In a statement to the police, appellant admitted that he and one Maxwell entered the store but insisted that he intended to purchase a soda, that Maxwell fired the fatal shot after a brief struggle (a fact not disputed at trial) and that he had no knowledge whatsoever of either Maxwell’s possession of a pistol or that a robbery was planned. The Commonwealth, to sustain its burden, was thus compelled to connect Stevens with the robbery attempt. This it chose to do <em>solely </em>by the use of four tacit admissions. After Stevens was warned that he had the right to remain silent and that anything he <em>said </em>could be used against him at trial, the prosecuting authorities had his statement stenographically recorded and signed. Immediately thereafter, statements obtained from each of the four other alleged participants in the offense were read seriatim to Stevens. Before these four statements were read, Stevens was told that he could make any corrections he wished but not that, <a id="p596" href="#p596" data-label="596" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*596</a>if he failed to reply, this failure would result in the use at trial of the statements of his four alleged confederates.

See <em>United States ex rel. Staino v. </em>Brierly, <a href="/f2d/387/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="387 F.2d 597" data-case-ids="2091228" data-case-paths="/f2d/387/0597-01">387 F. 2d 597</a> (3d Cir. 1967); <em>United States ex rel.

However, the Court of Appeals did stress two factors in both opinions—the fact that the tacit admissions were vital to the prosecution case<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> and the presence of a warning of the right to remain silent given prior to the reading <a id="p597" href="#p597" data-label="597" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*597</a>of the statements<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>—as indicia of when use of a tacit •admission is fundamentally unfair. Both of these factors are here present. Of the two decisions, <em>Staino </em>is factually almost identical to the circumstances under which Stevens’ tacit admissions were obtained. Staino was twice confronted by statements of alleged coconspirators and each time was warned of his right to remain silent, a procedure which the Third Circuit characterized as “an indefensible sort of entrapment.” <a href="/f2d/387/0597-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="387 F.2d 597" data-case-ids="2091228" data-case-paths="/f2d/387/0597-01">387 F. 2d at 600</a>. Furthermore, that court found significant the fact that Staino’s coconspirators did not testify at trial (nor did any of Stevens’ accomplices) ; this, said the court, created many of the risks inherent when a defendant is denied the right. to confront his accusers. Additionally, the use of the four tacit admissions obtained from Stevens contains an element of unfairness found in neither <em>Smith </em>nor <em>Stamo </em>for it is arguable that in fact appellant did not admit the veracity of these statements. Having just made a statement in which all complicity in the crime had been denied, Stevens may well have believed that this alone operated as a denial of his confederates’ statements and that no action on his part was necessary.</p>

A denial by this Court of appellant’s petition would cause disrespect for the law, create confusion and congestion in our trial courts and impair the finality of our judgments. These very factors caused us in <em>Commonwealth v. Negri, </em>supra, and <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Berkery v. Myers, </em>supra, to adopt a conclusion of the Third Circuit which was at variance with the one advocated by this Court in its prior decisions. They are equally applicable here and we thus conclude that introduction at Stevens’ trial of the tacit admissions is a defect which can be successfully attacked in a collateral proceeding and which requires a new trial.</p>

Perhaps the clearest statement of this view is contained in <em>O’Connor v. </em>Ohio, <a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">385 U.S. 92</a>, <a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">87 S.

However, the Ohio Supreme Court withheld relief based on its belief that O’Connor’s failure to assert the <em>Griffin </em>error during his direct appeal worked a waiver of his right to later assert this defect. The Supreme Court of the United States disagreed and granted the writ, stating (<a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">385 U.S. at 93</a>, <a href="/us/385/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="385 U.S. 92" data-case-ids="11334480" data-case-paths="/us/385/0092-01">87 S.
