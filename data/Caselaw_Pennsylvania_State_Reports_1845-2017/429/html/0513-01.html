To insure that this opportunity be not lost as a whisper in a windstorm, the law has created strict and often formal procedures whereby a potential defendant is notified of each proceeding at which his rights may be affected. Thus, when a court undertakes, on petition of a private citizen, to hold a man in contempt, it is absolutely imperative that the defendant be notified of the pendency of this drastic action, and be apprised of the exact time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether punishment will be meted .out. To hold, therefore, as the majority has done in .the present case, that Dr. Brocker need not have been notified of the September 6, 1966 contempt hearing simply because he must have been aware that he was violating a June 18, 1965 custody order is to ignore both due process of law and reality itself.</p>

That rule remains unchanged. Nor will it suffice to say that the present defendant did not <em>need </em>any notice of the contempt hearing since he must have known that, by failing to return the children at the conclusion of summer vacation, he was violating a custody order issued over a year before. Indeed, this line of reasoning not only reduces itself to the proposition that a defendant need never be given notice of any contempt proceeding, but it also assumes that, in the present case at least, Dr. Brocker must be held to have known that by fail<a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>ing to return the children he was not only violating the decree, hut was also subjecting himself to a contempt citation by so doing.

Certainly, having secured the rule to show cause, Dr. Brocker need not have assumed that he would be in contempt of court by failing to return the children in August; Furthermore, when he realized that the Butler County court was not going to act on his petition in time to decide the matter before the September school term began, Dr. Brocker then commenced an action in an Ohio court on August 25, 1966. In fact, according to appellant’s brief, not contradicted by appellee, ■ he has now been awarded custody of the children by Ohio. Thus, when it is considered that appellant, at the time of the contempt hearing on September 6, had not one, but <em>two </em>court actions pending to obtain custody of the children, it seems a gross deprivation of due process to hold that he was not entitled to formal notice of the- Butler County contempt proceeding simply because he should have known that his actions were a violation of the June decree.</p>

Since Dr. Brocker’s Pennsylvania counsel was from Pittsburgh, he decided to retain a Butler County lawyer to represent his interests in that forum. The record reveals that although Dr. Brocker himself did not appear, nevertheless his Butler counsel not only was present on August 30, 1966, the day the contempt petition was filed, but was also in court on September 2, the return day for the contempt rule. On that day, counsel asked the court to postpone the contempt hearing to September 6 and this request was granted. Later that same day, Butler counsel was permitted to withdraw from the case, but only after he had assured the judge that he <em>had </em>contacted Brocker’s Pittsburgh attorney and told him of the hearing scheduled for September 6. On this appeal, appellant claims that his Pittsburgh counsel was never told this information. However, there is nothing in the record to support this contention except the bare fact that no one appeared on Brocker’s behalf on the sixth. Absent something more than this, I would be loathe to conclude that the Butler attorney falsified information, in open court, before a judge of his own county merely to withdraw from a case. I would therefore hold that Brocker’s Pittsburgh counsel did have notice of the contempt proceeding; since notice of this sort to the lawyer should certainly bind the client, I conclude that Brocker’s rights were not violated at this juncture of the litigation.</p>

In <em>Bishop, </em>the court insisted: “Orders determining the custody of children are temporary in their nature and are <em>always </em>subject to modification to meet changed conditions.” (Emphasis supplied.) Certainly it would seem that a finding if immoral behavior by the child’s mother (as was here alleged) would be more than sufficient to meet our changed conditions test. Thus, under <em>Halvey, </em>Ohio could modify the June 18, 1965 Pennsylvania decree if that forum found that Mrs. Brocker’s behavior had deteriorated to the extent claimed by her ex-husband.</p>

Under Ohio law, a court has jurisdiction to determine custody of a child so long as the child and. one parent are- present in that state when the action is commenced. <em>Reed v.

Since it is-undisputed that on August 25, 1966 the Brocker children were lawfully in Ohio with their father pursuant to the Juné 18, 1965 custody order, Ohio’s jurisdiction cannot be questioned by Pennsylvania; In fact, it would seem that under <em>Halvey, </em>Ohio would have jurisdiction even if the children had been unlawfully <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>taken into that state, for in <em>Halvey </em>itself the children had been secretly taken from Florida to New York without the knowledge or consent of the mother who had just been awarded custody by a Florida court. Yet it was nevertheless held that New York had jurisdiction to modify the Florida decree.</p>
    <p id="b556-4" data-blocks='[["BL_556.5",556,[231,723,1152,719]]]'>The majority lays great stress upon the agreement entered into between Dr. and Mrs. Brocker that Butler County would have continuing jurisdiction over matters concerning custody of the children regardless of their residence. From this the majority concludes that Ohio had no jurisdiction. However, the contract language nowhere recites that Butler County shall have <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction. Bather I believe that a fair reading of this agreement shows that it was made simply to <em>permit </em>a Pennsylvania action where there might not otherwise be jurisdiction. It was not intended to prevent a second state from exercising concurrent jurisdiction.</p>

Only in appellant’s brief is there any statement that this action has proceeded to judgment. It is there recited that Ohio has awarded custody of the children to Dr. Brocker. However, absent any indication in the record below of the resolution of the Ohio proceeding, I would at this time be unwilling to hold that Dr. Brocker is not in contempt of court for his failure to return the children to Pennsylvania. Rather, I believe that the proper resolution of this controversy requires that we leave the contempt citation undisturbed with the understanding that Dr. Brocker may purge himself of contempt by demonstrating to the Butler County court that he has been awarded custody of the children by <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>Ohio, or that he has returned the children to Pennsylvania.</p>

Judge Watkins, speaking for the Superior Court, said: “There are a rash of modern instances where court orders are disobeyed with impunity and- respect for the law and the courts thereby weakened. It seems, therefore, that it is the duty of the appellate courts to see to it that every assistance is extended to the courts of the Commonwealth so that orders are meticulously carried out as otherwise the dignity of the judiciary, the majesty of the law and its enforcement are clearly undermined.” (p. 106).
