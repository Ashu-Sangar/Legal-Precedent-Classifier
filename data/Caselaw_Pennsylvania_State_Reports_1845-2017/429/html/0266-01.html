Thus, the interplay of apportionment factors of a number of states when applied to a corporation’s income may result in state taxation of more than 100% of that income. See <em>Commonwealth v. South Philadelphia Terminal, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/404/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="404 Pa. 293" data-case-ids="1301506" data-case-paths="/pa/404/0293-01">404 Pa. 293</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=171%20A.2d%20758" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="171 A.2d 758">171 A. 2d 758</a> (1961) and <em>Commonwealth v.

If a corporation with an office in state “X” sells its product from that <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>office <em>to </em>a Pennsylvania customer and state “X” allocates receipts from sales on a destination basis, neither Pennsylvania nor state “X” will include the receipts in the numerators of their respective receipts fractions.

Sales made to Pennsylvania customers may well have proved a more desirable allocation to the Commonwealth in this case, but it is not the statutory criterion established by the franchise tax act. The criterion is “office connection”, and the only question to be determined is what is the proper percentage of sales to be allocated on an office connection basis. It may well be, in a given case; that a company sells 100% of its product to Pennsylvania customers and yet allocates no sales receipts to Pennsylvania.

Sales made by the New York company were held to be allocable to Pennsylvania in computing Minds’ tax because the New York premises were not premises maintained by Minds. However, the meaning of this case is made somewhat obscure by several factors: (1) the fact that Minds’ only office was actually in Pennsylvania and (2) the partly confusing situation regarding the sales themselves. Although-the lower court (whose opinion we adopted) went to some lengths to state that the sales in question were those from the New York company to customers and not from Minds to the New York company, the recited facts actually appear to belie this position.</p>

The employees there were all residents of other states and were constantly traveling within the areas outside of Pennsylvania assigned to them. They came to Pennsylvania only once a year to attend a sales meeting. The company’s only office was in Pennsylvania. The court found no outside connection and did find the Pennsylvania connection sufficient to allow their wages to be assigned to Pennsylvania. This decision reflects accurately the concept of connection as used in the statute; just as Bayuk’s outside employees were connected with a Pennsylvania office, so may Pennsylvania resident employees be connected with an outside office.</p>

Conceivably, as stated above, no connection at all may exist. In such a case the wages of Pennsylvania resident and working employees may be assigned to Pennsylvania. But, to illustrate the statutory purpose further, the wages of Ohio resident and working employees may not be allo<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>cated to Pennsylvania just because the statutory language would allow it. In this latter case the statutory purpose forbids it; there would be no measure of corporate activity in Pennsylvania by including the wages of Ohio workers in the numerator of the fraction. It is at such a point that the “residue” concept and the statutory purpose meet.</p>
    <p id="b303-3" data-blocks='[["BL_303.4",303,[175,772,1158,603]]]'>We find no additional problem from use of the word “chiefly” in the statute. The word is one of comparison and is used to force an allocation to one place or another where like things may be compared— i.e., one office or another. Inherent in the use of the word is the presence of a connection with something;1 if there is no connection, there is no need to compare. But, it is not used to permit a comparison between unlike objects—i.e., an outside connection or a Pennsylvania residence. Since the residence is legally irrelevant, the comparison is meaningless.</p>
    <p id="b303-4" data-blocks='[["BL_303.5",303,[169,1389,1158,538]]]'>2. When we turn to the gross receipts allocation fraction, we find basically similar statutory language: “The amount of the taxpayer’s gross receipts from business assignable to this Commonwealth shall be, (1) the amount of its gross receipts for the taxable year except those negotiated or effected in behalf of the taxpayer by agents or agencies chiefly situated at, connected with, or sent out from premises for the transaction of business maintained by the taxpayer outside the Commonwealth. . . .”</p>
    <p id="b303-5" data-blocks='[["BL_303.6",303,[164,1950,1157,436]]]'>The phrases “agents or agencies” has replaced “employees”; otherwise, the same views just set forth regarding the wages and salaries fraction are applicable. If an employee’s wages are allocable outside Pennsylvania because of his connection with an outside office, then the receipts from sales negotiated or effected by that employee are similarly allocable outside of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b304-3" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[224,381,1152,765]]]'>
      <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>Where an “agent” is involved and no allocable wages are present, the same determinations must be made. An independent agent or broker, of course, maybe connected with an office of a taxpayer; if so, the receipts attributable to him are allocable to that office. On the other hand, an independent agent may not be directed or controlled in any way by or from an office of the taxpayer; in such a case, the receipts generated by him may be allocable to Pennsylvania if they thereby reflect corporate activity in Pennsylvania. If, however, they result from activity elsewhere (in or out of the United States), they are not allocable to Pennsylvania simply because of the residue theory of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[224,1167,1154,605]]]'>We have pointed out recently that state taxation cannot reach income or property derived from business activity carried on by a foreign corporation outside a state’s border. <em>Commonwealth v. Rieck Investment Corporation, </em>supra. This principle would be transgressed if Pennsylvania were allowed to increase the measure of its tax by allocating to itself receipts arising from activities of independent brokers located, for example, in Europe simply because the brokers were1 not connected with an office of the taxpayer located outside of Pennsylvania.</p>
    <p id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.6",304,[222,1785,1154,491]]]'>Several “side” issues involving the gross receipts of taxpayer also have been raised. Modern techniques of communication and transportation have transformed business methods sufficiently that traditional concepts of “negotiated or effected” may necessarily be inappropriate to determine all cases. Nevertheless, these two words remain the operative ones of the statute; and they must be applied in light of whatever facts appear in a particular case.</p>
    <p id="b304-6" data-blocks='[["BL_304.7",304,[223,2289,1151,100]],["BL_305.1",305,[182,393,1160,767]]]'>Thus, if the technique of selling presented involves an initial customer contact, a subsequent approval of <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>the customer and placement of him on the seller’s list of customers, and continued placement of orders by the customer directly to a distribution center of the seller, a careful analysis must be made to discern where the significant selling actions occur. The initial contacts between customer and seller may actually involve the negotiation and effectuation of a long-continued series of sales if these contacts actually involve an agreement to buy and sell. Where, however, only a status (e.g., approved customer) is determined, it is clear that no sale is made; and subsequent events must be scrutinized. Somewhere in the relationship of buyer and seller something happens which brings about a sale; when it does, an allocable event occurs.</p>

It is clear that the factual burden is on the party who appeals under §1104 of The Fiscal Code, 72 P.S. §1104. See <em>Commonwealth v. Equitable Gas Co., </em>80 Dauph. 89 (1963). This, however, is not the same as saying that a tax statute must be construed one way or another depending upon who appeals. As pointed out dozens of times, a taxing statute is to be strictly construed; and doubts as to its meaning must' be resolved in favor of the taxpayer. <em>Commonwealth v. Bieeh Investment Corporation, </em>supra. This does not exonerate a taxpayer from its factual burden, however, if it is the appellant.</p>

However, the very purpose for which this case is remanded, i.e., the compilation of findings of fact by the court below, demonstrates that this Court should not engage in an extensive discussion of matters not necessary for the disposition of complex litigation. It is my belief that appellate courts best function when their decisions are linked to the facts of the litigation. In the absence of this factual framework, a court is forced to enunciate abstract principles which may later be regretted when placed in a factual context. Furthermore, what now appears to be an issue in this case might become irrelevant to the final resolution of this case because either the lower court’s factual findings resolve any dispute or the parties themselves decide to abandon a particular contention. This Court would thus have rendered a purely advisory opinion. For this reason I express no view on the various principles of law concerning the “non-procedural” issues in this case as propounded by the majority.</p>
