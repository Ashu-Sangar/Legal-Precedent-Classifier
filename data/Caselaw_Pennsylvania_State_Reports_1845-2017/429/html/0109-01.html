Upon remand, the court below, on its motion or that of counsel, may take additional testimony to ascertain whether the factual posture would sustain a finding that Hoffines, by the conveyance of April 18, 1959, <em>actually intended </em>to defraud the Bank and whether the Bank <em>at that time </em>occupied a creditor status as to Hoffines such as would bring it within the orbit of persons defrauded within the meaning of §7. If counsel or the court do not request the taking of additional testimony, the court below should proceed on the present record to determine the applicability of §7 along the lines indicated.</p>

The note of April 30, 1959 was returned to Hoffines after the note of December 15, 1961 had been executed by Reisinger and endorsed by Hoffines. The complaint in this action avers the making of the April 30, 1959 note and the endorsement thereof by Hoffines and the answer admits such facts and the complaint further avers that, “on said obligation” of Hoffines, judgment had been confessed and execution issued and such averment is admitted. The pleadings do not mention the note of December 15, 1961. If the April 30, 1959 <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>note was returned, bow could judgment be confessed on that note?
