He has only the right of prosecution or defense in the manner prescribed, for the time being, by or for the court in which he sues; and if a statute alters that mode of procedure, he has no other right than to proceed according to the altered mode. The remedy does not alter the contract or the tort; it takes away no vested right.’ Endlieh on Interpretation of Statutes, 285. Another statement of the principle is this: ‘Statutes which are designed to change the mode of judicial procedure, where such change relates to the method of enforcing a right and does not affect the right itself, are construed to apply to causes of action which accrued before enactment as well as to those to accrue thereafter :’ 26 Am. &amp; Eng.

The relationship between Mooney and Weber, while that of independent contractee-contractor, does not alone control the situation. The distribution and sales agreements and the service contract between Mooney and Weber, who was also a member of Mooney’s board of directors, the advertising methods required and provided, the advertising of Mooney’s distributors as “Official Mooney Service Centers”, the entry into Pennsylvania, although sporadic, of Mooney’s vice-president of sales, assistant sales manager and other employees all indicate that Mooney for “pecuniary benefit” did effect an entry into Pennsylvania. In its enactment of §1011C the legislature considerably extended and liberalized the concept of “doing business” and, undoubtedly, the instant factual situation falls within the legislative purview.</p>

To enforce that judgment, a proceeding was instituted in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas in which Mooney challenged the judgment on jurisdictional grounds. Mooney’s motion to bar enforcement of the judgment was denied and judgment was entered for Donnelly. An appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is now pending.
