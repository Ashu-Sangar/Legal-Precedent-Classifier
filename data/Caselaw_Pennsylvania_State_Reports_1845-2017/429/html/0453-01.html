These are: (1) that he was detained 50 days before being given a preliminary hearing; (2) that no warrant was secured for his arrest until he had been in custody for 24 hours; (3) that he was not present at the coroner’s inquest; (4) that he was not permitted to consult a lawyer or his family when arrested; (5) that he was given no constitutional warnings before interrogatioh began; (6) that perjured testimony was employed during his trial; (7) that he was unduly restricted, in the right to cross-examine certain Commonwealth witnesses on their credibility; (8) that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence; and (9) that he was not asked if he had anything to say before sen<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>tence was pronounced.

Suffice it to say that once more Gates has failed to state in what manner these errors prejudiced him. Indeed, apparently no confession was wrung from appellant, for none was introduced at trial; and Gates’ defense was one of alibi. Moreover, these two claims are alleged violations of <em>Escobedo and Miranda </em>respectively. Unfortunately for appellant, his trial pre-dated both of these historic decisions.</p>

That section recites:“No petition may be dismissed for want of particularity unless the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>petitioner is first given an opportunity to clarify bis petition.” However, as this Court views the mandate it applies only in those situations where petitioner alleges a legal conclusion sufficient to entitle him to relief, but fails to allege any facts to support such conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth v. Stokes, </em><a href="/pa/426/0265-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="426 Pa. 265" data-case-ids="1908642" data-case-paths="/pa/426/0265-01">426 Pa. 265</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=232%20A.2d%20193" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="232 A.2d 193">232 A. 2d 193</a> (1967). We there held that a petition alleging a guilty plea had been unlawfully induced could not be dismissed sans hearing unless petitioner was first given the opportunity to clarify his petition' by alleging facts to support his guilty plea claim. - But §7 does not apply where, as in the present case, appellant has failed to allege even a valid legal theory for release. Assuming the <em>truth </em>of his allegations concerning the warrant and the preliminary hearing, these claims cannot, in our view, form the basis for collateral relief once the appellant, represented by counsel, goes to trial without ever complaining of these infirmities in his pretrial proceedings. Section 7 was never intended to provide the. means whereby a petitioner could throw darts at the constitution until he struck the proper legal bulls-eye.</p>
