Thomas Prendergast, Chief of Police of the Borough of Sewickley, testified that on the morning of May 21, 1965 two men reported that their automobiles, parked in the lot of the Sewickley Inn, had been burglarized. According to Prendergast, these two men gave the Sewickley Borough police a list of the items taken which was broadcast to the various police departments in the surrounding area. Some time later a call was received from the Moon Township police that they had two men in custody who had been driving an automobile containing clothing which matched the list earlier broadcast. Prendergast further testified that the owners of the burglarized vehicles subsequently identified the clothing as theirs.</p>

Super. 364" data-case-ids="1056977" data-case-paths="/pa-super/155/0364-01">155 Pa.

One Cans, a police officer, testified that the owner of the allegedly stolen property (Goldsmith) had identified the property as stolen. However, at trial Goldsmith insisted that the goods could have been stolen but that it was equally possible that defendant had purchased the items from either his (Goldsmith’s) or another store. The Superior Court, holding that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the corpus delicti, stated (supra at 369-70, <a href="/citations/?q=38%20A.2d%20486" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="38 A.2d 486">38 A. 2d at 488-89</a>) : “This is not the case of proof solely upon circumstantial evidence which we have frequently upheld, but a clear case of failure of the Commonwealth to prove the ownership of the articles alleged to have been stolen or received. . . . [T]he proof did not establish the allegations of the indictment that the goods were the property of the Supply Company, or who was the real owner.” <em>Commonwealth v. </em>Cohan, <a href="/pa-super/177/0532-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="177 Pa.

Although the owner of the stolen items did not testify, the thief did and stated that he sold these items to defendant. <em>Cohan </em>contains the following explanation of <em>Cold </em>(supra at 539, <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a><a href="/citations/?q=111%20A.2d%20182" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="111 A.2d 182">111 A. 2d at 185-86</a>): “That the property was stolen is an element of the crime which mnst be proven by the Commonwealth. -But the owner is not the only person who can establish it.</p>

    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.6",250,[232,942,1157,1266]],["BL_251.1",251,[182,390,1149,103]]]'>We believe it clear that the present ease falls on the <em>Gold </em>side of the line. The testimony of officers Tyler, Schramm and Pantuso contains not one line in any way indicating the ownership of the allegedly stolen items and the Commonwealth mnst therefore rest solely on the events recited by Chief Prendergast. The bulk of Prendergast’s testimony, however, consisted of inadmissible hearsay, and was objected to as such by appellants’ counsel at trial. Thus, Prendergast’s recitation that he was told by two men that their vehicles were burglarized, that he received a radio message from Moon Township that an automobile had been captured containing clothing and that these two car owners later told him that the recovered clothing was theirs was inadmissible.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Commonwealth’s evidence on the issue of ownership is thus identical with that contained in ■ <em>Gold </em>and consisted of hearsay that a third party told the testifying officer that the items were theirs. Absent any demonstration through admissible evidence that the clothing was stolen, the- corpus delicti was not proven and these convictions must be reversed. However, we may not grant a motion in arrest of judgment on a diminished record, see, e.g., <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>
