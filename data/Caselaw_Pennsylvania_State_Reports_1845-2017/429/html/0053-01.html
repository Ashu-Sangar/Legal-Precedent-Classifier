As Turk entered the vehicle, James Lewis also entered it, intending to rob him. Lewis assaulted Turk severely, causing injuries which resulted in his death. A citizen who came upon the scene as the assault and robbery were in progress saw the appellant Banks standing about 30 feet away from the Turk automobile, “looking back and forth.” As this citizen went to the aid of Turk, Lewis fled and, as he did so, “kind of waved” to Banks. Banks remained on the scene and assisted in aiding the victim. The police arrived at the site shortly afterwards and Banks, upon being asked “if he had seen what happened.” said “no,” but then changed this to “yes.” He was taken to police headquarters, questioned and released.</p>

The three proceeded via police squad car to the Homicide Headquarters of the police department, located about one-half hour traveling time away. Banks readily answered all questions. His statements were exculpatory in nature and he was allowed to leave. During this questioning Banks stated he was employed <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>by a certain business firm in Philadelphia. Through later inquiry, the police learned this was untrue. As a result the two police officers returned to the Banks home at about 2 p.m. on January 4th, “picked up” Banks and drove him in a police car to Homicide Headquarters. Before leaving his home Banks was informed the police desired “to further interview him concerning information he had stated in the first interview.”</p>
    <p id="b81-3" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[194,821,1156,426]]]'>Banks was then questioned at police headquarters for about two hours or from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. He was asked why he made a false statement, about his employment when questioned the day before. He “tried to explain that away” but “finally came out and said he was involved in the robbery of Mr. Turk” as “a lookout” and Lewis was the actual robber and assaulter.</p>

With this confession out of the case, it may be there will not be enough evidence to convict Banks of the brutal crime which he, more than anyone else, knows he committed, because he voluntarily. admitted he committed it. If Banks is not convicted at the new trial, this will be another deplorable case where the courts have, in the face of the clearest evidence of guilt, released a murderer into the streets to prey on innocent Americans, who, under the Declaration of Independence, are entitled to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” and, under the Constitution, should be guaranteed by this Court to “domestic tranquility,” and the “blessings of Liberty”.</p>
