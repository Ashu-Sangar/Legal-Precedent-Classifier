Post-trial motions were dismissed and each defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two to four years on the larceny and receiving convictions. Sentence was suspended on the conspiracy conviction. Young and HolloAvay filed appeals in the Superior Court,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> which affirmed the judgments of sentence on the vote of an equally divided court.

In the course of the trial, a fellow employee testified concerning conversations he had Avith the defendant Adams who told him that he was to share the proceeds of the stolen wire with Young and Hollo-Avay and that they had “double-crossed” him by stealing six instead of four coils. These particular statements of Adams were made in the absence of both Young and Holloway and after these last mentioned defendants had been taken into custody by the police. This evidence was specifically introduced by the district attorney against Adams only.</p>

And while evidence limited to the question of the guilt of one of the conspirators may be admitted at a joint trial even though it refers to or implicates the others, the trial court must clearly instruct the jury as to the limited purpose and effect thereof. <em>Commonwealth v.
