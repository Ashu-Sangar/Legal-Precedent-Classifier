Thereafter, allegedly, Robert and Benjamin Pope, sons of William and Elizabeth Pope, conducted Crescent’s business.

Under his will, the Crescent stock and the business realty were left in trust for appellant provided Naomi Pope failed to survive Robert Pope for a period of 120 days but, in the event of her survival, such assets would pass to Naomi Pope. Naomi Pope survived Robert Pope for a period in excess of 120 days and it is alleged that she advised appellant she was holding all the assets for appellant’s benefit, that she intended to terminate the constructive trust by transferring the assets to appellant while she lived, that she instructed her counsel to prepare the appropriate instruments to effect such a transfer and did furnish, through her counsel, to appellant’s counsel the necessary data for the preparation of an assignment of the stock certificates.</p>

Appellant correctly argues that §301 (3) which gives the Orphans’ Court exclusive jurisdiction over <em>inter vivos </em>trusts does not include a trust created by operation of law, i.e., a resulting or a constructive trust. The statutory definition of an “inter vivos trust” (Orphans’ Court Act of 1951, supra, §102 (6), 20 P.S. §2080.102) expressly and unequivocally excludes “resulting” or “constructive” trusts.

In <em>Johnson, </em>we said, inter alia: ‘If it is [the widow’s] theory, as expressly averred in the complaint, that [decedent] died <em>seized </em>of the real property, then clearly the orphans’ court which has exclusive jurisdiction over the administration and distribution of the real property of the estate of the decedent would be the only appropriate forum: Orphans’ Court Act of 1951, supra, §301 (1).” (p. 35).</p>
