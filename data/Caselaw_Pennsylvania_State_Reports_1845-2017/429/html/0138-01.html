Davis was sentenced to 12% to 30 years; no appeal was taken. In 1965 he filed a habeas corpus petition which was denied (after a hearing had been held) and that denial affirmed by this Court without written opinion. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. Davis v.

As is all too often the case, the trial record contains no examination as to the voluntariness of the plea. See <em>Commonwealth ex rel. West v. Rundle, </em><a href="/pa/428/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="428 Pa. 102" data-case-ids="1912346" data-case-paths="/pa/428/0102-01">428 Pa. 102</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=237%20A.2d%20196" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="237 A.2d 196">237 A. 2d 196</a> (1968). The post-conviction hearing judge made no factual finding as to voluntariness but rather rested his decision upon a finding that Davis’ plea was the product of trial strategy, i.e., a plea bargain<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> was made after which the Commonwealth certified that the offense did not rise higher than second degree murder. We have read the records of Davis’ post-conviction hearing, his federal habeas corpus hearing and his trial (as did the post-conviction court below) and see no reason to disturb the conclusion of the post-conviction hearing court that the guilty plea was not the product of an involuntary confession.
