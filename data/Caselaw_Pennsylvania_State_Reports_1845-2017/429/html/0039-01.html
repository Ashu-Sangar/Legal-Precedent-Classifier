At about 6:38 p.m. a city police sergeant, William G-latfeller, received a phone call in his office informing him of the shooting. He proceeded by police car in the direction of the address where the shooting occurred. While en route he received via radio a description of the person suspected of committing the crime. Shortly thereafter he saw Moody, who fitted the description, at a public street intersection. With the assistance of another policeman who arrived on the scene he took Moody into custody. Moody was immediately told that he was “under arrest.” He was searched, handcuffed and taken to the police station.</p>

When he arrived, Moody was seated in a “cell corridor” behind a locked door. Admittedly he was not free to leave. Allender escorted Moody into Ms office and, after asking him his name, address and <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>employment, inquired “what happened?” Moody unhesitatingly replied, “I shot my wife.” Then Robert E. Sperling, the captain of the city detectives, who also had been summoned from his home, arrived on the scene. After Moody was informed who Sperling was, Sperling asked him what happened. Moody replied, “Mr. Sperling, I’m going to tell you the truth. I shot my wife.” Sperling then interrupted Moody and advised him “that anything he said could be used against him; that he need not say anything and he had a right to remain silent.” Moody replied, “I want to get it off my chest. I want to tell the truth. I shot my wife.”</p>
    <p id="b66-4" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[211,1108,1150,637]]]'>Shortly thereafter Moody was subjected to questions concerning the details of the crime which, together with his answers, were written down in longhand and typewritten. The recorded typewritten statement was then read to Moody and signed by him. Immediately before this particular questioning began, Sperling explained to Moody that he need not make a formal statement, but that if he did so “it would be of his own free will, without any promises, inducements or threats, being fully aware anything he said could be used against him. . . .” It is the admission of this statement in evidence that is assigned as error.</p>

Six or seven officers had broken down the door and followed on Toy’s heels into the bedroom where his wife and child were sleeping. He had been almost immediately handcuffed and arrested. Under such circumstances it is unreasonable to infer that Toy’s response was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.”</p>

Moody had been arrested and handcuffed; he was seated in a “cell corridor” behind a locked door when detective Allender arrived. In custody, faced with two police officers and having twice admitted that he shot his wife, “it is unreasonable to infer that . . .

Westover had been questioned by state authorities for 14 hours without having been given any warnings; he was then given to the FBI at which time he was given the requisite warnings. Holding that the statement procured by the FBI was inadmissible, the Court stated <em>(Miranda v. Arizona, </em><a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">384 U.S. 436</a>, 496, <a href="/us/384/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="384 U.S. 436" data-case-ids="12046400" data-case-paths="/us/384/0436-01">86 S.

But here the FBI in<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>terrogation was conducted immediately following the state interrogation in the same police station—in the same compelling surroundings.” Certainly, there can be no contention here that Moody’s written statement was obtained after he had been removed from “the same compelling surroundings” that produced his oral statements.</p>

In the confession cases, as demonstrated by Bayer, the focus must be upon the psychological pressures facing an accused and the remedy is to insure that the accused has been effectively removed from those pressures before a second statement is obtained. Where an illegal search leads to additional information the focus shifts to the conduct of the police and their exploitation of a prior illegality; except perhaps where the illegal search or arrest produces a confession, the accused’s state of mind is not relevant.</p>

Although there were three eyewitnesses to the homicide, Moody at trial insisted that he could not remember any of the details of the shooting. .This testimony was obviously designed to impress upon the jury that Moody lacked the specific intent to kill which is a requisite for a first degree murder conviction. However, in Moody’s statement he was able to recall the details of the shooting, a fact which the jury may well have believed cast considerable doubt on appellant’s memory lapse. Under these circumstances, I do not believe that the admission of <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>Moody’s confession was “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”</p>

In fact, the very Comment the majority cites, concludes (114 U. Pa. L.

This conforms to the analysis that views the fifth amendment exclusionary rule as stricter than the exclusionary rule which sprang from the fourth amendment. Because it is more strict, the fifth amendment exclusionary rule is likely to have a more inhibiting effect upon law enforcement than the Mapp decision had. This, however, would seem a necessary result in light of the different purposes served by the exclusion of evidence under the fourth and fifth amendments.” See also, George, A New Book At Confessions: Escobedo-The Second Round 117-19 (1967).</p>
