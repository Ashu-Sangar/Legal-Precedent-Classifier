The Board filed an answer to this action of mandamus alleging that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by Bethlehem.

Mr. Justice Cohen, speaking for this Court, said: “It is well established in this Commonwealth that where a statute provides that the action of an administrative agency is final, the only review therefrom is to this Court in-the nature of a narrow certiorari, [citing authorities]. This rule has been applied to action by the Board of Finance and Revenue in refusing a petition for refund of tax. [citing an authority]. In other contexts this rule and remedy has been termed ‘exclusive’. [citing authorities].</p>

However, in <em>Graybill, </em>we recognized that, because of the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>confusion occasioned by our previous tacit approval of mandamus as the vehicle for appellate review, it would be “manifestly unjust to dismiss appellant’s appeal because it pursued its position by mandamus rather than direct appeal.” (p. 74). Despite the impropriety of the mandamus procedure, nevertheless, in <em>Graybill, </em>we did pass upon whether the Board did have jurisdiction to entertain a petition for a refund of taxes in the factual context of <em>Graybill.</em>
