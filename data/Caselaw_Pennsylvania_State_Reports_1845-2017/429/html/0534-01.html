Shortly thereafter, the defendant, aged 16 years, was arrested and committed to Mercer County jail. He submitted to questioning by the arresting officers for several two-hour periods, both on October 6th and 7th. On October 7, defendant was taken to his father’s home and, with his father’s permission, a search was conducted which uncovered a revolver later found to bear evidence of defendant’s fingerprints.</p>

In this appeal,. defendant contends that he was innocent of any crime, and that at the most the killing amounted to voluntary manslaughter. These contentions, and particularly thé latter one, are based upon the theory or contention that defendant spent the night in the home of his uncle and that his uncle was killed the following day as the, result of an altercation during which defendant’s gun went off. We note, incidentally, that defendant did not testify that his gun went off accidentally or unintentionally, or exactly how it went off. This contention was not presented in the lower Court, The only evidence cited to support it in this <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>appeal is the testimony of a witness for the Commonwealth that there was an indentation in the bed in the room of defendant’s uncle roughly conforming to the shape of' a body, which defendant’s counsel now con-, tends was the body shape of defendant. Defendant’s confession, which he now seeks to repudiate- because allegedly made under duress, was to the effect that he entered his uncle’s- house with the intention of stealing checks, and that in the process of obtaining them he had a short struggle with his uncle. He now seeks to combine the statement in his repudiated confession of' his alleged struggle with his uncle with the aforesaid testimony about the <em>impression </em>of a body on the bed ; obviously, there is no connection between these two bits of evidence. Furthermore, this evidence is clearly- and without the slightest doubt insufficient to prove a crime of provocation or passion—namely, voluntary manslaughter.</p>

James related his version of the events surrounding the murder. Asked if this version was true, appellant answered yes. He was then further questioned and an oral statement obtained (no written statement was taken) adding details not covered in James’ statement. Two officers then took Herbert for another automobile ride since appellant had promised during this interrogation period to show the officers where decedent’s wallet had been disposed of. The wallet was located and Herbert returned to the substation at 1:40 p.m. The first formal charge was filed at some time prior to 2:20 p.m., although Judge Rodgers began his attempts to obtain counsel for appellant at about 12:45 p.m.</p>

Moreover, this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary <em>system—that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his </em>interest.” (Emphasis supplied.).
