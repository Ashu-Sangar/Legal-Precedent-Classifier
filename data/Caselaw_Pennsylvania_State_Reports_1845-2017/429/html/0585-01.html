Samuel Hodge and four medical doctors are the sole stockholders of the Me-Dee Company, which in turn owns all the stock of Me-Bee Company. Both corporations were formed for the purpose of erecting, operating and occupying a medical building in which the four doctors would conduct their respective medical practices. Hodge’s exact stake in this venture has never been made completely clear, although it appears that certain tax advantages befell him as a result of his participation.</p>

In his complaint Hodge alleged that he had repeatedly demanded the re-payment of his loans, but that defendants have refused. Hodge thus prayed that the court enter judgment “against defendants Me-Dee Company, Incorporated and Me-Bee Company, Incorporated jointly and severally with interest.” Defendants, in their answer, admitted every allegation in plaintiff’s complaint, but asserted, as new matter, the fact that no payment was yefc due because no net profit had been realized by defendants. On this issue alone the parties went to trial.</p>
    <p id="b611-5" data-blocks='[["BL_611.5",611,[168,1223,1159,871]]]'>Trial was held before a judge sitting without a jury on June 15, 1966. On June 27, 1966 the court entered a verdict for plaintiff Hodge in the amount of $20,528.-71 with interest. Defendants filed exceptions which were subsequently denied by the court en banc on January 26, 1967. Accordingly, Hodge computed the interest due, and on March 2, 1967 assessed damages of $26,346.56. On March 8, 1967 defendants filed their appeal which appears on our docket as No. 1, January Term, 1968. Subsequent to the filing of this appeal, but prior to its perfection, the trial judge issued an order clarifying his original verdict. This order recited that the interest awarded shall run only from the date of trial, i.e., June 27, 1966. From this order plaintiff Hodge has appealed, his action appearing on our docket as No. 19, January Term, 1968.</p>

The actual task of filing this writ with the prothonotary of the lower court falls upon: the party taking the appeal, in this case Me-Bee and Me-Dee. The statute clearly provides that until this writ is filed with the court below, the appeal shall not be considered perfected.

Nevertheless, this Court has held that while the appeal need not be perfected within the three month period "for filing, it must be perfected within a reasonable time thereafter, or else be quashed. In the present case, a period of almost six months elapsed between the last day for filing this appeal, April 26, 1967, and the. date on which the appeal was perfected, October 4, 1967. Even under our most liberal cases, this delay is far too long to be considered reasonable.</p>

Appellant maintains first that, as a matter of law, interest <em>must </em>run from the date on which Hodge first advanced the money to appellees since this was constructively admitted by Me-Bee and Me-Dee in their pleadings. It is also argued that we must invalidate the order because it was allegedly entered ex parte, without proper notice or <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>opportunity to be heard being given to appellant.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> Neither of these contentions do we find persuasive.</p>

Appellees take no issue with this general proposition. <em>Stocker v. </em>Hutter, <a href="/pa/134/0019-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="134 Pa. 19" data-case-ids="814888" data-case-paths="/pa/134/0019-01">134 Pa. 19</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20A.%20427" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="19 A. 427">19 Atl. 427</a> <em>(1890); Nicolazzo </em>Estate, <a href="/pa/414/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="414 Pa. 186" data-case-ids="1890423" data-case-paths="/pa/414/0186-01">414 Pa. 186</a>, 187 n.1, <a href="/citations/?q=199%20A.2d%20455" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="199 A.2d 455">199 A. 2d 455</a>, 456 n.1 (1964) (dictum). At this point, however, appellant’s house of cards collapses. He asserts that because the complaint alleges the existence of a loan and the answer explicitly admits this fact, given the presumption that loans bear interest it follows that an admission of the existence of a <em>loan </em>is also a judicial admission that interest is owing. The fallacy in this argument, unfortunately, abides in the notion that by admitting a fact from which flows a presumption the pleader waives his right to rebut this presumption.</p>

Since the court below properly held that no interest ran on this loan until the trial ended, all that remains is to pass on appellant’s contention that the March 17 order was improperly entered.

In that letter, the judge stated:' “For your information, the proceedings before me were not ex parte in any sense of the word. This Court has full confidence in our members and I was informed by Mr. William C. Beatty [local counsel for appellee] that Edward M.
