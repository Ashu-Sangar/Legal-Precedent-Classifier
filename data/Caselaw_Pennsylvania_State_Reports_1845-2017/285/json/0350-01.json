        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Kephart,\nAppellant sued to recover for injuries sustained by her son Joseph M. Gallagher caused by a collision between a bicycle on which he was riding and appellee\u2019s automobile, on a road from Atlantic City.\nThe primary issue of the action was appellee\u2019s negligence and whether it was the sole cause of the injury, unaided by any neglect on the part of the boy. These questions, submitted to the jury, were determined in appellee\u2019s favor. All other questions based on causal liability, since they are the direct result thereof, disappear and are of no consequence to the litigation when the primary issue is held not to exist. Examples of such secondary matters are, the injury to the physical structure, pain and suffering, loss of earning power, loss of companionship, costs incurred in medical attention and other sundry elements which help to make up such law suits. It follows, therefore, when the jury frees a defendant of the charge of negligent conduct producing injury, erroneous admissions of evidence respecting questions of damage or incidents relating thereto, or erroneous instructions based thereon, are immaterial unless they palpably prejudice the jury on the main issue.\nThe court below may have committed error in admitting evidence in relation to an hereditary tendency to hernia, and in the charge to the jury regarding it; also on the law as to damages. The jury having found no causal connection between appellee\u2019s conduct and the accident, these matters were in no sense prejudicial to the main question and are now of no importance. The assignments of error based on such erroneous admission of evidence and the charge of the court in relation thereto and as to damages, are dismissed.\nAppellant complains that the court below unduly stressed appellee\u2019s testimony. The charge was a correct resume of all the evidence and we may consider only the record before us. Appellant\u2019s misfortune is that the evidence exhibited a much stronger case for defendant than for plaintiff, and, if it created an impession in defendant\u2019s favor, it was because the testimony warranted it. The jury undoubtedly took into consideration the story of the boy, who, though accompanied by a number of boy companions, was not corroborated, while appellee\u2019s story was supported by three disinterested witnesses. To award compensation at the expense of one who is in no way responsible for an accident would be a \u201cmonstrous injustice\u201d as stated by the court below. Appellant is aggrieved at the use of these words but it is to be noted this remark followed another statement by the learned judge wherein the jury was instructed, that, if the appellee ran the boy down, it would be \u201coutrageous if not criminal.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Gallagher et al., Appellants, v. Hildebrand.\nNegligence \u2014 Evidence\u2014Harmless error \u2014 Charge.\n1. Where a jury frees a defendant of the charge of negligent conduct producing injury, erroneous admissions of evidence respecting questions of damage or incidents relating thereto, or erroneous instructions based thereon, are immaterial unless they palpably prejudice the jury on the main issue.\n2. In an automobile accident ease, it is not reversible error for the trial judge to say in his charge that it would be \u201cmonstrous injustice\u201d to award compensation at the expense of one who is in no way responsible for an accident; and especially is this so where the judge also says that if the defendant ran the boy down it would be \u201coutrageous, if not criminal.\u201d\n3. A plaintiff in a negligence ease cannot successfully complain \u2022that the court unduly stressed the defendant\u2019s evidence, if it appears that the court gave a correct resume of the evidence, and that the impression produced was due to the fact that the evidence exhibited a much stronger case for defendant than for plaintiff.\nArgued November 30, 1925.\nAppeal, No. 374, Jan. T., 1925, by plaintiffs, from judgment of C. P. No. 4, Phila. Co., March T., 1922, No. 1303, on verdict for defendant, in case of Joseph M. Gallagher, by his mother and next friend, Bridget Gallagher, and Bridget Gallagher, in her own right, v. Charles C. Hildebrand.\nBefore Moschzisker, C. J., Frazer, Walling, Simpson, Kephart, Sadler and Schaefer, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass for personal injuries. Before Finletter, J.\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court states the facts.\nVerdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiffs appealed.\nErrors assigned were various rulings and instructions, quoting record.\nHenry J. Scott, with him Harry E. Apeler, for appellants.\nS. S. Herman, for appellee.\nJanuary 4, 1926:"
