On February 21, 1923, John Knoell, present plaintiff, entered two judgments, amounting to |10,000, against the mortgagor. Eighteen days thereafter, Harry Drake filed a mechanic’s lien covering the same property, claiming that the work, for which payment was due, had actually begun on April 24, 1922. Foreclosure proceedings were had later, and the property was sold. Before <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>distribution of the proceeds by the sheriff, notice of the claim of Knoell, based on his two judgments, was given. He also instituted a proceeding to set aside the mechanic’s lien entered by Drake. The order prayed for was refused, and, on appeal, the decree entered was affirmed for several reasons, which are set forth in the opinion filed in that case: Drake v. Stout, <a href="/pa/282/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="282 Pa. 223" data-case-ids="1088421" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0223-01">282 Pa. 223</a>.</p>
    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[268,744,1161,1022]]]'>Notwithstanding the notice to the sheriff of the intended contest of Drake’s right to participate in the fund, a distribution was made, appropriating the money in hand to the payment of the first mortgage and other claims, including the mechanic’s lien referred to, leaving but a small sum applicable to the Knoell judgments. An action of assumpsit was then brought against the sheriff by the present appellant to recover the full amount of his claim, less the portion awarded to him. The affidavit of defense admitted distribution as averred, but insisted upon the legality of the appropriation made, it being averred that the mechanic’s lien, paid in full, was entitled to priority, since it must be considered as a lien from the time of the commencement of the work on the building, to wit, April 24, 1922, a date prior to the entry of the judgments. A rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense was discharged, and, from this order of the learned court below, the present appeal is taken.</p>

In so far as purchasers at the sale are concerned, the dates disclosed by the record undoubtedly control in determining the rights of the respective parties (Eckels v.

Superior Ct. 113</a>), and, in the instant case, the priority of the mechanic’s lien was indicated. As between distributees, however, the true facts can be proved in a proper proceeding. The fund having been received by the sheriff,- it was his duty to make distri- ■ <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>bution in accordance with the certificates showing the order of those entitled to share, and the amounts due to each. For protection, in case of doubt or dispute, he could, of course, pay the fund into court, by which it would be awarded, or the allotment might be through the medium of an auditor, the course usually pursued: Com. v. Walter, <a href="/pa/99/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="99 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="446058" data-case-paths="/pa/99/0181-01">99 Pa. 181</a>.
