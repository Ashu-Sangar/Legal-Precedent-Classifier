On April 25, 1922, when the accident complained of occurred, plaintiff stood on the front of an engine, traveling at a slow rate toward a switch, intending to pass over it, and transfer certain cars which had just arrived from West Virginia. Admittedly, the employee was then engaged in interstate commerce, a claim advanced by the railroad company to defeat an award by the Workmen’s Compensation Board, and the facts clearly indicated plaintiff was so occupied at the time in question: McNeill v. Director General, <a href="/pa/272/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="272 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="1068378" data-case-paths="/pa/272/0525-01">272 Pa. 525</a>.</p>

Two nuts, measuring seven-eighths of an inch each, were used as fasteners, leaving the thread end of the bolt extending beyond for a short distance, variously estimated at from one-half to two inches. Pursglove was standing on the right side, and stepped from the moving engine when it came opposite the office of the company, intending to secure a drink of water there, and then pass across to the train which was to be transferred. In descending from the foot board, his raincoat caught on the end of the protruding bolt, resulting in a fall. He was <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>dragged from ten to thirty feet before being released, and the injury, for which damages are now claimed, was inflicted. Suit was brought to recover “by virtue of the Federal Liability Act of April 27, 1918” (doubtless the intention was to refer to the Act of April 22,1908), and, on the trial, it was insisted there had been a violation of its provisions, and also of the Boiler Inspection Act of February 17, 1911, as amended on March 4, 1915, so as to include not only boiler locomotives, and their appurtenances, but tenders used in connection therewith. A compulsory nonsuit was entered by the learned court below upon completion of the plaintiff’s case, and the motion to remove it was subsequently denied. From this action this appeal has been taken.</p>
    <p id="b54-4" data-blocks='[["BL_54.4",54,[259,1133,1162,1243]],["BL_55.1",55,[141,370,1151,534]]]'>In four particulars, the defendant was charged, in the statement of claim, with negligent conduct. It was averred that the bolts were not properly inspected, should not have been fastened with two nuts, and, if properly installed, would have been countersunk, or reversed, so that the smooth head should have been on the outside in front. All of these may be dismissed without comment, since no evidence was submitted which established any lack of due care as to the matters set forth. In passing, it may be noticed that the rules promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, pursuant to the authority granted by the Safety Appliance Act, as amended, directed, — in the cases where the location of bolts was deemed necessary of regulation, — that nuts attached to bolts shall be on the outside, evidently to provide for easier and more thorough inspection. Where locomotives are used in switching service, as here, it is expressly required that foot boards shall be securely bolted to metal brackets each of which shall be fastened to “buffer-beam, end-sill or tank-frame by not less than two seven-eighths inch bolts” (2 Roberts Federal Liability of Carriers 1625), and the compliance with this duty imposed cannot be said to constitute negligence. <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>The last defect alleged is that the end of the bolt was “sheared off and jagged,” — a fact not proven, — as a result of which the coat of plaintiff was caught, and plaintiff thrown to the ground and dragged. There was evidence that the thread of the bolt extended beyond the nut, and to this extent only was the charge supported. We are now asked to say that this condition disclosed was a violation of the legislation enacted for the protection of railroad employees, and that the proof of it sufficed to establish liability.</p>

No offer was made to establish this to be the ordinary practice of railroads under like circumstances, and that, therefore, the failure to so install was evidence of negligence. Indeed, such proposed construction would seem to be in conflict with the trend of thought expressed by the Interstate Commission in its rules, as already noted.</p>
    <p id="b57-3" data-blocks='[["BL_57.4",57,[129,1067,1153,1183]]]'>The court properly rejected the testimony, referred to in the second assignment of error, to show that the bolt could have been reversed in position, so that the end would have projected inward, and that access to the nuts could have been had if placed in that direction. Nor can we see any error in refusing to permit the same witness to testify as to the extension of the ends of bolts on other engines. The purpose was not to show the customary manner of protection in general use, but merely to state that the witness, a brakeman, had not observed, on engines upon which he had been engaged, any bolts which “stuck out,” as this one did. The only duty imposed on the defendant was to furnish appliances reasonably safe and suitable, and not to provide the latest and best, or to abandon those which were efficient, on the discovery of later improvements: 1 Roberts Liability of Carriers 927. There was no attempt made to show by the second witness that the projection of the bolt was dangerous, or to prove the practice and custom of other railroads, as indicating a want of ordinary care on the part of defendant, but merely that Shimmel had not before seen bolts installed in like manner.</p>
