Although the current installment of rent had been paid, defendant treated the removal as a breach of the lease and levied on plaintiffs’ personal property by distraint under a landlord’s warrant for the rent for the entire balance of the term, amounting to $9,875. Plaintiffs at once instituted an action of replevin, claiming the property levied on to have been wrongfully distrained, as no rent was then in arrears. In their affidavit of defense, defendants relied on the portion of the lease quoted above to support their contention of a right to distrain for the unpaid rent for the entire balance of the term by reason of re<a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>moval of personal property from the premises.

    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[274,1246,1162,1185]]]'>Applying the foregoing general principles to the present proceedings, defendants were bound to point to an express provision in the lease clearly authorizing them to distrain for rent accruing during the remainder of the term. Although customary in Pennsylvania to insert in leases a provision making the balance of rent for the entire term due and payable in case of default in any installment, the difficulty in the present case is that if the parties intended to create a situation of that character they failed to express their intention in language readily understandable. The only words referring to the matter are those contained in the clause “Whether due or not,” and this language expressly negatives any idea of acceleration of rent. Defendant contends, however, that the clause in question clearly confers the right to levy for future rent for the remainder of the term and is consequently equivalent to an acceleration. We find no explicit provision in this clause giving the right to levy for. rent not due, and the mere fact that such right might be implied from the words used is not sufficient to warrant that conclusion: Latimer v. Groetzinger, <a href="/pa/139/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="139 Pa. 207" data-case-ids="11250987" data-case-paths="/pa/139/0207-01">139 Pa. 207</a>.</p>

When so construed, every clause in the paragraph is given full effect without resorting to a strained construction in any part. Had the parties desired to accelerate the balance of rent for the term in case of default, or to permit a levy for the amount that had not accrued under the terms of the lease, such intention could readily have- been expressed in language which could not be misunderstood. Inasmuch as the parties did not see fit to set forth their intention in plain and comprehensive language we cannot make a contract for them by writing into the lease provisions they themselves omitted.</p>
