This amended statement averred that, at the time in question, defendants “were engaged in the trucking business for hire in and about the City of Philadelphia.” Then an affidavit on the merits was filed wherein defendants denied that “on the date set forth in plaintiff’s statement of claim they were engaged in the trucking business for hire in and about the City of Philadelphia”; and averred that, “on the contrary,......Corbin &amp; Bodine, a corporation existing under the laws of the. State of Delaware, [was the party so] engaged......on the date mentioned.” In this affidavit, defendants also denied that the goods in question were delivered to them, and insisted they were in fact delivered to the aforesaid corporation, from whom they were stolen without any fault on its part; and defendants averred that, at the time of the delivery of the goods, “plaintiff placed a value thereon of $1,592,” as stated in the shipping order; further, that, prior to the present action, plaintiff had sued the aforesaid corporation in the City of New York upon the same cause of action, and that this suit was still pending and undisposed of; finally, that some of the merchandise had been found and returned to plaintiff, which fact the latter admitted at trial.

When the trial judge asked counsel for defendant, “Is there any dispute about the real value of the goods?” the latter replied, “I don’t think so, if he says it is a mistake.” The court then inquired, “Is there any question that the freight rate is just the same whether [the goods] are valued at $1,592 or $5,192” to which counsel for defendant answered “No.” Whereupon the court remarked, “So that it made no change in the charge that would have been made against the shipper?” and counsel for defendant replied, “No.” Under these circumstances, we must take it that the court below was warranted in treating the case as though the point of a difference in value between the amount stated in the shipping order and in plaintiff’s statement of claim was waived by defendant.

The substance of defendants’ contention is that, on the record as made at trial, the contract in question must be viewed one between plaintiff and the alleged Delaware corporation, and, since the contract was for the sending of goods from one state to another, it must be accounted as involving an interstate transaction; hence, even though the corporation carrying out this transaction had not registered in Pennsylvania, as required by the Act of June 8,1911, P. L. 710, owing to the constitutional privilege of interstate commerce, it was doing business lawfully in this State, so far as the shipment in controversy is concerned, and therefore defendants assumed no indi<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>vidual liability in acting for that corporation. But this contention is answered by the trial court’s second ground of decision, concerning which the opinion in support of judgment for plaintiff states, and states correctly: “In the present case there is no actual proof that, when these defendants received plaintiff’s goods for carriage on July 20, 1923, there was in existence any corporation, ‘Corbin &amp; Bodine,’ either foreign or domestic. Not until December 20, 1923 (after the loss of plaintiff’s goods), was-there filed the application for registration in Pennsylvania- of such a corporation [, and this] application recites that the title of the corporation is ‘Corbin &amp; Bodine,’......‘established, organized or chartered under the laws of the State of Delaware,’ [but] there is no averment of the date of incorporation, nor is the Delaware charter presented or proven.”</p>

Again, the name Corbin &amp; Bodine, Inc., appears in both the shipping order and the waybill, but this is not conclusive proof that the individual defendants here named were not transacting business under that title. Finally, the fact, which appears in the evidence and is called to our attention by appellants, that the original conversation leading to the shipping order from plaintiff to Corbin &amp; Bodine, was held over the telephone with the New York office of the latter, settles none of the issues at bar.</p>
