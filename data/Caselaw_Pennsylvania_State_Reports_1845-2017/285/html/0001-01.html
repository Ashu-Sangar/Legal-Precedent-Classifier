Advertising matter was received and posted, and notices of sailing dates were received by him. In addition to orders for tickets he received ticket books of the various companies. The office did not bear any company name, it was in defendant’s house and so far as this record shows he paid the expenses of running it. There was no contract for compensation and the record does not disclose how defendant was paid for his services. To each company he gave a bond to secure that company from loss in case of default and he remitted the money received from sales a day or so after the tickets were sold.

We have in our vast mining and manufacturing sections large numbers of foreign people. It is to this class the mischief, which is a matter of common knowledge, is greatest. The State thus assures to intending travelers that when orders for tickets are presented at the ports, they will be honored, and that money paid for or on account of tickets will not be lost to their detriment; the ticket seller is thus held to strict accountability. Heretofore when agents absconded with money or otherwise misbehaved, in most cases, the persons injured, through ignorance, would not follow up their right and had no effective remedy if they did attempt to secure relief. The act is very simple. It requires some investigation by the banking department to determine the applicant’s fitness, honesty and likelihood to deal fairly. This investigation of character should be no different in kind or quality from that which any honestly inclined steamship company should make of its own representatives. But where, in the scramble for business, no investigation is made, and individuals who are not responsible are permitted to sell, it is then harm is done.

As their servant with specific duties to perform, his labors were centered in procuring service for his master, an interstate carrier. The connection was complete between him and the interstate carrier he represented as to duties, responsibilities and interest. It was the same as if his company had established a branch office for the purpose of procuring business, as the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad did in Pennsylvania when this State attempted to tax it. Norfolk &amp; Western R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a><a href="/us/136/0114-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="136 U.S. 114" data-case-ids="1217857" data-case-paths="/us/136/0114-01">136 U. S. 114</a>. Primarily, the employee’s engagement was absolutely in the interest of his company; whatever he did was for it. It was the interstate carrier’s business, not his business. In the Texas Case, what was done by an individual in the McCall Case, supra, was done by a corporation on a much larger scale, securing freight and passenger service for steamship and railroad companies. The company was a regularly employed agent under a contract fixing compensation. Its services consisted in soliciting and engaging commerce, designating ships, arranging for delivery of that commerce to the wharves, issuing bills of lading under the name of the shipowners or charterers, arranging for stevedores for loading and discharging cargos, collecting freight charges, paying ships’ disbursements, attending to immigration services and assisting generally in local customs and regulations. As such agent, it was authorized to quote freight rates and issue receipts in the name of the principals for cargos delivered on the wharf. These duties were similar in scope to those of a single agent. The practice of corporations managing one or more companies, instead of a president or manager doing so, seems to be growing. There is no reason why an agent for a company should not be a corporation that may at the same time occupy the same relation to other concerns, provided, of course, in its divers obligations, each corporation should be treated with fairness. The dividing line is not the number of concerns represented but whether duties are such as to cause it to be the employee or agent for its principals, rather than occupying a position in the nature of an independent contractor as defendant was here. In neither of the above cases were the acts aimed at fraud, imposition and over-reaching. They were revenue measures creating an occupation tax, which, though fixed in amount in its class, varied in the same kind of business according to grade. This was a tax on interstate business. Therefore the facts in the McCall and Texas Cases, supra, would bring the <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>person and the company there proceeded against clearly under the exception stated in our statute.</p>

Here, the defendant merely sells tickets ; he is a free lance with no obligation to any particular company or any named in the record. In other words, he has no interest in any or all concerns as to furthering their business. He is guided entirely by his own judgment, and his interest in the sale of tickets is entirely personal, furthering his own business not the business of these companies. He was not employed by any of them, his authority, as evidenced by papers submitted, did not amount to an agency or an employment. It consisted merely of a right to Sell tickets at scheduled prices. The company assumed no obligation beyond that expressed in the certificate and this right was revocable at a moment’s notice. It assumed no responsibility for his wrongful acts as it would of an employee. He received no compensation, the companies paid none of his expenses so far as the record shows; the bonds that were given to the companies protected only the company, not the purchasers. Barring the remittance of the money, the companies have absolutely no interest in his business, and outside of the money he is under no liability to them. If he charges more than the normal fare and keeps the difference, the only way the companies could reach him would be to dismiss him. His business was personal as distinguished from that of the agent or employee in the McCall Case or from the corporation performing the same service as a personal employee or agent in the Texas Case. The difference is manifest.</p>

It was held that furnishing an opportunity to do interstate commerce business was within the protection of the commerce clause. This case is like the preceding one, as is also Crutcher v. Kentucky, <a href="/us/141/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="141 U.S. 47" data-case-ids="3556047" data-case-paths="/us/141/0047-01">141 U. S. 47</a>; Adams Express Co. v.

We are clearly of the opinion that the act should be sustained and the Superior Court was in error in reversing the court below. Other questions raised are deemed unnecessary to the decision of this case.</p>
