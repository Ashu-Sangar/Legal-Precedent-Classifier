The lease provided that if the rent should at any time be in arrears and unpaid the tenancy should be terminated, with the usual clause authorizing any attorney, as attorney for the lessee, at the request of the lessor, to sign an agreement for entering an amicable action and judgment in ejectment against the lessee for the recovery by the lessor of possession of the premises. The rent being in arrears, and the lessor having given notice that it had elected to end and determine the lease, an attorney, at the request of the lessor, was proceeding to file in' the office of the prothonotary the amicable action and judgment in ejectment as provided for in the lease, when he was met by the order of court above quoted. As required by its provisions, he entered a rule to show cause why the amicable action should not be filed and judgment be entered against defendant for possession of the premises described in the lease. This rule was taken out September 3, 1924. An answer was filed by defendant on September 16,1924, in which it set up, among other things, an oral agreement on the lessor’s part to make certain repairs to the property which had not been made, claimed resulting damages, and denied the right of the plaintiff <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>to enter its amicable action or to have judgment thereon. The docket entries disclose that a hearing was held October 22,1924, that the testimony was filed October 27, 1924, and that not until October 14,1925, was an opinion filed, in which judgment for plaintiff was refused, and a jury trial ordered for the determination of the question “Is the plaintiff entitled to judgment?” Following this order, plaintiff applied for and we issued a special certiorari directing the record to be brought before us.</p>

L. 354, concerning attorneys at law, which provides, “Every such attorney shall have power to commence, prosecute and defend, all actions and suits in which he may be retained or concerned, from time to time, in the manner and with the effect hitherto allowed and practiced”; and section 77 thereof, P. L. 355, concerning prothonotaries, which provides, “They shall have power ......to enter judgment at the instance of plaintiffs, upon the confessions of defendants.” These statutes give legislative sanction to the entry of amicable actions and the confession of judgment thereon, go far as we have knowledge, it is the custom throughout the Commonwealth for such actions to be entered in ejectment and judgments thereon to be entered at the instance of plaintiffs upon defendants’ confessions.</p>

Gilbert, 8 S. &amp; R. 567; McCalmont v. Peters, 13 S. &amp; R. 196; Hatch v.

Harlan, <a href="/pa-super/78/0092-02" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="78 Pa. Super. 92" data-case-ids="650181,650198" data-case-paths="/pa-super/78/0092-02,/pa-super/78/0092-01">78 Pa. Superior Ct. 92</a>. The practice has uniformly been, in those instances where a defendant had a defense to the judgment, for him to make application to the court below either to strike it off or to open it and let him in to a defense. This method of procedure is speedy and orderly, preserves the rights of the parties and gives the court such control over the judgment as to prevent injustice to <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>defendants, as well as full opportunity to set aside unmeritorious defenses which are interposed and thus to safeguard plaintiffs in the assertion of their rights which cannot be legally countervailed. The rule in question is an innovation on the practice which has heretofore prevailed and shifts the burden which theretofore had been upon the defendant to satisfy the court that a judgment which he had confessed ought not to be maintained against him, to the shoulders of the plaintiff to satisfy the court that a duly executed confession of judgment in his favor should lead to its contemplated end.</p>
    <p id="b462-4" data-blocks='[["BL_462.4",462,[278,976,1158,975]]]'>The acts of assembly quoted provide for the filing of amicable actions and the entry of judgments thereon by the prothonotary where judgments have been confessed. The effect of the rule is to deny the statutory right to enter the action without leave of court and to forbid the prothonotary, although he is authorized by law to enter the judgment, to do so except with the court’s sanction. If such a rule as that made by the court below as to amicable actions in ejectment upon leases is to be approved in view of the provisions of the law, then it is difficult to see why a like rule may not be prescribed as to judgment notes. If a rule of that kind should be adopted by the courts, the practice of our people for generations would be upset and great hardship and wrong could be done to worthy creditors attempting to assert just claims where time as to the entry of judgment might be of the most vital consequence.</p>

It was then faced <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>with an order for a jury trial to determine whether it is entitled to judgment, which may not, very likely cannot, be finally determined, if appeal should be taken, for another year, during all of which time the lessee remains in possession of the property paying no rent. Such a state of affairs should not be tolerated unless it is unavoidable, and we think under the law it is not, because in our opinion the rule of court contravenes the acts of assembly and the common law under which it was plaintiff’s right to proceed speedily.</p>
    <p id="b463-4" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[133,900,1152,752]]]'>We are not unmindful of cases in which rules of court as to the entry of judgments by confession where the confessions ai*e more than ten and more than twenty years old have been sustained, such as Bierly v. Hamor, <a href="/pa-super/50/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="50 Pa. Super. 124" data-case-ids="428469" data-case-paths="/pa-super/50/0124-01">50 Pa. Superior Ct. 124</a>. There is a reason for such rules owing to the age of the document in which judgment is confessed and the presumption of payment. As was said by the Superior Court in the cited case, “The validity of such a rule of court has been recognized throughout the Commonwealth from early times and we think is beyond question,” but it has also been recognized throughout the Commonwealth and is equally beyond question that proceedings between landlord and tenant should be speedy of remedy and quick of conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[130,1663,1152,426]]]'>We are not disposed to encourage proceedings by special certiorari. The orderly method is to invoke the appropriate remedy in the court below, which in the pending case would have been mandamus. This remedy not having been pursued, we might well have quashed the writ of certiorari. We have concluded, however, in view of the great delay to which the plaintiff has been subjected to allow the writ to stand.</p>
    <p id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.7",463,[130,2101,1150,208]]]'>The court below is directed to set aside the order heretofore made granting a jury trial, plaintiff to be permitted to proceed, irrespective of the rule or order of court in question, in accordance with law.</p>
