On June 27, 1924, Frank W. Sautter and wife, the owners of the property, entered into a written agreement to sell same to defendant, William Rowland, and one J. F. Flail. The consideration stated was $45,000, of which $5,000 was paid in hand, as a deposit, and to be forfeited as liquidated damages in case of the purchasers’ default. Possession of the property, which included a two-story brick garage, was to be and was immediately turned over to the buyers. The <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>agreement, embracing the elements of a transfer of property, provided that it should be followed within three days by a more formal writing calling for a completion of the purchase within ninety days from June 30, 1924. The parties met on the day last mentioned and such formal agreement was prepared but Rowland declined to execute it unless Flail was eliminated as a party, to which the latter refused to consent. On July 2d, following, plaintiffs’ counsel wrote to both Rowland and Flail declaring the agreement cancelled and of no further effect, because of their refusal to execute the formal agreement. Thereafter, however, all parties treated the agreement of June 27th as in force, and later in the summer Rowland procured an assignment of Flail’s interest therein, and continued in possession of the premises, but failed to perform or tender performance of the contract within the ninety days, or at any subsequent time. Thereupon plaintiffs brought this action of ejectment and recovered an unconditional verdict; from judgment entered thereon defendant has appealed.</p>

In answer to plaintiffs’ declaration and abstract, defendant admits he claims a right of possession under and through plaintiffs; hence, the latter is the common source of title and needs no further proof thereof: Turner v.

Swarz, which, as the trial judge explained, was in part corroborated. This assignment might be well taken had there been a conflict in the evidence or a doubt of its sufficiency, if credible (Fillman et al. v. Divers, <a href="/pa/31/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="31 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="985035" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0429-01">31 Pa. 429</a>; Howell v.

If Swarz’s testimony was true, plaintiffs’ case was made out, and we are not prepared to hold the trial judgd committed reversible error in so informing the jury. Defendant offered no evidence, except the letters of July 2d, so there| was no conflict in the testimony. Defendant offered no evidence as to the amount received by him as income from the property since July 2, 1924, and makes no claim that he tendered performance of the contract on his part or was ready and willing to do so or tendered a return of the property. The only defense set up in the answer is that the agreement was cancelled on July 2d, and that defendant retains possession and claims the right to do so until reimbursed the $5,000. But he makes no attempt to deny that the parties by their subsequent conduct treated the agreement as in full force and in fact his contract with Flail and other evidence show he so regarded it.</p>

There was some personal property embraced in the contract, not here material. Defendant had been in possession of the property for seven months <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>when the case was tried and there was some evidence that plaintiffs paid a commission on the sale; so the remarks of their counsel, along that line, in closing to the jury, were not improper.
