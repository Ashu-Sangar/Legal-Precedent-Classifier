Where a testator, in making his will, exercises a power of appointment, the fact that he makes no provision for payment of his debts, is a circumstance, in connection with his disposition of the residue, bearing on the question whether, in exercising the power, he had blended his own estate with the appointive estate.</p>

In such case, the use of the word “residue,” indicates an intention that the fund over which testator had power of appointment should not be subject to or used for the payment of his debts and therefore should not be blended with his estates generally, but should be differentiated so that his debts and pecuniary legacies should be payable out of his estate and that the balance, if any remaining, should be disposed of in the same way that he disposed of his appointed estate.</p>

If he had devised Ms entire estate, together with the estates over which he had the power of appointment, putting all as it were in hotch pot, there then would be strong ground for holding that he had blended them, and the rule which we have heretofore applied in cases like McCord’s Estate, <a href="/pa/276/0459-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="276 Pa. 459" data-case-ids="1077670" data-case-paths="/pa/276/0459-01">276 Pa. 459</a>; Forney’s Est., <a href="/pa/280/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="280 Pa. 282" data-case-ids="1084437" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0282-01">280 Pa. 282</a>; Kates’s Est., <a href="/pa/282/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="282 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1088423" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0417-01">282 Pa. 417</a>; and Twitchell’s Est., 284 Pa. .135, would be applicable. As was said by the Superior Court in its opinion (<a href="/pa-super/85/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="85 Pa. Super. 123" data-case-ids="665610" data-case-paths="/pa-super/85/0123-01">85 Pa.

    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[267,757,1162,1452]]]'>In McCord’s Estate, the power of appointment was unlimited and the donee of the power could transfer the estate over which she had power of appointment to her own estate, which we determined she did, but in the pending case, it could not be said that the testator had made the appointive estate part of his own. In the McCord case, the testatrix said, “It is my intention by this my will to dispose not only of all estate and property which I own or hold in my own right but also all over which I have any power of appointment......and it is my further intention that the entire estate and property shall be administered by my executors hereinafter named for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of my will.” This she followed with a direction for the payment of her debts and funeral expenses by the executors. There the intention to blend the two estates was unmistakable. If instead of opening the fourth paragraph of his will with the words “All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate,” testator in the instant case had opened it with the words disposing of the estate over which he had the power of appointment and had followed them with the words “also all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate,” no question could have arisen that he kept the two estates separate and that there was no blending. We think the reversed order does not indicate a different intention or bring about a different result.</p>

    <p id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[131,752,1150,373]]]'>It will further be noted that the appointive estates of which the testator in the instant case was making disr position need not and do not go to his executors at all but go direct to his trustees. It is by this made more manifest that he was not considering the appointive estates as his own and did not have the intent to blend them with his other possessions.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[130,1137,1152,812]]]'>We are of opinion that it was not the purpose of the testator to blend the appointive estates with his own for all purposes, but what he intended was that the appointive estates should follow the same channels of distribution which he designed for the residue of his estate. The mere fact that the appointed estate is given to the same persons who take the residue of a testator’s individual estate is not the test to be applied in determining whether there has been a blending of the two estates, but the real test under our line of decisions is whether the testator has treated the two estates as one for all purposes and manifested an intent to commingle them generally. It follows from what has been said that the estates over which the testator exercised his power of appointment are not subject to the tax.</p>
