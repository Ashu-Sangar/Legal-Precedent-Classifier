Addleton was the owner and in possession of the premises described in these proceedings, located on Main Street in the Borough of Dalton, Lackawanna County, until her death, and, from that time, her husband had possession of the property until November 14, 1923, when he died, leaving a will in which he devised his residuary estate to M. R. Stanton. Since the date last named, defendants, the nephew and niece of Ida E. Addleton, named in her will, as quoted above, have been in possession of the premises, and this amicable action of ejectment was brought against them by the devisee of Edward H. Addleton for the purpose of determining title to the property. The contention of plaintiffs is that, by the will of Ida E. Addleton, her husband took an estate in fee which, in turn, passed to plaintiff under his will, while defendants contend the husband was given merely a life estate with power to consume, with a gift over of the unconsumed portion to defendants. The court below entered judgment in favor of defendants, and plaintiffs have appealed.</p>

At the same time, however, in all cases of the construction of wills, the intention of testator must control, and if, from a reading of the entire will, an intent to restrict the gift is clearly the dominant one, such intent must be given effect and the will, as a whole, construed, not as an attempt to limit a fee, but as a gift of less than a fee: Fassitt v.

The former is always lawful and effective, the latter rarely, if ever; the first, because the testator’s intention is the governing consideration in the construction and carrying out of a will; the second, because even a clear intention of the testator cannot be permitted to contravene the settled rules of law by depriving any estate of its essential legal attributes”: Good v.

When read as a whole, the will shows clearly testatrix did not first give an estate in fee and then attempt to deprive it of some of its essential legal attributes but limited the original gift to an estate for life with a remainder over of the unconsumed portion.
