Gowen, in the . estate of James Gowen, the auditing judge found the indebtedness of Henry, above referred to, remains unpaid and said, “But assuming that the claimant has a standing, I must reject his claim for the reason that the testator had expressly converted the debt of his son Henry, into an advancement and directed that no money should be apportioned to the share apportionable to his son Henry until the share apportionable to each of his other children have actually amounted to the principal and interest then due upon Henry’s indebtedness. As this state of facts never existed, it is difficult to see on what theory Henry or those claiming under him are entitled to any share in the present estate until Henry’s debt with interest is paid in full. That a testator can convert a debt into an advancement is shown clearly by Knight’s Est., <a href="/pa/253/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="253 Pa. 290" data-case-ids="1024065" data-case-paths="/pa/253/0290-01">253 Pa. 290</a>. The claim of Morris W. Gowen is, therefore, disallowed.” In the opinion dismissing exceptions to the adjudication, the court said, “The eighth paragraph of this will recited the debts due by this son [Henry], directed they should not be released, and empowered the trustees to use their discretion in collection. The testator aimed at equality as between his children. If the debt was not repaid, it was to be charged as an advancement against this son’s distributive share; and he was to take nothing until the shares paid the others actually amounted to the principal and interest due by him. The testator has served his own purposes by mingling the legal conceptions of debts and advancements, and this he had a right to do. Whether these debts could now be collected is aside from the question: see <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>Knoppel’s Est., 1 Pa.
