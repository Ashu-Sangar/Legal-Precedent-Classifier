    <p class="author" id="Aac" data-blocks='[["BL_286.10",286,[597,1321,465,43]]]'>Mr. Justice Walling,</p>
    <p id="b286-8" data-blocks='[["BL_286.11",286,[298,1374,1159,425]]]'>On May 18, 1923, the defendants agreed in writing to sell plaintiff the property known as 130 South Eighth Street, Philadelphia, for $37,800, of which he paid them $1,500 in hand and $1,000 shortly thereafter. The purchase was not consummated and this suit in assumpsit to recover such advance payments resulted in a verdict and judgment for plaintiff for the $2,500 and interest; therefrom defendants brought this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b286-9" data-blocks='[["BL_286.12",286,[297,1810,1160,646]],["BL_287.1",287,[159,393,1151,209]]]'>The record discloses no reversible error. The contract was made through the agents of the parties, and plaintiff based his right to rescind the same largely on the alleged fraudulent representations of defendants’ agent to the effect that the property in question extended westerly from Eighth Street to an alley, a distance of about sixty-nine feet, whereas in fact it extended back only about forty-nine feet, and was shut out from the alley by a piece of land some twenty feet in width, owned by another. There was ample evidence, notwithstanding the agent’s denial, to take the question of such fraudulent statements to the jury. There was a four-story brick <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>building on the premises and the evidence tended to show he made false and fraudulent statements as to the leases and solvency of the tenants therein, which was also a question for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b287-4" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[154,613,1154,920]]]'>The contract provided, inter alia, that, “The title is to be such as will be insured by any reputable title company in Philadelphia,” and there was some evidence, possibly not very convincing, that the title did not meet this requirement. In that connection, plaintiff offered a certificate from the Land Title and Trust Company, stating certain objections to the title. The certificate was produced by an employee of the company, and defendants’ counsel objected to its admission until he could have an opportunity to cross-examine an officer of the company as to statements therein. The trial judge admitted it merely as a certificate of the Land Title and Trust Company. Later, during the trial, defendants called the title officer of the company and examined him fully in regard to the certificate. This removed the only objection made to its admission and cured the error complained of, if such it were.</p>
    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[147,1544,1157,923]],["BL_288.1",288,[279,390,1156,310]]]'>The contract described the property merely by its lot number, so the alleged statement that it extended to the alley did not contradict the writing. Again, in support of the allegations of fraud, it was competent to show the false statements of defendants’ agent, which induced the execution of the contract: Atherholt v. Hughes, <a href="/pa/209/0156-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="209 Pa. 156" data-case-ids="936102" data-case-paths="/pa/209/0156-01">209 Pa. 156</a>.

As tending to disprove the averment of the solvency of the tenants of the building, it was competent to show that bankruptcy proceedings were then pending against those occupying the second floor and that their rent was in arrear.</p>
