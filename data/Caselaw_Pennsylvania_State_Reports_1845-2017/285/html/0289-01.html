These later counts also charge that, on October 29, 1903, the prisoner was found guilty in the State of New York of grand larceny and “thereupon sentenced to be confined in the State Reformatory at Elmira, New York, until discharged according to law; that......[he] was conveyed to and imprisoned in the said Elmira Reformatory......up to [January 3,1906], and upon the last mentioned date......was transferred to the New York State Prison, located in the city of Auburn,......and was confined and held as a prisoner in the said New York State Prison......up to [October 10, 1907] upon which......date [he] was......released......on parole; that because of alleged violation of the regulations of his parole [he] was, on [December 9, 1907,] returned to the [said] New York State Prison ......and......there held as a prisoner until [June 26, 1908] , and upon the last mentioned date.....was..... reparoled.”</p>

Moreover, where an indictment so charges, it may be that a general verdict of guilty comprehends an implied finding of confinement under sentences on prior convictions; but neither this presumption nor such an implied finding can be regarded as broader than the charge on these subjects contained in the indictment itself: 16 C. J. 1113, section 2606.</p>
    <p id="b321-5" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[156,902,1153,1238]]]'>It will be noticed that the count in the present indictment, reciting the circumstances of the offense in 1903, alleges that the prisoner was found guilty in New York of grand larceny and sentenced to be imprisoned in a state reformatory until discharged according to law; that he was confined in the reformatory for more than one year following the date of sentence, and then transferred to a New York state prison, where he was held for over another year; that he was paroled and subsequently returned to the prison for a few months and then reparoled. This is not a sufficient charge to show, in the words of our Act of 1909, that the petitioner was, in New York, “convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned in the penitentiary for a term of not less than one year, for a crime.” The original New York sentence was to a state reformatory, not to a penitentiary, and, so far as this indictment shows, his transfer to the state prison at Auburn, if that is a penitentiary, may have been caused by some breach of discipline of the reformatory, rather than inflicted as punishment for a “crime,” as required by the habitual-offender provision of the Act of 1909, supra; hence the indictment itself fails to bring the case within the terms of that statute.</p>

Com., <em><a href="/pa/22/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="22 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="413744" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0351-01">22 </a></em><a href="/pa/22/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="22 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="413744" data-case-paths="/pa/22/0351-01">Pa. 351</a>, 352), including the one charging convictions of, and sentences for, prior offenses, or, in other words, the habitual-offender count, on which the prisoner was sentenced to a maximum of 30 years. Hence the record not only contains no findings, implied or otherwise, to support the maximum sentence imposed, but actually negatives those required for 'that purpose. Such being the case, petitioner was improperly sentenced as an habitual offender, and is entitled to relief on habeas corpus.</p>
