Such action shall be brought and tried as an action in equity, and may be brought in any court having jurisdiction to hear and determine equity cases within the county in which the offense occurs. ......Upon the decree of the court ordering such nuisance to be abated, the court may......order that the room, house, building, structure......or place shall not be occupied or used for one year thereafter.” These provisions are followed, in section 7, by a further one to the effect that, if “the owner, lessee, tenant, or occupant” <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>of the premises in question shall, after an order closing the property for a year, give a bond for not less than $500, “conditioned that intoxicating liquor will not thereafter be manufactured, sold, offered for sale, bartered, furnished, possessed, or otherwise disposed of” on the premises, and that the obligor will “pay all fines, costs and damages that may be assessed” for the violation of the Act of 1923 upon such premises, the court may permit the property to be forthwith occupied and used for proper purposes. Section 10 provides that violators of the act shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment, “at the discretion of the court”; and section 11, that property used and possessed contrary to the terms of the act shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture.</p>

L. 39), which provides that the courts of common pleas shall have “the power and jurisdiction of courts of chancery so far as relates to......the prevention or restraint of the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community,” is not broad enough to give jurisdiction to abate nuisances legislatively declared to be detrimental to public health (the authorities indicate otherwise: see, for example, Com. v.
