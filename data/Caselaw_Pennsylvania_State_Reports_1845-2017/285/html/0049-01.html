Shortly after <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>six o’clock on the evening of December 29, 1923, Enos Eobb, the deceased, left his home in Palmyra, Lebanon County, and walked along the street about five hundred and forty feet when he received a bullet wound in the forehead, which caused his death. So far as known, the deceased had with him no firearm and none was found in the vicinity of the body, which, with the report of three shots, pointed to homicide rather than suicide, and afforded ample evidence of the corpus delicti to justify the admission of a confession.

It is not enough, however, to show a death, but death must be consistent with a criminal act before a conviction,will be sustained”; and Mr. Justice Sadler, for the court, in Com. v.

Under such circumstances, the jury should first pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence of the corpus delicti. If it satisfies them beyond a reasonable doubt that crime has been committed, then they are at liberty to give the confession such weight as it is entitled to, taking into view the circumstances attending it, and the extent to which <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>it has been corroborated.” See also Gray v.

A month thereafter, on February 3, 1924, defendant gave the officers a signed statement setting forth that he saw Jimmie Miller shoot Robb; on the strength of which Miller was confined in jail for some days. Eight days later defendant gave the officers a second signed statement in which he admitted shooting Robb, but asserted he did it under the belief that it was another party and that the latter was about to attack him. Then, on the following day (February 12, 1924), defendant gave the officers a third statement in detail, which he wrote with his own hand and wherein he stated, inter alia, that he was badly in need of money and took his gun from his mother’s house at Hershey, told his brother he was going out that night to get some money, no matter where, that he went to Palmyra some four miles on the street car, and states that while walking on the street: “I saw a man coming tuward me an these thoughts came back to my mind hold him up maybe he has some money I walked tuward him an when I got just about eaven I said stick em up then he jerked his hands out of his pockets then I thought he was going to shoot then I fired and that is how this awful thing happened then I run I didnet look to see who it was or if he had money.” He also says in this statement that he told his brother Ben the next day he thought he killed a man the previous night and further that he was drunk or he would not have done it. Defendant wrote his mother the same day stating, inter alia, that had he not been drunk he would not have done this awful thing. He wrote his wife at the same time <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>saying he was in jail for causing a man’s death, and added, “but when I shot him I shot in self defense.”</p>

This was properly excluded as being too remote. For a like purpose defendant offered to prove by a lay witness that in the fall of 1923, defendant “keeled over with a nervous attack that required the service of a physician.” This was properly rejected as too indefinite, as there was no offer to show that the attack resulted from or was caused by any permanent nerve impairment; furthermore, a lay witness <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>would not know whether defendant’s lapse resulted from a nervous attack or from some other cause, and it did not tend to establish his condition when the confession was made.</p>

No suggestion is made that his duties were not performed accurately and with fidelity, but it is urged that he was not sworn as the statutes require. The presumption is that the stenographer had complied with the law in that respect and the contrary was not shown. Moreover, the jury tried the case on the evidence given in open court and their verdict could not have been influenced in the slightest degree by the fact as to whether the stenographer was or was not sworn; neither can this appeal, as the accuracy of the record is unchallenged. As no harm resulted to the defendant and as he made no request that the stenographer be sworn, we conclude that such question cannot be raised after a trial and verdict upon the merits.

The request was complied with in due time but the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to delay the proceedings until compliance with such request.

The corpus delicti, being sufficiently established, the credibility of defendant’s admissions and confessions was for the jury. The circumstances in corroboration thereof were not strong, but included the fact that defendant was in need of money, that he owned a revolver of the same caliber (.38) as the one which killed Eobb, that he was in the vicinity at th.e time in question, that he gave conflicting accounts of the transaction and that he directly charged an innocent third party with the crime. The latter, as an effort to divert suspicion, is always regarded as a circumstance indicative of guilt: Com. v.

He also quoted the statute imposing upon the jury the duty of fixing the degree of murder in case of conviction and said further: “The jury always has to determine in murder, whether of the first degree, second, or voluntary manslaughter; that is included in the count for murder.” So the contention that the trial judge took from the jury the right to fix the degree, is untenable. While he explained the nature of the crime, under the statute, as was his duty, he left with the jury the right to fix the degree, and that is what the law requires. It is not necessary for the trial judge to reiterate to the jury in every part of the charge their right to fix the degree: Com. v.
