Consider his expectancy of life, which doesn’t control you but only guides you;.....consider his age, his health, his habits, his sex, the condition of his health before the accident and the condition of his health at the present time.” These instructions are both wrong in law and inadequate in substance. To begin with, this court has more than once said that, in cases like the one before us, the standard of compensation is not “loss of wages” which one injured “may experience in the future,” but loss brought about by impairment of earning capacity; and these two, as pointed out in our cases (see Piper v.

In the second place, it was wrong ,to tell the jury, in the meager way the trial judge did it, that plaintiff’s expectancy of life was not, controlling on them. If the instruction as phrased in the charge was intended to convey the thought that the standard tables were not controlling, ;that would be correct (as we shall show at greater length in considering points “c” and “d”), but this is very different from saying that plaintiff’s expectancy of life, after the jurors determined that question from a consideration of all the relevant evidence on the subject, was not to control them in estimating ¡his future losses due to impaired earning power. These two mistakes present errors of law, and, in addition thereto, the í part of the charge now under consideration contains a third fault, which, though perhaps not more than an inadequacy, should be noted. The trial judge entirely failed to instruct the jurors that-it was their duty to determine, from the evidence, whether plaintiff’s impairment of earning power would last until the end of Ms life expectancy, or, if not, how soon it would prob<a id="p568" href="#p568" data-label="568" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*568</a>ably change for the better, and to adjust their award of damages on that score accordingly; it would have been error to refuse such instructions had they been requested, and to omit them, even when not requested, was at least an inadequacy in charge, which ought to. be avoided - on another trial. (We shall discuss the point in hand at greater length, later on, when dealing with the last question enumerated in the first paragraph of this opinion). While, since the Act of 1923, P. L. 439, 440, amending the Act of May 11,1911, P. L. 279, a mere inadequacy of charge may be assigned as error under a general exception (Peterman v. Enggasser, <a href="/pa/280/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="280 Pa. 528" data-case-ids="1084449" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0528-01">280 Pa. 528</a>, 531), — which is all that appears on the present record, —it is still the; rule that, ordinarily, we will not reverse on such assignments alone. The above-quoted instructions, however, are not only inadequate, but also, as we have indicated, they contain errors of law, and these latter faults cannot be overlooked or accounted harmless under the circumstances of this case.</p>

Newcastle Elec. Co., <a href="/pa/251/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="251 Pa. 394" data-case-ids="1019866" data-case-paths="/pa/251/0394-01">251 Pa. 394</a>, 399, definitely said, “We have repeatedly held the failure......to instruct the jury......to find the present worth of future payments......, to be anticipated and capitalized in the verdict, eyen where no special requests for such instructions had been made, is reversible error,” and this principle has been followed and approved in several subsequent cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>; though in other cases<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> judgments were affirmed where the award of the jury was so small that it was clear the absence of such instructions had done no harm. After deliberate <a id="p569" href="#p569" data-label="569" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*569</a>consideration of the whole matter, we have now reached the conclusion that, notwithstanding the rule heretofore laid down in the cases first referred to in this paragraph, a mere failure to charge on the subject of the obligation of the jury to reduce its award of future payments, anticipated in a verdict, to their present worth, is not always to be held reversible error, particularly in the absence of a request so to charge or of any effort to call the trial judge’s attention to a lack of such instructions. On the contrary, there may be cases where, under such circumstances, the default would amount to no more than an inadequacy; therefore, we wish it understood that this particular omission will no longer be dogmatically classed by us as a reversible error. Whether the failure to charge on present worth was harmful error in the instant case, need not be decided, since, as already indicated, the judgment must be reversed with a venire facias de novo, on other grounds (see our discussion of subdivision “(a),” supra).</p>

Of course, where such instructions are given, they must be in proper form, and the jury’s attention should be called to the fact that a man’s earning power naturally decreases as his life approaches its end. This is particularly true of the manual laborer, but it also applies in <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>a less degree to the average brain worker. The point must be brought to the jury’s attention- so that, after the expectancy of life has been determined, proper allowances may be made for this natural decline, when computing losses brought about by the decrease of earning power attributable to the accident: see Reitler v. Pa. R. R., <a href="/pa/238/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="238 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="991603" data-case-paths="/pa/238/0001-01">238 Pa. 1</a>, 7; Burns v. Pa. R.

Again, particular care must be exercised to bring home to the jury the essential idea that the value of a lump sum received to-day is much greater than the value of a number of smaller sums of equal total amount received over a long period of time; it ought also to be pointed out, so the jury will understand, that a sum sufficient to provide from interest alone the amount of the estimated annual decrease in earning power, would be grossly excessive, since the entire capital would remain unimpaired at the date of plaintiff’s decease, whereas, of course, it is supposed to be absorbed by the annual payments: McLane v.

First, it must be. understood that direct application of annuity tables, —calculated, as they are, on the basis of a constant annual amount,^is never permissible in cases of the present type, because, if this course were pursued, the gradual decline in the average man’s earning capacity toward the end of his days would make the result inaccurate in any given case. Present-value tables have been held admissible only to show the proportionate relation between payments which would ordinarily be made in the future and a lump sum to be awarded at once as compensation for their loss: Seeherman v. The Wilkes-Barre Co., <a href="/pa/255/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="255 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1027630" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0011-01">255 Pa. </a><a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a><a href="/pa/255/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="255 Pa. 11" data-case-ids="1027630" data-case-paths="/pa/255/0011-01">11</a>, 16, 17; Fletcher v.

The purpose of admitting such tables has been to aid the jurors in making calculations they would otherwise have to figure out for themselves; but compensation for pecuniary loss is not to be arrived at by arithmetical processes alone, for it cannot be said that, the amount of the income being known, the loss is reduced to a mere matter of calculation, — the nature of the income previously enjoyed by the person involved and the probabilities of its continuance according to the particular circumstances on which it depends must be considered. In a case like the one at bar, plaintiff is not necessarily entitled to receive a perpetual annuity calculated on his loss of income from the date of the accident, for it is possible that, without regard to the effect of the accident in question, he might be disabled by illness, natural decline or other causes from continuing to earn the income he had before his injury. After taking into account the income itself, the circumstances under which it was earned by plaintiff, and all factors affecting the likelihood of its continuance, increase or diminution, as unaffected by the accident, the jurors are to say what, in their opinion, is fair compensation for the impairment of earning power, whether permanent or temporary, under which plaintiff suffers because of the accident; and, in order to work justice, the jury would have to understand that present-value tables could not be applied until the probable expectancy of the life in question had been decided and the amounts of future yearly losses determined. As pointed out earlier in this opinion, such losses are those due to diminution of earning power, and, as before indicated in the immediately preceding paragraph, usually a time arrives toward the end of the average man’s life when his earning power becomes less and less; in other words, the sums or losses to be decided on and reduced to their present value are variable in that, after a certain time, <a id="p572" href="#p572" data-label="572" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*572</a>to be determined in every case by the jury, the annual earnings generally become smaller each year. To expect a jury to determine these dates and amounts and then to apply the tables and reach present values, is to expect the impossible, — as long experience has shown. The question is, What, in the light of this experience, should now be held as to the admissibility of such tables at a jury trial? Do they in fact aid the jury to make proper calculations, or does their presence almost inevitably tend to their misuse, or, in other words, to'the direct application of them as though they were annuity tables? We are unanimously forced to the latter conclusion. This being so, we take advantage of the instant case, — where we have been materially aided by the researches and the arguments of able counsel, who considered all phases of the matter of proper evidence of future losses connected with impairment of earning power, — to say that, the present-worth tables should not be admitted at jury trials. They were not offered at the trial under review, and their absence did no harm.</p>

Where experience of long duration, and due judicial consideration, show a certain kind of evidence, though logically relevant, to be,-in practical effect, harmful, it may be excluded. The reasons for this rule are well stated in Sutton v. Bell, <a href="/njl/79/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="50" data-cite="79 N.J.L. 507" data-case-ids="297415" data-case-paths="/njl/79/0507-01">79 N. J.

[Exclusion of such evidence] is not therefore a rule of relevance based upon considerations of logic, but a juridical rule based upon experience.” Of course, such a rule must be sparingly applied, but it may be used in a proper case, and our experience shows it to be applicable to the kind of evidence we have been engaged in discussing under the subdivision in hand.</p>

The Carlisle tables and what are known as the American tables, the first based on the entire inhabitants of certain parishes in Carlisle, England (under living conditions different from those of the present, especially in our large cities), and the second made up from selected insured lives, were put in evidence by plaintiff. Both purport to show life expectancies at given ages; they were admitted without objection on the part of defendant, but the trial judge made no direct reference in his charge to either of them. When tables of this character are part of the evidence in a case, the court should carefully instruct concerning their use, and all the factors which tend to limit their application ought to be stressed. It is not enough for the trial judge to charge, as the judge in the present case evidently intended to do, that the tables are of some aid, but not conclusive, in determining the probable life of the plaintiff. “All the circumstances affecting the probable duration of plaintiff’s life as disclosed by the evidence......should [be] called to the attention of the jury”: Seifred v.

For if all these variables are not called plainly and directly to the attention of the jurors, they are likely to be entirely overlooked and the tables accepted as a constant and exclusive guide; whereas they are far from occupying that evidential position. While mortality tables have been held admissible in nearly all, if not all, the states of the Union, this court, from the beginning, has expressed doubts as to the wisdom of using them at jury trials, and has constantly called attention to the practical abuses to which the employment of such evidence is susceptible.</p>

      <a id="p575" href="#p575" data-label="575" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*575</a>In onr own State, mortality tables were first admitted at the trial of a negligence case in 1891, Steinbrunner v. Pittsburgh Ry.

Other cases on the general subject will be found in a note at the foot of this page.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The method of compilation of the Carlisle Tables and the reasons for their use are discussed by Paxson, C. J., in the Steinbrunner Case (p. 517), where he said: “While we are unable to see how such evidence is to be excluded, I must be allowed to express the fear that it may prove a dangerous element in this class of cases, unless the attention of juries is pointedly called to the other questions which affect it.” Subsequently, in Kerrigan v. P. R. R., <a href="/pa/194/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="70" data-cite="194 Pa. 98" data-case-ids="912476" data-case-paths="/pa/194/0098-01">194 Pa. 98</a>, 106, this court said: “Experience has demonstrated, however, that what was merely apprehended by Paxson, C. J., has since been realized. Courts and juries as a rule give far more weight to this testimony than it is entitled to; they are apt to supply the place of proof of expectancy of the particular life by generalization from life tables. This is going further than was intended or than is warranted ; therefore, a halt is called on the manifest tendency to give them undue weight.” Subsequent cases, while admitting the general competency of life tables, adhere to the strict rules concerning their use, the main essentials of which we have hereinbefore summarized. Finally, in none of our decisions have we said that such tables are necessary to either plaintiff’s or defendant’s <a id="p576" href="#p576" data-label="576" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*576</a>case; we have merely said that they are relevant proofs and admissible when offered.</p>
    <p id="b600-4" data-blocks='[["BL_600.4",600,[260,462,1161,973]]]'>We have now reached the conclusion that the admissibility of these tables is subject to two well-recognized principles: (1) Where there is already sufficient evidence before the jury from which, without the aid of the tables, it can properly decide the probable duration of the life in question, the trial judge may exercise his sound discretion, as in the case of any matter of cumulative evidence, and decline to admit the tables on the ground of lack of necessity. (2) Where under the facts of a particular case, the admission of the tables would tend to do more harm than good (if, for instance, the plaintiff did not enjoy normally good health before the accident,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> or is following a particularly hazardous occupation, or there is no reasonable probability of the financially harmful effects of the injury lasting till the end of plaintiff’s life), the trial judge, in the exercise of a sound discretion, may bar them, just as he may refuse any other evidence which will tend to confuse or mislead the jury.</p>

Plaintiff’s business pursuit was that of an adjuster for an employers’ liability insurance company. The injury to his shoulder left his right arm in such bad condition that his hand “cramped” after he wrote “steadily for three or four minutes,” and this made him give up his calling. Defendant produced expert medical testimony that “practically 100 per cent of dislocations have adhesions” which might cause the condition of which plaintiff complained, and that, when “passive-motion” treatment was not sufficient to overcome these adhesions, it was usual to break them forcibly, with the patient under an anaesthetic; that this treatment was resorted to in “practically every case,” and, though causing the patient to suffer increased pain for a few weeks, it restored the <a id="p577" href="#p577" data-label="577" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*577</a>affected part to normal “in the majority of cases.” This doctor testified that, in his professional opinion, plaintiff’s case was the ordinary one of dislocation of the shoulder, and that, under the usual treatment, as described by him, “at least 70 per cent” of such cases recovered normal use of the affected member.</p>

D., L. &amp; W. R. R.
