Claiming that, under the Intestate Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 429 (which, as will be observed, was passed between the date of her husband’s conveyance and his death), she was entitled to a $5,000 absolute interest in that property, and also to a fee simple estate in an undivided one-half of the balance, she filed the present bill in equity for partition.

Laws 143, 145, says that, after payment of debts, “the remaining part of any lands, tenements and hereditaments, and personal estate, of any person deceased, <em>not sold </em>or disposed of by will, nor otherwise limited by marriage settlement,” shall be divided between the widow and the heirs or next of kin in the way stated. By the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 315 (which was drafted by William Rawle, Thomas I. Wharton and Joel Jones, commissioners appointed under the resolution of March 23, 1830, P. L. <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>408, to “revise, collate and digest......the civil code of this State”), it is provided, in section 1, that distribution of “the real and personal estate of a decedent, whether male or female, remaining after payment of all just debts and legal charges, <em>which shall not have been sold </em>or disposed of by will, or otherwise limited by marriage settlement, shall be divided” between the widow and heirs or next of kin as therein specified. The Act of 1833 was amended by the Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 87, but, so far as affects the question now under consideration, the latter statute simply quoted and reenacted the foregoing language of the Act of 1833. Finally came the Act of 1917, — first above quoted and now being construed, — which was drafted by Judges John Marshall Gest and Thomas J. Baldrige and by George E. Alter, Esq., the commissioners appointed by virtue of the Act of April 23,1915, P. L. 177, “to codify and revise the law of decedents’ estates.” There is no language in any of the statutes above quoted, nor in the careful reports of the commissioners proposing the enactment of those of 1833 and 1917, which limits the scope of the words we have italicized. On the contrary, each of those statutes provides only for distribution of the real and personal estate of decedents, and hence excludes from its purview property which was not part of the estate of a decedent.</p>

They cannot be made to refer to sales for the purpose of settling a decedent’s estate, since this is provided for by the clause “remaining after payment of all just debts and legal charges.” Nor are they limited to property which shall have been “sold......by will,” for property is not thus sold; if any had been, decedent would not have died intestate as to it, and hence these statutes would have had no application to it. It is clear, therefore, that the italicized words, as appearing in the various statutes, must be given their n&lt; rmal meaning (un<a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>less — which possibility we will hereinafter exclude, so far as relates to lands previously sold — section 3 of the Act of 1917 now compels a different conclusion) ; as a consequence, property sold by a decedent, without the joinder of his wife, is not within the purview of any of these acts, and plaintiff is entitled to have only the dower given to her by the common law.</p>

Nichols, <a href="/pa/12/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="12 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="963799" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0038-01">12 Pa. 38</a>, 42, it is said that “the Act of 1794,.....like its successor of 1833, has reference solely to the realty of which the baron was owner at the time of his death: Riddlesberger v. Mentzer, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20W.%20141" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="7 W. 141">7 W. 141</a>. If this be the true meaning of the older statute, and I do not understand it is denied, by what warrant can we ascribe a broader signification to the Act of 1797,...... The truth is, no one can read these statutes and those that have followed them of like import, without at once perceiving their operation was intended to be confined to lands an intestate had left to descend on his heirs, or a testator had given to his devisees. The simple absence of every direct expression, indicative of a design to bring lands aliened within the purview of the enactments, ought, in itself, to be accepted as sufficiently proving no such design was entertained; for surely, had the lawmaker intended so important' a change in the existing law, he would not have left it to a doubtful inference drawn from inconclusive reasoning. This suggestion is in accordance with one of the primary canons of construction, which teaches that statutes are to be interpreted in subordination to the common law, a change of which is not to be imputed to the legislative body, where the legislative act can be construed in harmony with it.” This reasoning was cited with approval in Gray v. McCune, <a href="/pa/23/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="23 Pa. 447" data-case-ids="974056" data-case-paths="/pa/23/0447-01">23 Pa. 447</a>, 449-50, and the conclusion reached has never sincé been doubted. As the Act of 1917, so far as regards the instant question, contains substantially the same language as the statutes considered in those opinions, it must, of course, receive the same construction <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>(Hedrick v. Harrisburg, <a href="/pa/278/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="278 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1080627" data-case-paths="/pa/278/0274-01">278 Pa. 274</a>), unless the latter part of section 3, which is a departure from the others, compels a different result as to conveyances made before its passage; and to this question we now address ourselves.</p>
    <p id="b399-3" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[121,630,1158,1740]]]'>It is at once apparent that, if section 1 is considered without reference to section 3, and the expression “which shall not have been sold” is construed according to the usual signification of those words, plaintiff can have no statutory interest in the land now being partitioned; for that language is broad enough to include — and therefore to exclude from the class of gifts provided for in the act — all land aliened by a decedent, whether before or after the passage of the statute. This much, at least, is established by the foregoing reasoning and authorities. On the other hand, if the language of section 3 is to be broadly interpreted without reference to section 1, a widow will have the statutory interest in lands aliened by her husband, whether the sale was made before or after the passage of the act. These two constructions cannot coexist; hence we must find a way to reconcile the two provisions, and this may readily be done by treating the act as prospective only. Thus considered, section 1 will give the widow the interest specified in section 2(a) in lands “which shall not have been sold” by decedent before the passage of the act; and by section 3 “her share in lands aliened by the husband in his lifetime [after the passage of the act].....shall be the same as her share in lands of which the husband died seized.” This is the only reasonable reconciling interpretation to be given to the two sections, and it has the additional merits of according with the rule as to prospective statutory operation, of avoiding a possible injustice to purchasers of land before the act was passed, and of so construing the statute that it will agree, as nearly as may be, with the theretofore existing course of the common law: Kates’s Estate, <a href="/pa/282/0417-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="282 Pa. 417" data-case-ids="1088423" data-case-paths="/pa/282/0417-01">282 Pa. 417</a>.</p>

Nichols, <a href="/pa/12/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="12 Pa. 38" data-case-ids="963799" data-case-paths="/pa/12/0038-01">supra,</a> necessarily means at the time •of his death; and since, at that time, this decedent had no interest in the property sought to be partitioned, plaintiff could obtain no rights in it “under the provisions of this act,” as she nevertheless claims to do.</p>

Each of them refers, in terms, to the real and personal estates of decedents, and to no other estates; hence this contention has been fully answered by what we have already said. Plaintiff vigorously contends, however, that, because no reason is given why á nonsupporting husband (section 5), a deserting wife (section 6) and a murdering spouse (section 23), should not be deprived of all interest in lands conveyed by the other spouse during his or her lifetime, just as certainly and effectually as in property passing under the intestate laws, the necessary conclusion is that the legislature must have intended to include both classes within the purview of these three sections, and hence of the statute generally, including the part of section 3 now under consideration. This is a clear non sequitur, however. The learned commissioners who drafted the act, and the legislature which passed it, were alike familiar with article III, section 3 of the state Constitution, and hence wisely limited the three sections mentioned to the distribution of the real and personal property of intestates, which was the one subject clearly expressed in the title of the statute.</p>

This point was squarely raised in defendants’ answers, and perhaps with sufficient certainty in one of the exceptions to the adjudication of the trial judge; but the dismissal of that exception is not specified as error, and the only assignment which even remotely suggests the point, is the one which objects to the final decree. The statement of the questions involved does not refer to it, nor was it argued in the briefs or orally.
