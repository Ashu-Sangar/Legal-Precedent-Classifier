At the trial, after plaintiff had produced his case in full, the presiding judge concluded there was no evidence to sustain a verdict against the last-named defendant, and, accordingly, entered a non-<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>suit as to it.

As to this, it is sufficient to say that the present statute contains but one subject, which is expressed with sufficient clearness in its title. The act was evidently drawn to remedy a procedural difficulty which existed in our law when two or more defendants were charged with joint liability and it was not proved as alleged; this purpose is amply covered by the title employed.

Doubtless it was to meet this condition of affairs and to give a practical and speedy remedy in such cases that the Act of 1923 was passed.

In one of these questions appellant treats the case as having to do with a joint tort, and, in the other, as involving two separate, though, in the above sense, “concurrent,” torts. In this connection, howevex*, it is sufficient to say that, as we view the statement of claim, it avers a joint tort in the sense of “a community of fault which occasioned the injury” (see Howard v. Union Traction Co., <a href="/pa/195/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="195 Pa. 391" data-case-ids="914125" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0391-01">195 Pa. 391</a>, 395; O’Malley v.

    <p id="b271-4" data-blocks='[["BL_271.5",271,[131,1302,1155,797]]]'>The act in question provides: “Whenever it is pleaded in any suit that two or more defendants are jointly liable for the cause of action specified, and [1], in the opinion of the trial judge, the evidence may not justify a recovery against some of them, the suit shall not be dismissed as to all, but the case shall be submitted to the jury, if the facts are in dispute, to determine which, if any of them, are liable, or, [2] if the facts are not in dispute, the question of liability of any or all of them may be reserved for consideration by the court in banc, or [3] the suit may be dismissed as to some and the trial proceed against the others, in every such contingency with the same effect as if the defendants ultimately found to be liable were the only ones [originally] alleged to be so.”</p>

    <p id="b272-4" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[276,756,1157,525]]]'>The provision marked “[2]” is meant to cover cases where joint liability of the defendants is pleaded in plaintiff’s statement of claim, but where, at the end of the trial, after taking the evidence into consideration, the presiding judge is doubtful as to whether or not, on the undisputed facts, a joint liability of one or more of the defendants has been proved. Under such circumstances, the trial judge may reserve the point concerning which he is in doubt for consideration of the court in banc.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.5",272,[276,1301,1156,525]]]'>The provision marked “[3]” is to cover cases where, though the statement of claim avers a joint liability, it appears, at the close of plaintiff’s case, on the undisputed evidence produced by him, or at any other stage of the trial, by proper admissions or undisputed proofs, that recovery against one or more of the defendants cannot be sustained in law. In such cases the trial judge may dismiss the suit as to the defendants who are so shown to be not liable, and permit it to proceed against the others.</p>

At the close of the testimony produced by plaintiff, it appeared that, when the taxicab in which he was riding eastward on Chestnut Street, Philadelphia (a public highway 60 feet wide from houseline to houseline, containing a 26-foot wide roadway), was about 45 feet from the westernmost line of Seventh Street (a public highway 50 feet wide, with a roadway 26 feet in width), an <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>automobile truck, belonging to the Public Ledger Company, emerged from the southernmost houseline of Chestnut Street, going north on Seventh Street, at approximately 20 miles an hour, which was the same rate of speed at which the taxicab was traveling, and that the chauffeur of the latter vehicle, — instead of allowing the driver of the truck to have the right of way to which he was entitled under the law (see Act of June 30, 1919, P. L. 678), — speeded the taxi, and then, in order to avoid a collision, attempted to turn in the direction in which the truck was going, causing the taxicab to run up on the pavement of the building at the northeast corner of Seventh and Chestnut streets and to crash against the wall of that structure, thereby injuring plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b273-4" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[133,1120,1154,592]]]'>It follows from what has already been said that the dismissal of the suit against the Public Ledger Company was authorized in law and warranted in fact, and hence, perhaps, we might wisely end our opinion at this point were it not that to do so would give countenance to the mistaken idea entertained by appellant that one in its position is entitled to question the entry of a nonsuit against another defendant pleaded as jointly liable with it. For convenience in disposing of the questions thus far discussed, we have treated the case as though such a right exists; but the law is otherwise.</p>

Boston &amp; M. R. R., <a href="/nh/69/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="69 N.H. 429" data-case-ids="536748" data-case-paths="/nh/69/0429-01">69 N.

Goodall, <a href="/pa/10/0133-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="10 Pa. 133" data-case-ids="962666" data-case-paths="/pa/10/0133-01">10 Pa. 133</a>, 134; Fitzpatrick v.

Superior Ct. 173</a>, 176); hence, with us, the nonsuit injures no one, and cannot be assigned as error. What must be held to have been adjudicated when the motion of one entitled under our statutes (Act of 1836, P. L. 76, section 7; Act of 1875, P. L. 6) to ask for the removal of a nonsuit has <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>so acted, thus submitting himself to an appealable judgment, and the effect in subsequent suits of such a judgment (see Finch v. Conrade, <a href="/pa/154/0326-01" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="154 Pa. 326" data-case-ids="842330" data-case-paths="/pa/154/0326-01">154 Pa. 326</a>, 328; Hartman v.

Ins. Co., 6 Pa. L. Journal 373, 4 Clark 54) we need not here discuss, for the only one authorized so to proceed is the plaintiff against whom the nonsuit was entered. In other words, the fact that appellant is one of' two defendants named as liable in plaintiff’s pleadings, gives it no right to move to take off the non-suit entered in favor of the second defendant, since the nonsuit is not a judgment against appellant; and the further fact that the latter has chosen to pursue this course cannot add to its rights. Neither the Act of 1923 nor any other statute gave appellant the right to ask for the removal of the nonsuit, and, not possessing the right to seek such relief, it cannot here complain of its refusal. Then, again, as pointed out above, the nonsuit harms no one in the position of this appellant.</p>
