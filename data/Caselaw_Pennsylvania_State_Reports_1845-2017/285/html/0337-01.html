The letter was issued May 8th, and was to cover the price of 100 tons of sugar purchased in Java. On September 23,1920, a draft, with the necessary documents, for the above sum, less $1.65, was informally presented to appellee by the Japanese Bank of <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>Taiwan, the owner. The documents consisted of a bill of lading, consular invoice, commercial invoice, declaration by shipper of food and drug products, certificate of origin of sugar and policies of insurance. The bill of lading, in addition to the printed provisions, had written across its face, in red ink, special notations setting forth that the steamer was not responsible for bursting of bags and loss of contents or for liquefaction of sugar. Other typewritten notices set forth that all expenses incurred at the destination, such as repairing packages, including cost of materials, should be paid by the consignee before delivery; and that the steamer was not responsible for breakage or loss of contents due to frail packages. Appellants decided that the bill of lading was not a correct or “clean” bill because of the notations on its face, and not in accordance with the letter of credit. They instructed the bank to make no payments on it under the latter. Afterwards the draft, with the documents attached, was formally presented to appellee when it was decided by Camp and representatives of appellee to refuse to accept the draft for the reason above stated. Later, Camp and his coplaintiffs notified appellee not to pay, and agreed that, if the matter remained unadjusted for thirty days, satisfactory security indemnifying appellee from loss would be given. The president of the drawee bank, about October 29th, informed appellants that, unless a bond was furnished, the draft would be paid. No bond having been furnished, and appellee meanwhile having secured additional data to meet the objections, and having been given a bond of indemnity by the Bank of Taiwan, paid the draft November 19th.

      <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>Tested by the foregoing principles, should the bank have refused payment of the draft because of the notations on the bill of lading? As stated in the review of facts, the bill of lading was charged as not being “clean” or “customary” because of the four notations. The letter of credit did not require a “clean” bill of lading under the strict interpretation that term has sometimes been given. No statute has been referred to regulating the form of a foreign bill of lading in the light of the objection, and it is assumed by the parties that the printed bill is the customary one. Whether or not it is so “unclean” as to stop payment of the draft, because of these notations, must depend entirely on their effect when construed with the printed part. The purchaser had a right to expect a bill conforming to the customary one, and these notations would add materially to the vendee’s burden if it were not for the fact that they are substantially reiterations of what is contained in the printed part. Such a bill may not be strictly regarded as a “clean” bill, because the writing challenges the immediate attention of the consignee, though imposing no additional responsibility, nor in any wise limiting the obligation of the consignor or carrier. We find no reason, and none has been offered, for holding a writing that does not change the contractual obligations of the parties and adds nothing to the printed matter should defeat payment merely because it is a writing on the bill. As we view the testimony of Zeller, it does not conflict with our deductions. Banks are in duty bound to examine all the papers for discrepancies, and they are not required to look at any other documents than those specified in the letter of credit to determine whether there has been a compliance therewith: Bank of Taiwan v. Union National Bank of Phila., 1 Fed. (2d) 65 (3d C. C. A.); Pan-American Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. National City Bank, supra. It is urged the jury should have determined from the evidence whether, under the custom of the trade, the shipping documents were correct and in <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>accordance with the provisions of the letter of credit. The question which bank officials must decide when a draft is presented, is whether, from an inspection of the papers, they come within the letter of credit. It did not require the aid of parol evidence to determine this fact, where, as here, their language was clear and unambiguous and the deduction to be drawn free from doubt.</p>
    <p id="b370-4" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[276,739,1159,808]]]'>A more serious question arises when considering the effect of these words in the printed part of the bill of lading stating the sugar was received by the agents of the steamship company “to be transported by the steamer Arcturus or any other steamer,” as being at variance with the letter of credit and agreement. The letter specifies “shipments during July 1920;......the shipments must be completed and drafts drawn on or before August 15, 1920.” This bill, it is argued, should have shown “shipment in July,” a condition to be strictly complied with because of the fluctuations in the price of sugar. Appellants say the bill of lading is one commonly known as a “to be transported bill” and not a “received on board bill,” the latter showing the goods to be actually on board the vessel.</p>
    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[278,1559,1156,525]]]'>We need not discuss the effect of the earlier cases where the term shipment has been construed. In recent decisions it has been given a broader meaning: Marlborough Hill v. Cowan &amp; Sons, L. R. (1921) 1 App. Cas. 444; Vietor v. National City Bank of New York, <a href="/citations/?q=193%20N.Y.S.%20868" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="193 N.Y.S. 868">supra.</a> Nor need we consider again the rule announced in National City Bank v.

The sugar reached New York on October 2d. The letter and contract required shipment on or before August 15th, but did not require an “on board” <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>bill of lading. Shipment was to be a fact; it nowhere appears in the bill of lading that the shipment had been actually made or the merchandise was on board the vessel. The bill of lading named the vessel or some other vessel of the shipping agents. If the bill of lading had been the only document accompanying the draft, the bank officers, who were to examine only the papers before them, when the draft was presented, with the sugar not in port, would place the bank in a serious position by payment. But some of the documents accompanying the bill of lading did state sufficient to show shipment as a fact. The sellers’ declaration, being a part of the documents, speaks of the “shipment’’ covered by the invoice as being “exported from Pasoeroean,” and the contracts of insurance, likewise a part of the same documents, characterize the sugar as being “in the ship or vessel called Arcturus.” With this information, the bank could very properly regard the sugar as on board the vessel. This would justify the conclusion by the bank that the goods sold were “shipped” within the letter of credit.</p>

Only the notations on the bill and another very general reason were given as objections.

Good faith requires it. If the customer was not satisfied with the bill of lading because of a lack of clear proof of “shipment,” it should have specified its objection: Littlejohn v.

This responsibility rests on the bank, apart from notice. Where, however, the buyer, interested in the faithful execution of the contract, undertakes to assume the bank’s responsibility by directing nonpayment and calls attention to defects, of which he has knowledge or the means of obtaining it, natural justice and equity require that he should be held to the specifications wherein he claims the instrument is faulty. This is on the principle of estoppel. As stated by Mr. Justice Schaffer, in Bulliet, Trustee, v.

Discretion involves the exercise of independent judgment or the power of the officers of the bank to act without control, but it does not include an arbitrary or capricious judgment or. an abuse of power. This stipulation, <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>that their discretion would alone determine whether the documents were correct or unimpeachable, would not warrant the bank in accepting a draft where the documents showed on their face they were not in conformity to the letter, including the contract. The latter might fix the price of sugar at ten cents a pound, while the bill of lading might double that figure. To accept a draft under such circumstances would be a manifest abuse of a discretionary power; no such facts are shown in this case.</p>
    <p id="b373-3" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[112,867,1155,755]]]'>It is urged that good faith was not exercised in accepting the draft, as it was not paid until six weeks after its first receipt. The reason for this delay will be discussed later; but even if the drawee bank ultimately concluded to pay the draft because, as is stated, appellants could not furnish bond, it is uncontradicted that, prior to that time, the bank recognized the validity of the documents, and must have concluded it would not further jeopardize commercial relations with foreign institutions by withholding payment of a perfectly valid instrument. The question of good faith cannot fairly be raised in this case, at least, by appellants. The bank showed the latter every consideration possible consistent with good banking practice.</p>

This was followed by a similar notice on September 29th, followed by another on October 5th; this latter notice provided that the bank should “refuse and continue to refuse” to pay, and a promise that if the matter was not settled in thirty days, appellants would endeavor to give a bond. The drawee bank for a time acquiesced in appellants’ view as to the validity of the draft; it waited the thirty days at appellants’ express request. No bond being produced, appellee waited a second presentation of the draft. This was made November <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>19th. Whatever the delay, either before or after the thirty days, it was the direct result of appellants’ continued and persistent efforts to secure nonpayment of the draft. Camp sold the sugar and applied the proceeds in reduction of damages. Under all these circumstances we cannot hold the bank liable for delay when it did just what appellants asked it to do.</p>
