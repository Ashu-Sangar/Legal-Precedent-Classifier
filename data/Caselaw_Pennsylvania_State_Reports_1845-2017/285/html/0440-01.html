The pumps were stopped at the close of the day and it was Cymbor’s duty to return during the night and set them going so the water would be removed from the mine when work was resumed in the morning. His home was about twelve hundred feet from the mine and he walked to and from usually on the tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. At about ten o’clock on the evening of October 5, 1921, Cymbor took his lantern, went from his home to the mine, started the pumps and, while returning on the railroad tracks, was killed by an engine. He was paid by the hour for his work at the mine and extra for starting the pumps at night; for the latter he kept his own time and turned it in every two weeks; the amount thereof was not shown. It took but a moment to start the pumps, the real time was in going to and from. It might be inferred that he charged the actual time he was from home on this errand; in any <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>event, he could properly have done so. The widow’s claim for compensation, allowed by the referee and workmen’s compensation board, was reversed by the court of common pleas; therefrom she brings this appeal.</p>

Had it been Cymbor’s duty to unlock the plant in the morning, so the workmen could enter, would he be in the master’s employ while going to and from the plant, or merely while turning the key, or at most while on the master’s premises, and is there any difference between unlocking a door and starting a pump, between turning a key and turning a button? In either case the real labor is in going to and from, and while doing so the employee is engaged in the master’s business the same as if sent on an errand from the mine to a neighboring village. As suggested by appellant, had plaintiff lived five miles away, could it <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>be urged he was only on duty when actually starting the pumps, and yet the principle would be the same. Cymbor, when killed, was on the usual and direct route from his home to the mine, so the suggestion that he may have been going elsewhere is without force. The case is not analogous to that of a day laborer whose work and pay begin when he arrives in the morning and end when he quits in the afternoon. His furtherance of the master’s business begins and ends with the work of the day. In the instant case, to hold the employee was furthering the master’s business only after reaching the mine or while starting the pumps, is drawing too fine a sight on a statute which must be liberally construed: Pater v.
