Philadelphia, supra, where a witness in attendance at court had been crushed to death by an elevator and the charge of negligence consisted in a failure of a locking device to work, this court said: “Whether this evidence was sufficient for the purpose for which it was offered we need not decide, for the plaintiffs were not called upon for specific proof that the city had been negligent. Their case was for the jury when they showed their father had been crushed to death by the elevator through no fault or negligence on his part, and it was for the defendant to rebut the contention that it had been negligent.” The court then stated the duty of common carriers to protect passengers as follows: “The slightest neglect against which human prudence and foresight may guard, and by which hurt or loss is occasioned, will render them liable to answer in damages, Nay, the mere happening of an injurious accident, raises prima facie a presumption of neglect, and throws upon the carrier the onus of showing it did not exist.” This presumption may of course be rebutted by showing the accident was one which the utmost skill, foresight and <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>diligence could not have prevented: Meier v.

The court goes on at some length to justify the conclusion thus reached, holding that the owner was bound not only to provide safe and suitable cars, appliances and machinery for motion and control, but also to exercise the strictest care in managing these means of transportation: see Treadwell v. Whittier, <a href="/cal/80/0574-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="80 Cal. 574" data-case-ids="1947135" data-case-paths="/cal/80/0574-01">80 Cal. 574</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20P.%20266" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="22 P. 266">22 Pac. 266</a>; Hartford Deposit Co. v.

    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[319,896,1158,1346]]]'>Since the owner of an elevator is not the insurer of the safety of persons carried on the elevator, the burden of proving negligence is on the plaintiff. In this, as stated in Fox v. Phila., <a href="/pa/208/0127-01" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="208 Pa. 127" data-case-ids="998159" data-case-paths="/pa/208/0127-01">supra,</a> and in Riland v.

Where that which causes the injury is under the sole management and control of the owner or his representative, and is an agency wherein the slightest negligence will be followed by injuries of the most frightful consequences to those within the agency, who are utterly ignorant of what ought to be done for their safety and in a position of passive helplessness, and an accident happens that in the ordinary course would not happen had those in control used proper care or which human knowledge, skill and foresight could have guarded against, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of an explanation, that the accident happened as a result of the want of care: 9 R. C. L. 1259; 10 C. J. 1039. Those who use elevators (and they number a large percentage of the people) are absolutely at the mercy of the owners and operators, and are entitled to the benefit of this rigid rule of law where an injury occurs either through the operation of the car, defect in its machinery or improper maintenance of its parts.</p>

This was the fair effect of appellant’s evidence and the jury could well infer that some act of his caused the car to move. He had control of the only device that could keep the elevator stationary or cause it to move. This too appears from the evidence. Kemble, as appellant’s witness, denied that he was on the car, and stated that, when the car reached the ground floor, he locked it so that it could not move, and stepped off to the corridor. We need not discuss his act in leaving the car with a passenger on it, a heavy object to be moved off, and someone on the outside to assist in moving it; but even if his statement is true, he could not have locked the safety device that held the car, or else it was defective. Otherwise the car would have remained stationary, which it did not do. This evidence, however, was clearly for the jury, and their finding was adverse to appellant’s contention.</p>

Where one has alighted from an elevator but is engaged as deceased was in direct connection with or relation to the car, and by some non-negligent act of his is injured, he has not lost his identity as a passenger, and the duty of the carrier still exists: Fox v.

The specific act which caused the car to move is not stated with particularity, and any negligent act of appellant which “allowed it to move upward” was competent proof of the charge. The court below permitted evidence of other causes to be introduced which appellant says were not germane to the issues raised in the pleadings. It is true plaintiff may waive the right to invoke a presumption of <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>negligence, by pleading specific acts of negligence as the cause of the injury: Orcutt v. Century Building, supra. But in this case the averment amounted to a general charge of negligence. An examination of the record shows that all evidence offered as to the causes of the accident had a definite relation to the charge of “negligently allowing the elevator to move upward.” If appellant felt it was entitled to have the causes set forth more specifically in the pleadings it should have taken proceedings to that end.</p>

To say that Kemble Was a servant of McKnight would not establish a fellow servant relation to this appellant. The latter would not be the employer.

McKnight was bound to perform the particular piece of work for his master McKeefrey. Kemble’s relation to it and McKnight to Kemble came through the use and operation of the elevator. But this use and <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>operation was no more than the ordinary nse and the performance of the ordinary duties which his master, this appellant, required of the service Kemble was temporarily engaged in. This service was for McKnight or any one having business with appellant. It was the duty of appellant, using generally such appliances in connection with his business, to furnish the elevator service, and he could neither delegate nor permit someone else to delegate this duty to others so as to relieve him from responsibility: Sciolara v. Asch, <a href="/ny/198/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="198 N.Y. 77" data-case-ids="58122" data-case-paths="/ny/198/0077-01">198 N.

The safe was appellant’s property being moved on its elevator operated by Kemble, its chief engineer, who had complete control of the instrumentality which caused the death. That McKnight was not a fellow servant with Kemble of appellant is fully demonstrated by Justice Schaffer’s opinion in Eckert v. Ship Building Corp., <a href="/pa/280/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="280 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="1084474" data-case-paths="/pa/280/0340-01">280 Pa. 340</a>. For the reasons given, the rule applicable in cases of fellow servants (Spees v.

    <p id="b521-5" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[120,1478,1154,863]]]'>In unloading the safe, McKnight placed himself in front of it while his helper stood at the rear and pushed it forward and by their combined efforts the safe was to be forced into the corridor. McKnight’s position became dangerous when the elevator moved upward; the trial judge was of opinion he was not guilty of contributory negligence by standing in front of the safe aiding in its removal. We agree that his position was not one of such obvious danger that the court could declare it so as a matter of law. He was not bound to foresee or even remotely anticipate the negligent act of appellant. Had the safe been on a second or intermediate floor and descended, the man who stood in the car would have been subject to the same danger as McKnight. The question of contributory negligence was fairly for the jury.</p>
