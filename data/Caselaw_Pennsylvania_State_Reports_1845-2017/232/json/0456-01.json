        "text": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Moschziskee,\nThis is an action instituted by a wife and husband under sec. 1, of the Act of May 8,1895, P. L. 54, to recover for personal injuries to the former and consequential losses to the latter. Pending the action the husband died and his wife was appointed administratrix of his estate; she continued the suit and obtained two verdicts, one for $2,000 in her own right, and the other for $500, as the personal representative of the estate of her deceased husband. Judgments were entered on both of these verdicts and the defendant has appealed.\nThe questions involved as printed in the appellant\u2019s paper-book suggest but two points for our consideration; the first is, \u201cDoes action brought by husband for negligent injury to wife not resulting in her death survive to his personal representatives?\u201d To start with, \u201cAt common law, a cause of action by a husband to recover for personal injuries to his wife, and for loss of her services and for medical expenses resulting from such injuries, did not survive the death of either party:\u201d 21 Ency. of Plead. & Prac., 341. Generally speaking, a right of action to recover damages for injuries done to person or property did not survive; but this rule was relaxed by the statute of 4 Edw. Ill, chap. 7, and its supplements, so that thereafter, in certain instances, personal representatives had the same remedy as the decedent himself. While these old English statutes were declared to be in force in Pennsylvania, and were given a liberal construction, still it was held that they had reference only to wrongs which had inured to the benefit of the defendant or increased the assets of his estate at the expense of the personal property of the plaintiff\u2019s decedent: Penrod v. Morrison, 2 P. & W. 126; Lattimore v. Simmons, 13 S. & R. 183. But the Act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 70, provided by sec. 26, \u201cThe executors or administrators of any person who at the time of his decease was a party,- plaintiff, .... in any action .... shall have full power, if the cause, of action doth by law survive to them, to become party thereto, and prosecute .... such suit .... to final judgment .... as fully as such decedent - might have done if he had lived . . . .,\u201d and by sec. 28, \u201cExecutors or administrators shall have power to commence and prosecute all personal actions which the decedent whom they represent might have commenced and prosecuted, except actions for slander, for libels, and for wrongs done to the person; . . . .\u201d\nThe words \u201cexcept actions for .... wrongs done to the person,\u201d as used in this statute, do not describe a type of action but mean actions to recover for wrongs in the nature of physical injuries done to the person of the plaintiff decedent; and in interpreting this statute they have been so construed: Moe v. Smiley, 125 Pa. 136. At the time the statute was passed a husband had the common-law right \u201cto commence and prosecute\u201d an action in tort to recover for the loss of his \u201cwife\u2019s society and services, and for expenses incurred:\u201d 21 Cyc. 1526; Donoghue v. Consol. Trac. Co., 201 Pa. 181. Since the effect of the act of 1834, supra, was to make all actions which a decedent had the right to commence and prosecute survive to his personal representatives, other than those particularly excepted (Miller v. Wilson, 24 Pa. 114, 122), and since the act did not except actions of this character, a husband\u2019s right to recover damages for the loss of the services of his wife survives his death.\nBefore leaving this branch of the case it may be well to note that the phrase \u201cwrongs done to the person\u201d in sec. 28 of the act of 1834, supra, and the phrase \u201cinjuries to the person\u201d in sec. 18 of the Act of April 15, 1851, P. L. 669, are similar in meaning (Moe v. Smiley, supra); and that we have uniformly treated the latter as signifying injuries to the person of the plaintiff bringing the action, (Birch v. Ry. Co., 165 Pa. 339; Taylor\u2019s Est., 179 Pa. 254; Maher v. Traction Co., 181 Pa. 391; Rodebaugh v. Traction Co., 190 Pa. 358, 362; McCafferty v. Railroad Co., 193 Pa. 339; Edwards v. Gimbel, 202 Pa. 30, 39); and not as designating a. type of action arising in whatever way from injuries to the person. The two sections referred to deal with a like subject, and there is no reason why the similar phrases used in each should not be given a like limited meaning. But if they were to be given a broader signification and held to embrace all actions growing out of injuries to the person, then the verdict recovered by the personal representatives of the deceased husband 'would fall within the remedial provision of sec. 18 of the act of 1851, supra. However, looking at the question for determination -in the light of our decided cases, we are brought to the conclusion that the phrases must be construed as before stated, that the act of 1834, supra, saved the action of Anthony W. Smith from abating by his death, and that his suit could be \u201cprosecuted\u201d by his administratrix \u201cas fully as such decedent might have done if he had lived.\u201d\nThe second question involved as stated by the appellant is, \u201cCan plaintiff recover on proof of negligence not alleged in her statement filed?\u201d The defendant contends that the testimony adduced was not sufficient to support the averment in the statement describing the occurrence which brought the injuries upon the plaintiff, Mary Smith. The testimony was sufficient, if believed, to justify the jury in finding that a defective condition of the defendant\u2019s tracks, which had existed for a sufficient length of time to put it on notice, caused one of its cars to become derailed and run into the frame dwelling house occupied by the plaintiff, thereby throwing Mrs. Smith to the floor' and producing the \u2019injuries of which she complained. Under these circumstances we cannot say that the allegata and probata did not agree, or that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, if the jury saw fit to accept the testimony of the plaintiff and her witnesses.\nThe first, second, third and sixth assignments which cover all of the matters comprehended in or suggested by the statement of the questions involved, are overruled; the other assignments which complain of instructions and rulings unrelated to these matters and in no way suggested by the statement of the question involved, are dismissed: Willock v. Railroad Co., 229 Pa. 526. If the appellant desired the points covered by these latter assignments reviewed, it would have been sufficient, after stating the main questions for determination, had counsel added a few words to this effect, \u201cCorrectness of instructions as to the effect of nonproduction of certain testimony, and concerning the condition and conduct of plaintiff after accident; rulings on admission and rejection of testimony.\u201d If those instructions and rulings were necessarily involved in or suggested by the principal questions stated, then this course would not be required, or desired. While we do not specifically pass upon the assignments in question, we will say that we are not convinced that the court below fell into any reversible error.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

In an action to recover damages for personal injuries the allegata and probata are not out of agreement and there is sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict where the statement of claim avers, that on a certain date the defendant railroad company was operating a train of cars on its railroad in the vicinity of plaintiff\u2019s home; \u201cthat the said train of cars, through the negligence and carelessness of the said defendant and its employees, left the tracks of the said defendant company on which it was then and there being operated by the said defendant company and its employees, and crashed into the said home, where the said plaintiff was then and there sitting,\u201d the impact and shock throwing her from her chair and injuring her, and the testimony is sufficient, if believed, to justify the jury in finding that a defective condition of the defendant\u2019s tracks, which had existed for a sufficient length of time to put it on notice, caused one of its cars to become derailed and run into the frame dwelling house occupied by the plaintiff, thereby \u25a0throwing her to thp floor and producing the injuries of which she complained.\nAppeals \u2014 Supreme Court \u2014 Paper-books\u2014Matter not embraced in statement of questions involved.\n4.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad Company.\nBefore Fell, C. J., Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Moschzisker, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nTrespass by Mary Smith, administratrix of the estate of Anthony W. Smith, deceased, and Mary Smith in her own right, against the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. When the action was instituted Anthony W. Smith, the husband of Mary Smith, was a plaintiff, but he died before trial, and his administratrix was substituted. Before Garman, J.\nThe statement of claim averred, inter alia, that on January 25, 1906, the defendant company was operating a train of cars on its railroad in the vicinity of the plaintiffs\u2019 home; \u201cthat the said train of cars, through the negligence and carelessness of the said defendant and its employees, left the tracks of the said defendant company on which it was then and there being operated by the said defendant company and its employees, and crashed into \u2022 the said home, where the said plaintiff was then and there sitting with her baby in her lap. The impact and shock of the said crashing train was so great that the said plaintiff was thrown thereby from the chair on which she was sitting, violently and with great force against another chair, and was severely injured.\u201d Mary Smith claimed for physical injuries and for pain and suffering, and her husband, Anthony W. Smith, for expenses incurred for medicine, medical and surgical attendance and nursing to his wife, as well as for loss of her earnings, services and companionship. Verdicts: for Mary Smith individually, $2,000; and for Mary Smith, administratrix, $500, and judgments entered thereon. The defendant has appealed.\nErrors assigned were (1) refusal to enter judgment non obstante veredicto; (2) instruction to the jury: \u201cIn estimating the damages to be awarded the estate of her husband the jury are to allow it for the expenses incurred by Anthony Smith in his lifetime in curing his wife and also for the loss of her services to him as the husband of said Mary Smith as the natural result of the accident complained of, and in considering the loss of services the jury may also estimate the loss of her companionship caused him by her injuries up to the time of his death, to wit, August, 1909\u201d; (3) refusal of binding instructions for the defendant; (4) refusal to instruct the jury that the failure of plaintiff to produce and read the testimony given by Anthony W. Smith at the former trial warranted them in presuming that it was damaging to her case; and instructing that, as either side might offer the testimony, the failure of the plaintiff so to do would not warrant more than an inference that such testimony might be damaging; (5) refusal to instruct if the jury believed that Mrs. Smith was up and about on the day that the accident happened, and thereafter, with nothing apparently the matter with her, \u201ctheir verdict should be for the defendant;\u201d and instructing that if they believed the testimony to that effect it would go to impeach the credibility of the plaintiff, and if from such impeachment \u201cyou will disbelieve her entirely your verdict should be for the defendant;\u201d (6) refusal of defendant\u2019s request for charge: \u201cThe allegation of negligence in plaintiff\u2019s statement being that defendant \u2018was operating a train of cars\u2019 and that \u2018the .... train of cars through negligence and careless-, ness of the .... defendant and its employees left the' track .... on which it was then and there being operated by the defendant company and its employees,\u2019 proof that the car left the track on account of a defective condition of the defendant\u2019s roadbed does not sustain the plaintiff\u2019s allegation, and the verdict must be for the defendant, unless the jury find that the derailment of the car was due to the defendant\u2019s negligence in the operation of the train of cars,\u201d which was declined without reading; (7) overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the admission of certain testimony; (8) sustaining plaintiff\u2019s objection to defendant\u2019s offer of certain testimony.\nJ. B. Woodward, of Wheaton, Darling & Woodward, for appellant.\n\u2014 The variance between the allegata and probata was fatal: Clark v. Lindsay, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 43; McLean v. Schoenhut Co., 225 Pa. 100.\nThere was no survival of the action: Cregin v. Brooklyn Crosstown R. R. Co., 83 N. Y. 595; Foels v. Tonawanda, 20 N. Y. Supp. 447; Sweet v. Metropolitan Street Ry.
