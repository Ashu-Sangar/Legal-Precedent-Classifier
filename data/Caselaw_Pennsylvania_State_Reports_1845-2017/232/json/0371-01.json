        "text": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nTwo appeals from the same judgment, involving the same question of law, are here presented by different appellants. The question arises upon the distribution of a fund realized from the foreclosure of a mortgage, which represented purchase money, although it was postponed to the lien of advance money mortgages in aid of a building operation. The principal question raised is the constitutionality of the thirteenth section of the mechanic\u2019s lien Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, which gives priority to mechanics\u2019 liens over advance money mortgages. The learned auditor appointed by the court below to make distribution of the fund, held that the thirteenth section above referred to, was unconstitutional and void, and awarded the fund to the holder of the mortgage. He based his conclusion upon two grounds, the first being that the subject of the statute was not clearly expressed in the title, and therefore it was in violation of art. Ill, sec. 3, of the constitution. We are not impressed with the strength of this proposition. As was said in Gilbert\u2019s Estate, 227 Pa. 648: \u201cIt has been decided over and over again that the title need not be a general index to the contents of an act, but that it is sufficient if it relates to one general subject, no._-matter how the details may be multiplied, provided they are subordinate to the general purpose of the act and germane to its provisions.\u201d And in Bridgewater Boro. v. Bridge Co., 210 Pa. 105, our Brother Brown said (p. 108): \u201cIf the title fairly gave notice of the subject of the act, so as to reasonably direct inquiry into its body, the constitutional requirement was not violated: State Line & Juniata R. R. Co.\u2019s Appeal, 77 Pa. 429; Carothers v. Phila. Co., 118 Pa. 468; Dailey v. Potter County, 203 Pa. 593.\u201d The evil of loading the title of an act with details, in the effort to express the subject clearly, was pointed out in Com. v. Broad St. Ry. Co., 219 Pa. 11, by Chief Justice Mitchell, where he says (p. 17): \u201cIt has always been held that the title of an act need not be a complete index to its contents. The time has come to say that it not only need not, but ought not.\u201d The auditor felt that the title indicated that it affected only \u201cparties to\u201d building contracts, and gave no notice to anyone other than \u201cparties to\u201d such contracts that they might be affected by the legislation. But the title gives notice of more than this when it describes the act as regulating the effect of contracts for work and labor to be done, and labor and materials to be furnished to any building, etc. When this statute was enacted, there was other legislation in existence upon the subject of the priority of mechanics\u2019 liens over advance money mortgages, and the notice in the title of this act, as to repealing, consolidating and extending existing laws in relation to building contracts was sufficient to put parties interested in the effect of such contracts, upon notice.. It is plain that the act was intended to be a codification of the law relating to claims under contracts for work done and materials furnished to buildings. Such work may be done, and such materials may be furnished by others than mechanics, so there can be no special significance in the fact that the phrase \u201cmechanics\u2019 liens\u201d does not appear in the title so long as descriptive words are used which include not merely mechanics but others who are entitled to protection for their claims, under the act.\nOur difficulty in this instance is not with the title, but is with the second proposition, as to whether the thirteenth section offends art. Ill, sec. 7 of the constitution, which provides, \u201cThe General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law .... providing or changing methods for the collection of debts, or the enforcing of judgments, or prescribing the effect of judicial sales of real estate.\u201d The scope of this provision with respect to various sections of this statute of 1901 has been so thoroughly discussed in several late opinions of this court, that little remains to be said by way of amplification.\nThus the twenty-eighth section, which gave to a subcontractor or material man the right to issue an attachment execution against the owner, or other party indebted to the contractor for labor or materials furnished, was held unconstitutional in Vulcanite Cement Co. v. Allison, 220 Pa. 382.\nSection 46, which provided for the enforcement of the judgment on the lien by a special fi. fa. under the Act of April 7, 1870, P. L. 58, was, in Vulcanite Paving Co. v. Transit Co., 220 Pa. 603, held to violate the constitution.\nSection 38, which permitted mechanics\u2019 liens to be filed against a building, without reference to the land, and provided for the sale and removal of the building for the benefit of lien holders, was held to be within the ban, in the opinion in the case of Henry Taylor Lumber Co. v. Carnegie Institute, 225 Pa. 486; and\nSection 35, which gave the right to enter a personal judgment against a contractor who has been served with the original scire facias or any scire facias to revive, was held to violate the same provision of the constitution, in Sterling Bronze Co. v. Improvement Assn., 226 Pa. 475.\nTurning to the question now before us, it appears that prior to the constitution of 1874, advance money mortgages had priority over mechanics\u2019 liens. In Henry Taylor Lumber Co. v. Carnegie Institute, 225 Pa. 486, this court said (p. 493): \u201cThe whole act of 1901 is legislation for a special class of creditors, some of the provisions of which are permissible because the constitution of 1874 did not intend to wipe out the system to which they relate; but those providing special methods or changing old ones for the collection of debts due the special class of creditors or for the enforcement of judgments recovered by them are prohibited by the organic law.\u201d\nThe result of the decisions above noted, is to make it clear that any provision of the act of 1901 which is clearly divergent from, and is an advance upon the law as it stood prior to the constitution of 1874, is to be regarded as invalid. As the effect of sec. 13 is to grant to mechanics\u2019 liens a preference, and to give to them a priority of payment that they did not have, and to which they were not entitled prior to the present constitution, it must be held invalid. As the learned auditor says, \u201cThe plain and practical result of the act is that the mechanic has in the enforcement of his liens, higher rights and greater privileges under the statute than he had prior to the constitution, which forbids the extension of the lien.\u201d It was urged in the argument of counsel for appellant, that the section in question is substantially a re-enactment of the earlier act of 1881, and that long acquiescence in the similar provisions of the former statute should have controlling weight now, in favor of the constitutionality of the section. The answer to this suggestion may be found in the late opinion of this court in Kucker v. Oil Co., 230 Pa. 528, where an argument similar in that respect was made. If a statute is plainly in conflict with the organic law, mere lapse of time cannot cure the defect.\nWe agree with the conclusion reached by the auditor as set forth in his able report, and affirmed by the court below, that the thirteenth section of the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 431, violates the provisions of art. Ill, sec. 7, of the constitution, in that it gives to mechanics\u2019 liens a higher dignity, and greater priority than they possessed before the adoption of the present constitution. Distribution of the fund realized was therefore properly made to the mortgage creditor. The assignments of error are overruled, and the decree of the court below is affirmed.",

Finn and Thomas Jennings, trading as Finn & Jennings, claimants, and the German-town Woodworking Company, claimant, from the order of C. P. No. 1, Phila. Co., March T., 1909, No. 1,225, awarding distribution in case of Harlan Page, mortgagee, v. John H. Carr, mortgagor, and Charles C. Norris, Jr., real owner.\nBefore Brown, Mestrezat, Potter, Elkin and Stewart, JJ.\nAffirmed.\nDistribution of a fund raised by sheriff\u2019s sale under a judgment upon a scire facias sur mortgage. Exceptions to report of George DeB. Myers, Esq., auditor.\nFrom the record it appeared that Harlan Page, mortgagee, issued a scire facias sur mortgage against John H. Carr, mortgagor, and Charles C. Norris, Jr., real owner. Judgment for want of an affidavit of defense was entered on April 3, 1909, in the sum of $34,167. Under this judgment the mortgaged premises were sold by the sheriff on May 3, 1909, to Warren F. Martin for $25,000. The mortgaged premises which were sold under the levari facias, consisted of twenty-four dwellings and a large lot of ground adjoining them. Against the twenty-four dwellings a number of material men had filed mechanics\u2019 claims, and upon the petition of one of them, Reuben A. Fowler, the court below ordered the fund realized at the sheriff\u2019s sale to be paid into court for distribution. Pursuant to this order, upon September 27, 1909, the sheriff paid into court the sum of $23,559.22, being the balance of the $25,000 paid by the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, less city taxes and costs of suit.\nThe court appointed George DeB. Myers, Esq., auditor. The claimants appearing before him were Harlan Page, mortgagee, and a number of mechanics\u2019 lien creditors, as follows: John M. B. Morrow, Reuben A. Fowler, Reliance Manufacturing Company, James Moore, and the present appellants, Finn and Jennings, and the Germantown Woodworking Company. After the testimony was taken by the auditor some of the mechanics\u2019 lien claimants filed petitions to have an issue awarded in order to have certain disputed questions of fact, raised by the testimony, determined by a jury. Subsequently these petitions and the rules thereon allowed by the court to show cause were withdrawn. On January 25, 1910, the auditor filed an interlocutory report, setting forth that the totel amount of the claims of the mechanics\u2019 lien creditors amounted to a trifle over $8,800, and that the claim of Harlan Page was for the entire fund under his judgment of $34,167. The court upon February 11, 1910, upon petition and rule allowed Harlan Page, ordered that $10,000 of the fund in court be paid to Mr. Page, as mortgagee.\nThe auditor upon April 7, 1910, completed his report, awarding the balance in court, amounting to $13,559.22, less the expenses of the audit, to Harlan Page, mortgagee.\nExceptions to the auditor\u2019s report were filed by Harlan Page, Reuben A. Fowler, Finn & Jennings, Germantown Woodworking Company, John M. B. Morrow and the Reliance Manufacturing Company. The auditor dismissed all the exceptions in his final report. The court dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the auditor\u2019s report.\nErrors assigned were in dismissing exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.\nStanley Folz, with him Leon H. Folz, for appellants.\u2014\nThe mechanics\u2019 lien act is constitutional and the title of the act sustains the thirteenth section: Com. v. Butler, 99 Pa. 535; Sugar Notch Borough, 192 Pa. 349; Likins\u2019s Petition, 223 Pa. 456; Com. v. Charity Hospital, 198 Pa. 270; Blood v. Mercelliott, 53 Pa; 391; Com. v. Jones, 4 Pa.

Co., 219 Pa. 11.\nSection 13 is not special legislation within the inhibition of art. III, sec. 7, of the constitution.\nDrastic and fantastic remedies unlike anything in the previous history of our' mechanic\u2019s lien laws, and in no wise a proper feature of the system, will not be sustained: Henry Taylor Lumber Co. v. Carnegie Institute, 225 Pa. 486.\nThe provisions of the Act of June 8, 1881, P. L. 56, and of the similar section of the act of 1901 have stood upon our books for thirty years. Within that time they have met with the entire acquiescence of the profession in their constitutionality.\nSheldon Potter, of Potter, Dechert & Norris, with him Alfred S. Miller, for appellee.\nJuly 6, 1911:"
