        "text": "Opinion by\nMu. Justice Potter,\nThe substantial question raised by this appeal is as to the right of the wife to bring suit upon a promissory note against her husband during coverture. This question was distinctly answered in the negative in Small v. Small, 129 Pa. 366. And the ruling was followed in Kennedy v. Knight, 174 Pa. 408, where it was said in an opinion approved by this court, that on the authority of Small v. Small, supra, the principle that a married woman cannot bring suit against her husband while they are living together, is to be regarded as firmly established. It was also held in the same case that the statute of limitations does not run against the claim of the wife during coverture. In the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, sec. 3, it is expressly provided, that a married woman may not sue her husband, except \u201cin proceedings for divorce, or in a proceeding to protect or recover her separate property whensoever he may have deserted or separated himself from her without sufficient cause, or may have neglected or refused to support her.\u201d As the present case falls within none of these exceptions the trial judge was entirely right in excluding the period of the'wife\u2019s coverture, in ascertaining the time at which the presumption of payment upon the note in question arose. The assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.",

T., 1910, by defendant, from judgment of C. P. Franklin Co., Sept. T., 1909, No. 101, on verdict for plaintiff in case of Arthur W. Gillan, Administrator of Clara A. Funk, deceased, v. Thomas H.

Funk were husband and wife, and that the latter made the note in suit, dated April 1,1881, in the sum of $3,500, payable to Clara A. Funk. Mrs. Funk died on April 13, 1893. In December, 1906, Jacob R. Funk was adjudged a weak-minded person and Thomas H. West was appointed his guardian. The action was brought on June 11, 1909. There was evidence that Mr. and Mrs. Funk lived together until the wife\u2019s death.\nPlaintiff presented this point:\nIf the jury believe from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Clara A. Funk, was the wife of Jacob It. Funk, the ward of the defendant, from the date of the note sued on, April 1, 1881, until April 13, 1893, the date of her death, then, under all the evidence in the case, your verdict should be for the plaintiff. Answer: We affirm that point. [1]\nDefendant presented this point:\nThat under all the evidence in this case the verdict must be for the defendant. Answer: This point we decline to affirm.
