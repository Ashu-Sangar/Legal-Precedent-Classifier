It is only when the danger is so great and apparent that an ordinarily prudent person would regard it as dangerous, and therefore avoid it, that a trial court can say, as matter of law, that the person .using the more dangerous route is guilty of contributory negligence. If the alternative route has dangers of its own, and the dangers of the route actually taken are not so great and obvious as to deter the general public and ordinarily prudent and careful people from using it, the question of the contributory negligence of a person injured in using it is a question for the jury.</p>

His widow brought an action on behalf of herself and the children of the deceased to recover damages for the loss of his life, claiming that his death was due to the negligence of the defendant township. The court below gave binding instructions for defendant, judgment was entered accordingly, and the plaintiff has appealed.

No one saw the decedent fall, and how the accident happened can be determined only by inferences to be drawn from the known facts. As before stated, the jury might have found the facts as we have outlined them, and hence it could not be said as a matter of law that the defendant township was not guilty of negligence in failing to guard this vertical cut on a populated main street.</p>

Adding these to the circumstances of this case, we cannot say that the evidence was insufficient to go to the jury.” Next, in Scranton v. Dean, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.N.C.%20467" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="2 W.N.C. 467">2 W. N. C. 467</a>, “The body of Dean was found below a bridge along the side of which there was no fence; there being no evidence of the manner or circumstances of his death: Held, that the presumption of law is, in the absence of proof to the contrary, that the deceased exercised ordinary care.” We there said, “The strain of the case .... fell upon the manner of the accident, leaving the question one of probability whether Dean fell over the wall or abutment by accident and whether he contributed to the fall by any negligence of his own. These were questions to be decided by the jury from the circumstances attending the place where the body was found, its position and condition, and from the character, habits and general conduct of the man himself. ... It is for them to weigh the probabilities of an accidental fall as Dean went home, the darkness of the night, his knowledge of the way, the effect of a blunder, <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>or a misconception of his position as he was entering upon the abutment, the probable condition of his senses, his instinct of self-preservation, and all the circumstances attending the place where he was found.” Also see Ferry v. Phila. R. T. Co., decided at. this term, and authorities there cited.</p>
