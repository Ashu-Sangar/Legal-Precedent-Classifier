In June, 1906, when the issue devisavit vel non had been awaiting trial for several years, the present plaintiff, upon his own petition as the administrator c. t. a. of the estate of John Loughran, deceased, was appointed by the orphans’ court receiver of all the assets of the said estate. The petition set forth that if the alleged will then in contest were rejected, the next prior will would immediately become the subject of a new contest, and so with each of the other wills. The petition further averred that Catherine Grogan, the' defendant here, had entered into-a transaction with the testator’s widow, Bridget Lough-ran, when the latter was upwards of seventy years of age, whereby, for an expressed consideration of one dollar, the widow had undertaken to convey to the defendant the real estate in question, which was part of the estate of John Loughran, and that the defendant was in possession of and claimed the property in fee simple; that she was without means and would be unable to respond in mesne profits; that by reason of the pending will contest, and those in prospect, no action of ejectment could be brought for an indefinite period without the appointment of a receiver for that purpose. The petition prayed that a receiver be appointed to take possession of the real and personal property belonging to the estate of John Loughran. On July 19, 1906, the plaintiff, William J. Power, was appointed such receiver, and he thereupon instituted this action of ejectment.</p>

When the case was again tried, the plaintiff proved title in John Loughran and rested. The defendant then introduced evidence to show that Bridget Loughran had conveyed the property to her in pursuance of an agreement to compensate her for nursing and caring for said Bridget Loughran so long as she lived.

My construction of that clause is that it did not give to Bridget Loughran power to absolutely dispose of that property unless it was necessary for her maintenance and support. . . . She had not the right to arbitrarily dispose of the property. . . . Whether or not Bridget Loughran was justified in making provision for her support- and maintenance to the end of her life, by employing some one to take care of her and keep her until the end of her life and agreeing to convey the property to her .... will be a question of fact for you. There will be another question of fact for you to determine, — did she make such a bargain. ... If she, from motives of affection, or from any motive at all, simply gave this property to Catherine Grogan .... she was exceeding her power under the will. Her husband .... meant that she should have the property or the use of it for her life, and that she should use so much of it as was necessary for her maintenance and support.” After referring to the testimony relating to the negotiations between the widow and the defendant .concerning the bar<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>gain for the services to be rendered by the latter to the former and the subsequent conveyance of the property as alleged by the defendant in fulfillment of that bargain, the court went on to say, “Was that done in good faith? Was it the act and deed, was it the voluntary act, — assuming that you come to the conclusion that it was necessary, that she thought it was necessary, and it was necessary for her support and maintenance, — was it her free act and deed, or did Catherine Grogan, the younger woman, exercise such an influence on the mind of the older woman as to amount to a fraud? Or, did Catherine Grogan, — and this you will have to determine, — in furtherance of a selfish, — I say no more than selfish, — design to get hold of the woman’s property, get her to deed the property to her? .... The question you will have to determine is, Was it a fair and equitable transaction? Or, did' Catherine Grogan impose on the old woman? Did she impose her will on that old woman’s will? Did she make a sharp bargain with the old woman, and use fraud to carry it out? . . . .” Then, after referring to the evidence in a general way and to the deed to the defendant, the court said, “That is all testimony for you to consider, first, as to whether it was necessary for her support and maintenance, and if so, whether the bargain was made as Catherine Grogan says it was made. And if it was made, then consider whether it was made under duress. . . . That is, under force which the superior will acting upon an inferior one exerts, which the strong, vigorous, healthy person has upon the sick and infirm; or, to put it in another way, whether there was fraud. Because if there was fraud, this deed should be swept aside.” And, in answer to a point, the court again said, “Unless the jury find that it was necessary for the proper maintenance and support of Bridget Loughran, to make use of the property in question, by conveying the same away from the estate, they must find for the plaintiff.”</p>

It ... . grows out of the inherent power of a court of equity to afford relief where the remedies to be obtained in the courts of ordinary jurisdiction are inadequate:” 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 1002; Kerr on Receivers (5th ed.), 1. “The jurisdiction exercised in the appointment of receivers has always been <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>treated as a purely equitable one, and the remedy has been generally regarded, next to that of injunction, as the most efficient and salutary of the extraordinary remedies known to the courts of equity:” High on Receivers (4th Ed.), sec. 41. “The appointment of a receiver is the exercise of a power in aid of a proceeding in equity. . . . The court must be convinced that it is needful and is the appropriate means of securing a proper end:” Chicago &amp; Allegheny Oil &amp; Mining Co. v. U. S. Pet. Co., <a href="/pa/57/0083-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="57 Pa. 83" data-case-ids="1010448" data-case-paths="/pa/57/0083-01">57 Pa. 83</a>, 91. The Act of May 19, 1874, P. L. 206, sec. 7, vests the orphans’ court with power to issue preventive orders “in the nature of injunctions,” but neither that nor any other statute expressly gives it the right to appoint receivers. Since the orphans’ court does not possess general chancery powers, it is difficult to conceive by what authority it made the appointment in this case. Further, we fail to see the necessity for the appointment.</p>
    <p id="b425-5" data-blocks='[["BL_425.5",425,[143,1305,1156,1124]],["BL_426.1",426,[293,381,1152,1769]]]'>In Com. v. Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, <a href="/pa/4/0301-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="4 Pa. 301" data-case-ids="401949" data-case-paths="/pa/4/0301-01">4 Pa. 301</a>, 302, we said: “Our orphans’ court is essentially .... (a court of chancery) in its proceedings and decrees within the limited sphere of its jurisdiction;” in Guier v. Kelly, 2 Binney, 293, 298, “The orphans’ court, in matters within their jurisdiction, proceed on the same principles as a court of chancery;” and in Black’s Exrs. v.

The orphans’ court is sometimes called a court of limited jurisdiction. This is true, if regard be had to the <em>derivation </em>of its powers, for it possesses none inherently, and exercises <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>such only as are conferred by or implied from legislation; and it is true also as to the <em>subjects </em>of its jurisdiction, for these are set down in the statutes:” Shollenberger’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/21/0337-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="21 Pa. 337" data-case-ids="411541" data-case-paths="/pa/21/0337-01">21 Pa. 337</a>, 340. This thought was brought out even more strongly in Brinker v. Brinker, <a href="/pa/7/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="7 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="957894" data-case-paths="/pa/7/0053-01">7 Pa. 53</a>, 55, where we said: "Although the orphans’ court has been called a court of equity, in respect to the few subjects within its jurisdiction, the ancillary powers of such a court have not been given to it. It is a special tribunal for specific cases; and its resemblance to a court of equity consists in its practice of proceeding by petition and answer containing the substance, but not the technical subtleties and nice distinctions of a bill in equity; by which, however, justice is obtained more conveniently and as certainly as in courts of equity, purely so-called. . . . The orphans’ court .... has.not the general powers of a court of equity. . . .” Finally, in High on Receivers (4th Ed.), sec. 42, we find it stated, "The appointment of receivers being a power pertaining to courts which are vested with chancery jurisdiction, a court of probate powers only cannot appoint a receiver in aid of the collection of the estate of a deceased person. And since a probate court has no power to appoint a receiver, an action by a receiver thus appointed cannot be maintained;” and in Anderson’s Law Dictionary, 815, a "probate court” is defined as, “A court exercising jurisdiction over the estates of deceased persons, possessing, as to personal assets, nearly all the powers formerly exercised by the courts of chancery and the Ecclesiastical Courts of England. . . . Other names are ‘orphans’ and ‘surrogate’ courts.” We conclude that the orphans’ court had no power to appoint the plaintiff a receiver or to authorize him as such to bring this action of ejectment.</p>

The will of the decedent authorizes, empowers and directs his executor to sell, transfer and convey his <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>real estate. “The will gives the executor the power to sell the real estate in question. By operation of the Act of February 24, 1834, P. L. 70, the executors took the estate in the land as fully as if it had been devised to them to be sold. They may, therefore, maintain ejectment to recover the possession:” Chew’s Exrs. v.

Since the original executor had the right to institute the ejectment, the plaintiff could have brought the action as administrator c. t. a., and there was no necessity for the appointment of a receiver for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b427-4" data-blocks='[["BL_427.5",427,[152,1130,1161,1166]]]'>In view of the fact that the administrator c. t. a. and the receiver are in point of fact the same individual, can the record be amended? Although a change of parties which involves a change of the cause of action is not within the province of amendments (Wildermuth v. Long, <a href="/pa/196/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="196 Pa. 541" data-case-ids="916790" data-case-paths="/pa/196/0541-01">196 Pa. 541</a>; Garman v.

Prudential Life Ins. Co., <a href="/pa/161/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="161 Pa. 257" data-case-ids="854157" data-case-paths="/pa/161/0257-01">161 Pa. 257</a>; Jamison v.

Here, the plaintiff, if he should recover by showing a right of possession against the defendant, would hold the property for whomsoever entitled, no matter whether the plaintiff be designated as receiver or as administrator c. t. a. (Warden v. Eichbaum, <a href="/pa/14/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="14 Pa. 121" data-case-ids="405949" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0121-01">14 Pa. 121</a>, 127); and, inasmuch as the statute of limitations has not run, there can be no objection to an amendment in this respect when the record is returned to the court below.</p>

Again, the testimony was not as to anything that occurred in the lifetime of John Loughran or between him and the defendant, but as to matters which took place after his death between his widow and the defendant.
