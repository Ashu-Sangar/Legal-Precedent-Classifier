Moudy Manufacturing Company of a certain chair factory in the borough of Mount Union, known as the Moudy Chair Company’s plant, or the DeFrehn Chair Company. By its terms she was to pay a rental of $600 per year. At the time this property was rented to her it was subject to a mortgage given February 11,1893, by the DeFrehn Chair Company, a prior owner, to William McMurtrie Spear and Robert E. Speer, in the amount of $12,000. When the property was purchased by the William H. Moudy Manufacturing Company, the mortgage was still $12,000, with interest. This amount was reduced until in April, 1908, it was $7,500. By an agreement between the William H. Moudy Manufactur<a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>ing Company, and W. T. Bell, A. S. Welch and others, who were the guarantors of the mortgage, it was to be paid at the rate of $500 a year with interest on the amount remaining unpaid. On April 12, 1909, a payment of $500 became due. Mr. Moudy was unable to make this payment. On April 15,1909, a levari facias was issued and the property was sold on May 14, 1909, to A. S. Welch. On the evening of the day of the sheriff’s sale, A. S. Welch, W. T. Bell and others went to the factory and took possession, placing locks and installing watchmen.</p>

Welch, one of the appellees, there passed to him and to those for whom he purchased the premises in controversy as trustee the right to their possession, for appellant’s lease was subject to the mortgage upon which the property was sold, and the appellees having obtained peaceable possession of it, no trespass was committed: Leidy v.

The verdict having been properly directed for the defendants, the judgment upon it is affirmed.</p>
