Afc the time of the accident the premises were in the occupancy of a tenant under a lease from it. There was no evidence that the defect in the sidewalk had existed for any length of time. No one testified to having seen it before the day the plaintiff was injured. The hole was apparently due to the removal of a single brick. The case as presented is not one of a landlord who leases his property with a defect existing in the pavement at the time of the execution of the lease, nor is it one in which during the term the pavement becomes out of repair and though notified of its condition the landlord neglects to repair it, in disregard of his covenant in the lease to do so. The action is against a landlord which had neither actual nor constructive notice of the defect in the pavement in front of the premises in the occupancy of its tenant. A municipality though having the exclusive control of public streets, is not liable for injury resulting from an obstruction or defect in them unless it has had actual or constructive notice of the existence of the danger; .... An owner of property not occupied by him but in the exclusive possession of a tenant under a lease from him ought not to be and is not held to stricter accountability. The general rule is that when premises are in good repair at the time they are let and the landlord- is not bound by the lease to keep them in repair, the tenant in possession and not the landlord, is liable for an injury resulting from failure to repair the pavement in front of the premises. ... A tenant in possession may reasonably be held, from his going in and out of the premises, to have notice of an obstruction in the pavement in front of them as soon as it exists; but not so with the landlord, who may not even live in the same town or city or if living in it, far away from the property <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>occupied by his tenant. From all that appears in the present case the brick may have been removed so shortly before the accident that even the tenant may not have noticed the hole and therefore was not negligent in not filling it up. The gist of plaintiff’s case is the alleged negligence of the defendant and she can establish this, if at all, only by showing that it had not filled up the hole after notice of its existence. No such negligence appears, and unless an owner of property out of possession of it, and while it is actually occupied by a tenant under a lease from him, is bound to keep constant watch over the pavement in front of it and the instant the same becomes out of repair to repair it, the plaintiff cannot recover. No such harsh and unreasonable rule can be applied to this landlord for no such rule exists.”</p>
