Generally speaking, a right of action to recover damages for injuries done to person or property did not survive; but this rule was relaxed by the statute of 4 Edw. Ill, chap. 7, and its supplements, so that thereafter, in certain instances, personal representatives had the same remedy as the decedent himself. While these old English statutes were declared to be in force in Pennsylvania, and were given a liberal construction, still it was held that they had reference only to wrongs which had inured to the benefit of the defendant or increased the assets of his estate at the expense of the personal property of the plaintiff’s decedent: Penrod v. Morrison, <a href="/pen-w/2/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 126" data-case-ids="8877542" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0126-01">2 P. &amp; W. 126</a>; Lattimore v. Simmons, 13 S. &amp; R. 183. But the Act of February 24, 1834, P.

At the time the statute was passed a husband had the common-law right “to commence and prosecute” an action in tort to recover for the loss of his “wife’s society and services, and for expenses incurred:” 21 Cyc. 1526; Donoghue v. Consol. Trac. Co., <a href="/pa/201/0181-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="201 Pa. 181" data-case-ids="925592" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0181-01">201 Pa. 181</a>.

The two sections referred to deal with a like subject, and there is no reason why the similar phrases used in each should not be given a like limited meaning. But if they were to be given a broader signification and held to embrace all actions growing out of injuries to the person, then the verdict recovered by the personal representatives of the deceased husband 'would fall within the remedial provision of sec. 18 of the act of 1851, supra. However, looking at the question for determination -in the light of our decided cases, we are brought to the conclusion that the phrases must be construed as before stated, that the act of 1834, supra, saved the action of Anthony W. Smith from abat<a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>ing by his death, and that his suit could be “prosecuted” by his administratrix “as fully as such decedent might have done if he had lived.”</p>
    <p id="b492-4" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[273,538,1171,908]]]'>The second question involved as stated by the appellant is, “Can plaintiff recover on proof of negligence not alleged in her statement filed?” The defendant contends that the testimony adduced was not sufficient to support the averment in the statement describing the occurrence which brought the injuries upon the plaintiff, Mary Smith. The testimony was sufficient, if believed, to justify the jury in finding that a defective condition of the defendant’s tracks, which had existed for a sufficient length of time to put it on notice, caused one of its cars to become derailed and run into the frame dwelling house occupied by the plaintiff, thereby throwing Mrs. Smith to the floor' and producing the ’injuries of which she complained. Under these circumstances we cannot say that the allegata and probata did not agree, or that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, if the jury saw fit to accept the testimony of the plaintiff and her witnesses.</p>

If the appellant desired the points covered by these latter assignments reviewed, it would have been sufficient, after stating the main questions for determination, had counsel added a few words to this effect, “Correctness of instructions as to the effect of nonproduction of certain testimony, and concerning the condition and conduct of plaintiff after accident; rulings on admission and rejection of testimony.” If those instructions and rulings were necessarily involved in or suggested by the principal questions stated, then this course would not be required, or desired.
