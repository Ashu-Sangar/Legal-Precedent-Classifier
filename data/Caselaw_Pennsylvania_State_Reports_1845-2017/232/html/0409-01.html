This demurrer was sustained with leave to the plaintiff to amend. The plaintiff took no exception to the judgment of the court sustaining the demurrer, but proceeded to amend his statement by adding an averment to the effect that the defendants “were liable under the law of Pennsylvania to the plaintiff” in the sum named. After amending his statement the plaintiff entered a rule upon the defendants to file an affidavit of defense. An affidavit and a supplemental affidavit of defense were filed by the defendant Power, in which he averred that while he was a member of the defendant firm he took no personal part in the conduct thereof and had no knowledge of the transactions in question; that his copartner and the manager of the office in which the bets were made were both dead and that he had not possession of and had never seen any of the books or records of the firm and did not know where they could be found; that the plaintiff had given testimony in another action at law involving the same matters referred to in the present suit in which he had admitted that certain of these bets or wagers were not open and undetermined transactions on the date aforesaid and had <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>asserted that such transactions were thén closed; that “in reliance upon the said testimony of the plaintiff the defendant denies that all of the transactions above mentioned were open, undetermined and unexecuted transactions on November 28, 1904, and that the contingent event which was to determine the bet or gamble had never taken place, and the unknown event or casualty upon which the plaintiffs or defendants were to win or lose never happened.” And the defendant averred further, “defendant is advised by counsel and therefore avers that no affidavit of defense is necessary to so much of the plaintiff’s statement of claim as makes the statute of New Jersey .... the basis of the plaintiff’s right to recover. Defendant is advised by counsel that a demurrer heretofore filed to the plaintiff’s statement of claim has been sustained.”</p>

IV, sec. 1, of the constitution of the United States and the acts of Congress passed in pursuance thereof?” and, “Second: Is the New Jersey statute <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>against the policy of the law of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and if so can the courts of this state refuse to enforce it?”</p>
    <p id="b442-4" data-blocks='[["BL_442.5",442,[286,531,1176,1388]]]'>It is not necessary to determine either of these questions as they are not properly before us. Both of them were decided adversely to the plaintiff by the court below in disposing of the demurrer to the statement of claim, and instead of excepting to that ruling and standing upon the points at issue, the plaintiff amended his statement in such a manner as enabled him to base his claim for recovery upon the law of Pennsylvania rather than upon the New Jersey statute. Had the plaintiff desired to raise the question of the propriety of the ruling of the court below to the effect that the New Jersey statute declared upon by him was contrary to the- public policy of the law of Pennsylvania and would not be enforced in this state, he should have taken an exception so that he might at a proper time assign the ruling for error; since he did not pursue this course, but took advantage of the leave to amend, we must view his statement as though the plaintiff had acquiesced in that ruling and had elected to rely upon the law of this state alone. “If a party, after judgment upon demurrer to pleadings is given against him, under leave of court, amends the pleading demurred to, he acquiesces in the judgment upon the demurrer, and . .will not be permitted to assign it for error in the appellate court:” 2 Cyc. 645.

We shall not attempt to adjudge any of these issues at this time; they can best be determined at trial where it will be possible to secure all the relevant facts in regard to the dealings between the parties and to reach a correct decision as to their rights.</p>
