You must also consider whether or not he will endure pain and suffering for the remainder of his life by reason of this injury and to what extent, because it does not necessarily follow, even though he may endure pain, that it will be the same degree of pain at all times or continuously, it may appear for a time and then it may disappear. It is said that there is no way of measuring pain. This is true. Nevertheless the law allows the jury to take that into consideration in rendering compensation to one injured in this manner and under these circumstances. You may consider as a circumstance in the case the number of years that the plaintiff is likely to live in measuring the loss of his earning capacity. Upon this point evidence has been introduced of what is known as the expectancy of life tables, sometimes called the Carlisle tables, and under these tables the expectancy of life of a man of the plaintiff’s age would be nineteen years and a half. You are not, of course, to assume that he will live these nineteen years, he may live much less, he may live possibly longer, yet you are permitted to use this table in assisting you in arriving at a conclusion in ascertaining the amount of damage which he may sustain by the loss of his earning capacity permanently.] [9]</p>

You must consider this circumstance as an element in the case in measuring the loss of his earning capacity. His trade or occupation before the injury is the one which should guide you primarily, which would be the occupation he probably would have continued in if he had not met with this injury. He may continue in the same employment he is now in or he may at any time lose it, and then if he was to seek employment in the same occupation which he had heretofore followed, if you believe his story and the story of the physicians as to his injury, he would not be as fit to perform the duties of a machinist as he had been before the time of this injury.

The train in question consisted of two cars and was operated by a third rail electric system. The case was submitted to the jury, and the plaintiff recovered a large verdict, upon which, after a substantial cut, the court below entered the judgment from which this appeal has been taken.</p>
    <p id="b100-4" data-blocks='[["BL_100.5",100,[302,707,1150,520]]]'>The plaintiff contended that the train had stopped at a regular station for discharging passengers and that he had immediately attempted to alight, but that, without giving him sufficient time, the train started while he was in the very act of stepping to the ground. The defendant claims that the plaintiff carelessly stepped from a moving train before it had come to a stop. The evidence was conflicting and the case was for the jury; but the assignments question the propriety of certain rulings of. the trial judge and the manner in which the issues were submitted.</p>
    <p id="b100-5" data-blocks='[["BL_100.6",100,[302,1244,1148,583]]]'>The second specification complains of the admission in evidence of a time book belonging to the plaintiff’s employers purporting to show the hours that the plaintiff had worked on the day of the accident. Since it was not a book of original entries and the absence of the time slips from which it was made up was not sufficiently accounted for or the witnesses who made the entries produced, the evidence should not have been admitted. While we sustain this assignment, if it were the only error in the case, we should not consider it of sufficient importance to require a reversal.</p>

The trial judge, inter alia, said: “Inasmuch as it is testified that this is a permanent injury and it is not contradicted, you can consider then what would be the loss of his earning capacity, whether it is totally destroyed or partially destroyed.” The permanent destruction of earning capacity was again referred to, and, after calling attention to the facts in the case concerning the employment of the plaintiff before and after the accident and the wages earned, the trial judge submitted the issue to the jury, saying: <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>“It is a very difficult question for jurors to decide and it is in the nature of a guess.” These instructions are faulty in several particulars.- The plaintiff’s own testimony shows that he returned to his old employer, and that, although he is unable to perform the same kind of physical labor that he did before the accident, he now occupies a better position and is earning a higher salary. Therefore there is nothing in the evidence to justify the suggestion' that his earning capacity has been permanently destroyed, much less “ totally destroyed.” (See Goodhart v. Penna. Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/177/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="177 Pa. 1" data-case-ids="883679" data-case-paths="/pa/177/0001-01">177 Pa. 1</a>, at p. 16.) Furthermore, the jury’s attention should have been .called to the fact that any allowance for future losses due to an impairment of earning capacity must be capitalized and brought down to its present worth. Finally, the use of the word ‘ ‘ guess ” ought to have been avoided. Jurors should never be told that any of their deliberations are in the nature of a guess, for such a remark is practically a suggestion to them that matters submitted for their determination can be decided without mature judgment and deliberation. These specifications of error are sustained.</p>

Should the plaintiff remain in the position which he now occupies, and continue to earn at least as much as he was capable of earning prior to the accident, it would be strong evidence tending to show that he had not suffered any serious impairment of his earning capacity; but the jury had a right to consider the evidence showing his physical condition and the character of work which he performed both prior to and since the accident, and if this justified the conclusion that as a result of the accident his future earning power had been reduced, they could award him damages accordingly. As was said in McLaughlin v. Corry, <a href="/pa/77/0109-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="77 Pa. 109" data-case-ids="436295" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0109-01">77 Pa. 109</a>, “. . . . <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>the true measure of damages .... would be the plaintiff’s actual permanent loss of earning power, occasioned by the accident. What he gets from his present employers by way of wages cannot go in mitigation of damages . . . .; but what he earns from any source may, with other things, be considered as going to prove what his earning powers actually are.” The assignment is overruled.</p>
