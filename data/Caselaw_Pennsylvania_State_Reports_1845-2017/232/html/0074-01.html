This question was distinctly answered in the negative in Small v. Small, <a href="/pa/129/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="129 Pa. 366" data-case-ids="568072" data-case-paths="/pa/129/0366-01">129 Pa. 366</a>.

It was also held in the same case that the statute of limitations does not run against the claim of the wife during coverture. In the Act of June 8, 1893, P. L. 344, sec. 3, it is expressly provided, that a married woman may not sue her husband, except “in proceedings for divorce, or in a proceeding to protect or recover her separate property whensoever he may have deserted or separated himself from her without sufficient cause, or may have neglected or refused to support her.” As the present case falls within none of these exceptions the trial judge was entirely right in excluding the period of the'wife’s coverture, in ascertaining the time at which the presumption of payment upon the note in question arose. The assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
