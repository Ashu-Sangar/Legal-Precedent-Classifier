    <p id="b216-11" data-blocks='[["BL_216.13",216,[296,1347,1151,744]]]'>This appeal is utterly without merit. It challenges the corporate power of the appellee to purchase water from a water company in a territory within which it is authorized by its charter to supply water to the public. In that territory the appellee is part of the public: Bland v. Tipton Water Co., <a href="/pa/222/0285-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="222 Pa. 285" data-case-ids="959388" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0285-01">222 Pa. 285</a>; and it must have water if its cars are to run. Apart from its implied power to purchase water from a water company authorized to sell it, express authority to do so is found in the comprehensive words of the second section of the act incorporating it: 1846 P. L. 312. Nothing said in Bland v. Tipton Water Company justified the application for the writ of quo warranto; on the contrary, that case was authority for refusing it, and the learned judge below correctly so held.</p>
