The competency of such a witness does not depend upon his interest in the <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>subject in controversy, but whether he has complied with the requirements of the act.</p>

In an action of ejectment one of the defendants, formerly owner of an undivided half interest in the premises, was permitted to withdraw his plea of “not guilty” and to file a disclaimer of title and a bond to secure the payment of costs. It appeared that he had previously conveyed his undivided half interest in the premises to the other defendant by a general warranty deed. On the trial the plaintiffs showed title out of the commonwealth, the assessment and levy of taxes on the land in dispute, the return for the nonpayment of the taxes, and the subsequent sale and delivery of the treasurer’s deed to one of the plaintiffs and to the predecessor in title of the others. The defendant, who was prima facie in possession, for the purpose of invalidating the treasurer’s deed, called the person who had disclaimed, and who testified under objection, that previous to the tax sale he had called at the office of the county treasurer and asked for the taxes due upon the land in dispute, which was then owned by himself and defendant; that the treasurer furnished him the amount which he said was due for taxes on this land, and that the witness then gave the treasurer a check for the money which he demanded. Plaintiffs contended that the witness was adversely interested by reason of the fact that in the event of a recovery by the plaintiffs he would be liable on his clause of general warranty in its conveyance to the defendant and was incompetent to testify by reason of the death of one of the grantees under the treasurer’s deed, whose right or interest in the property had passed to his devisees who were on the record as plaintiffs. <em>Held, </em>that under the act of 1887 the witness was competent.</p>

In such a case the fact that the county treasurer was dead did not make the witness incompetent, as the treasurer was simply the agent and acting for the county, and his estate was not interested in the cause nor was it represented by any party to the record; nor could the plaintiffs show the declarations of the treasurer in regard to what took <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>place between him and the witness, made to a stranger to the title, not in the latter’s presence, at a time subsequent to the interview at which the taxes were demanded and paid, such declarations being no part of the record, but simply ex parte and self-serving, and not admissible to contradict the witness’s testimony as to what had previously occurred between him and the treasurer.</p>

Clause e, of sec. 5, is the only one having any relevancy to the question in hand, and it provides as follows: “Nor where any party to a thing or contract in action is dead, .... and his right thereto or therein has passed, either by his own act or by the act of the law, to a party on the record, who represents his interest in the subject in controversy, shall any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract, or any other person whose interest shall be adverse to the said right of such deceased. . . . party, be a competent witness to any matter occurring before the death of said party .... unless the action be ejectment against several defendants, and one or more of said defendants disclaims of record any title to the premises in controversy at the- time the suit was brought, and also pays into court the costs accrued at the time of his disclaimer, or gives security therefor, as the court in its discretion may direct, in which case such disclaiming defendant shall be a fully competent witness.”</p>

Trexler is interested in the result of the case, and that his interest is adverse to the estate of J. Simpson Africa, deceased. This interest, it is claimed, arises from the fact that in the event of a recovery by the plaintiffs against'Jacob F. Trexler, John L. Trexler will' be liable to his brother upon the clause of <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>general warranty in the deed conveying his undivided interest in the land to his brother. It is, therefore, contended that John L. Trexler is interested adversely to the estate of the decedent whose representatives are plaintiffs, and that the witness is incompetent under clause e, of sec. 5, of the act above referred to. We think it manifest that this contention is not supported by the clause of the act in question. If it be conceded that John L. Trexler would be liable on his warranty if the plaintiffs recovered a judgment against the defendant and that, therefore, he is interested adversely to the right of the deceased party represented on the record by the plaintiffs, it would not necessarily follow that he was disqualified to testify under clause e, of sec. 5. The right of the witness to testify does not depend upon his interest in the question at issue. As we have seen, the act makes all persons competent witnesses with the exceptions noted in sec. 5. One of those exceptions denies the right of a surviving party to testify to any matter occurring before the death of the other party where the latter’s interest in the subject in controversy has passed to a party on the record who represents his interest. That part of the exception might exclude John L. Trexler as a witness by reason of his liability on his warranty, which might be construed as an interest adverse to the right of the deceased in the premises in dispute. We need not, however, determine whether such interest would disqualify the witness, as it becomes unnecessary under the other part of clause e, which is quoted above. That part of the clause furnishes, as it were, an exception to the exception contained in the earlier part of the clause disqualifying a witness on the ground of an interest adverse to that of the deceased party. It relieves the witness from disqualification in actions of ejectment where he files a disclaimer and secures the payment of the accrued costs. In other words, when a codefendant in an action of ejectment is called as a witness and complies with the conditions imposed by this clause by filing a disclaimer and securing the cost he <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>is relieved from the disability imposed upon a surviving party having an interest adverse to that of the deceased party. Such witness in an ejectment suit occupies the same position as if the clause had no existence, and becomes a competent witness under sec. 4, of the statute. The competency of such a witness does not depend upon his interest in the subject in controversy, but whether he has filed a disclaimer and has paid or secured the payment of the costs which have accrued in the action. The wisdom of this provision we may not question; that was solely for the legislature, and its command must be obeyed. It follows that John L. Trexler having filed his disclaimer and secured the costs was a competent witness to testify to what occurred between the witness and the county treasurer in regard to his effort to pay the taxes assessed against the land in dispute.</p>
    <p id="b533-5" data-blocks='[["BL_533.5",533,[131,1233,1155,800]]]'>The finding of the jury invalidated the tax title, and, therefore, the plaintiffs could not recover. The defendant having made the proper effort to pay the taxes charged against the land in dispute, and having failed by reason of the improper act of the treasurer and by no fault of his own, the effect as to the legality of the purchasers’ title was the same as though the taxes had been actually paid. The sale was void and passed no title to the purchasers. The treasurer’s deed did not give them constructive possession of the premises, and the defendant could question its validity: Miller v. McCullough, <a href="/pa/104/0624-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="104 Pa. 624" data-case-ids="452127" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0624-01">104 Pa. 624</a>. The plaintiffs having no title to the premises are not in position to oust the defendant from his possession. The deed upon which they rely was absolutely void and conveyed no title or right to the possession.</p>

The treasurer was simply the agent and acting for the county, and his estate was not interested in the cause nor was it represented by any party on the record. It is equally apparent that the plaintiffs could not show the declarations of the treasurer in regard to what took place between him and John L. <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>Trexler, and which were made at a time-subsequent to the interview with the treasurer at which the taxes were demanded and paid: Young v. Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/28/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="28 Pa. 501" data-case-ids="981692" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0501-01">28 Pa. 501</a>; McGregor v.

Hutchinson, 5 S. &amp; R. 295. Such declarations were no part of the res gestse, but simply ex parte or self-serving, and were not admissible to contradict Trexler’s testimony as to what had previously occurred between him and the treasurer. They were made to a stranger to the title, and not by an agent of the defendant nor in the latter’s presence, and hence, are not competent evidence to' affect the defendant’s title to the premises in dispute.</p>
