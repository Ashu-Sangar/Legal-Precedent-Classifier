A borough ordinance under which a water company supplied water contained the provision that the grantees should have the right “to enter upon the streets and highways of the said borough for the purpose of supplying good water to said borough and the inhabitants thereof. . . . Said water to be mountain water taken from the springs or runs in Fairview Township, York County, Penna., so long as the consumption of the Borough shall not exceed the supply of such springs or runs as may be selected by said Horner, in which event the additional water shall be pumped from the Yellow Breeches Creek.” The borough sought to enjoin the laying of a proposed new line partly on the ground that this provision limited the right of the defendant company to pipes conveying water from the springs and runs referred to, so long as they furnished a sufficient supply. It appeared that the water which was to run through the new line came from the Yellow Breeches creek, a source of supply mentioned in the ordinance. <em>Held, </em>that even though there may be a sufficient quantity of mountain water from the springs and runs to supply present needs, the company, fixed with the obligation to keep up such supply, can provide for the future by making the water from the creek presently available for the borough.</p>

The complaint of the plaintiff is in substance that ■ the defendant supplies .... other places with water, and for the purpose of supplying such other municipalities and places outside of the borough of New Cumberland have constucted or are in process of constructing a filtering plant on the banks of the Yellow Breeches Creek . . . . outside of the limits of the borough of New Cumberland, and that for the purpose of conveying the filtered water from the above mentioned filtering plant to the consumers northward and outside of the borough of New Cumberland the said company proposes and have surveyed and made plans and commenced to dig and install a main water line from said filtration plant to the consumers of said company outside of the borough of New Cumberland, within the borough limits, without the consent of said borough; that said work has just started at the corner of Second and Geary streets within said borough, and the defendant has declared its purpose to be to convey said <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>main supply water line, through the said borough upon the line of said Geary street for a distance of about twelve hundred feet — the size of said pipe to be from twelve to sixteen inches in diameter — this being done without the consent of the borough authorities and against their protest. ... It is also averred that the Mountain Water Company supplies water under an ordinance passed by the borough of New Cumberland on January 20, 1896, and is bound by its provisions. The prayer is that the company defendant may be enjoined from digging trenches and laying water pipes on Geary street, or other streets and highways of the borough, and it be decreed that it has no authority so to do. . . .</p>

The general manager testified that ‘the purpose is to supply not only the territory north of New Cumberland, but also to supply a circulating system in New Cumberland, and to increase its pressure.’ Richwine, secretary and treasurer of the defendant company, testified that ‘the object of the company was to give a larger supply of water for fire protection;’ that what was proposed to be installed ‘was a grid-iron system, a cross system, connecting each pipe line, so as to give a certain flow, and so there will be no dead ends; so the water will flow through all the pipes of the system — a cross connection of each pipe line with the other.’ . . . The defendant is erecting a station and filter plant .... and other improvements to its system involving necessarily a very large outlay of money, and testimony was offered to show that one of the incentives to do this was that there had been complaint by citizens of New Cumberland as to the water supply . . . .; that by the laying of the proposed new and larger pipe, and making connections with those formerly laid it will give the circulation required to prevent water from becoming <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>stagnant in the 'dead ends/ which has heretofore obtained in the existing system of distribution; also that by means of this new pipe line, and the proposed connections, the company will be enabled to give New Cumberland and the other communities which it serves a much more abundant supply, and that of pure filtered water, and a pressure much more serviceable for fire purposes, as already stated. It was also shown .... that the establishment of the pumping station and purification works, the laying of a new force main from there to a new reservoir north of White Hill, and the laying of additional street mains in White Hill, Lemoyne and New Cumberland were submitted to Samuel G. Dixon, commissioner of health of the commonwealth, and were approved by him, and permits given to the company defendant .... to make the proposed additions and changes to its system, under the powers conferred upon him by the provisions of an Act of assembly approved April 22, 1905, P. L. 260.</p>

To that from the springs and runs in York County will be added pure filtered water from an inexhaustible source; circulation will be insured in the pipes and stagnation, with consequent deterioration avoided, while the additional pressure provided will render it more serviceable in case of fire, and insure better protection. As a matter of course, the ditches dug in which to lay pipes, will be filled up, and the streets put in equally as good condition for public travel as they were before being entered upon by the defendant.

Bristol Boro., <a href="/pa/224/0464-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="224 Pa. 464" data-case-ids="963113" data-case-paths="/pa/224/0464-01">224 Pa. 464</a>, 472); and there is no limitation in the ordinance which would affect the defendant’s right to construct the line in question.</p>
    <p id="b567-7" data-blocks='[["BL_567.10",567,[148,1882,1153,530]]]'>Should it be conceded that all general rights of the water company inconsistent with the municipal grant would be limited by the terms of the ordinance, that would not prevent the defendant from exercising charter rights, which are not inconsistent, simply because no direct reference to the particular rights desired to be exercised are to be found in the ordinance. In other words, the maxim “expressio unius est exclusio alterius” is not to be applied in the construction of this ordinance so as to deprive the water company of its charter rights.</p>

      <a id="p538" href="#p538" data-label="538" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*538</a>It is provided in the ordinance that Horner and his assignees shall have the right “to enter upon the streets and highways of the said borough for the purpose of supplying good water to said borough and the inhabitants thereof. . . . Said water to be mountain water taken from the springs or runs in Fairview Township, York County, Penna., so long as the consumption of the borough shall not exceed the supply of such springs or runs as may be selected by said Horner, in which event the additional water shall be pumped from the Yellow Breeches Creek.” The appellant contends that this limits the right of the defendant company to pipes conveying water from the springs and runs referred to, so long as they continue to furnish a sufficient supply. It appears, however, that the water which is to run through the new line is to come from the Yellow Breeches Creek, a source of supply named in the ordinance. Even though there may be a sufficient quantity of mountain water from the springs and runs to supply the present needs of the borough, it does not follow that the water company, fixed with the obligation to keep up such supply, could not provide for the future by making the water from the Yellow Breeches Creek presently available in the borough.

Under these circumstances, the fact that it may also be used by the defendant company for the purpose of transporting water beyond the borough limits, would not be sufficient to justify us in reversing the court below for refusing the relief asked for by the plaintiff.</p>

For instance, the first specification is: “The learned court below erred in its answer to the first finding of fact for the plaintiff,” quoting the request and answer. This specification should have shown that there was an exception taken, and the assignment of error should have been to the final action of the court on the exception. In Landis v.
