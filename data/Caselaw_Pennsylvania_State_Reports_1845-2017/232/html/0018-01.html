On March 30, 1910, the plaintiff tendered the defendant a proper deed for said real estate and demanded the balance of the purchase money. The defendant refused to accept the deed and to pay the balance of purchase money, alleging that the plaintiff did not have a good and marketable title to said real estate. This suit was then brought to recover said sum of $8,200. The parties have agreed upon a case stated, wherein they have stipulated that, if, in the opinion of the court, the said four children of Peter Wilbert, deceased, took title in fee to said real estate, judgment shall be entered in favor of the plaintiff for the sum of $8,200; but if, in the opinion of the court, the said four children did not take title in fee, that judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendant.</p>

      <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>(1) Did the appointment of William Hill as trustee prevent the application of the rule in Shelley’s case?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-5" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[284,577,1144,154]]]'>(2) Did the said four children of the testator take an estate in fee under the rule in Shelley’s case, or did they take a life estate only?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-6" data-blocks='[["BL_50.6",50,[284,739,1146,687]]]'>1. We do not regard the naming of William Hill as trustee for the children of Peter Hill as having any effect upon the construction of the devise to them. No object for the creation of a trust was specified in the will, nor were any duties prescribed for the trustee either with respect to the beneficiaries or with respect to the property devised. The trustee never did accept the appointment, and he never performed any duties thereunder. The trust was a dry or passive trust, pure and simple, and it was executed by virtue of the statute of uses. Therefore, the estate which the said children took was a legal, not an equitable, one, and the devise over, being a legal estate, the two can coalesce, under the rule in Shelley’s case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-7" data-blocks='[["BL_50.7",50,[284,1437,1145,475]]]'>2. What was the estate which these children took under the said will? The rule in Shelley’s case is a rule of law and is not merely a rule of construction of the language of a will. The question always is, Has the testator used language which brings the case within the operation of the rule? If he has done so, his supposed, or even declared, intentions are of no importance: Hileman v. Bouslaugh, <a href="/pa/13/0344-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Pa. 344" data-case-ids="964948" data-case-paths="/pa/13/0344-01">13 Pa. 344</a>; Kleppner v.

After the widow’s life estate terminated, the testator divided the remainder equally among his four children for their lives, and then directed that it should be divided equally among their natural heirs. In other words, the share of each ancestor should go tó his respective heirs equally. This is not a mode of distribution contrary to the intestate laws, but it is in accordance with them: Appeal of Cockins, <a href="/pa/111/0026-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="111 Pa. 26" data-case-ids="545433" data-case-paths="/pa/111/0026-01">111 Pa. 26</a>.
