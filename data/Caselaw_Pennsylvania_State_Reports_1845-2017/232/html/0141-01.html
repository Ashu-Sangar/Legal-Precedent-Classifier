The purpose of the enactment is to secure the safety of the workmen in the mines. The law declares that “it shall be obligatory” on the mine owners to leave such a barrier pillar as the tribunal of mine experts referred to shall determine to be sufficient for that purpose. It is for them to fix its width. Until they say that none at all is needed for the safety of the men, the obligation imposed by the statute remains.</p>

If none at all were needed it would seem idle for the inspector and engineers to fix a width of, say, one foot, for the sake, merely, of literal compliance with the statutory obligation of leaving a pillar of some width. If, therefore, we may apply the maxim that the law does' not require a vain thing, there is room for the construction that, in vesting in the inspector and engineers the power to determine how wide the barrier pillar should be to secure safety, the intent of the lawmaking power was to also empower them to say, if such be the fact, that the safety of the men does not require a barrier pillar of any width at all. But, be that as it may, it is evident that the act does not warrant a mine.owner in refusing to permit his engineer to participate in determining the question of the width of, or the need for, a barrier pillar simply because he, the mine owner, does not consider one necessary. In our opinion, the law requires such a pillar to be left, unless the inspector and engineers, after due examination of the premises and consideration of the subject, determine that none is needed to secure the safety of the men employed in either mine in case the other should be abandoned and allowed to fill with water.</p>

But, of course, such classification with reference to occupation must be reasonable and dictated by a necessity springing from manifest peculiarities clearly distinguishing those of one class from each of the other classes, and imperatively demanding legislation for each class separately that would be useless and detrimental to the others.

Repr. 383) it was said by our highest court, speaking by Mr. Justice Brown (p. 393) that, <em>“ </em>while the business of mining coal and manufacturing iron began in Pennsylvania as early as 1716, and in Virginia,. North Carolina and Massachusetts éven earlier than this, both mining and manufacturing were carried on in such a limited way and by such primitive methods that no special laws were considered necessary prior to the adoption of the Constitution for the protection of the operatives, but, in the vast proportions which these industries have since assumed, it has been found that they can no longer be carried on with due regard to the safety and health of those engaged in them, without special protection against the dangers necessarily incident to these employments. In consequence of this, laws have , been enacted in most of the States designed to meet these exigencies and to secure the safety of persons peculiarly exposed to these dangers. ... In (States) where mining is the principal industry, special provision is made for the shoring up of dangerous walls, for ventilation shafts, means of signaling the surface, for the supply of fresh air, and the elimination of dangerous gases (etc., etc.) .... These statutes have been repeatedly enforced by the courts of the several States; their validity assumed, and, so far as we are informed, they have been uniformly held to be constitutional.” Mr. Justice Brown then refers to certain cases where such laws were held to be constitutional under the police power, and among them, to Com. v.

Repr. 961), a provision in the mining act of that state requiring the mine owner to pay the fees for the inspection of mines by a state inspector was held to be valid and constitutional under the police power, though its effect was to deprive the owner of property, to-wit, the money required to be paid as fees. It was there said, as it might equally well be said in the case at bar, “the mining of coal is recognized as a dangerous and hazardous business and is a productive industry of the greatest importance. For many years in this State many thousands of men have been engaged in that character of work and a proper safeguard of their lives and health is a matter of so great interest and necessity that no subject can be mentioned where there is a more positive necessity for the exercise of the police power than in seeking to subserve their safety. . . . (Speaking of the payment of the inspector’s fees): The expense thus incurred is imposed because of the peculiar dangers of the surrounding situation and subserves not only the interest of the miners but alike protects the mine owner; and hence the payment of the fee (in this case, the leaving of coal for a barrier pillar) can be properly imposed upon the mine owner without violating any provision of the Constitution. ” That case was followed by Consolidated Coal Co. v. People, 186 111. 134 (57 N. E.

There the mining act in question provided, inter alia, that “no owner or tenant of any land containing coal shall open, or sink, or dig, excavate or work in any coal mine or shaft on such land, within five feet of the line dividing said land from that of another person or persons, without the consent in writing of every person inter-<a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>rested in, or having title to such adjoining lands,” etc. This provision was claimed to be unconstitutional as being an infringement of the rights of private property. It was held to be a proper exercise of the police power and not unconstitutional in the respect claimed, the court saying: "This is no undue assumption of the right to apply the police power to a subject which does not fall within it; for regulations (on this and other subjects mentioned) have long been recognized as wholesome and reasonable, and as fit subjects for the exercise of the police power, as tending to preserve the rights of the citizen and promote the welfare of the Commonwealth. The mining of coal is one of the largest industries carried on in the State. In mining, proper support and ventilation are necessary .... for the health and safety of the miner engaged in a dangerous employment, and for that reason the public welfare requires it. . . . This rib of solid coal not to be mined into by either of the adjoining owners was to be contributed by each in equal parts for the mutual benefit of each, for the protection of the surface, to secure independent systems of ventilation, drainage and workings, and in aid of an industry so great and widely diffused that the State as a whole is interested therein. , . .

Ency. of Law (2d ed.), 916, and cases there cited. Por example, in the case at bar, the state does not take the coal in the barrier pillar and convert it to a public use, but leaves it in the ownership and possession of the adjoining mine owners. The coal itself is not taken. The property right affected by the statute is not ownership, but use, of the material thing — the right to mine it out. . Nor does the state take that right for public use. The act does not transfer the right to mine out the coal from the owner to some one else, for the public benefit, but prohibits that right from being exercised by anyone — that is, destroys it, to prevent a possible calamity, to-wit, the flooding of mines, and to protect the lives of that class of the general public whose safety would be thereby endangered, and, incidentally, to conserve the mine property of the owners themselves. In this latter aspect of the case the destruction of the right to mine the coal bears some analogy to the destruction of buildings to prevent another sort of calamity — a conflagration. True, in the latter case the disaster is imminent, while here it is uncertain; so that perhaps a closer analogy in that respect would be the statute law requiring fire escapes to be placed on certain structures in order to avert a possibly remote catastrophe.
