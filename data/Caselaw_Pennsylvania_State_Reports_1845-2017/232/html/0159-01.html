She recovered a verdict and judgment thereon for $900. During all of the time she did the alleged nursing she was in the employ of the decedent as a domestic in consideration of $2.00 per week or $10.00 per month, and she was paid for her work as a domestic in full. At the trial the defendant’s counsel presented a written point asking for a binding instruction in favor of the defendant. This was refused, and an exception noted for defendant. After verdict, the same counsel moved the court for judgment non obstante veredicto upon the whole record, and this was refused and an exception noted for defendant and judgment entered on the verdict. Therefore, the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict is squarely raised by the first and second assignments of error and also by the third.</p>

This under the decisions, perhaps, does not necessarily prevent a recovery, provided the evidence clearly raises an implied contract by showing that the plaintiff and McCloskey both understood that the nursing was not embraced in the contract for domestic service, but that it was to be paid for on the basis of its value.</p>

But in the latter case it was only held that the services rendered by the plaintiff could, in the absence of any agreement fixing a price upon them, have been recovered for upon a quantum meruit. There was positive testimony of a declaration of the decedent that the plaintiff was to be paid for her services as nurse. The ruling there is that a recovery might be had upon a contract and that the amount thereof could be fixed as the value of the services.</p>

We cannot too often repeat the cautions we have so frequently uttered upon this subject, and we feel that the present occasion is one which demands both their repetition and their application.”</p>

But in view of the character of the plaintiff’s claim, and the fact that she was steadily under the employment of the decedent, for a long period of time, at $2.00 per week, and received her pay in full, and that she also received more than $100 from the Odd Fellows for her special care of McCloskey, and the further fact that her claim was not presented until after the lips of Samuel McCloskey and his wife were closed in death, we are not at liberty to permit our sympathies to obscure the legal principles established for the disposition of such'cases, by a long line of decisions of the Supreme Court, as well as by numerous decisions of this court.</p>

This plaintiff had been in the employ of the decedent for a long time without any bargain for more than $2.00 per week, and we cannot find in the testimony any sufficient evidence to warrant a jury in finding that there was even an implied contract to pay her more than the <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>stipulated sum. It is true that there was considerable loose talk by McCloskey to other persons about her services and that they never could pay her for the same, and again, that she would have to be paid at some indefinite time in the future. But there is also evidence on the part of the plaintiff, that she was told that they were not able to pay her more than the $2.00 per week, or at the most $10.00 per month. There is considerable evidence that she was expecting to be rewarded by a legacy from Mrs. McCloskey and after the death of the latter, and after it was found that the plaintiff was not remembered in her will, the plaintiff quit taking care of McCloskey and left him about twelve days before his death. There is no evidence of any agreement with the plaintiff that she was to have a legacy. Nor is there any satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff ever agreed with McCloskey that she would nurse and care for him and receive her compensation therefor in the future.</p>

In our opinion, .this case, as it appears from the evidence in the record, ought not to have been submitted to the jury.</p>

In reversing the judgment of the court below the Supreme Court said: “In the absence of any proof of a new contract, the law presumes that the plaintiff continued at service until she left, at the same wages at which she commenced. And this presumption is not destroyed by the fact, that she was required to do more work than she at first anticipated, in consequence of the defendant’s resumption of the active labors of farming. If she was dissatisfied with the original arrangement she should have demanded additional compensation.”</p>

The evidence is not sufficient to support either contention.

In each the plaintiff was paid in full as per contract. The plaintiff here certainly did not agree to remain and nurse McCloskey on the footing of a legacy, although it is quite clear that she anticipated the legacy, nor can we find from the evidence that she agreed to remain and nurse McCloskey on a contract for compensation in addition to the $10.00 per month, which she received.</p>
