The trend of all our modern decisions, federal and state, is to distinguish between individual and corporate suretyship where the latter is an undertaking for money consideration by a compány chartered for the conduct of such business. In the one ease the rule of strictissimi juris continues to prevail; with respect to the other, because it is essentially an insurance against risk, underwritten for a money consideration by a corporation adopting such business for its own profit, the courts generally hold that such a company can be relieved from its obligation of suretyship only where a departure from the contract is shown to be a material variance. The doctrine that a surety is a favorite of the law, and that a claim against him is strietissimi juris does not apply where the bond or undertaking is executed upon a consideration by a corporation organized to make such bonds or undertakings for profit. While such corporations may call themselves “surety companies” their business is in all essential particulars that of insurance. Their contracts are usually in the terms prescribed by themselves, and should be construed most strictly in favor of the obligee.</p>

He accepted its bond, with the appellant as its surety, to secure the payment of the damages to which he might be entitled. The condition of the obligation was as follows: “If the said Pittsburg, Binghamton &amp; Eastern Railroad Company shall pay or cause to be paid unto the said John H. Brown such amount of damages as the said John H. Brown shall be entitled to receive, in consequence of the location and construction of said railroad after the same shall have been agreed upon by the parties or assessed by and under the provisions of the acts of the general assembly, in such case made and provided, whether the same exceed the amount of the penalty in this bond mentioned, or not, without fraud or further delay, then this obligation to be null and void; otherwise to be and remain in full force and effect.” Some months after the bond was given to the appellee he and the railroad company agreed, in writing, that the value of the land and the damages to his property by reason of the location and construction of the railroad through and over it amounted to $5,500, and the agreement provided that upon the payment of the said sum, with interest, he would execute and deliver a deed to the railroad company for the right of way and the land occupied, free and clear of all incumbrances. The unsuccessful contention of the appellant in the court below, renewed here, is that the agreement of the appellee with the railroad company, made without notice to or consent by it, released it from liability on the bond, because “the amount agreed to be paid by the railroad company included not only the dam<a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>ages contemplated by the bond, but, in addition thereto, the value of the land itself, which, for the consideration agreed upon, the obligee agreed to convey to the railroad company in fee simple.”</p>

The appellee and the railroad company agreed “that the value of the land and the damages to the property by reason of the location and construction of the railroad through it” amounted to $5,500. If the agreement had stopped there, it is to be assumed that the appellant would not be questioning its liability on the bond, for this agreement was simply what viewers would have been required to find and report, if they had been appointed to assess the damages. Sec. 11 of the general railroad Act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 79, provides that it shall be the duty of the viewers, inter alia, “to estimate and determine the quantity, quality and value” of the lands taken or occupied, and “to estimate and determine whether any, and, if any, what amount of damages has been sustained.” The sole question to be determined is whether the agreement to convey the land in fee to the railroad company was a material departure from what was contemplated by the terms of the appellant’s bond. If it was not, the appellant has not been prejudiced, and cannot, therefore, successfully contend against its liability.</p>

Land taken from an owner under the right of eminent domain for railroad purposes has no further practical value to the owner, in view of the rights of the railroad company in it and over it, and che records may be searched in vain to find where anyone has purchased as a thing of value the ultimate reversionary right of the owner of the fee upon the cesser of the railroad company’s use of the land, and, therefore, it is that, though only an easement is taken for the public use, no deduction is made, in practice, in the assessment of damages for the reversionary right: Pierce on Railroads, 159. While authorities in support of this need not be multiplied, one directly in point may be cited. In Murray et al. v. County Commissioners, <a href="/mass/53/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="53 Mass. 455" data-case-ids="1976797" data-case-paths="/mass/53/0455-01">53 Mass. 455</a>, a turnpike road was changed into a public one, and the owners of the fee in the bed of the turnpike claimed that the land reverted to them on the discontinuance of the road by the turnpike company, and asked for the appointment of a jury to assess their damages as if the road were being originally laid out. In holding that they were entitled to no damages, Shaw, C. J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said: “The proprietors have already been paid for a perpetual easement over their land, for all the actual uses and purposes of public travel; a payment commonly estimated in practice at the value of the land itself.”</p>

In giving the deed the appellee did nothing to the prejudice of the appellant.</p>
