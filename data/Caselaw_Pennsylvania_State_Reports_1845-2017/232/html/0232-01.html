Trial by jury has become part of our mandamus system as administered in the common pleas, and such trials are conducted as in other actions at law, but the rule that the jury always have the right to judge for themselves whether they shall find a general or special verdict does not prevail. The whole structure of the Acts of June 14, 1836, P. L. 621, and June 8, 1893, P. L. 345, indicates that although jury trials are contemplated in mandamus they are for the purpose of ascertaining the facts for the guidance of the court in determining the question of issuing the peremptory writ.</p>

All of which couples the benefits of the special findings afforded by an equity proceeding with the advantages of trial by jury.</p>

In such a case, by reason of the defendant being a corporation and the fact that service was presumably made, in compliance with the equity rules, “in the mode prescribed by law for the service of a writ of summons upon such corporation,” which is consistent with the mode prescribed in sec. 5 of the act of 1893 for the service of a writ of alternative mandamus, there can be no objection to the appellate court remitting the record with directions to transfer the cause to the law side of the court, all costs to abide the final determination thereof in the court below, in compliance with sec. 3 of the Act of June 7, 1907, P.

Since a mandamus will never issue for a vain or useless purpose or to satisfy mere curiosity, this first proceeding would involve certain subsidiary issues, as, for instance, the question of the city’s financial ability under the law to purchase the defendant’s plant, and this question, in turn, would raise the issues as to the assessed value of the city’s real estate and the amount of its indebtedness, or, in other words, its borrowing capacity, and also, necessarily, the issue as to the cost of the water company’s plant, its maintenance and the dividends declared.</p>

Where, in such a preliminary mandamus proceeding, the evidence plainly shows that the works and property of the water company total a value greatly in excess of the amount which the city could raise under the law, the city is not in position to .make the purchase and hence is not entitled to a mandamus to force the water company to submit to an investigation of its books and properties, but where it can be shown that the probable price which would have to be paid for the water company’s property and the borrowing capacity of the plaintiff city approximate one another, the mandamus will issue to enable the city to make its investigation, and, after securing sufficient knowledge to qualify it to submit an intelligent offer, in accordance with the act of 1874, if that offer should be refused, the plaintiff could demand another mandamus <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>to compel the water company to convey its plant to the city upon payment of the estimated price; the water company could then take issue on the figures submitted by the city, and there would be a common law trial to adjudge the issues thus raised.</p>

(10) That neither the city nor the borough has at any time constructed waterworks. (11) That on June 1, 1907, the councils of Williamsport passed the following resolution: “Whereas, the Williams-port Water Company and the Citizens’ Water &amp; Gas Com<a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>pany have for more than twenty years supplied water to the public and the city; and whereas, it is the desire of the councils that the city shall become the owner of the works and properties of these companies under the provisions of clause 7 of sec. 34 of the act of April 29, 1874; therefore, resolved: 1. That the city declares its intention to become the owner of the works and properties of the companies and hereby agrees to pay therefor the net cost of erection and maintenance, with interest thereon at the rate of ten per centum per annum, deducting from the interest all dividends theretofore declared, provided, that the cost to the city of Williamsport, ascertained as above set forth, shall not, when taken together with the existing indebtedness of said city, exceed seven per centum of the valuation of the property in the said city taxable for county purposes; and provided further, that the electors of the said city shall assent, at a public election to be held for that purpose, to the increase of additional indebtedness of said city (not exceeding, when taken with the existing indebtedness, seven per centum of said assessed valuation) to a sum sufficient to effectuate the purchase. 2. The companies are requested to exhibit to the light and water committee of the city councils of the city of Williams-port a detailed and itemized statement showing the net cost of erecting and maintaining the works and property of the said company, as well as the amounts and dates of payment of all dividends heretofore declared, together with such other information as will enable said light and water committee to verify the statement or statements so made. 3. If the companies neglect or refuse to comply with the request for twenty days after notice, the light and water committee are to take legal steps to compel the companies to give the information demanded.” (12) That on July 12, 1907, a demand was made upon the defendant reciting the above resolution and requiring a statement in writing showing the net cost of erecting the waterworks and property of the Williamsport Water Company and the Citizens’ Water <em>&amp; </em>Gas Company, the net cost of main-<a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>taming the works and property of said companies, the amounts and dates of the payments of all dividends theretofore declared, the date of completion of the waterworks of each of the said companies, the general character of the maintenance of the works and property, and such other information as will enable the committee to verify the statements above required. (13) That on July 13, 1907, the two companies by their attorneys answered declining to furnish the information, giving as a reason that it was obvious that the city did not have enough borrowing capacity under the law . to raise a sufficient amount of money to make the purchase. (14) That on November 1, 1907, the plaintiff’s solicitor had been instructed to proceed against the two companies. (15) That the refusals of the desired information rendered it impossible for the city authorities to take intelligent action in the premises.

(14) Calling for proof of matters in corresponding paragraph. (15) Denying that the answer of the two companies averred in the corresponding paragraph of the bill prevents intelligent action by the plaintiff in the matter of acquiring the works and property of the defendant. (16) Averring that on September 3, 1907, before the bill was filed, the plaintiff, pursuant to a councilmanic resolution, requested its city engineer to furnish data and estimates of the cost of the works and property of the two water companies; that the engineer rendered such a report stating that he had had complete access to “all maps, plans, and data” of the two companies, and that the report “furnished a very reliable basis for the city to work upon,” and further that “the prices and areas of the land included in this report are matters of record;” that the total cost estimated by the engineer was 1858,221.55, not including the cost of maintenance. (17,18,19) That the defendant company, and its predecessors, had begun the construction of its work and the laying of its mains in 1865 and had continued with them to the present time, always supplying fresh and pure water to the places before stated. (20) That in order to protect the water supply from pollution and “acceding to the demands of the board of health of the City of Williams-port” the two companies had purchased and owned large tracts of land, in the case of the defendant amounting to 5,017 acres and of the Williamsport Water Co. to 2,020 acres.

(23) That prior to the resolution of June 1,1907, and to the filing of the bill, the plaintiff had knowledge that the defendant had become the owner of land and other properties in Armstrong township, largely at the command of the aforesaid board of health, which property was acquired at a cost greatly exceeding the borrowing capacity of the plaintiff city. (24) That on July 12, 1907, when the demand was made, and at the time of the filing of the bill, the last assessed valuation of taxable property within the plaintiff city was “$9,578,853, and its existing indebtedness $545,561.54, which indebtedness could not be increased more than $124,958.17, without violating sec. 8, of art. IX of the constitution; a financial condition known to the plaintiff.” (25) “That the plaintiff .... having knowledge before filing its bill that the cost of a portion of the works and property of the company when taken together with the existing indebtedness of the city, very largely exceeded seven per centum of the valuation of its taxable property, it was unnecessary and useless for her to proceed further and to require from the company the statement demanded; and hence the relief prayed for . . . . was inquisitorial and an unreasonable search, against .... sec. 8 of art. I of the Constitution.” (26) Calling attention that the resolution of the city councils declared its intention to purchase the works of the two companies provided that the city had sufficient borrowing capacity, and further calling attention to the fact that the report of the city engineer showed that the probable cost of the work would exceed the borrowing capacity by more than $700,000, and averring for that reason the proceedings against it were an unlawful attempt to enforce an unreasonable search. (27) Averring that because the resolutions of councils were aimed against the two companies jointly the suit was improperly brought against the defendant company alone.

The practice was changed from time to time by acts of Parliament allowing answers, returns and other pleadings. Special provisions for jury trials were made by these various acts, among them statute 9 Anne, chap. 20, enlarged by 3 and 4 Wm. IY, chap. 42, secs. 24, 25, but a power was reserved to the courts to “give judgment according to the very right and justice of the case:” Tapping on Mandamus, chap. 7, pp. 383 et seq. It would seem from Rob<a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>erts’ Dig. of Statutes, p. 384, that this statute of 9 Anne, and by inference its supplements above referred to, were part of our common law, but in the year 1831, in Com. v. Mitchell, <a href="/pen-w/2/0517-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="2 Pen. &amp; W. 517" data-case-ids="8879368" data-case-paths="/pen-w/2/0517-01">2 P. &amp; W. 517</a>, 518, referring to the statute, Gibson, C. J., said, “With us, it (mandamus) is supposed to stand very nearly, as it did in England before the statute 9 Anne, chap. 20.” However this may be, first by an act of 1722, then by the general mandamus Act of June 14, 1836, P. L. 621, and later by that of June 8,1893, P. L. 345, the substance of these English statutes was re-enacted into our law, and we established our own practice and pleading, which, while subject to some of the common-law rules, is not controlled absolutely by them. Trial by jury has become part of our mandamus system as administered in the common pleas, and such trials are conducted as in other actions at law, but the rule that the jury always have the right to judge for themselves whether they shall find a general or special verdict (Chambers v. Davis, 3 Wharton (Pa.) 40, 47; Patterson v. Kountz, <a href="/pa/63/0246-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="63 Pa. 246" data-case-ids="1018895" data-case-paths="/pa/63/0246-01">63 Pa. 246</a>, 252), does not prevail. The whole structure of our acts of 1836 and 1893 indicates that although jury trials are contemplated they are for the purpose of ascertaining the facts for the guidance of the court in determining the question of issuing the peremptory writ. The fact that by secs. 32 and 33 of the act of 1893 the Supreme Court is given the general power in mandamus to decide issues of fact without a jury, is a legislative recognition that such proceedings are not necessarily subject to all of the rules regulating the trial of common-law cases; for if they were, the legislature would have been obliged to provide a jury for the trial of these cases in the Supreme Court. Again, sec. 21 of the act of 1893 evidently had in view that there might be cases where the issues of fact would be decided by the common pleas without the aid of a jury. A review of the common law and the Pennsylvania acts show that, while trial by jury has become part of our system in administering the law of mandamus, the court may, if it deem such a course wise, submit special <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>issues instead of the general issue, and thereby secure special findings on the essential and controlling points raised by the pleadings and covered by the evidence. All of which couples the benefits of the special findings afforded by an equity proceeding with the advantages of trial by jury.</p>

In a case like the present the applicant for the writ presents a petition “setting forth the facts upon which he relies for the relief sought” and “the act or duty whose performance he seeks.” If the “petition presents the substance of a case for mandamus,” the court directs the writ to issue in the alternative form. The defendant then files his answer or return, and issue maybe joined thereon, as directed in the act of 1893, supra. When the case comes on for trial the issues of fact which are thus raised may be submitted to the jury, or by agreement of the parties they may be found by the court; or if the parties so desire, certain of them may be submitted to the jury and others may be reserved for the decision of the court: Treasurer of Jefferson County v.

Amendments may be allowed as in other civil actions save as hereinafter mentioned” ; and section 28, “The peremptory writ, though issued, may be superseded or quashed for such causes as to the court-may seem just, but no amendment thereto shall be allowed.” Thus the court can either issue the writ.or withhold it, or, the writ having issued, the court may supersede or quash it.

In the last of these cases we said, “The rule that the best evidence of a fact must be produced .... requires that where two different grades or qualities of proof exist, that which is the best shall be adduced, if practical; as, for instance, the contents of a writing must be proven by the production of the writing,' before secondary evidence can be given. But that rule has no application to a choice between witnesses, where both have legitimate knowledge of the subject matter of the inquiry. Some may have a better knowledge than others, but that will not exclude the knowledge of those who are the less informed, if it is otherwise compe<a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>tent. It is for the jury to judge of the sufficiency of the proof .... The proof offered by the expert testimony of Mr. Douglass was entirely legitimate and should have been received. He had a competent experience to qualify him for proving the probable cost of building .... the monument, .... and therefore he was a competent witness for that purpose.” “Evidence is not considered secondary where it carries with it no indication that better remains behind:” Cutbush v. Gilbert, 4 S. &amp; R. 550, 555. Ordinarily receipts and vouchers are not primary evidence: Townsend v.

The inquiry was not so much to ascertain the actual cost of the plant which the plaintiff would have to pay if it should become the purchaser thereof, but to determine if the city was in a financial position reasonably to entitle it to compel the defendant to submit to an investigation of its records and properties. If the evidence plainly showed that the cost of certain real estate recently acquired by the defendant, as a necessary part of its plant, actually exceeded the borrowing capacity of the city, that such real <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>estate represented but small part of the cost value of the whole plant, and that the defendant’s other properties, according to the testimony of expert witnesses, totaled a value that would cost many times the amount which the city could raise under the law, then the plaintiff was not in a position to make the purchase, and hence it was not entitled to a mandamus to force the water company to submit to an investigation of its books and properties.</p>
    <p id="b281-4" data-blocks='[["BL_281.5",281,[140,816,1154,689]]]'>But in a case where it could be shown that the probable price which would have to be paid for the defendant’s property and the borrowing capacity of the plaintiff city approximated one another, the mandamus would issue to enable the plaintiff to make its investigations; and, as before stated, after securing sufficient knowledge to qualify it to submit an intelligent offer, in accordance with the act of 1874, if that offer should be refused, the plaintiff could demand another mandamus to compel the water company to convey its plant to the city upon payment of the estimated price; the water company could then take issue on the figures submitted by the city, and there would be a common-law trial to adjudge the issues thus raised.</p>

L. 32, equity had no <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>jurisdiction, and the decree of the court below must be set aside.</p>

If necessary all of these points can be decided in due time and in a proper proceeding. In that connection, for the present we go no further than to decide that the plaintiff, as a municipality in which the defendant company is located, has a prima facie right to acquire the works and property of such company on the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>terms fixed in the act of 1874. Whether or not the facts peculiar to this case, when properly determined, will show that this particular company is not within the purview of the act, or that for any reason the city is not in a position to insist upon the rights given to municipalities under the statute, we do not now decide, or indicate any view. The court below made no findings in respect to the amount of the available borrowing capacity of the city, or the probable value of the defendant’s property, and while we will not prejudge either of these points, we do not refrain from saying that the testimony introduced indicates a strong probability of a lack of sufficient borrowing capacity, and that it will likely take years before this plaintiff will be in a financial position to acquire the works and property of the two water companies. In the meantime the development in the statutory law may eliminate as live issues between the parties all of the questions referred to at the beginning of this paragraph.</p>

Oil City Boiler Works, <a href="/pa/204/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="204 Pa. 453" data-case-ids="927533" data-case-paths="/pa/204/0453-01">204 Pa. 453</a>, 457); but we do not now pass upon that question or determine any other point in connection with the act. We acquiesce (Com. ex rel. v.
