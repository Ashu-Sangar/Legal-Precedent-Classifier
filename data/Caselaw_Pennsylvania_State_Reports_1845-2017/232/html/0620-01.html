In an ejectment suit in which the plaintiff claims under a deed alleged to have been signed by the defendant, which the latter denies, the court is not warranted in applying in its charge the rule that when one of two equally innocent parties must suffer by reason of the fraud of another, the loss should fall upon the one whose negligent act or omission has enabled the wrongdoer to commit the fraud, where the evidence shows that if fraud was committed, the only parties to it were the defendant’s brother, with whom she had left her deed for the sole purpose of enabling him to collect the rents for her, and a woman who represented herself as the defendant, there being no evidence of any agency and no act or omission on the defendant’s part enabling the brother to deceive the plaintiff.</p>

The rule of law is that, if two innocent persons must suffer the one who is least to blame is the one that must suffer least. In this case, if you should find that there has been imposition and fraud practiced by some one and that neither the plaintiff, Mr. Higinbotham, nor the defendant, Mrs. Pauch, was to blame, the burden is on you to determine which of them is the least to blame and you should find your verdict accordingly; that is, if they are both innocent and one or the other of them has to suffer. If this comes to be a consideration with you, it is your duty to take into account their respective positions, places of residence and opportunities for acquainting themselves with the facts and what was being actually done and by whom. If the contention of Mrs. Pauch is correct, that she was in or near Chicago and knew absolutely nothing of what was going on in South Brownsville, she could not be held responsible for anything that might have happened in South Brownsville, and having no opportunity to protect her interests no blame could be imputed to her. If, however, you should find that Mr. Frank Pauch was acting as the agent of Mrs. Anna Pauch and was looking after and attending to her affairs and betrayed the trust that she had reposed in him to the extent of presuming to act for her and impo'sed on Mr. Higinbotham, then there would be no blame attached to Mr. Higinbotham, if he used such care and caution as a reasonably prudent man would have used under the circumstances; if that comes to be a consideration with you, it will be your duty to determine which is the least to blame and the one who is the least to blame would be the one who should suffer least.] [1]</p>

In this case either Mr. Brashear or Mr. Smith is mistaken; they cannot both be correct in their testimony as to the identification of this defendant, and where this condition prevails it is the duty of the jury to determine which of them is correct and which of them is mistaken; or which of them is testifying correctly and which is testifying incorrectly or falsely; or if you should be satisfied that one or the other of them is testifying falsely it is your duty to determine which you think it is, and it is not only your right and your privilege but your duty to take into account the manner of the witnesses on the stand, any prejudice, malice, bias or ill will that they or any of them may manifest in the giving of their testimony, any interest that they or any of them may have in the result of your verdict; also any corroboration that there may be of either of the witnesses whose testimony is being considered by other evidence with the truth of which you are satisfied.

This- being a civil action, where there are questions of fact to be determined, and as we have indicated there is one important and prime question of fact for determination in this case, that is, -whether or not Mrs. Anna Pauch signed this deed on December 18, 1905 — if you- find the preponder<a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>anee of credible testimony to the effect that she did not sign it you will return a verdict generally for the defendant, and if on the other hand you find the preponderance of credible testimony is on the side of the plaintiff and you find that the defendant did sign and acknowledge this deed on December 18, 1905, you should return a verdict for the plaintiff for the premises described in the writ, together with six and a fourth cents damages.] [2]</p>

The defendant denied that she had signed the deed and the clearly defined issue was whether it was a forgery. She was a single woman whose residence was in Chicago. She purchased the property in question in 1903, and her deed for the same was duly recorded and left with her brother in Pennsylvania and he acted as her agent in collecting the rents and in looking after the property. In 1907 the plaintiff negotiated with <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>the defendant’s brother for the purchase of the property and at the settlement a deed was signed and acknowledged by a woman who was represented to be the defendant. At the same time the woman executed a writing directing the payment of the purchase money to the defendant’s brother. At the signing and acknowledgment of the deed four persons were present, the defendant’s brother, who died before the trial, the woman who executed the deed and the two subscribing witnesses, one of whom was the notary who took the acknowledgment. One of the subscribing witnesses testified at the trial that the defendant was the woman who signed, the other testified with equal positiveness that she was not. Corroborating circumstances were shown on both sides and it was evident that if a fraud had been committed, at the execution of the deed, the only parties to it were the defendant’s brother and the woman who signed the deed.</p>
