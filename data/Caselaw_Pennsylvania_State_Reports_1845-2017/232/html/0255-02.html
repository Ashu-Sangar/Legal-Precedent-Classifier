The plaintiff, a bridge company, owned a bridge erected to take the place of a destroyed bridge under the special Acts of March 23, 1865, P. L. 602, and February 19,1868, P. L. 177, the ninth section of the latter providing: “All property and franchises held by the said company at the site of the old bridge shall continue to be held in the same manner as if the bridge had been re-erected.” The latter bridge was located about 500 feet north of the old bridge, part of the abutments and the tollhouse of which remained. Subsequently the two counties whose boundary line was the river constructed a free bridge at the site of the old bridge, in the construction of which there was used stone from the abutments of the former bridge. It also appeared that the contractor caused the old tollhouse to be broken into, and at a later date, the building was put up at public auction by the county commissioners and sold. The parties were unable to agree as to the amount of damages sustained, if any. The bridge company brought an action in trespass against the two counties to recover damages for violation of their franchise and for the taking of the stone, the tollhouse, and the land upon which it stood. <em>Held, </em>that the Act of May 6,1897, P. L. 46, as amended by the Act of May 13, 1901, P. L. 191, providing in such a case for compensation to be made to the owners of a former bridge for the taking or impairment of their franchises or the taking of piers, approaches, tollhouses or other property by the appointment of viewers to assess damages, furnished a special remedy which the plaintiffs must pursue, and the common pleas has no original jurisdiction over the subject-matter.</p>

The plaintiff company is a corporation originally incorporated by Act of ... . March 26, 1814, P. L. 223, in which it was authorized to. erect a bridge from the east end of Market street, in the town of Lewisburg, to the opposite shore; ..... the plaintiff company did proceed and construct a bridge .... upon piers located in the river and abutments at either end. . . . This bridge continued to be used down to the year 1865, when, on the 17th day of March, of that year, it was destroyed by a flood. In the year 1867, the plaintiff constructed another bridge at a point which is about 400 feet north from the old bridge, at the western side of the river, and a distance of about 200 feet north at the east side of the river. . . . Subsequent to the destruction of this old bridge .... <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>and to the building of the new bridge .... the county of Union and the county of Northumberland constructed a free bridge at the site of the old bridge as located prior to 1865; in the construction of this inter-county bridge there was used .... stone taken from the western, abutment, and it has been testified on the part of the plaintiff that this stone amounted to about four carloads; .... It is my recollection that the testimony showed that there were two carloads used in the construction of ... . the new bridge .... and that the other two carloads were not used in the new bridge, but were used by the contractor. ... It is also shown on the part of the plaintiff that about the time of the commencement of the construction of this new bridge, which was on the 30th of December, 1905, .... the contractor, or those who were interested in clearing the ground for the construction of the new bridge, caused this old toll house to be broken into, and .... at a later date the building was put up at public auction by the Commissioners of Union and Northumberland counties and sold at public sale, and that there was derived from this sale the sum of $56.50, including the foundation and all. It has been testified on the part of the plaintiff by Mr. Wendel that he lived in this house from 1874 down to 1894, and that he had not been in the house from that time down to the sale, but gives it as his opinion that the whole premises, assuming that the plaintiff was the owner of the land on which they were located, were worth about a thousand dollars, and he fixed its market value at about that figure, but also said that considering the building alone he did not consider it of much value. ... Now this is substantially the testimony on the part of the plaintiff that relates to the subject of our inquiry . . . .; it presents at least two questions in reference to the stone — one as to the amount of stone that was actually taken and made use of by the defendants .... and the other as to the value thereof. The only witness that I recall that undertook to testify as to the value of this stone said that such stone <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>had a value of about one dollar and forty cents a perch, but stated further that in place they did not possess much if any value. . . . The value of the building, considering it as an independent proposition, must depend upon what it was worth at that place and at the time it was taken. If the land is considered with it, then of course the measure of value would be the value of the house as it stood there at the time and any other property connected with it.” Here the trial judge refers to the testimony going to show the circumstances under which the toll house was erected and whether or not it stood upon ground which could be classed as a public street, after which he said: “If the jury believe from the evidence that plaintiff never had any other title to this land, and there is no evidence here of any grant of title to any piece of ground connected with this bridge at the western end, then when it ceased to use this ground for bridge purposes, or when it ceased to use it for the purpose of maintaining a toll house there for that bridge, the land reverted back to either the original owner or to those by whom it was dedicated, and the plaintiff would have no right to damages for the land itself in this action. ... If you believe that this land was public property, then we say tó you that when the plaintiff bridge company ceased to use this land for the necessary purposes of a bridge at that place it had no longer a claim in the soil or to this easement that it may have up to that time enjoyed. . . . The next question you come to is, if you find this was public land there, a street or a dedicated plot of ground, and that plaintiff had abandoned, it for bridge purposes, what value had this toll house simply as a dwelling as it was used at the time of its being taken away. That is a question entirely for the jury under the evidence, and as you decide that so will you determine its value.” In answering requests for charge, the court informed the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover what they might determine to be the worth of the toll-house, and also the value of the stone from the old bridge which was used in the construction of the new inter-county <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>bridge; but if they believed from the evidence that the property referred to had no real value, there could be no recovery.</p>

The defendant neither expressly nor by its conduct at any time waived this point, but on the contrary questioned the jurisdiction of the court in its plea, by a motion for a nonsuit, and by requests for binding instructions (see Wiggins v. Columbian Fire-Proofing Co., <a href="/pa/227/0511-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="227 Pa. 511" data-case-ids="1008535" data-case-paths="/pa/227/0511-01">227 Pa. 511</a>, 516).

The evidence showed that the injury complained of was not the necessary consequence of the improvement, but that it arose through the negligent performance of the work. In reversing, we held that the liability declared upon could not be enforced in the form of proceeding adopted, and that the city was not estopped from raising the issue of jurisdiction, for the viewers could not be given authority to pass upon a question of liability which the law had not put within their jurisdiction.</p>

Brower, <a href="/pa/117/0647-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="117 Pa. 647" data-case-ids="555836" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0647-01">117 Pa. 647</a>, 656. We cannot agree that the act should be set aside as unconstitutional legislation. The fact that there is no express provision in the statute for paying or securing the damages before the taking or injury, cannot be urged as a valid basic objection. In Keene v.

The act provides that, "the costs and expenses” of the joint construction of the bridge are to be paid by the "Counties respectively, in the proportion of the population thereof,” and it further provides for the payment of damages for property taken, injured or destroyed and "authorizes the county commissioners of the respective counties” to raise the money therefor by the issuance of bonds, if necessary. These damages, when adjudicated and awarded to one injured, would constitute part of the “costs and expenses” of the bridge. Of course the construction of the bridge could not take place without the concurrent action of the two counties. Proceedings must be had in each of the counties affected before any final action can be taken which would cause such damages; and if these proceedings are not concurrent, those concluded in the first county would have to be subject to or await the action of the other county. The act provides that the court of quarter sessions of the county in which any tangible property taken or destroyed is situate, shall appoint viewers to assess the damages. By this method the courts of the two counties could, working concurrently, arrive at the total cost and expense of such items of damage. The act also provides that the damage to franchises suffered by the owners of the former bridge shall be ascertained in the same manner; and this presents the question as to which court shall adjudicate damages of this character. The preferable rule would probably be that the court of the county in which the headquarters of the corporation are situate, or the court wherein the first proceedings are had, should be intrusted with this duty; but these are matters of detail which the legislature has left for the courts and the administrative authorities to work out. While it would have been better had all such detail been provided for in the legislation, we cannot declare the statute invalid because of this omission; for the act distinctly declares that damages for injuries shall be paid, fixes the proportions in which they shall be paid, and provides machinery for ascertaining them.</p>

      <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>The statute further provides that the commissioners of the several counties can jointly build the bridges over streams forming the boundary line between two counties, and “if the said commissioners of the said counties” (the two counties affected in any particular instance) shall neglect or refuse to act, then proceedings may be taken to compel action. It is contended by the appellant that this provision is in itself sufficient to invalidate the act, because it is revolutionary and an encroachment upon the functions of the courts. The full text of the provision is as follows: “If'the said commissioners of the said counties shall neglect or refuse to act as herein provided, then, upon the petition of fifty property owners and tax-payers residing in the city, borough or township in which the bridge is or was located, which petition shall set forth fully all the facts supported by the affidavit of five of said property owners and tax-payers, to the court of common pleas of the counties where located, upon hearing, said court having jurisdiction shall issue a mandamus to said commissioners to proceed as provided by this Act.” We fail to see anything objectionable in the provision. We construe it to mean that the courts in each of the counties shall have jurisdiction over the commissioners of their own county. The commissioners are first authorized to use their discretion as to whether or not a bridge should be built; but this discretion is expressly made subject to review by the common pleas of the respective counties. While the discretionary power of a public official cannot ordinarily be controlled by mandamus, there is nothing in the law to prevent the legislature from ordaining such control when conferring the power, and that is precisely what they did in this particular instance. It is not necessary to construe the statute as a legislative encroachment upon judicial powers; we can never assume that the legislature intended such encroachment, and that construction should not be placed upon an act of assembly unless the words employed leave no other choice. The language of the section is that the fifty property owners shall pre<a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>sent a petition fully setting forth the facts (it does not say what facts) and that “upon hearing” the court “shall issue a mandamus.” The word “hearing” means “the session of any court, or of an adjunct thereof, for considering the proofs in a case:” Anderson’s Law Dictionary, 506; “The receiving of facts and arguments thereon for the sake of deciding correctly:” 4 Words &amp; Phrases, 3237. If the act had provided without more that upon the petition of the fifty property owners the court must issue the mandamus, the appellant’s argument would have much force, but it does not so provide; on the contrary, it particularly leaves the ascertainment of the facts and the decision of the cause to the court. In other words, the statute makes the action of the county commissioners subject to review by the common pleas; and if upon such review the court decides that the commissioners, under the facts presented, should, as the representatives of the county, exercise their authority for the purpose of the joint construction of an inter-county bridge, then it can compel action by a mandamus. The use of the word “shall” is consistent with this construction, and the phrase “shall issue a mandamus” simply designates the writ which shall be used for the purpose of compelling county commissioners to act. It is to be assumed that before a court would issue the extraordinary writ of mandamus, in order to compel the. county commissioners to enter into such an arrangement with the officials of another county, it would first ascertain as a fact the condition of each of the counties and see that the division of the financial burdens was properly arranged. We conclude that the act can be sustained as a constitutional and workable piece of legislation.</p>

It is also true that the facts found in <a href="/pa/197/0110-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="197 Pa. 110" data-case-ids="918643" data-case-paths="/pa/197/0110-01">197 Pa. 110</a>, so located the old bridge that the case was taken out of the act of 1897; but the amendment of 1901 makes the statute much more extensive in its operation, and the case as presented at the trial now under review was within the act as amended.</p>

Hence the case falls squarely within the jurisdictional conditions for the appointment of viewers as provided in the act, and the fact that the defendants contended that the property claimed for had long since been abandoned and had no value, was not such a denial of the claimant’s title as would estop the defendants from demanding their right to have the case tried according to the method prescribed in the statute.</p>

The grant to the bridge company must be construed most favorably for the public, and it cannot be said that the court below fell into error in holding that such grant could not be viewed as an exclusive franchise. The words used do not require such a construction, and so to hold would partially deprive the commonwealth of its sovereignty over the extension of roads and highways made necessary by the increase in population. Nor do we feel that error was committed in the conclusion that the ninth section of the Act of February 19, 1868, P. L. 177, did not allow the plaintiff a continuing franchise at the site of the old bridge as well as at the site upon which the new bridge was to be constructed. The authority given by the act was not to build an additional bridge!, but to rebuild the old bridge at a new site, and we construe the section in question to mean that all of the plaintiff company’s franchises for the bridge at the old site were preserved to it for the new bridge, and not that such franchises were to continue to exist at the old site. The plaintiff company’s abandonment, for bridge purposes, of <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>the old site for more than forty years indicates that it likewise so construed the statute. The issues as to the old tollhouse and its value, and as to the value of the other tangible property claimed by the plaintiff, appear to have been fully and fairly treated in the charge of the trial judge. If it were an open question whether or not this case should be sent back to the court below for a retrial, the incident complained of in the last assignment of error would not move us so to do.</p>
