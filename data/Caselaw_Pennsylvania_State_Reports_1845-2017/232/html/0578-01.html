On April 25, 1901, the defendant railroad company entered into a contract with an individual for the construction of an extension of its railroad. This contractor in turn made a contract on May 24, 1901, with the plaintiff, a foreign corporation, for the same work, which contract was guaranteed by the defendant company. The work was commenced by plaintiff in 1901 and prosecuted to completion in 1903. An arbitration followed and an award was made by the arbiter, to whom all disputes were referred by the terms of the contract. An action was then commenced by the plaintiff against the defendant company on the contract of guaranty, but plaintiff failed to recover because it was unregistered in this state at the time of the contract. Subsequently the plaintiff brought action under the provisions of the Act of May 23, 1907, P. L. 205, against the defendant upon the arbiter’s award, and recovered a judgment upon which a sci. fa. was issued, the plaintiff claiming a hen upon the railroad from the date of its contract under the resolutions of 1843 and 1862, whereby contractors, in the building of railroads, are given prior liens. This priority was contested by the trustee under a mortgage executed by the defendant and recorded July.l, 1907, to secure an issue of bonds. There was no allegation that the trustee, or any purchaser of the bonds, ever made any inquiry such as would have disclosed the lien of the plaintiff, nor is it alleged that anyone was actually misled. <em>Held, </em>(1) the Act of May 23, 1907, P. L. 205, which makes enforceable contracts theretofore made by unregistered foreign corporations and unenforceable by the Act of April 22, 1874, P. L. 108, while retrospective, is not unconstitutional; (2) the plaintiff is a contractor within the meaning of the resolutions, and not estopped from asserting the existence of that relation against either the defendant company or the trustee, by reason of having brought a previous suit in the capacity of subcontractor against the defendant upon its contract of guaranty.</p>

On April 25, 1901, the West Side Belt Railroad Company entered into a contract with A. S. Petrie for the construction of an extension of its railroad. Petrie, in turn, made a contract with the plaintiff, May 24, 1901, for the construction of the said extension, which contract was guaranteed by the West Side Belt Railroad Company, John S. Scully and T. N. Barnsdall. The work was commenced by the plaintiff on May 20, 1901, and it prosecuted the same continuously until completion, June 11, 1903. An arbitration followed, and an award was made by the arbiter, to whom all disputes were referred by the terms of the contract.

Scully and T. N. Barnsdall, to recover upon the said guaranty. That litigation resulted in a decision that the plaintiff could not recover, because it was a foreign corporation and had not established a place of business and designated agents for the transaction of its business in Pennsylvania, at or prior to the time of the contract with the said A. S. Petrie, and, therefore, it was precluded from maintaining the action by the provisions of the Act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, approved April 22, 1874, P. L. 108.

But, upon inquiry, he would have learned that the defendant’s railroad was being constructed by the plaintiff; and he would have been bound to inquire concerning all the facts and circumstances relative thereto. Then he would have learned the very facts and circumstances, which were afterwards deter<a id="p585" href="#p585" data-label="585" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*585</a>mined to be sufficient to constitute the relation between the plaintiff and the defendant as in fact contractual, and which justified the Supreme Court in saying, when rendering its decision as aforesaid:</p>

It seems to us that this is the situation of the Colonial Trust Company and of the holders of the bonds, secured by its mortgage, with respect to the contention there was no notice of the plaintiff’s claim. The lien claimed by the plaintiff is not a secret one. It is a right given by the legislature of the state.

Consequently, when the plaintiff sought to hold Scully and Barnsdall liable, the action had to be brought against them upon the guaranty, which was the only contract the plaintiff had with them. But, in order to maintain the action against Scully and Barnsdall, the- plaintiff was obliged to join the West Side Belt Railroad Company, because it also was one of the joint guarantors. It is apparent why the plaintiff brought the action as it did in the United States circuit court. That action was upon the contract of guaranty, and all the other allegations and contracts pleaded were incidental thereto. But, when the plaintiff brought its action in this court, it brought it upon the original contract, alleging a primary and not a secondary liability. If the defendant now finds itself in this dual situation, it has no one except itself to blame, because it voluntarily placed itself in both situations.

Both parties had the power to make such a contract; they did make it; and the plaintiff performed all, and the defendant the greater part, of the obligations respectively undertaken. That both parties were under a moral obligation to fully perform it cannot be seriously disputed. That the plaintiff was likewise morally entitled to all the incidents of said contract, including the lien given by law, is equally indisputable. And, if both parties had fully performed the contract, no one, certainly not the Colonial Trust- Company, could have questioned their action. But the plaintiff could not invoke the aid of the courts to enforce performance, not because the contract was illegal or void, but solely because of the provisions of said act of 1874. This was a legislative inhibition, which the legislature had the power to remove at any time. When the legislature did remove the inhibition, as it did by the act of May 23, 1907, it placed the said contract in precisely the same condition in which it would have been, had the statute of 1874 never been enacted. It likewise made the contract an obligation, legally enforceable, with all its incidents, which was exactly what the parties intended it should be, when they signed the instrument on May 24,1901. The act of 1907 does not say that it speaks only from its date. On the contrary it validates and makes enforceable contracts theretofore made, but which were not enforceable because of the act of 1874.

Therefore, by force of said act of 1907, the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant became a valid and binding contract, as of the date of its execution and as to all its provisions and stipulations; and in consequence the award of the arbiter became a legal finding of the extent of the defendant’s liability thereunder. Upon said con<a id="p588" href="#p588" data-label="588" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*588</a>tract and upon said award the plaintiff was enabled to sustain a recovery, and upon no other ground.</p>

Crowninshield, <a href="/us/17/0122-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="17 U.S. 122" data-case-ids="4696" data-case-paths="/us/17/0122-01">17 U. S. 122</a>.</p>

Every right which it secured, when its mortgage was given, still exists unimpaired; and so does every remedy which the law or the contract then provided. In other words, the obligation of the contract between it and the defendant remained precisely the same after the passage of said act as it did before. If the said act relates back to the date of the plaintiff’s contract, as the plaintiff contends, the Colonial Trust Company and the holders of bonds secured by its mortgage will have exactly the same security they obtained, when the mortgage was given and the bonds purchased. The act does not take away one iota of their security. If, on the other hand, the said act speaks only from its date, as the Colonial Trust Company contends, it and the holders of said bonds will have a greater security than that for which they bargained and paid. For it must not be forgotten that every dollar’s worth of labor and <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>material, which the plaintiff put into said railroad, increased the security of said bonds to the same or even greater extent. So that the equity of the contention of the Colonial Trust Company and of the said bondholders is not quite apparent. If, therefore, the Colonial Trust Company and the said bondholders have not been deprived of any right or of any remedy by the passage of the act of 1907, and we have seen they have not; and, if they had notice of, or could with reasonable diligence have ascertained, the relation between the plaintiff and the defendant, upon what possible ground can it be said that the act of 1907 impaired the obligation of their contract with the defendant? It seems to us there is none whatever, and that we must hold the act did not have that effect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b619-3" data-blocks='[["BL_619.4",619,[142,1191,1152,530]]]'>Equally untenable is the position, that said construction of the act will result in the taking of property without due process of law. By no possible reasoning can it be shown that any property, in which the Colonial Trust Company has an interest, will be taken by said construction of the act. It has its lien: and it is the same lien which it had at the inception of its mortgage. Not a particle of the property, upon which it secured a lien, has been taken away. Therefore, it will not be deprived of any property at all, much less “without due process of law.”</p>

The mortgage was executed and recorded, and the bonds secured thereby were issued, certified and delivered, long before the plaintiff made its contract with, or performed any work for, the West Side Belt Railroad Company.. Consequently that mortgage was a subsisting lien at the date of the plaintiff’s contract, and that lien, to the extent of the bonds of that issue still outstanding, cannot be displaced by the said resolutions of 1843 and 1862.</p>
