    <p class="summary" id="b217-8" data-blocks='[["BL_217.15",217,[165,1782,1153,467]]]'>Plaintiff instituted suit against the defendant to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by him by reason of the negligence of the defendant company. A verdict was recovered by the plaintiff in the sum of $3,200. A motion for a new trial was made to the trial judge, which was overruled. Thereafter an appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of this state. The Supreme Court overruled all the assignments of error and affirmed the judgment entered on the verdict.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b218-4" data-blocks='[["BL_218.5",218,[262,917,1154,529]]]'>At the time this case was tried the defense was that the plaintiff was suffering from paralysis by reason of a disease he had acquired prior to the accident. The trial judge in his charge to the jury instructed them that if the plaintiff was suffering from the disease as contended for by the defendant there could be no recovery whatever. The verdict of the jury, under the instructions from the court, showéd conclusively that in their judgment the paralysis of the plaintiff was due to the accident, resulting from the defendant’s negligence.</p>

    <p id="b219-9" data-blocks='[["BL_219.11",219,[155,1244,1162,693]]]'>Shortly after this court had affirmed the judgment obtained by the appellee in the court below the appellant made application to that court to vacate it for the alleged reason that it had been procured by the fraud, perjury and deceit of the appellee. The relief sought was extraordinary, and it was denied because in the opinion of the court below the appellant had not made out a case calling for it. We have not been persuaded that this was error. The reasons for discharging the rule to show cause why the judgment should not be vacated and a new trial awarded are set forth in the court’s opinion denying appellant’s petition. In it we concur, and on it the appeal is dismissed at appellant’s costs.</p>
