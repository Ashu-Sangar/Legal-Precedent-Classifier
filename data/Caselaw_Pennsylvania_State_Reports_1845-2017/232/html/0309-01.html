Under the constitution and laws of Pennsylvania, all the sovereignty inherent in a state, and not ceded to the United States of America, belongs to the commonwealth and to the commonwealth alone. Within its domain there are no co-ordinate sovereignties. There are agencies called counties, cities, towns, etc., upon whom the power to exercise certain portions of the state sovereignty, within <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>certain limits and for certain specified purposes, may from time to time be conferred by the state. Cities upon which such powers are conferred are commonly said to have city charters. These charters, however, are merely revocable at the will of the legislature by laws properly enacted. From the historical fact that in England there were charters of a higher grade for certain cities, no consequences can be drawn for our commonwealth. Doubtless it was. felt, when sovereignty was divided between the United States and our commonwealth, that a further subdivision within the commonwealth would imperil its position, if any question should ever arise between its sovereignty and that of the nation. At all events, the one and indivisible nature of our state sovereignty has been consistently and jealously guarded.</p>

Its effect is to take for the use of the State a portion of the private property of a citizen, upon his implied consent to such taking, which implied consent may not, in law or in fact, be denied. In order that such taxation shall be fair and equal, the state has established a uniform system, providing for assessors of counties, whose duty it is to take an account of real and personal property belonging to each of the taxable inhabitants within their jurisdiction. And these assessors must swear that they will justly and honestly to the best of their judgment, assess and value every separate lot, piece or tract of land, with the improvements thereon, and all personal property made taxable by the laws of this commonwealth at the rate or price which they, after due examination and consideration, believe the same would sell for, if sold singly and separately and at .a bona fide sale, after full public notice, and that <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>they will perform their duties with honesty and fidelity, according to the laws of this commonwealth, without fear, •favor or affection, hatred, malice or ill-will. This oath is under the Act of July 27, 1842, sec. 9, P. L. 441, and by sec. 10 of the same act a board of revision is provided, whose duties, under sec. 13, are defined to be to examine and inquire whether the returns of the assessors have been made in conformity with the laws of this commonwealth, and whether all property to be valued for taxation for state and county purposes has been valued at a sum or price not less than the same would bring, after full public notice, at a public sale, supposing each separate lot or piece or tract of land, with the improvements, or the personal property of each individual, company or corporation only were to be sold. They are, moreover, to consider the written communications of any taxable inhabitant of the county relative to any property which such taxable inhabitant shall believe to have been reduced too low or raised too high, and raise or reduce the same so as to revise and equalize the assessment.</p>

It has been used without question for forty-five years, and by common consent has been accepted as a substitute for the legislation on that subject, contained in the consolidation act of 1854, for the obvious reason that where the simultaneous administration of an earlier system and a later system is practically impossible, the act establishing the later system, by necessary implication, repeals the former act.</p>

If, therefore, the city claims any power in the premises, it must be only a partial power. Its utmost contention cannot go beyond a claim that it may interfere with the assessment of real estate, but not with the assessment of personal estate. Any power claimed by a municipal corporation to supervise, in part or in whole, a department created by the commonwealth must be based upon an express grant, or upon necessary implication from such a grant.</p>

It seems to be conceded by all that, whatever system is adopted, its basis must be the fair prices obtained by actual sales in each vicinity. The most that can be contended is that it is theoretically possible from such actual sales to derive a stable law which shall ascertain the general judgment of buyers as to values in a particular vicinity. In view of the great differences between the intellects of men, and having regard to the complexity of modern urban life and the vicissitudes in national financial conditions and prosperity, the establishment of such a fixed rule cannot be said to be easy of attainment. Assuming, however, that the difficulty has <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>been perfectly solved, and that it shows that the law now regulating the judgment of assessors is inadequate and should be replaced by an improved standard, the proper forum to address is the legislature of the commonwealth.

Pittsburg, <a href="/pa/183/0202-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="183 Pa. 202" data-case-ids="896158" data-case-paths="/pa/183/0202-01">183 Pa. 202</a>, it was held that the city might appropriate money to a committee of private citizens which had been created by the chamber of commerce, a corporation therein existing, and later approved and accredited by the city councils, to defray the expenses of surveys for a ship canal, and to secure information from experts touching the practicability of such canal and the probability of its commercial advantage. It was held that the appropriation was valid as within the power <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>of the councils. The argument on the part of the contestants was that this action was within the inhibition of sec. 7, art. IX. of the constitution, which forbids a municipality “to appropriate money or loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution or individual.” The Supreme Court did not sustain the appeal. The judgment there proceeded, according to our understanding, upon the doctrine frequently announced, and herein expressed, that in matters of civic government councils may legislate in the interest of the municipality for the benefit and welfare of the citizens at large where they do not interfere or impinge upon the sphere and authority of agencies already created for the attainment of the same object or violate the conditions of their charter. That case differs from this in that there had been created no power to act upon the important subject committed to a body described upon the record as “The Provisional Committee of the Lake Erie and Ohio River Ship Canal.” In the case at bar we have already shown that the state has provided a public department for the appraisal of real estate.</p>

The ordinance was held invalid, as an attempt to provide an action inconsistent with, and not authorized by, the existing legislative system. The Supreme Court said: “Councils are powerless to provide any remedy to be used as a substitute for attachment or any other remedy which the legislature has heretofore withheld on grounds of public policy or otherwise.” In Bechtel v.

It was held: “The Legislature has provided officers whose duty it is to levy all taxes, officers to cause all property to be properly assessed and placed upon the tax rolls, and officers for the collection of such taxes. ... It is true that a county is interested and concerned in the matter of the collection of taxes. Its revenues are derived chiefly therefrom, and it is important to it, and to the State as well, that all property properly taxable pay its just share and proportion of the public burdens. But the county is not charged with the duty of seeing to it that all such property is assessed and placed upon the tax rolls. Other officers acting independent of the county are charged with the performance of such duties and they are alone responsible therefor. The matter of unearthing and discovering property which has escaped taxation is not only not necessary to the exercise of the corporate powers of a ' county, but is beyond its express or its implied authority.”</p>
