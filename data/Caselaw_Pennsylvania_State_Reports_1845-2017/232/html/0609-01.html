A statement of the occurrence favorable to the appellant is that after an altercation with McDevitt on the street in relation to a dog, he went home and returned to the street where half an hour later the altercation was renewed. McDevitt seized the appellant by the arm, and made a threatening remark and gesture. The appellant drew a razor from his pocket and inflicted the wound that caused death. The different degrees of murder, manslaughter and the right of self-defense were defined with <a id="p611" href="#p611" data-label="611" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*611</a>exceptional clearness and accuracy in the charge, and the defendant’s points which covered every feature of the case favorable to him were affirmed without qualification. The assignments of error are to the following excerpts from the charge: “I do not believe there is anything in the case that would justify you in saying that the evidence warranted the defendant in killing McDevitt in self-defense. There was no weapon in sight, and I do not think the evidence would justify you in saying that he should be acquitted on the ground that he killed in self-defense. The same thing applies to manslaughter. But you are not bound by my opinion. I do not think the evidence warrants a verdict of manslaughter.” In immediate connection with these statements it was said: "I do not bind you by my opinion. If you believe the evidence justified a killing in self-defense, you have a right to say so; you are not bound by my opinion on that point or upon any other point in the case .... if you believe the evidence does justify it, in accordance with the law as I have given it to you, you are warranted in finding him guilty of manslaughter, notwithstanding my opinion.”</p>
