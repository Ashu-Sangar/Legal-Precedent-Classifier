Keim never took out letters testamentary, as appears from the records of the orphans’ court of Berks county but, by a paper dated April 18, 1838, renounced the trust. When this paper was filed does not appear, but one Samuel S. Jackson was granted letters de bonis non cum testamento annexo, on May 23,1838. Notwithstanding Keim had never taken out letters testamentary, on April 23, 1838, he was substituted as executor in the case of William Silvis v. Valentine Brobst, the judgment I spoke of a few moments ago. This substitution was by agreement of one Dunn, acting as attorney for Keim executor, and is dated April 16, 1838, the agreement for substitution antedating the renunciation by two days.

On September 10, 1838, a writ of venditioni exponas was issued, which was stayed by plaintiffs’ attorney. On September 25, 1839, a pluries venditioni exponas issued, an alias in the meantime having been issued and stayed. Up to this time the judgment stood and all the proceedings thereon, Silvis v. Keim, executor. On November 30,1839, Samuel S. Jackson, administrator, etc., was, by agreement, substituted. January 29,1840, the third pluries venditioni exponis was issued, the second having, in the meantime, <a id="p632" href="#p632" data-label="632" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*632</a>been stayed and under this the lands levied upon were sold (among which was the land in suit in this case), to William Silvis for the sum of $9,800.

He had not been brought into court and was not upon the record at the time the fieri facias issued and at the time of the inquisition and condemnation of the land. The record itself is regular. We only know from proof, introduced here upon the trial de hors the record, that Keim had never accepted the trust imposed upon him by the will of Valentine Brobst. He was named in the will as one of the executors of Valentine Brobst. He was substituted by an agreement of an attorney acting for him, but there is nothing in the case to show that there is any irregularity in this record which was brought to the knowledge of Silvis, the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, and we believe that the irregularity cannot affect his title.</p>

The party who alleges fraud must prove it. There is not a particle of evidence, as I have said, that he ever accepted under this deed of assignment or even knew he was named therein, and courts and juries are not permitted to lightly infer fraud, and in this case you would have to find it without any evidence, which is not permitted.</p>

We know of no law that will compel a prothonotary to keep his minutes all in one book or that will prevent him keeping the minutes of the court in a book which may be termed and labeled on the back thereof “Sheriff’s Deed Book.” Some fifteen or sixteen deeds were acknowledged that April Term, as shown by the minutes and record of the acknowledgment contained in this sheriff’s deed book, or this so-called sheriff’s deed book, and very few, if any of them, are minuted in the regular common pleas minute book of that date.

Silvis and those who claim under him have paid the taxes on these lands from 1840, from the time of this sheriff’s sale, down to the present time. They took possession of the lands back in the fifty’s or sixty’s and even earlier than that, built some houses on them as the evidence shows and collected rents. The houses have been occupied from 1854 to the present time and the rents have been paid over to the Lehigh Valley Coal Company,' the present owners. They have, during all these years, been collecting the royalties for sand and stone, and other improvements have been put upon the property.</p>
