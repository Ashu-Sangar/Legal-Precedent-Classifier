It does not state the whole number of votes cast in tbe ward, nor tbe number improperly endorsed.\nWaiving the question of the legality of the endorsement, we think the insufficiency of the petition justified the decision of the court.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Zerby versus Snare.\nA petition was tiled to contest the election o\u00ed a borough officer, wliieli averred that many illegal ballots were cast, and counted against the contesting candidate, and if they had not been counted the contestant would have been elected; the petition, however, failed to aver expressly that said illegal votes were cast for the candidate who was declared elected, and also omitted to state the number of such illegal votes or the whole number of votes cast: Held, that the petition was defective and insufficient, and was properly quashed.\nJune 9th, 1884.\nBefore Merche, C. J., GoruoN, Paxson, TrtjxKey, Sterrett, GreeN, and Claek, JJ.\nCertiorari to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Dauphin county: Of May Term, 1884, No. 49.\nA petition of twenty-five qualified voters of the first ward of the borough of Steelton was filed, contesting the .election of Harry H. Snare, as high constable of said borough, on the ground that certain of the ballots east were illegal, in that instead of being printed with the heading \u201cBorough,\u201d as directed by law, they were headed \u201c Republican Borough Ticket.\u201d\nThe petition averred that the officers of the general election held for said borough on the third Tuesday of February, 1884, liave certified and returned that Harry H. Snare received 246 votes for said office, and Cyrus Zerby received 237 votes; that said election was undue and illegal; that manj' ballots which were illegal, for the reason above stated, were voted and counted against Cyrus Zerby as though they were legal, notwithstanding objection thereto was made to the election officers. The petitioners averred \u201c that should the illegal votes be taken from the whole number of votes cast in tbe first ward of said borough, then Cyrus Zerby, and not Harry H. Snare, would receive a majority of all the legal votes in the borough of Steelton, and be entitled to the office of high constable of said borough.\u201d The petitioners therefore prayed for an order, &c., &c.\nHarry H. Snare filed a motion to quash the said petition, on the ground, inter alia, that the petition was defective in failing to aver the number of alleged illegal ballots, or that the same were counted for said Snare, or to aver the total number of all the votes cast.\nAfter argument on the motion to quash, the court, in an opinion bv McPhersoN, J., held that while said ballots headed \u201c Republican Borough Ticket \u201d were irregular and improper, yet the provision in the Act of March 30th, 1866 (P. L. 92), as to the headings of tickets, was directory merely and not mandatory: citing McCrary on Elections, 126, 194, 400 ; Wheelock\u2019s Case, 1 Norris 297 ; Boileau\u2019s Case, 2 Pars. Eq. Cas. 603 ; Brightly\u2019s Elec. Cas. 268 ; and further, that as the petition did not allege that the actual merits of the election were affected by the irregular ballots cast, and the petition was otherwise defective, the court granted said motion, and entered an order quashing the petition.\nThe petitioners took this certiorari, assigning for error, inter alia, said decree.\nCasper Dull, for the plaintiffs in the certiorari.\nThe Act of 1866 is not the only Act pertinent to this question ; the Act of July 2d, 1839 (P. L. 634), is in pari materia with the Act of 1866, section 71 of which provides: \u201c All tickets folded and endorsed as aforesaid, and personally delivered by the voter, and none other, shall,\u201d &c., &c. The Act of 1866 provides that voters are \u201c authorized and required \u201d to vote by tickets classified and headed as therein directed. These statutory provisions, we contend, are essential and mandatory; hence the ballots in this case which the court below termed \u201c irregular and improper \u201d were absolutely illegal and void. If this be so, the averment in the petition that if they had not been counted Zerby would have been elected, -was sufficient to give jurisdiction, and the court erred in quashing the petition. The Act of 1874 merely requires that \u201c the petition shall concisely set forth the cause of complaint,\u201d &c.: Commonwealth v. Woelper, 3 S. & R. 40; Melvin\u2019s Case, 18 P. F. S. 333 ; Wheelock\u2019s Case, 1 Norris 299 ; Election Cases, 15 P. F. S. 31; Mann v. Cassidy, 1 Brewst. 26,^29 ; In re Contested Election of McDonough, 9 Out. 488.\nMcQarrell (Fleming with him), contra."
