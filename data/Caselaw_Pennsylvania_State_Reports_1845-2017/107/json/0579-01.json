        "text": "Chief Justice Mercur\ndelivered the opinion of the court November 13th, 1884.\nIt is well settled that when the courses and distances given in a return of survey differ from the natural and artificial boundaries on the ground, the latter shall govern. Where there are no such monuments on the ground, and there is a discrepancy between the courses and distances given and the adjoining lands called for, the latter will prevail: Koch v. Dunkel, 9 Norris 264. But in ascertaining the location of a tract of land, the inquiry is not where it should or might have been located, but where it actually was located: North-umberland Coal Co. v. Clement, 14 Norris 126.\nIn plaintiff\u2019s abstract of title furnished, it is averred that the warrant issued on the 10th of December, 1784, and the survey thereon was made on the 6th of May, 1800 ; but that survey was not given in evidence. Hence the case lacks the essential evidence of official location on the ground.\nIt is true a patent dated the 23d of February, 1847, was given in evidence, and some evidence was given of a survey made about 1850. It is not proved by wliat authority that survey was made, and one of the persons who carried chain in making it, testifies that the patent does not cover the land as surveyed. Thus without proving the original location of the warrant, and when it is shown that the land in contention is not covered by the patent, the attempt is made by an unofficial survey, to apply the patent to other lands. This is such a departure from all recognized rules in ascertaining the true location of a warrant issued by the Commonwealth, that the court very correctly took the case from the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Payne versus Howard.\nA plaintiff in ejectment based his claim upon the ground that the locus in quo was included in an original warrant and survey in 1784^1800, but was, by mistake of a subsequent unofficial survey in 184=7, omitted therefrom and consequently was not included in the patent granted in pursuance of the latter survey. The original survey was not offered in evidence. Plaintiff offered testimony to show the alleged error in the second survey.\nHeld, that without proving the original location of the warrant, the attempt made, by an unofficial survey to apply the patent to lands not described therein, was such a departure from recognized rules in ascertaining the true location of a warrant issued by the Commonwealth, that the court below properly entered a nonsuit.\nNovember 5th, 1884.\nBefore Mercttr, C.

Patterson, dated September 9th, 1797. Thomas B. Patterson conveyed the same to Samuel Ewalt by deed dated September 17th, 1803, and Samuel Ewalt sold his interest in the same to James Gil-lam and John Nickle by articles of agreement dated August 27th, 1814. James Gillam got into the possession of the entire premises, and remained in possession up to the time of his death, preceding which he made his will, which is recorded in Allegheny county in the Register\u2019s office, in Will book No. 6, page 33, in which he appointed James Payne executor of his will, who proceeded and obtained a patent on Rayburn\u2019s warrant for the heirs or devisees of James Gillam, dated February 23d, 1847, and having' obtained a patent for the same, said Payne also obtained a quit claim to himself from the heirs of John Nickle, deceased, dated April 24th, 1847, and then said Payne, executor of the will of said James Gillam sold by deed dated. March 24th, 1848, the property of said James Gillam to William A. Payne, a part of which plaintiff claims is the property in controversy in this suit. When James Payne applied for a patent he employed Mr. Hastings to survey the property in order to get a description of it, and said surveyor, in the presence of the two chain carriers, Joshua Nickle and Joseph Payne, who were directed to carry the chain and measure the distance along the line of Samuel Wilson\u2019s until it reached the line of Samuel and Isaac Large, across a portion of Peter\u2019s Greek, and that they then ran along the line of said Samuel and Isaac Large to tlio land of Hugh Kennedy, and from the point where the Large line met the Kennedy line; thence along the Kennedy line until it reaches the P\u00e1yne line, while the patent calls for the adjoiners, Wilson and Large. The courses and distances in the patent will not meet, nor do they roach the Large line in any one place, showing plainly that the surveyor returned to the surveyor\u2019s office a different survey from that which he ran on the ground. While the survey that the surveyor returned is marked on the ground, it is not the survey that was made for James Payne, executor of James Gillam, by said surveyor; consequently, the line which is described in the patent and marked on the ground is not the line of the survey made on the ground for James Payne, executor of James Gillam, deceased. In the trial of the cause the testimony of Joshua Nickle was read in evidence, which evidence showed that Mrs. Howard purchased but about three acres from James Gillam, and that being the case the Howard claim is derived from tlio Gillam claim from the Commonwealth, and the defendants are estopped from denying the Gillam claim, which is now the claim of William A. Payne. The testimony of Joseph Payne and Nickle agreed as to the location of the line surveyed on the ground by Hastings, and they both stated that the line that Hastings surveyed and which they claimed was the line run by Hastings on the ground, and that said line ran along Wilson\u2019s line until it reached the line of Samuel and Isaac Large, aud thence along the line of Isaac and Samuel Large until it reached the Kennedy line, and from that point on the Large line along the Kennedy line until it reached the Payne line. The warrant called for all the land included within the boundaries of the Wilson line, the Large line and the Kennedy line, which would include and contain the land now in controversy. The court below, notwithstanding these facts, ordered a compulsory nonsuit to be entered, thereby depriving plaintiff the opportunity of going to the jury on the facts as to there being a mistake or a fraud perpetrated on the said James Payne, executor, by the return of the surveyor to the land office.\u201d\nThe paper books did not contain a plot.)\nOn the trial, before Stowe, P. J., at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the judge granted a compulsory non-suit, which the court subsequently refused to take off. The plaintiff took this writ, and filed the following specifications of error:\n1. The court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s objection to the offer by plaintiff of the deed of Samuel Wilson from - McGogeney, viz.: that plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered in evidence deed of Samuel Wilson from-McGogeney, for the purpose of showing the line run to on the Wilson line, and where the Wilson line now is.\nObjected to as incompetent and irrelevant.\nObjection sustained and bill sealed for plaintiff.\n2. The court erred in sustaining the objection of defendant\u2019s counsel to the offer of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to prove by David Donaldson the occupancy of the land in dispute, by the exercise of ownership since 1847, when the survey was made under the warrant upon which the survey was based, as including all the land between the Wilson and the Large line, notwithstanding the courses and distances in the patent do not reach or touch the Large line, but that the patent calls for the Wilson line and the Large line, as adjoiners, viz.:\nObjected to, that the offer is not in accordance with the abstract of title.\nObjection sustained and bill sealed.\n8. The court erred in sustaining the objection of defendant\u2019s counsel to that part of testimony of Joshua Nickle, marked in pencil, viz.: (Q. Do you know how much land Mrs. Howard claimed at that time. Objected to as irrelevant and incompetent. A. I think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of three acres.) By the court: I think that part objected to is incompetent, as we have nothing to do with the claim of the defendant as yet. Objection sustained and bill sealed for plaintiff.\n4. The court erred in allowing defendant\u2019s motion for non-suit, viz.: Defendant\u2019s counsel moves the court for judgment of peremptory nonsuit, for the reason that the plaintiff has failed to show that the ground in controversy is within the patent and deeds under which he claims title.\nMotion allowed, with leave to move the court in banc to take it off.\nJohn H. Large, for the plaintiff in error.\nThos. 0. Lazear, for defendant in error."
