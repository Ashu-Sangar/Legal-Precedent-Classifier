Ray, was, according to the values of the said property testified to by John K. Brown (one of the appraisers), really a double portion, the valuation on this property being five thousand dollars, while the others received property differing from two thousand five hundred dollars to eighteen hundred dollars. No explanation is offered of this great difference, although, of course, it is but natural to suppose some reason existed at the time the deed was given to David E. Ray, on the 7th day of June, 1875; and the theory of plaintiffs that in this partition, (which unfortunately was parol), the children had in view the ultimate equalization •of all the property, and so put into the hands of one of them the odd piece, to be sold at a future, and as they no doubt thought, a more favorable time, and a division then to be niade, seems to the Master a fair conclusion. But the defendants have objected, and there is much force in the position that these letters, even if taken to refer to the trust as set forth, are not sufficient to overturn David E. Ray’s absolute deed. That the plaintiffs have not proved a trust at all. As to sufficiency of this proof no authorities have been cited on either side, although it might be expected that this question had been ruled and decided in this state. Yet the able counsel have found nothing beyond the Act of Assembly, which plaintiffs’ counsel offer and depend upon. It is in these words: Act of 22d of April, 1856. “ All declarations or creations of trusts or confidences of any lands, tenements or heredita-ments, and all grants and assignments thereof, shall be manifested by writing, signed by the party holding the title thereof, or by his last will in writing, or else to be void.” Since the passage of this Act, of course, a trust in lands cannot be <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>established by parol, but as to the writing necessary, beyond the fact of its being signed by the party holding the title thereof (to the lands in question), we have nothing explicit, but, in the absence of any authorities, the Master is of opinion that the plaintiffs have come within the Act, and have established their case.</p>

This was alleged to have been double the value of his share, and the allegation was that he was to hold one of the houses in trust for the other heirs, and when sold the proceeds were to be divided among them so as to equalize the shares. And as a part of said trust, the rents of one of said houses until sold were to be paid to the widow of said Robert R. Ray on account of her dower generally in the estate. This brief statement of the trust is believed to be sufficient to an understanding of the case. It is proper to say, however, that no declaration of said trust was made in writing at the time the partition took place. David E. Ray having died seised of both houses, this bill was filed by the widow and heirs of Robert E. Ray against his administrator, and against the guardian of his minor child, for the purpose of having the trust declared, and to procure a decree against said guardian to sell the property in execution of the trust.

In selling the estate, according to law, I am entitled to over $500 for which I have not received anything and I can claim it and get it, or give you all the benefit of not claiming it. If you insist on this claim you can see Bird, and after deducting the amount which I have specified, $200, he will pay you the difference and you give him a receipt in full and end the matter.”</p>

It was said by Mr. Justice STRONG in Barnet <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 8 Casey, at page 372: “The plain meaning of the enactment is that a trust in land can now be proved- in no other way than by writing.” This language was of course used in reference to express trusts, and not to trusts which “ arise or result by implication or construction of law,” which are expressly excepted out of the Act by the proviso to the fourth section. See P. L. 1856, p. 583.</p>
    <p id="Ap7" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[290,973,1165,1400]]]'>Do the two letters, taken together, constitute such a writing as will take the case out of the prohibition of the statute? It must be conceded that they contain an admission of the existence of <em>a </em>trust. But what trust? Who are the <em>cestuis que tfustent? </em>And how, and in what proportions do they take? One of the letters speaks of selling the property and dividing the proceeds <em>pro rata. </em>But between whom? Just here is the pinch of the appellee’s case. For it is in vain that we look to the letters for an answer to these questions. To obtain it we must go outside the letters and supply tlie omissions by oral testimony. The appellees refer with confidence to the partition to show that the trust is in favor of the heirs of Robert R. Ray; that the allotment to Robert Ray was double in value the share of the other heirs. But all this appears by oral testimony, and the facts which the Master reports as agreed upon only meet a portion of the difficulty. There is nothing in the facts admitted to raise and define the trust. It is but necessary to read the report of the learned Master to see that he was compelled to rely to a considerable extent upon oral testimony to reach his conclusions. And we can safely say that no decree could be made by a Chancellor without such aid. It would be a decree composed of a species of judicial mosaic work, written evidence -alternating with oral testimony. It needs but a moment’s reflection to see that if we allow this we would seriously impair the Act of 1856. This we are unwilling to do. There never was a time when it was more the duty of the courts to sustain that Act in all its integrity than it is now. The law of evidence as it exists in this state affords great facilities for attempts to set up parol trusts, and the facilities furnish the temptation. The Act of 1856 is the only obstacle in the way, and if that Act should be undermined by judicial construction the result cannot fail to be disastrous.</p>
