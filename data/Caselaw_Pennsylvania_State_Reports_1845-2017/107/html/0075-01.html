Bigler, bankers, doing business in the name of the City Bank, and Samuel S. Bigler and Casper S. Bigler, lumber manufacturers, trading in the firm name of Bigler &amp; Son, made a deed of assignment, for the benefit of creditors, to Francis Jordan and George W. Porter. This deed included the property and estates of said two firms, and also of the several individuals composing them. Samuel S. Bigler was a member of the City Bank firm, and also of the saw mill firm of Bigler &amp; Son; and John A. Bigler was the chief acting officer of the bank. On July 24th, 1882, the assignees, having accepted the said trusts, filed an account of the assigned estate of Samuel S. Bigler and Casper S. Bigler, lumber manufacturers, and doing business in the name of Big-ler &amp; Son, showing a balance of $12,435.49 for distribution. Prior to this date Samuel S. Bigler had died. To the confirmation of this' account exceptions were filed August 31st, 1882, by Casper S. Bigler,-alleging that the proceeds of a-certain saw mill, with which the accountants had charged themselves, did not belong to said partners, as partners, but as tenants in common. Thereupon the court, September 5th, 1882, appointed Frederick M. Ott and Leroy J. Wolfe, Esqrs., Auditors to pass upon the exceptions, and report distribution. Said exceptions were sustained by the Auditors, who found the net aggregate fund for distribution to be $10,835.49. This sum they divided into three parts, one of which, amounting to $5,783.54, they divided among the creditors of Bigler &amp; Son,another part ($2,525.97), they distributed among the creditors of Samuel S. Bigler, and the remaining part ($2,525.97), to <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>the creditors of Casper S.

The fund was claimed on the other hand"' by Jordan and Porter, as assignees of the City Bank, upon five judgment notes under seal amounting in the aggregate to $184,000, signed by Bigler &amp; Son, and made payable - days after date to John A. Bigler or his assigns. These notes were dated January 1st, 1876, but it was found as a fact by the court that the notes were signed by Casper Bigler after the date of the assignment to Jordan and Porter (September 7th, 1876), and antedated as above: The words “ City Bank” were stamped across them in blue ink, and they were included by the assignees of the City Bank in the inventory of the bank’s property. It having appeared that Casper S. Bigler signed these notes in the name of Bigler &amp; Son without the authority or consent of his partner, the assignees of the bank only sought recovery upon them out of the $2,525.97, found by the Auditors to belong to the individual estate of Casper S.

Bigler; that <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>the Hooker judgment was no lien ; and they further reported two alternative tables of distribution — the one or the other to be adopted by the court as it should find the law to be on the testimony of Casper S.

The assignees also assert that the Auditors erred in admitting Casper Bigler to testify concerning the execution and consideration of these notes, and this preliminary question must be first decided. We do not think the objection is sound. The Act of 1869 certainly allowed <em>him </em>to give testimony under the circumstances of this proceeding, and the testimony he did give was competent and relevant. It was offered and received to prove who signed the judgment notes in question, when and under what circumstances they were signed, and for what, and for whose indebtedness they were given. This testimony was important, and did not, except as to their date, in any way contradict the notes. Indeed, if we disregard it, as the assignees ask us to do, and look at the notes- alone ' without evidence as to who signed them, or for what debt they were given, we would be obliged to say that they had not been proven to be Casper Bigler’s individual debt, and-could not share in this distribution.</p>

Their finding, like the special verdict of a jury, must stand in the absence of plain mistake, and such mistake we do not see: Bedell’s Appeal, <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>6 Nor. 510; Wedekind’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Phil.%2068" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="11 Phil. 68">11 Phil. 68</a>; Jones <em>v. </em>Jones, Id. 559.</p>

In this aspect of the case, it makes little matter what was the original consideration of the notes: if Casper Bigler became liable in the manner and to the extent contended for, the Auditors’ finding in regard to the original consideration is unimportant, for there is no doubt that he did sign these judgment notes in the firm name without authority from his partner. Did he thereby make the debt his individual and separate obligation, so as to put it in the same class and on the same level with the debt secured by Mr. Gilbert’s judgment? The general question presents some difficulty, but we do not feel obliged to answer it, believing that the time when these notes were signed is the controlling factor in the problem. Their date is January 1st, 1876, but they were really signed, in September, 1876, shortly <em>after </em>the assignments above referred to. The uncontradicted testimony of Casper Bigler establishes this fact. On page six of the Auditors’ notes he testifies: “These notes.signed by Bigler &amp; Son were signed in blank after the the date of assignment for benefit of creditors. I signed them after the date of the assignment of City Bank,” (which was by the same deed as the other assignments), “it may be one or two days after; they were blank notes with no writing on when I signed them. The signature to the blank notes is mine.” Now, it seems to us that, assuming the position of the assignees to be correct in cases arising before an assignment has been made, or perhaps before insolvency has come, it cannot be correct in a case arising <em>after </em>an assignment has been made, and the debtor’s property has passed out of his hands in trust for his creditors of every class, so Jar at least as the property assigned is concerned. It certainly is the law of Pennsylvania that the rights of creditors in this property are fixed as of the date of assignment, and that each creditor then becomes an owner of the property assigned in the proportion which his claim bears to the gross amount of claims against the estate. To such an extent does this doctrine go, that where a creditor obtains partial satisfaction by seizing after the assignment property which the debtor has subsequently acquired, the creditor’s ownership is not thereby made less, and he is still entitled to share in the proceeds of the assigned estate on the basis of his <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>original claim: Keim’s Appeal, 8 Gas. 42; Miller’s Appeal, 11 Cas. 481; Brough’s Estate, 21 P. F. S. 460 ; Smith’s Appeal, 24 P. F. S. 191; Dean’s Appeal, 2 Out. 101. In Dean’s Appeal, an insurance company bad been dissolved by order of court, and it was held that the rights of creditors were so fixed by the decree that a policy holder, who suffered loss by fire thereafter, could not base his claim upon the loss, but must be confined to the unearned premium due when the company was dissolved. That seems to us a striking illustration of the doctrine referred to, and is an application of it to cases where the assignment is not voluntary but compelled by the law. Iiow, therefore, can we say here that Casper Bigler could, after his assignment, make new individual creditors with claims on the individual property assigned, or could reach the same result by giving to existing partnership creditors rights over his individual property which, at the date of the assignment they certainly did not have ? This would be interference with the ownership of his property as determined by the deed of assignment, and we think that he at least cannot so interfere. So far as the property assigned is concerned, we must hold that Casper Bigler’s act, in signing the firm name after the assignment to these judgment notes, could not affect the rights of creditors as fixed by the deed of assignment, and that we cannot, in this distribution, treat the notes as his individual debt.</p>

The fund for distribution is the proceeds of real estate, the individual assets of Casper S. Bigler, sold by the assignees under the provisions of the Act of 17th February, 1876. Two claimants, only, appear before the Auditor. Lyman D. Gilbert claims the amount of judgment No. 87 November Term, 1876, John A. Hooker <em>v. </em>Casper S. Bigler, an individual indebtedness, tho lien of which expired September 7th, 1881. No scire facias had issued upon it, and, as the conversion of the land into money was not effected until 81st January, 1882, the date of the confirmation of the sale, the judgment was an individual debt without priority of lien: Carver’s Appeal, 8 Norris 276; Tomlinson’s Appeal, 9 Norris 224; Burkholder’s Appeal, 18 Norris 525. The full amount of this judgment, debt and interest is 89227.61. From <em>the </em>proceeds of other real estate of Casper S. Bigler, embraced in the assignment, §5779.64 had been previously awarded to this claim but it is conceded that in this distribution, it is entitled to participate upon its full amount, provided only that satisfaction of the proper balance be effected thereby: -Kim’s Appeal, 8 Casey 42. The City Bank by their assignees, Francis Jordan and Geo. W. Porter claim upon five several judgment notes, dated January 1,1876, under seal, payable to John A. Bigler, and signed Bigler &amp; Son; having the words “ City Bank, Harrisburg, Pa.,” stamped in blue ink, diagonally across the bottom of the notes, immediately before the signature, and amounting in the aggregate, to §184,000. The claim of the City Bank rests exclusively upon the notes, no evidence whatever was offered on the part of the bank to show the consideration upon which they were given; they are payable to John A. Bigler, but whether the consideration passed from him or from the bank does not appear; indeed whether they were given upon any valid consideration rests in the presumption arising from the seal.</p>

      <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>Casper S. Bigler was called as a witness, in the interest o£ Lyman D. Gilbert; his testimony is not printed, but from the opinion of the court below, we learn that he testified, among other things, that he signed the firm name to these notes, without the authority or consent of his partner. It is contended, however, in behalf of the City Bank, that if the signing' of the firm name of Bigler &amp; Son, by Casper S. Bigler was not binding upon his partner, it was binding upon <em>him, </em>and that the debt thereby became his individual debt entitled to participate in the distribution as such. The Auditors have found that the notes were not given for an original individual indebtedness of Casper S. Bigler. An interesting question might here arise whether or not the notes being given in this form for a partnership debt of Bigler &amp; Son, under circumstances that they do not bind his co-partner, they could be allowed, under the rules of equity'in a distribution of Casper S. Bigler's estate to the prejudice of his individual creditors, were it not for the fact that Casper S. Bigler further testified: “ These notes ..... signed by Bigler &amp; Son were signed in. blank, <em>after the date of the assignment </em>for benefit of creditors. I signed them after the date of the assignment of the City Bank, it may be one or two days after, they were blank notes with no writing on when I signed them, the signature to the blank notes is mine.”</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[236,1467,1175,562]]]'>That Casper S. Bigler is a competent witness we think cannot be doubted. He is not in any sense a party to the proceeding; he made no claim before the Auditor; the question was one of distribution among his individual creditors only; his partner had no interest in the fund, was no party to the notes, and could neither be bound nor benefitted by them. If the notes were not entitled to share in the fund, because they were executed after the assignment, his individual liability continued. The issue involved is not as to his liability — that is conceded — but it is as to the right of one of his creditors to participate, to the exclusion of another; his interest is <em>in equilibrio ; </em>if the fund is applied to one creditor, his responsibility to the other remains.</p>
    <p id="b104-5" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[236,2028,1176,433]],["BL_105.1",105,[164,423,1188,693]]]'>The assignment for creditors was dated 7th September, 1876, and their rights are fixed as of that date ; each creditor, by the conveyance, becomes the owner, in equity, of such proportionate part of the property assigned as the debt due him bears to the aggregate of debts; it is as part-owners that creditors have standing in court when the distribution comes to be made: Miller’s Appeal, 11 Casey 48; Brough’s Estate, 21 P. F. S. 460 ; Dean’s Appeal, 2 Out. 101. The notes were dated January 1st; 1876, but Casper S. Bigler testifies, and the court finds, that thev were not given at the time of <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>their date, that they were given some days after the assignment, and were ante-dated; whether this was done by mere mistake, or with a fraudulent design, it was competent by parol proof to establish the fact: Finney’s Appeal, 9 P. F. S. 898. After the assignment of their estate the assignors had no power over it, excepting as to the surplus, if any. Notes thus executed, therefore, afford no evidence of ownership in the property assigned, and, without proof of a previously existing consideration or claim, cannot participate in the distribution. This point, it is true, was overlooked by the Auditors, and is first raised in the opinion of the court below, but this is certainly no reason why we may disregard it. It was the duty of the court below to determine the cause according to the law and the evidence, and if the facts were not' fully found by the Auditors, it was the duty of the court either to recommit or to revise and correct the report.</p>
    <p id="b105-6" data-blocks='[["BL_105.4",105,[161,1118,1176,512]]]'>In this finding, too, we think the court was clearly right. The testimony of Casper S. Bigler, on this point, is clear and uneontradicted, and as to the character of the debt is fully sustained by the form and expression of the obligations themselves. No attempt was made to contradict his statement that the notes were given after the assignment, or to prove their consideration. It seems incredible that a transaction, involving so large a sum, was not susceptible of some form of proof or explanation. The question sought to be raised by the alternate report already referred to, so ably discussed by counsel, is not raised upon this record, and cannot here be determined.</p>
    <p id="b105-7" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[425,1640,910,217]]]'>The appeal is dismissed at the costs of the appellants, and the decree confirming the second alternative distribution of the Auditors is affirmed, and it is ordered that the money be paid out accordingly.</p>
