As insurance companies prescribe their own conditions, they ought to be clear and unambiguous. They ought to be put in such form and in such language that the insured may not be misled or entrapped. They ought to be so clear that there would be no controversy or mistake on the subject. It is because I think the policy in this respect is not so clear and unambiguous, that I allowed evidence to be given as to what was the <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>usual Custom among country stores. Tbe written part of the policy is for goods, &amp;c., “usually kept in a country store.” Where there is any conflict between tbe written and printed portions of a policy, tbe written portion should prevail. The fourth clause would seem to limit merchants who sell gunpowder to keep not exceeding 25 lbs. of gunpowder, and gunpowder, 1 apprehend, covers all kinds of powder used for explosive purposes, either rock or rifle powder — but the language is peculiar again. “ Are privileged to keep for sale 25 lbs. of gunpowder in close tin <em>can.” </em>Does that mean that there shall be only <em>one </em>can ? If so, there can be only one kind of powder kept. This seems to be an enlargement of the third condition. It also applies to merchants generally, in the city as well as elsewhere. There would be a very evident propriety in making some discrimination between merchants in the country and merchants in the city. The latter can replenish their stock much more frequently than the former. It strikes me that the language in this policy is not so clear and free from ambiguity and doubt as it ought to be, and in view of the written portion of the policy, I have admitted evidence as to what is the custom among country stores, [and I leave it for you to say whether it was customary in such stores to keep more than 25 lbs. of gunpowder, and whether that custom was known to the defendant company. If so, I then say to you that the plaintiff can recover, notwithstanding this clause in the policy.] You have the testimony of two witnesses, 1 believe, that it is the custom among country stores to keep rifle powder in one keg, 25 lbs. perhaps, and different kegs of rock powder, and to a much larger amount than is indicated in this policy, and the testimony would go to show that that was a custom invariable in country stores. [Now did the defendant companj^ know of that custom ? There is no direct evidence that they did, but if it is a universal custom among country stores, it would not be a violent presumption to suppose they did know it. Bearing on that question is the fact that when these proofs of loss were made out at first, the number of pounds of powder was clearly set forth, and there seems to have been no objection made by any of the officers of the company at that time. No question raised on this point then.] The only thing spoken about then, as I remember the testimony, was that Jasper being a half owner, Jonas was not entitled to the whole amount. It may be some evidence to your minds, the fact that Mr. Gordon or Mr. McKeown raised no objection on the score of there being more powder than the policy provided for, — that they did not consider that as a violation of the condition of the policy; that, at least, they did not consider <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>it material in tbe ease. I will say, however, that the insurance company are not limited in their defence here to the objections they made at that time. Counsel for plaintiffs have asked me to instruct you that there was a waiver as to anything else, and I have declined to instruct you in that way. If you find, that the plaintiff was not the sole and exclusive owner of the goods, your verdict should be for the defendant; if he was, then yon pass to the next question, and if it was the universal custom to keep a greater quantity of gunpowder in country stores, and the defendant knew that at the time the policy was executed, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the whole amount of the policy with interest on it from the time fixed in the policy for payment after the proofs were furnished.</p>

Frazee &amp; Bro.; the sign set up in front of their place of business was in the same form, and the first proofs of loss clearly stated a joint ownership of the goods. These apparently inconsistent facts were to some extent explained, however, and the ques<a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>tion as to the real ownership of the stock was plainly one for the jury; there was without doubt abundant evidence to justify the submission.</p>
    <p id="b548-4" data-blocks='[["BL_548.3",548,[207,552,1173,730]]]'>The court instructed the jury that “if the plaintiff furnished the original stock of goods, and kept if up with his own money, and his brother Jasper had no interest in it, but for his services in keeping the store, instead of a salary, was to receive one half of the net profits, and be responsible for one half of the bad debts, then the goods would be the sole property of Jonas Frazee.” In this, we think the court was clearly correct. No question as to any partnership relation or liability which by construction of law might be supposed to-exist, as to third persons or creditors, is here presented. The inquiry is as to the ownership of the stock as between the parties themselves, and, in such case, where there is a positive agreement that must govern. If the evidence of Jonas and Jasper Frazee is believed, there was such agree ment, and Jonas Frazee, as against Jasper at least, was cer tainly the sole, undisputed and exclusive owner of the goods. The first and sixth assignments are therefore not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b548-5" data-blocks='[["BL_548.4",548,[205,1284,1168,986]]]'>The remaining assignments, however, relating to the ruling of the court as to the plaintiff’s right under the policy to store gunpowder in the building containing the insured property, in excess of the amount specified in the policy, possess more merit. In Franklin Fire Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Updegraff, 7 Wr. 357, the insurance was upon “merchandise such as is usually kept in country stores; ” the stock, at the time of the fire, consisted in part of hardware, china and glassware. By the terms of the policy, merchandise of this character was classed as “ hazardous,” and subjected the insured to the payment of higher rates; by the 12th condition, the omission to specify such property voided the policy; it was held, however, in a suit to recover the loss, that the insurance was not void because hardware, china and glassware were not specifically mentioned, if the articles were such as were usually kept in a country store. The expression “merchandise, such as is usually kept in country stores,” was deemed a sufficient designation of the articles insured, and to include “ hardware, china and glassware,” if these articles were usually so kept. The company accepting such a general description of the stock insured was bound to know what was usually kept in a country store, and the finding of the jury was conclusive on that question.</p>

S. 485, the insurance was upon “ a tannery and patent leather manu-factory ; ” the policy provided that benzole, to the amount of five barrels, might be kept in a shed detached from the build<a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>ings, one hundred feet distant, and nowhere else on the premises; it was stored in the shed, as stipulated, but was carried in cans into the buildings insured as needed and used in the process of japanning leather. It appeared, however, that benzole was ordinarily used in the manufacture of patent leather, and that this was the purpose in providing for its storage; therefore, it was held, that the presumption was that it was intended by the contracting parties that benzole might be used in the factory as it was ordinarily used in similar factories; that the policy included whatever was necessary and essential in conducting the business, if not expressly excepted.</p>
    <p id="b549-4" data-blocks='[["BL_549.4",549,[140,940,1166,1506]],["BL_550.1",550,[252,424,1164,257]]]'>Under the doctrine declared in Franklin Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Updegraff, the insurers were bound to know, if the fact were so, that gunpowder was a commodity usually kept in a country store, whether specifically set out in the policy or not; the right to keep and sell that article, does not in this case, however, depend upon mere construction, it is not left to inference ; by special mention, within certain limits, the right is expressly conceded, and the case last referred to we think becomes unimportant. It is said, however, that as the insurance is upon such articles as are kept in a country store, the presumption is, that-the parties intended that gunpowder should be kept in the usual quantity, and the case of Citizens Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>McLaughlin is relied upon as supporting this view. There is, however, a plain distinction between that case and the case under consideration. There was no restriction in that case as to the amount of benzole to be used in the factory in the manufacture of Japanned leather, the presumption was, that it was intended to be used as it was ordinarily used, in similar factories ; but in this case the amount of gunpowder which might be kept on hand in the store for the purpose of sale, in the plaintiff’s business, is expressly limited, and the limitation is written as a condition of the policy. No fraud is shown, no undue advantage alleged, no ambiguity or uncertainty exists in the contract and we must, therefore, read the contract as it is plainly written. It is true that the restriction is contained in, the printed portion of the policy, which is prepared in such, general form as to meet all cases presented; that the written parts inserted must therefore be taken as being more immediately expressive of the intention of the parties, and if there be any repugnancy or conflict between them, the latter must have controlling effect; that the language of the policy is the language of the company, and in case of doubt and ambiguity must be taken most strongly against the company; but we can discover no such repugnancy or conflict: the contract is clear and therefore conclusive. Nor can we regard the restrie-<a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>tion as unreasonable; it applies only to the particular building containing the property insured, and it is a wise precaution when practicable, not only upon the part of the insurer but the insured, that thé storage of a highly dangerous and inflammable substance like gunpowder, should be in a place apart from, and reasonably removed from the general store.</p>
    <p id="b550-4" data-blocks='[["BL_550.4",550,[249,681,1166,213]]]'>The court erred, we think, in receiving evidence of the general custom of merchants in country stores as to the quantity of gunpowder usually kept on hand, and in submitting to the jury the question, whether the conduct of the insured was in compliance with that custom.</p>
    <p id="b550-5" data-blocks='[["BL_550.5",550,[509,894,902,76]]]'>The judgment is therefore reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
