A delay in giving the bond does not prejudice the security of the former owner for the surplus of the bid, and he has no right to complain if the bond is, not given until toward the close of the two years,. The plaintiffs’ rights under their deed are just the same as though their bond had been given to the Treasurer on the day of the sale, and the former owners, by accepting the bond, prosecuting it to judgment and execution, and collecting the amount thereof, are estopped from alleging any irregularity in the process under which the plaintiffs derived their tax title, and from asserting any different effects or consequences than ordinarily attach to a perfect tax title. A Treasurer’s deed is closely analogous to a sheriff’s deed. The duty to make the sale was first enjoined by the law upon the sheriff. It has been frequently decided that a sheriff’s sale, at the time of the sale, conveys an inceptive interest in the soil, an inchoate, inceptive, incomplete title to the land, which, upon -execution and acknowledgment of the deed, relates back <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>to tbe day of sale: Stover <em>v. </em>Rice, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Whart.%2021" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Whart. 21">8 Wharton 21</a>; Hoyt <em>v. </em>Koons, 7 Harris 277; Morrison <em>v. </em>Wurtz, <a href="/watts/7/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Watts 438" data-case-ids="1846885" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0438-01">7 Watts 438</a>; Slater’s Appeal, 4 Casey 170; Stephen’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0186-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 186" data-case-ids="483304" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0186-01">8 W. &amp; S. 186</a>; Robb <em>v. </em>Mann, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20300" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Jones 300">1 Jones </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20300" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Jones 300">300</a>; </em>Hardenburg <em>v. </em>Beecher, 8 Out. 20. The Treasurer in making the sale has the same powers as were formerly exercised by the sheriff. According to the plain language of the Acts of Assembly we have quoted, we may follow this analogy still further, and urge that a Treasurer’s deed, upon failure to redeem, becomes absolute, and relates back to the day of sale as well as the sheriffs deed. It follows, then, that a purchaser at a Treasurer’s sale has a right to all the estate and interest in the land which existed at tbe day of the sale, less any diminution from ordinary and reasonable use.</p>

In that case the cutting of tbe timber complained of by tbe purchaser at tax sale was done by the owners (Wilkinsons), after tbe Treasurer’s sale, and before tbe giving of tbe surplus bond. In this case the cutting was done between tbe same points of time by the defendant, Shoup, under a contract with the owners for the purchase of the pine timber. Tlie per curiam opinion of this court in that ease is as follows : “ The timber upon the land was cut by the owners before the purchaser at the tax sale had executed the surplus bond. Until that had been done be had no title whatever. They had the ownership and the right to the full enjoyment of the land and timber.” It is well settled that the purchaser of unseated lands at a Treasurer’s sale, when he receives his deed, takes but an inchoate title, which it requires the lapse of two years to complete : Shalemiller <em>v. </em>McCarty, <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Pa.%20188" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="55 Pa. 188">55 Pa. St. 188</a>. The owner’s title is not divested until the expiration of tbe two years, and tbe incidents of title remain in him. Up to that time be would not be a trespasser if be entered upon the land and cut timber: Coxo <em>v. </em>Woleott, 3 Casey 154; Gault’s Appeal, 9 Id. 98. It is not necessary to enter into the question of the analogies between Sheriffs’ and Treasurers’ deeds as to tbe nature of tbe incep-tive titles given by the sale. Whatever similarity there may have been before the Act of 1815 allowing a redemption, that Act and the decisions under it have made a radical difference between them.</p>

      <a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>The title acquired by a purchaser of lauds at sheriff’s sale, differs very much from one which a purchaser takes in unseated lands on a treasurer’s sale for the non-payment of taxes. In the former case, on the acknowledgment and delivery of the deed, the purchaser tabes a title as full and perfect as the defendant held the same, and it relates back to the day of purchase. In the latter, the title of the former owner is not fully divested until the expiration of two years after the sale. If the purchaser bids more than the amount of the taxes due on the land and costs, he must give to the treasurer a bond for such excess. The giving of this bond is indispensable to his acquisition of a valid title. The payment to the treasurer of the whole amount of the purchase money, is not an adequate equivalent: Connelly <em>v. </em>Nedro, <a href="/watts/6/0451-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Watts 451" data-case-ids="1846051" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0451-01">6 Watts 451</a>; McDonald <em>v. </em>Maus, 8 Id. 364. If he gives, the bond he has an inceptive title only. At the expiration of two years it may ripen into an absolute title. Until he does give it, he has no title whatever: Woodland Oil Company’s Appeal, 1 Pennypacker 480. His title is not vested until he pays the taxes and costs and gives this bond for the surplus: Donnel <em>v. </em>Bellas, 10 Barr 341. It is true, he may give it at any time within the two years during which the land is subject to redemption: Burd’s Executors <em>v. </em>Patterson, 10 Harris 219. If, however, the bond be given on the execution of the deed, or later, the purchaser cannot thereafter, before the expiration of the two years, enter on the land and cut timber, or do any other act affecting the freehold. He would become a trespasser thereby : Shalemiller <em>v. </em>McCarty, 5 P. F. Smith 186. During that time, the owner, in the absence of actual possession, has such a constructive possession as to maintain trespass for injury to the freehold: Id.</p>

L. 89, gives the purchaser of unseated lands at a tax sale a writ of estrepment against the owner or person acting under him, to stay waste prior to a redemption of the land. This Act, however, does not give the purchaser a right' to commit waste. It merely restrains the owner for the time being.</p>
