In a proceeding by the township of A. to have a pauper removed to the township of B., where he formerly had a legal settlement, the defence was that after leaving B. the pauper acquired a legal settlement in the township of C. The plaintiffs submitted, inter alia, a point which was substantially as follows: That the pauper did not, while residing in C. township', acquire a legal settlement therein. This the <a id="p302" href="#p302" data-label="302" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*302</a>court refused, on the ground that the pauper had acquired a legal settlement in C. township by living there for over a year, in a house for which he actually paid (in work for the owner) an annual rental of more than $10. The court having made an order in accordance with this opinion, the plaintiffs took a writ of error, assigning as a reason therefor that the court erred in refusing their point on the grounds set out, without any evidence to sustain them:</p>

Burnham was a farmer residing on his farm. The tenement house leased to Vamvormer appears to be on the same farm. The pauper had a contract with Burnham to dig limestone on the shares, which it appears only occupied a portion of his time ; the rent that he agreed to pay for the dwelling house to Burnham was at the rate <em>of </em>$40 per annum ; total rent for the fifteen months’ time occupied would amount to $50. Burnham says that he had an account against the pauper, and that that account, including the rent, amounted to $80.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[154,1209,1173,1255]],["BL_324.1",324,[247,419,1171,173]]]'>“ It appears by evidence of one W. S. Trainer that the pauper during this time was working for Burnham outside of the limestone quarry, viz.: from two to three weeks, opening a coal bank, say average time fifteen days, and at another coal bank one week, making twenty-one days ; that this work was worth <em>$1.50 </em>per day, this amounting to $81.50. Burnham gave the pauper credit for work done $31.28, but Burnham appears to be biased in favor of his township of Limestone. Trainer’s testimony appears to be disinterested, so far as we can see. Trainer swears that in addition to the work in the coal banks the pauper worked on the farm for Burnham as a farm hand, from time to time, but he is unable to give the number of days. Apply the payments for work at the coal banks pro rata to the account of $80, as Burnham appears to have mingled rent and other accounts together, and neither himself nor pauper has made direct application of the payment ; and five eighths of the account being rent, we have by this process an annual payment of rent of $10 aud upwards ; deduct account outside the rent, say $30, and allow the pauper a reasonable recompense for Ms labor on the farm for the time lie would likely be engaged assisting Burnham during the busy seasons of seed time and harvest, and we would still have the payments of rent to Burnham in excess of $10 per annum. This view of the case is further sustained by the evidence of the pauper, who says that on the fair settlement of accounts between Burnham and himself he would not owe Burnham anything. It therefore appears that E. H. Van-wormer lost his legal settlement in the Poor District of Knox, Jefferson county, by acquiring a new one in the Poor District <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>of Limestone, Clarion county, by taking a lease of a dwelling bouse of an annual rental value exceeding $10, in the said township of Limestone, residing thereon one year and upwards, and paying an annual rental therefor exceeding $10.”</p>

That the pauper leased from one Burnham is not denied, but he could not, under the circumstances, have paid any rent except by appropriating to rent the value of certain work. But he owed Burnham an outside account far exceeding the value of the work. The court erred in fixing the amount of Vanwormer’s debt to Burnham, exclusive of rent, at $30. The evidence showed it to be $77. Neither Vanwormer nor Burnham directed the application of the sum due for work. When no application of a fund is made by the parties, the court should apply it to the least secured debt, which in this case was the outside account: Pierce <em>v. </em>Sweet, 9 Casey 151; Garrett’s Appeal, 4 Out. 597. It follows that there was no payment of rent as required by the statute.</p>
