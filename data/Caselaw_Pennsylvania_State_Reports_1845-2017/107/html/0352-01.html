It is claimed, however, on behalf of defendant, that the Statute of Limitations is a bar to plaintiff’s recovery under the admitted facts, and in support of this the learned counsel for defendant cites Pittsburg and Connelsville R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Byers, 32 Pa. St. R. 22; McCully <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh and Connelsville R. R. Co. <a href="/pa/32/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="32 Pa. 25" data-case-ids="986695" data-case-paths="/pa/32/0025-01">32 Pa. St. 25</a> ; and Pittsburgh and Connelsville R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Graham, 36 Pa. St. R. 77. In the cases cited it was held that as between the railroad company and a stockholder, by analogy to the Statute of Limitations, where work on a railroad had not been prosecuted according to the requirements of the Act of Incorporation, and no calls had been made within six years from the date of the subscription for stock, a presumption of abandonment of the enterprise arose in favor of the subscriber, and that the lapse of six years was a bar to the remedy by call and to a suit to recover the instalments so called for. The language of Justice Woodwakd, in delivering the opinion of the court, was, “Under this charter the company were bound, from analogy to the Statute of Limitations, to call in payments on stock subscriptions within six years after their date; or if the delay was not satisfactorily accounted for, subscribers would be at liberty to consider the enterprise abandoned and their subscriptions cancelled ”: McCully <em>v. </em>The Pittsburgh and Connelsville R. R. Co., 32 Pa. St. R. 30. There is so marked a difference between a company seeking to enforce a subscription to its capital stock for the purpose of constructing a railroad after the enterprise has laid dormant for an unreasonable length of time, and a mutual insurance company seeking to collect the equitable proportion of losses <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>sustained during the continuance of a member’s policy, that principles applicable to one case can hardly govern the other. In the cases cited the principle applied, as I understand it, is this : That as the company abandoned the purpose for which the shares had been subscribed, the consideration of the subscriptions failed, and hence the subscriptions could not, under the terms of the implied contract, be enforced. The use made of the Statute of Limitations was in establishing a reasonable time for the company to undertake the enterprise in good faith, and after the lapse of which without such undertaking an abandonment would be presumed. If the principle of those cases is correctly apprehended, notwithstanding the analogy drawn from the Statute of Limitations, the-defendants were released, not by the bar of the Statute, but under the terms of their contract.</p>

Thereafter two assessments were made by the directors, which defendant paid. Again on April 13th, 1880, the directors levied another assessment, which defendant paid on September 29th, 1882, to the Receiver of plaintiff company. These payments are a feature in this case wholly absent in the cases cited by the learned counsel for defendant, and are inconsistent with the adversary attitude or claim of hostility implied in the plea of the-Statute of Limitations. In view of the payments I think it unnecessary further to. consider the defence raised by the plea in this case.</p>

We must, therefore, assume that all losses occurring during the life of the plaintiff’s policy were adjusted within ninety days after the expiration of said policy, <em>i. e., </em>before April 16th, 1875, at or before which all losses should have been paid. We therefore submit that the insurance company was, on April 16th, 1875, prepared, and had the right to assess the defendant for his proportion of all losses occurring during his membership; that it was the duty of the company to make such assessments at once, and that it was bound to make all its demands against him within six years from that date, or be thereafter forever barred. In Laforge <em>v. </em>Jayne, 9 <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>Parr 412, it was said, following tbe case of Codman <em>v. </em>Rogers, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pick.%20112" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Pick. 112">10 Pick. 112</a>, that, “in tbe judgment of this court, <em>on grounds of public </em>policy, to accomplish the true intent of the statute, as well as on the authority cited, if a demand was necessary before the running of the statute commenced, that demand ought to have been made within six years of the date of the lending.” This rule is fully sustained by the reasoning of Woodwaed, J., in Pittsburgh &amp; Connellsville R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Byers, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Cow.%2022" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Cow. 22">8 C. 22</a>, a case of subscriptions to the stock of a railroad company. Other and greater reasons may be urged against enforcing payment of an assessment of a mutual insurance company than against a subscription to the stock of a railroad company, especially when there is no deposit or premium note given to limit the extreme liability of the assured. A subscription to stock is definite in amount, and is just what the subscriber expects to pay when called upon, and cannot be enlarged beyond that amount to his injury. The liability of a member of a mutual insurance company depends, however, upon many circumstances and contingencies. The defendant ceased to be a member of the company on January 16th, 1875, and after that had no protection from, knowledge of, or control over the company. It was the duty of the company to make prompt and ample assessments to cover all losses, and on their refusal or neglect of this duty, it was in the power, of its creditors to compel payment of their claims: Bunn’s Appeal, 9 Out., 49; Scovill <em>v. </em>Thayer, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20U.S.%20155" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="15 U.S. 155">15 Otto 155</a>. The small assessments of 1875 and 1876 appear to have been made promptly enough, allowing for time for collections, but after this there was an interval of over three years — a delay unaccounted for and unreasonable — and no creditor intervened till nearly six years had elapsed after the defendant ceased to be a member of the company. Who is to suffer for this negligence and delay, the defendant who had no knowledge or power in the premises, or the creditors, who could have compelled satisfaction of their claims, but did not ? Under these circumstances, why should not the defendant be entitled to the benefit of his plea of the Statute of Limitations? That plea is no longer considered an unconscionable one: Herman <em>v. </em>Rinker, 10 Out. 121.</p>

When a note is given to a mutual insurance company to stand in the place of capital, and the time for requiring payment is left to the uncontrollable will of the company, it is payable on demand, and the statute bars a suit commenced more than six years after the date of the note: Howland <em>v. </em>Edmonds, <a href="/ny/24/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="24 N.Y. 307" data-case-ids="2029549" data-case-paths="/ny/24/0307-01">24 N. Y. 307</a>. In that case the difference was defined between the note in suit and a note given to a mutual insurance company for a policy, as an engagement to pay the proportion of the losses, not exceeding the nominal amount of the note; no action being maintainable on the latter until after an assessment to ascertain the proportion. It was vain to note the difference, or to inquire when an action would accrue, unless the statute would not begin to run until there would be a right to begin suit.</p>

The corporation was adjudicated a bankrupt, and to satisfy the claims of its creditors it became necessary to assess the unpaid stock. It was held that the agreement, though binding the parties, was void as to creditors of the corporation; that before the assignees in bankruptcy could maintain an action against the stockholder, there must be some proceeding in the proper court in the interest of the creditors; and until order by such court and assessment, or an authorized demand upon the stockholder, no cause of action accrues against him by the assignees, and the limitation provided in the Bankrupt Act does not begin to run: Scovill <em>v. </em>Thayer, <a href="/us/105/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="105 U.S. 143" data-case-ids="3496526" data-case-paths="/us/105/0143-01">105 U.

A sufficient answer to the plea of the statute of limitations is, that the note was not payable at once, or on demand, but is payable by instalments, upon the happening of a loss and assessment therefor; and so, until an assessment is made, the statute does not .begin to run: In the matter of Slater Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 10 Rhode Isl. 42; Bigelow et al. <em>v. </em>Libby, <a href="/mass/117/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="117 Mass. 359" data-case-ids="2136572" data-case-paths="/mass/117/0359-01">117 Mass. 359</a>. The same principle was ruled, though the action was not on a premium note, in Hope Mutual Life Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Weed, <a href="/conn/28/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="28 Conn. 51" data-case-ids="527844" data-case-paths="/conn/28/0042-01">28 Conn. 51</a>. In New York it was decided by the Supreme Court, that the liability of the maker of a premium note given to a mutual insurance company, payable “in such portions and at such times as the directors may agreeably to their charter and by-laws require,” is not absolute but conditional; and the cause of action is not perfect until an assessment, and notice thereof given to the maker, and an action thereon will not be barred by the statute of limitations until six years from that time: Howland, Receiver, <em>v. </em>Cuykendall, <a href="/barb/40/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="40 Barb. 320" data-case-ids="5103958" data-case-paths="/barb/40/0320-01">40 Barb. 320</a>.

Codman <em>v. </em>Rogers was no authority against the adjudication in Bigelow et al. <em>v. </em>Libby, for the principle involved in the former case did not touch the latter. Lapse of time with other circumstances may sometimes be sufficient to warrant an inference of payment, or the abandonment of a contract, or to induce a chancellor to dismiss a bill because the plaintiff’s claim is stale and inequitable; but such cases do not overthrow the established rule, that the statute of limitations is no bar to an action brought within six years of tlie date when the claim became suable. To hold that tlie statute is a bar to the plaintiff’s claim on the ground that demand should have been made within six years, would be equivalent to converting this conditional contract dependent on the happening of losses, into an absolute contract to pay a certain sum on demand.</p>
