I received instructions from him while at my house how to write the will. Before I went to him the next day I had written, I think, the whole of the first page of the will as it is now written, and a part of the second page of writing. I went to his house about three'o’clock, or a little after, the next' day, which was the 14th of the month. "When I went to his house, about the first change was the erasures in the second paragraph; perhaps the next thing done was the interlineation appearing in connection with the third paragraph. The next thing done was the erasure in the fourth paragraph, and the interlineation, ‘see next page.’ I then added the seventh paragraph and the eighth paragraph, and the attéstation clause. I correct myself. I mean to say, after I wrote the clause, 1 see next page ’ in the fourth paragraph, I turned over and wrote what appears on the fourth page of the will. ' After writing that, I wrote the seventh and eighth paragraphs, and the attestation clause. I am sure'the above, as corrected,-is the order in which I wrote the will; that is correct. This will, the whole of it, except the signatures of the testator and two witnesses, is in mj'- handwriting.

The Court of Appeals held, that under the statute of New York, which is substantially the same as ours, the will was sufficiently executed. But the decision was put expressly upon the ground that the references to the map virtually incorporated so much of it into the will as was necessary to explain or illustrate the devises; and the effect would have been the same if the references had been to the official map in the City Register’s office, of which that attached to the will was a reduced copy. But the court guard their decision from any misconstruction by saying that ‘the object of the statute was to insure a signature of authentication, distinct from, and at the close of, the descriptive and disposing parts of the will.’ That kind of authentication is precisely what is lacking in this case.</p>

L. 249, provides that “ every will shall be in writing, and, unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him, at the end thereof,” etc. The construction, which had been previously given to the Act of 1705, made this provision necessary; the plain purpose of the legislature, in requiring the signature of the testator to be written at the end of the will, was to assimilate wills, in the mode of their execution, to other instruments for the transmission of title, to furnish a more certain and satisfactory means of authentication, and thus to distinguish what might be mere incomplete memoranda, from that which certainly declared the full and final purposes of the testator respecting his property. That this was, at least, the primary and principal object of the statute of 1833, is abundantly shown, not only in the report of the commissioners, (Parke and J. 874), but in numerous decisions of this court since its passage: Strickler <em>v. </em>Groves, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20385" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Whart. 385">5 Wharton </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20385" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Whart. 385">385</a>; </em>Hays <em>v. </em>Harden, 6 Barr. 409.

By the statutes of 7 Will. IV., and 1 Viet. c. 26, however, all previous provisions, as to execution and attestation of wills were repealed, and it was thereby enacted that no will should be valid, unless in writing and executed as therein provided, and one of the requisites was that it should be signed, at the foot or end thereof by the testator, or by some other person in liis presence and by his direction. In Willis <em>v. </em>Lowe, 5 Notes of Cases <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>428, and in Smee <em>v. </em>Bryer, 6 Moore’s P. C. C. 404, however, it was held that the signature must be so affixed at the end of the will, as to leave no blank space for any interpolation between the end of the will and the signature. This was found to produce such extensive injustice, that bv the statute, 15 and 16 Vict. c. 24, the legislature interfered to alter the law so established, but in this amendatory statute it is expressly provided, that no signature shall be operative, to give effect to any disposition or direction which is underneath or which follows it, nor to any disposition or direction, inserted after the signature shall be made. Upon these provisions of the statute law of England, the case of Allen <em>v. </em>Maddock, 11 Moore’s Privy C. C. 426, was decided; in that case, after an extended reference to all the English authorities, and a full discussion of the subject, it was held that an unattested paper, which would have been incorporated in an attested will or codicil, executed according to the Statute of Frauds, is now in the same manner incorporated, if the will or codicil is executed according to the requirements of the Wills Act, 1 Vict, c. 26. That where there is a reference in a duly executed testamentary instrument to another testamentary instrument, imperfectly executed, but by such terms as to make it capable of identification, it is necessarily a subject for the admission of parol evidence as to its identity, and such parol evidence is not excluded by the 1 Vict. c. 26. The judgment in Allen <em>v. </em>Maddock, was delivered by Lord Kingsdown, who says “ It was not contended in this case, nor so far as we are aware, has it been contended in any case, since the Wills Act of 1837 (1 Vict.), that no reference, however distinct, is now sufficient to incorporate another testamentary paper in the paper duly executed as a will or codicil; but the question has always been, what reference in the valid paper is sufficient to let in evidence to identify the invalid ? ” The doctrine declared in Allen <em>v. </em>Maddock has not, we believe, in any respect, been modified, changed or doubted. It is followed in many subsequent cases, and is frequently referred to as containing a clear and elaborate exposition of the law on the subject: In re Almosnino, 29 L. J.

In Tonnele <em>v. </em>Hall, 4 Comstock 140, a will was written on several annexed sheets of paper, and was duly executed; a copy of a map was upon the last of the sheets, composing the instruments; it was referred to in the will, as being annexed, and for the description and designation of the several lots devised, <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>but it was not signed by tbe testator, nor attested by tbe witnesses. The Court of Appeals held that where a will, otherwise properly executed, refers to another paper already written, and so describes it as to leave no doubt of its identity, such paper makes part of the will, although it be not subscribed or even attached. It was contended in the argument of counsel in that case, that such a sheet annexed must be considered as the beginning or the end of the instrument, merely in reference to its local annexation without regard to the contents of the writing to which it is annexed, but Jewett, J., delivering the opinion of the court, says: “ I cannot agree that such a circumstance can have the effect to constitute the paper referred to, the beginning or end of any instrument, in the body of which reference is made to it or its contents, whether annexed in fact or not. If the map on file in the Register’s office, or a reduced copy of it annexed, may be treated as a part of the instrument, and I think it may (Habergham <em>v. </em>Vincent, 2 Vesey, Jr. 228; Bond <em>v. </em>Seawell, 3 Burr. 1775; Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Adam, 1 Vesey &amp; Beames 445,) its contents must be incorporated, and distributed in it to tbe extent of the several references made to it at tbe places where made; and thus the contents of the paper, to which the instrument refers, will be deemed constructively inserted before tbe point is reached where the subscription by the decedent and signing by witnesses are made.” We may also refer to similar rulings upon the same point in Loring <em>v. </em>Sumner, <a href="/mass/40/0098-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="23 Pick. 98" data-case-ids="2044371" data-case-paths="/mass/40/0098-01">23 Pick. 98</a>; Wilbar <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/mass/87/0194-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Allen 194" data-case-ids="2102354" data-case-paths="/mass/87/0194-01">5 Allen 194</a>; Johnson <em>v. </em>Clarkson, 3 Rich.

And this is true of others, soon to be referred to, many of which were decided during the existence of statutes requiring such formalities, so that we cannot escape from tbe force of these cases by supposing they had reference, exclusively, to wills of personal estate, when no particular formalities were required under the earlier English statutes.”</p>

In Ginder <em>v. </em>Farnum, 10 Barr 98, it was held, that where a will is written on <a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>several sheets of paper fastened together with a string, proof by two witnesses of the signature of the testator, at the end thereof, is sufficient; that it is the signature, not the <em>factum </em>or body of the will which is to be established by two witnesses, and whether there has been any subsequent or fraudulent interpolation is for the jury, to be determined as other cases. In Wilcoff’s Appeal, 3 Harris 281, following the Earl of Essex’s case, 1 Show. 69, it was held, that a will may be made on distinct pieces of paper; that it is sufficient if they are connected by their internal sense, and that even if there be some confusion in the order of their arrangement, when fastened together, they are to be read according to their coherence or adaptation of parts. In Fosselman <em>v. </em>Elder, 2 Out. 159, it was held, that where the name and designation of the beneficial party was written not in the body of the codicil,'but upon the face of an envelope in which it was found, that the inscription on the envelope should be read as a preface to, and in connection with, the paper enclosed therein, and that they together constituted a valid testamentary disposition. Thus the general principle has been clearly established that a will is to be read in such order of pages or paragraphs as the testator manifestly intended, and the coherence and adaptation of the parts clearly require. In writing a will upon the pages of foolscap paper, a testator may or may not conform to the order of the consecutive pages of the folio: there is no law which binds him in this respect; he may begin upon the fourth page of the folio and conclude upon the first, or he may commence upon the first, continue upon the third, and conclude upoiAthe second; in whatever order of pages it may be written, however, it is to be read, as in Wikoff’s Appeal, according to their internal sense, their coherence or adaptation of parts. The order of connection, however, must manifestly appear upon the face of the will; it cannot be established by extrinsic proof. Whilst, therefore, the end of the writing in point of space may in most cases be taken as the end o± the disposition, it does not follow that in all cases the signature must, of necessity, be there written, if it be written at the end of the will, according to such connection and arrangement of the pages or sheets, as the obviously inherent sense of the instrument requires.</p>

The testator’s intention cannot otherwise <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>appear; it cannot appear by extrinsic proof; but the identification of that which is sought to be inserted in the nature of the ease, may be the subject of extraneous proof.</p>

The testator, at the end of this unfinished part of the will, puts a mark, and at the back of the will he puts a corresponding mark before certain words which finish the sentence. It is obvious, therefore, that if all this was done before the will was executed, the testator intended that which was physically on the opposite side of the page to be read in, as if it preceded his signature. It is therefore intended to be part of the will.

It is apparent that, in the body of the will, there was not room for completion, and therefore reference is made to the next page.
