In answer to a point submitted by them, the court instructed the jury at length, in regard to the burden on a wife to establish her claim to property in a contest with her husband’s creditors: and also told them that a husband has a right to make a gift to his wife, if he has no creditors or has enough left to pay them.</p>

In this case it means these notes in suit. We will call your attention to a decision of the Supreme Court on that subject, in a late case, delivered by Justice GobdoN, which expresses it rather more pertinently than we are able to. He says: ‘Before the Act of 1848, the marriage contract vested the right to the personal property of the wife in the husband. She had no such thing as a separate and independent personal estate. Since that Act she may not only continue to own and hold the property she had at the time of the marriage, but she may, during coverture, acquire a separate estate. In favor of such an estate, however, there is no legal presumption, but the contrary; the husband is presumed to be the owner of the property of which he and the wife have the joint possession. Does she purchase lands or goods, their price is presumed to come from the pockets of the husband; or does he transfer to her property, real or personal, it is presumed to be a gift from him to her. Thus the Act of 1848, whilst it makes it possible for a feme covert to have and enjoy a separate estate, raises no presumption in favor of the existence of such an estate. She must affirmatively establish that fact, and this] not only because of the ease with which the husband’s creditors might otherwise be defrauded, but because, ordinarily, it is impossible for her to have a possession separate and distinct from her husband; hence one of the most obvious and prominent marks of proprietorship is, in her case, not only wanting, but such possession being usually attributed to the husband, a presumption of his ownership naturally follows, by which his credit is increased. Even in a case where a widow claims property as against her husband’s estate, it has been held that she must show by evidence which does not admit of a reasonable doubt, either that she owned it at the time of her marriage, or else acquired it afterwards by gift, bequest, or purchase. In case of a purchase after marriage, the burthen is upon her to prove distinctly that she paid for it with funds which were not furnished by the husband. To bring the property of a married woman under'the protection of the Act of 1848 — that is the married woman’s Act — it is made necessary by the letter, as well as the spirit of the statute, to prove that she owns it. She must identify it as property which was hers before marriage, or prove how she came by it afterwards. Evidence that she purchased it, amounts to nothing unless it be accompanied <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>by clear and full proof that she paid for it by ber own separate funds. In the absence of such proof, the presumption is a violent one that her husband furnished the means of pay ment.’</p>

He must not denude himself of property or the right whereof the creditor has the right to make his money, for the purpose of creating a maintenance or support for the wife in the shape of a gift. If so, it would be fraudulent as to those creditors. But if there is no creditor to suffer, and the man has ample remaining to pay his debts, so that there is no one to be injured, then it is simply a matter between husband and wife, and if the husband gives it, he would not have the right to reclaim it. There is the law. It belongs to the wife.</p>

Certainly it would be an important fact to keep in view in making proper inferences from their acts and conversation.</p>
    <p id="b310-5" data-blocks='[["BL_310.5",310,[257,1169,1180,476]]]'>It is immaterial what consideration induced the transfer. Whether Mrs. Lee paid the full amount in money inherited by her, or received' the notes as a gift, she took them subject to legal and equitable defences, same in one case as the other. It made no difference to Edmonds whether Lee sold or gave her the notes. After he knew they had become her property he could not make new arrangements with Lee to her <em>prejudice; </em>nor. could he satisfy them by a settlement with Lee, unless the settlement was founded on matters that would be a defence in an action on the notes — a defence existing before and at the time he obtained knowledge of her title.</p>
    <p id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[251,1645,1180,780]],["BL_311.1",311,[170,422,1158,85]]]'>In answer to the defendants’ second point the learned judge of the common pleas instructed the jury fully and correctly respecting the burden upon a wife to establish her claim to money or property in a contest with her husband’s creditors. He also told them that a husband has the right to make a gift to his wife, if he has no creditors, or has ample left to pay his debts so no one will be injured. All that was inapplicable to this case, but it was not harmless. The jury must have understood that it had something to do with the case before them. They might well have inferred that if Lee had creditors, other than Edmonds, that the transfer was a fraud as to those creditors and therefore void as to Edmonds. There was no testimony warranting them to consider the gift as affecting Lee’s creditors. This issue is not with a creditor. The suit is against a debtor who alleges payment of the debt. If it be true that there was an understanding between Lee and Edmonds that the notes should be satisfied and paid by the mortgage debt, his right to enforce it rests on other principles than <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>those established for protection of a man’s creditors against fraudulent claims by members of his family.</p>
    <p id="b311-4" data-blocks='[["BL_311.4",311,[160,508,1176,602]]]'>The instructions in response to the defendants’ second point directly led to affirmauce of their third, namely, there being no proof that the wife purchased the notes in suit, and paid for them out of her separate estate, tlie verdict should be for defendants, if Edmonds settled and paid the notes either by applying them to the payment of a mortgage he held against Lee, or by any other settlement between the parties. There was no pretence of a purchase, the plaintiff claimed a gift. It was as lawful for Lee to pass the title to tlie notes by gift to bis wife, as for him, upon good consideration, to transfer them to a stranger. After knowledge of sucli gift by Edmonds, as already remarked, he could not avail a defence wittingly made up by himself and Lee in violation of her rights.</p>
    <p id="b311-5" data-blocks='[["BL_311.5",311,[160,1111,1176,908]]]'>The plaintiff’s sixth point, — “ If Jefferson T. Lee indorsed and delivered, as a gift, the notes in question to his wife, as her separate property, and Jacob Edmonds knew it, any declarations or acts of J. T. Lee after such delivery and knowledge of Edmonds, In the absence of Mrs. Melissa Lee, should be disregarded by the jury in making up their verdict,” was answered as follows: “If the husband indorsed these notes over to his wife as a gift with Jacob Edmonds’ knowledge and consent, the result stated in the point would follow, but the jury must find this from all the facts in the ease; and as further explained by defendants’ points and answers thereto, we answer tliis point in the affirmative.” Perhaps the jury could detect something in that point that really was affirmed. Edmonds’ consent to the gift was unnecessary, unless for the purpose of barring his then existing defences and the proposition involved no such bar; and the explanation contained in the defendants’ second and third points and the answers thereto, was that unless Mrs. Lee paid for the notes out of her separate estate, any settlement of them by Lee and Edmonds would entitle the defendants to a verdict. The fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth assignments of error must be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[160,2020,1173,430]]]'>It was permitted the defendants to give in evidence the exemplification of tlie proceedings in bankruptcy in tlie matter of Jefferson T. Lee. Testimony was admitted on part of the plaintiff tending to show that all along Lee had continued in the possession and enjoyment of his property notwithstanding that proceeding. After the beginning of this suit the assignee reeonveyed all tlie property to Lee, and we think that deed was admissible in evidence. It is slight evidence, yet as the end of the proceeding introduced by the plaintiff, it should not have been rejected.</p>
    <p id="b312-3" data-blocks='[["BL_312.3",312,[243,433,1189,479]]]'>
      <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>There are numerous assignments of error to the admission of testimony of the declarations and admissions of Lee, made in the' absence of Mrs. Lee and, as alleged, after she had acquired title to the notes. It was a matter in dispute whether there was a gift, and if so when it-was made and when it came to the knowledge of Edmonds. Hence, the acts and declarations of Lee were admissible, as if there were no use party, and their weight and consideration depended much upon whether the jury found the fact of the alleged gift, and if so, when it was made and when it came to Edmonds’ knowledge.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[241,910,1185,306]]]'>The explanatory remarks respecting the plaintiff’s first point are free of error. A delay of seven or eight years before bringing suit generally is slight evidence of payment, in some circumstances it would be stronger than in others, and always where it is submitted to the jury to infer payment from facts and circumstances, the weight to be given to delay or promptness in bringing the suit, is for them to determine.</p>
    <p id="b312-5" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[235,1214,1188,608]]]'>Nor can the eleventh assignment be sustained. The plaintiff contended there was no evidence of a settlement, and therefore it was error to permit the jury to infer payment from a settlement. Wilson testifies that late in the fall of 1880, he met Lee and Edmonds, and in the conversation, Edmonds remarked, “that he had fixed that mortgage against Lee that day, and that he didn’t owe Lee anything now, and that Lee didn’t owe him anything, and that Lee said: ‘ That’s soor something to that effect.” Divens says that in the spring of 1878 he settled his own accounts with Lee and then Lee told him that the day before he had settled with Edmonds. There was other evidence tending to show a settlement which need not now be noted. The whole was sufficient to submit to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[236,1822,1177,77]]]'>We deem it unnecessary to remark any other assignments, which are not well taken.</p>
