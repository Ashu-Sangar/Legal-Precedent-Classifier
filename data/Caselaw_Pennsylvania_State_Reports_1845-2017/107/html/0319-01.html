Tbe facts and tbe questions involved therein are substantially tlie same. The eases were, in tbe court below, three separate writs of scire facias to revive judgments brought respectively by Harvey et al., to use, James M.

L. 96 and 326), with the powers and subject to the provisions of the General Railroad Act of 1849. The said railroad company was empowered by these Acts to mortgage its property to tbe amount of $1,000,000, and in February, 1873, it executed a mortgage upon its property and franchises to the amount of $800,000 to Alexander Bradley, as trustee for tlie holders of the company’s bonds, which mortgage was duly filed of record, and was tbe first lien against the property of the company. While constructing its track in 1872-3, it entered upon and appropriated <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>the lands of the respective plaintiffs without paying them therefor or giving any security for such compensation either before or subsequent to the said appropriation. Craig and Harvey et al., and, in the McKibben case, the railroad company thereupon petitioned the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence county for the appointment of viewers to assess damages. Viewers were separately appointed in each case, and awards were subsequently entered by them in favor of the landowners. The railroad company having appealed from these awards, each cause was separately put at issue in the form of an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, and a verdict having been rendered in each case in favor of the landowners, the respective plaintiffs therein, the court, in December, 1875, entered judgments thereon in their favor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b340-6" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[272,1024,1171,685]]]'>In 1879-80, the New Castle and Franklin Railroad Company became insolvent and a Receiver was appointed therefor; in 1881, Alexander Bradley, as trustee for the company’s bondholders, brought a bill in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Lawrence county to foreclose the said first mortgage. By agreement of the said mortgagee and certain other judgment creditors of the company, a decree was entered; whereby the Receiver was ordered to sell the property and franchises of the road for the benefit of its creditors. The Receiver, in accordance with this order, sold the property and franchises of the road to Thomas P. Simpson, who in turn sold his purchase to the New Castle and Oil City Railroad Company. This company was subsequently merged into the' Oil City and Chicago Railroad Company, which was merged in turn into the Buffalo, Philadelphia and New York Railroad Company, the present defendant.</p>

In 1883, the present writs of scire facias to revive were brought by the respective plaintiffs in the judgments against the New Castle and Franklin Railroad Company, with notice to the Oil City'- and Chicago Railroad Company and the Buffalo, Philadelphia and New York Railroad Company, and judgment was claimed against the company last named for the amount of plaintiff’s judgment against the New Castle and Franklin Railroad Company. The Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railroad Company filed an affidavit of defence, which alleged that the New Castle and Franklin Railroad Company entered into possession of the property for which the judgment for damages was given with the knowledge and consent of the plaintiffs, and that by the judicial sale on the <em>mortgage </em>and judgments under which <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>it held title, all claims whatsoever, including the judgments in question, were divested of lien or incumbrance against the property in its hands. A rule was granted to show cause why judgment should not be entered against the Buffalo, New York and Philadelphia Railroad Company in default of a sufficient affidavit of defence, and after argument the rule was made absolute, and judgments entered accordingly, the court holding that the pending cases were ruled in the plaintiff's favor by the case of West.
