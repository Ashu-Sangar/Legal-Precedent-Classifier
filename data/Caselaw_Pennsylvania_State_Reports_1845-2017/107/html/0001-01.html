In the room in which he worked, the machinery was driven by a small engine without a boiler, stationed about twenty feet from the machine of which the plaintiff had charge.' This engine was run by steam carried through an iron pipe from the boilers of a large engine in the main shop, about eighty-five feet distant. It was connected with plaintiff’s planing machine by belting running on an iron pulley wheel. The defendant’s foreman, in order to increase the velocity of the planing machine, attached, by bolts and screws, to this iron pulley wheel a wooden rim or lining of about an inch in thickness. The testimony was conflicting as to the safety of this addition. The engine was examined twice a day, started in the morning and afternoon, and stopped at noon and in the evening, by the engineer who had charge of the large engine in another building, the men in the small shop starting and stopping it at other times. On the day of the accident the governor-belt on the small engine ran off, increasing the speed of the machinery, whereupon Cole, whose attention was directed to the fact, crawled under a board, went to the place for stopping the planer for the purpose of saving the machine, shifted or threw the belt from the driving-wheel to a loose pulley, thus further increasing the speed of the machinery, after which the pulley running the planing-machine broke and a piece struck plaintiff and broke his leg.</p>

      <em>Answer. </em>— We cannot affirm this point. If the plaintiff was placed in a position of peril by the accident which happened to the governor-belt of the engine, and the consequent “running away” of said engine, as it is called, and the jury believe this occurred because of a want of reasonable care on the part <a id="p5" href="#p5" data-label="5" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*5</a>of the defendant, he, the plaintiff, could not be held to the exercise of the soundest judgment under such circumstances of peril, and his right to recover could not be defeated by the fact set forth in the point, if otherwise entitled.

This, however, did not absolve the plaintiff from the duty of informing himself of any patent defect in either the construction of the machinery or in the manner of propelling or using it, and before you can find for the plaintiff you must be satisfied not only that the defendant was guilty of negligence, which, in this case, would be a want of due and reasonable care, in providing defective machinery and propelling it in a dangerous way, but you must be further satisfied that the defect was not sufficiently obvious to be noticed by plaintiff, and was not, in fact, observed by him. If it was, and he failed to speak of it, and chose to continue in the service, he would be guilty of concurring negligence himself, and could not recover.[The defendant further takes the position that even assuming the pulley-wheel to be dangerous, and the methods employed to run the engine also hazardous, that the defect in the one was patent, and that the plaintiff was bound to observe it, and did observe it, and that he also knew the fact that no one was detailed whose special duty it was to watch the engine, and that he ought to have known the danger; and, knowing, and yet continuing in the service, he is guilty of concurring negligence and cannot recover. And this is a correct statement of the law, if he knew, or as a prudent man ought to have known, not only the facts, but the risk resulting from those facts. It is for you to determine the questions at issue in this conflict of evidence regarding the wheel and engine.] (Ninth assignment of error).[It has been argued that defendant himself caused this accident by slipping the band from the tight to the loose pulley of his machine, and thus gave additional rein to the engine. But we must not forget that he did this at a time when he was notified of what had happened, to wit, the breaking of the governor-belt of the engine, and when others were flying from the shop. Ilis position was one of peril, and he could not be held to the exercise of sound judgment at such a time. Assuming it to be true that he might have escaped had he not paused to look after his machine, such an error of judgment at such a time ought not to prevent <a id="p6" href="#p6" data-label="6" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*6</a>a recovery, if be is otherwise entitled.] (Tenth assignment of error).</p>

The jury in arriving at their verdict, must have found that the injuries complained of by plaintiff below resulted from the want of reasonable and proper care on the part of defendant or his authorized agents; and that plaintiff himself was not chargable with negligence contributing thereto. These controlling questions of fact, fairly raised by the testimony, were exclusively for the jury; and, inasmuch as the several propositions, in which they are presented by the respective parties, were answered by the court with substantial accuracy it is unnecessary to consider at length each of the specifications of error.</p>

The last of these was properly qualified by the learned judge in his answer thereto, and also in his general charge; the others were rightly affirmed. In the third proposition, the court was requested to charge: “ If the jury find it was the duty of defendant to have placed a competent man in charge of the small engine ..... so as to have immediate control thereof in case of accident, and that the failure to place such person in charge of said engine was negligence on the part of defendant, it will then become.their further duty to find whether or not the injury to plaintiff was the natural and probable consequence of that negligence, and to ascertain by their verdict what was the proximate cause of the injury suffered by him.” The most essential features of plaintiff’s case are so fairly presented in this point that its unqualified affirmance is not even the subject of complaint.</p>

Plaintiff had a right to assume that such precautions, as were reasonably necessary for the safety of himself and his fellow employees, were taken by their employer ; and, unless he knew, or as a prudent man should have known, not only the circumstances connected with the runniug of the small engine, but also the risk likely to result therefrom, he could not be precluded from claiming damages, if otherwise entitled to recover.</p>

The circumstances recited in the fifth, sixth and seventh propositions were not such as to justify the binding instructions therein requested. The testimony tended to show that plaintiff unexpectedly found himself in a position of peril, caused by the breaking of the governor belt and the consequent “running away ” of the engine. If the jury found, as they doubtless did, that such was the case, and that it resulted not from any default of the plaintiff himself, but from the negligence of defendant, it would have been most unreasonable to bold plaintiff to the exercise of such deliberate judgment as should have controlled bis action under other circumstances. That his position was one of imminent danger, in which there was no time for reflection, is clearly shown by the fact that other employees were fleeing therefrom while he was endeavoring to prevent the destruction of his employer’s machinery. As was well said by the learned judge in that part of his charge complained of in the ninth specification, <a id="p8" href="#p8" data-label="8" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*8</a>“ assuming it to be true that be might have escaped bad be not paused to look after his machine, such an error of judgment, at sucb a time, ought not to prevent a recovery.”</p>

The witness had previously testified that he himself was running engines in the same manner that plaintiff’s engine was operated at the time of the accident, and he did not consider it dangerous to do so. He had even testified that “it is not carelessness to run an engine in that way.” His answer to the question propounded could not have been more favorable to the defendant than this. At best it would have been substantially a repetition of the opinion he had already expressed. The defendant had the full benefit of that, and hence he could not have been prejudiced by the action of the court. The question complained of in the twelfth specification was entire!}'' proper. Being familiar with the position of the engines and the manner in which they were operated, the witness was asked to “state whether or not it was safe or otherwise — safe or dangerous — to run the small engine with out any person to attend to it,” and if dangerous, to “ describe the kind of danger.” The object of the question was to elicit facts clearly proper for the consideration of the jury in determining whether or not the defendant was justly chargeable with negligence.
