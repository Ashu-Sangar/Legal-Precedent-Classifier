Mutual Aid Society, in pursuance of its chartered 'power, issued to A. a certificate of membership which entitled B., “his wife, her heirs or assigns, upon the death of said A., to $3,000.” The wife died intestate during A.’s lifetime, leaving five children. Afterwards A. died, insolvent. The Society thereupon paid the $3,000 to said five children, who surrendered the original certificate. Subsequently letters ■ of administration were granted on the estate of B., and the adminis- ■ tratar (who was also assignee for benefit of creditors of A.) brought suit against the socieiy to recover the amount of the certificate. The court below directed a verdict for plaintiff, and upon a question reserved, <em>entered </em>judgment for plaintiff for one sixth of the amount of the certi<a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>ficate with interest, holding that as A. survived Ms wife, he or his estate was entitled to share equally with the live children in the proceeds of the policy, and that the payment by the society of the whole amount thereof to said children was no defence to the plaintiff’s claim for such one sixth part thereof.</p>

Aid Association, 13 Norris 481. The cases of Deginther’s Appeal, 2 Norris 337, and Anderson’s Estate, 4 Norris 202, relied upon by the court below, are inapplicable. Besides, the policies in those cases were payable to the wife of the insured, “ her executors, administrators and assigns,” thus indicating that the fund would become part of the wife’s estate. The words used in this certificate, viz.: “heirs or assigns,” negative the idea that this fund was to be a part of the wife’s estate, in case she did not survive her husband. Her legal representatives, as such, are not among the persons entitled to payment by the terms of the certificate. The word “ <em>heirs </em>” in the certificate must be construed as to effectuate the intention of the member. We contend that this case falls within that class of cases referred to in Hodge’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.N.C.%20209" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 W.N.C. 209">8 W. N. C. 209</a>, where it was held that the fund arising from membership in a beneficial association is “no part of the estate of the deceased member, and his administrator has no right to receive it as assets for the payment of debts.” As was stated in that case, the word “heirs” in the present certificate should have been held to mean the “next of kin” of Elizabeth Clay, the beneficiary, living at the time the benefits of membership in the association became due and payable. So construing the word heirs would have excluded the husband (Abbey’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20W.N.C.%20535" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 W.N.C. 535">13 W. N. C. 535</a>; affirmed in Ivins’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20W.N.C.%20165" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 W.N.C. 165">15 <em>W. </em>N. C. 165</a>; s. c., 10 Out. 176), and thus have carried into effect the manifest intention of Daniel Clay when he obtained his certificate of membership from this plaintiff in error, and the intention and purpose of the society which granted said certificate. That he did intend to provide for his <em>wife </em>and <em>children </em>is plain ; and in order to carry out this undoubted intention, the court below should have construed the word “heirs” in this certificate to mean the children of Elizabeth Clay.</p>

Payment to one of several'joinl payees is a good discharge of an obliga<a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>tion, and the obligees must settle with each other for their respective portions of the fund paid.
