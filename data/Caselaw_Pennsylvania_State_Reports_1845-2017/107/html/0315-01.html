J., the following facts appeared : Jacob Short was Supervisor of Derry township for the years ending in the spring of 1879 and 1880. On April 26th, 1879, the Auditors of the township met and settled his accounts for the first year, showing a balance clue by him to the township of $294.59. On April 19th, 1880, they met and settled his accounts for the second year, carrying forward in this report the $294.59, “amount due on settlement of ’79.” At the second settlement the Auditors found a balance due the township by Short of $274.01; and to recover that amount this suit was brought.</p>

Further, that being still dissatisfied with the Auditors’ report, Short applied to them to re-examine his accounts which they agreed to do, but failed to meet for the purpose until 1882, when two of the Auditors for 1879 and 1880 did meet, and found that Short was entitled to further credits for taxes, work and money expended, amounting to $100.39, leaving his debt to the township only $22. Two of the Auditors for 1882 (one of whom was also an Auditor in 1879 and 1880), approved of this statement.</p>

It appears by the evidence that Jacob Short was a Supervisor in Derry township in the years 1879 and 1880. For those years he executed bonds. Upon his bond for the last year this action is brought to recover from the Supervisor a balance in his <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>builds as shown by the Auditors’ report. It appears that the Auditors passed upon the accounts of the Supervisor and carried the balance for one year over to his accounts for the last year. In the Auditors’ report for the last year they found that there was a balance of $274.01 in Mr. Short’s bands. [This finding of the township Auditors is an adjudication of the balance in his hands, and, for the purpose of this action, is conclusive upon him]. The law provides that a person must appeal from the finding of the Auditors within a certain time, and if he does not do so he cannot in any other proceeding question the correctness of their finding. It has incidentally leaked out during the trial that there was an error In the first year in footing up the duplicates. That was a year before tbis final audit. We cannot now open up this audit, and especially tbe audit of the former year, and question what has been done, in this action. As we have said, if the Supervisor was not satisfied with the result, his remedy was by appeal to the court, in which case the court would have placed the matter in such shape as that it could have been examined and correctly adjusted. But now, this Auditors’ report for the last year, footing up this balance, as shown by their books, is conclusive upon tlie defendant, and, there being no other evidence, yon must find for the plaintiff this amount, to which, of course, you will add interest. This suit having been brought upon an official bond, your verdict should be for the full amount of the penalty in the bond, but you will assess as damages only the amount actually due by the defendant to the township, as shown by the Auditors’ report.”</p>
