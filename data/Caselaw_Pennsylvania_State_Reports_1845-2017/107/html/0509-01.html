It is true this matter escaped the attention of counsel in the court below, otherwise the rule for judgment would, no doubt, have been discharged; for in a very recent case, his honor Stowe, P. J. (who made absolute the rule in this case), has given to the rule of court in question even a more strict construction than is here urged, as follows: “ The affidavit of claim was sworn to by the affiant as agent in this behalf, of the plaintiff. This will not do and does not come within the rule of court. A party cannot deputize another to swear for him either generally or specially.

Nothing contained in the contract deprived the Pennsylvania Reform School of its rights to legal process for such purpose.

The plaintiff below is a corporation. It was represented in this suit by the affiant in said affidavit. There is nothing contained in the record of this case to show that said affiant was not the proper person to make the affidavit. Any such objection should have been raised by plaintiffs in error in the court below, and the same offered to be proven as a fact. The truth of the objection certainly did not appear upon the face of the affidavit in the court below, nor does it now appear in any part of the record.

St. 81</a>, cited by plaintiffs in error, was an action of covenant on a mortgage in which judgment had been taken for want of sufficient affidavit of defence. The rules of court required the filing, by the plaintiff, of a copy of the instrument sued on, or a reference in the praecipe or narr., to the office, book or page where the same could be <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>found of record. No copy had been filed, and neither narr. or-praecipe contained such reference. This, of course <em>appeared to the court </em>upon review of that case, and your Honors very properly said that “ an omission to state in the court below an objection <em>so clearly shown by the record </em>does not preclude the plaintiffs in error from urging it now as a ground of objection to the judgment.”</p>

The plaintiff in error being a surety, an action could be brought against him in the first instance without pursuing the principal to insolvency, hence if, as alleged, our original suit against Vaters &amp; Co. were not on the contract (which we do not admit) it would in no way affect the status of this suit.</p>

If not made by the party, but by an agent, then the fact of his agency should in some manner, be averred in the affidavit.

    <p id="b539-4" data-blocks='[["BL_539.4",539,[141,518,1161,855]]]'>This suit was against the plaintiff in error as surety for Vaters &amp; Co., for the fulfilment of a contract between them, and the defendants in error. The former hired of the latter, for the term of two years, the labor and service of boys and girls, inmates of the Pennsylvania Reform School. They were to be employed in manufacturing light saddlery and harness goods in the workshops of said school, by Vaters &amp; Co., who were to pay for the labor certain sums stipulated, payable quarterly. In said contract it is agreed, that on the failure of Vaters &amp; Co. to pay any instalment due for labor performed thereunder, the other party “shall retain and keep in their possession all merchandise, goods and machinery and tools whatsoever,” which may be on the premises of said school at Morganza, belonging to said Vaters &amp; Co. and hold the same as a pledge for the payment of such moneys as may be matured or become due, until the same be paid; and if not paid in a reasonable time, then to sell and dispose of the same either at public or private sale, and after paying from the proceeds all moneys owing them from Vaters <em>&amp; </em>Co. and all costs and expenses, to pay over the residue, if any, to Vaters &amp; Co.</p>
    <p id="b539-5" data-blocks='[["BL_539.5",539,[143,1375,1159,641]]]'>In paragraph 6 of the affidavit of defence it is averred substantially that the personal property of Vaters &amp; Co., on the promises at Morganza, which the plaintiffs below were bound to retain, sell, and apply the proceeds under the contract to the liquidation of any indebtedness thereon, was worth about $2000, and if the same had been properly sold, said sum would have been realized therefrom ; yet that they made no such application of the property or its proceeds, but on the contrary they caused the property to be levied on and sold at sheriffs sale, on an execution in a suit wherein they had recovered a judgment against Vaters <em>&amp; </em>Co. on an entirely different matter, as appears by the record; and at said sale the property was sacrificed for about $463. How far these facts may be disproved, or their presumptive effect be removed, on the trial, we cannot now anticipate.</p>

It thus appears that the contract of Vaters &amp; Co., for the performance of which the plaintiff in error became surety, expressly declares, on the very contingency which has happened, the other party “ shall retain and keep in their possession ” the property specified, and sell and apply the proceeds thereof on this indebtedness to them. When the surety became bound, he saw the contract imposed this imperative obligation on the other party. It required Vaters &amp; Co. to furnish in the workshops of the <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>school all tools, machinery, and implements necessary to manufacture the goods named. The surety had a right to assume this property would be some substantial security to reduce the measure of his liability. If, in fact, in violation of the contract the Reform School appropriated this property to another separate and distinct debt to the damage of the surety, it may give the latter an equitable defence to the extent of that damage. It may be a question on the trial whether the property was sold in good faith, and according to the agreement, so as to produce the largest sum practicable, or whether it “was sold in such a manner as to unduly prejudice the rights of the surety.</p>

To the extent, and in the manner and under the circumstances pointed out in his obligation, he is bound, and no further. It is not sufficient that he may sustain no injury by a change in the contract, or that it may even be for his benefit. He has a right to stand upon the very terms of his contract, and if he does not assent to any variation of it, and a variation is made, it is fatal.” Any material variation of the contract with the principal discharges the surety: Tull <em>v. </em>Serrill, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20W.N.C.%20373" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 W.N.C. 373">1 W.
