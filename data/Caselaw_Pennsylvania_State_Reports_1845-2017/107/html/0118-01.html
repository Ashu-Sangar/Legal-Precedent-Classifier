Herman, President Judge of the ninth judicial district, composed of Cumberland county, was related to a party in interest, Herman, P.

Barnett, President Judge of the forty-first judicial district, “ho being the Judge learned in the law residing nearest to the court-house of the said county of Cumberland, who is qualified to act.” Subsequently, Barnett, P. J., holding a special Court in Cumberland county, filed an order appointing William Trickett and C. P. Humrich, Esqs., examiners to take testimony. At a meeting of the examiners, counsel for both parties stated that, it having been discovered that a large number of illegal votes bad been cast for both the candidates, they were satisfied, after exhaustive inquiry, that the result, as declared by the return judges, would not be changed, and for this reason no testimony was submitted by either party. Counsel for Mr. Wagner admitted that there was probable cause for the contest. The examiners reported said agreement and admission to the court, whereupon the court, Barnett, P. J., entered a decree that Samuel C. Wagner had been duly elected. The decree further proceeded as follows :</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[161,1658,1174,813]]]'>“ It is further made the duty of the court by the Act of May 8th, 1876 (P. L. 148), to dispose of the question of costs. It is admitted by the eouusel of Mr. Wagner that there was probable cause for the beginning of this contest; they Lave arrived at that conclusion after a careful examination of the evidence exhibited to them by the contestants: and they make the admission for saving the costs of an examination in the usual mode by the commissioners appointed by the court. Under these circumstances it would be extraordinary for a court to decide ‘ that the complaint was not or is not without probable cause.’ We do not so decide. We must therefore apportion the costs. It appears from the ‘Compendium of the Tenth Census of the United States, 1880, part ii. p. 1151,’ that the total assessed valuation of real and personal property in Adams county is $11,760,445 ; and the like valuation for Cumberland county is $14,277,465. These amounts are very nearly in the ratio of 45 to <em>55 </em>; and we think such valuation affords an equitable basis for apportionment.</p>

Under the provisions of the Act of May 19th, 1874, § 17, this was error. The word “ district ” in that Act, refers to senatorial district and not to judicial district.

Probable cause is a mixed question of law and fact. In this case, there was no trial, for there was no evidence, and the Judge could not decide the question of probable cause on a mere admission of parties, with no evidence on the record. Hence, there can be no liability on the county for costs incurred wholly by the parties: Berks Co. <em>v. </em>Pile, 6 Harris 496: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Horner, 10 Casey 445; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Huntingdon Co., <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Rawle%20488" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Rawle 488">3 Rawle 488</a>; York County <em>v. </em>Crafton, 4 Out. 619.</p>

      <em>coram non yudice </em>and therefore void, it follows of course that-there was nothing on which to base the mandamus execution of which plaintiff in error complains. On the other hand, if the court, presided oyer by the president judge of the 41st Judicial District, had jurisdiction of the case, its orders and decrees, declaring that the contestee “ received the greatest number of legal votes for Senator in the district and is entitled to the certificate; that the complaint was not without probable cause,” and directing that the costs of the proceeding be paid by the counties composing the Senatorial district, etc., were clearly within the powers conferred by the Act and its supplement of May 8th, 1876 ; and, as between the parties to these "writs of error and certiorari, these orders and decrees are conclusive and cannot be inquired into.</p>

The question is whether, under the provisions of the Act above quoted, he was authorized to preside. It is contended by plaintiff in error that the phrase, “ district in which any contest shall arise,” in the 17th section, means senatorial and not judicial district, and inasmuch as the president judge of Adams, one of the counties composing the 32d Senatorial district, was not disqualified, he and not Judge Barkett was the only judge who, under the circumstances, was authorized to preside at the trial. We cannot assent to this construction of the Act. On the contrary, we are clearly of opinion that the clause in question refers to the judicial and not to the Senatorial district: and when, as in the present case, the judicial district is composed of a single county the <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>meaning of the phrase is the same as that employed in the lltli section, viz. : “ the county where the person returned shall reside.” We entertain no doubt that the judge who presided at the trial was fully authorized to act. The assignments of error, involving the question of jurisdiction and other questions dependent thereon, are not sustained.</p>

If there is, we have failed to discover it. The court, as we have seen, had jurisdiction of the subject. Want of probable cause for the complaint on which the original proceeding was based was not found by the court, and the learned judge proceeded as required by the supplement of 1876, to apportion the costs and order the payment thereof. The supplement provides that if “ the court or judge shall not decide that the complaint is without probable cause, the proper district,” &amp;e., “shall be liable to pay all costs, and the same shall be promptly paid by the proper authorities, and upon the order of the court or judge trying the case.” The learned judge distinctly stated that under the circumstances he could not decide that the complaint was not without probable cause, and he did not so decide. The decree conformed substantially to the requirements of the Act, and surely the court was not powerless to enforce it. It may be that the burden has fallen on those who should not be required to bear it, but the actors in the original proceedings are not before us, and there appears to be nothing in the proceeding that would justify us in reversing or setting them aside.</p>
