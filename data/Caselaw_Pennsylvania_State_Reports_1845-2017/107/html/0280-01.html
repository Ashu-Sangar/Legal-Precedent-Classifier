But if subsequently, and soon after having paid for such actual injury thus done, a grade was regularly established making a further change or alteration in the grade additional to what had been before made, or if additional work was done on the street by the borough, causing a further change and alteration, and injury resulted to the lot by reason of the establishing of such different grade or by reason of such additional work, the then owner of the lot would be entitled to recover, and the borough to pay for such injury thus occasioned ; and any change thus made, if it occasioned injury to the lot additional to the injury occasioned by the former change, would be sufficient to entitle the owner to compensation in damages therefor.”</p>
