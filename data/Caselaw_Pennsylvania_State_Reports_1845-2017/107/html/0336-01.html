The said firm of McGough, Parker &amp; Co. has not been engaged in a banking or other business since on or about the 13th day of February, 1877, and has not kept up any form of organization since that date. All accounts of said firm, so far as presented, were closed, and public notice was given that its business was transferred and that the firm of McGough, Parker <em>&amp; </em>Co. had discontinued its business.

Notice by publication of the dissolution seems to have been given. Upon the dissolution of McGough, Parker &amp; Co. the accounts, etc., of that firm were transferred to the new bank. This, if Avith the consent of the customers and depositors of the old bank, would be sufficient and conclusive upon them. But clearly the old firm, to whose indebtedness an individual liability attached, could not relieve themselves from that liability by their own act. Mere publication of the dissolution would not discharge their liability unless notice was shown to have been received by the particular individuals who were creditors, and express <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>or implied consent given. The question might arise, although not here raised, whether the transfer of the accounts at the date of the dissolution would not be a distinct acknowledgment of the indebtedness at that date as effecting the question of the Statute of Limitations, independent of other consideration. In the present controversy the fact of indebtedness is not denied ; the defence interposed is that the claim of plaintiff is barred by the Statute of Limitations. If the obligation is to be treated as a mere due bill or promissory note ordinarily passing between individuals, then the defence on that ground would be tenable. In this view the defendant’s counsel very ably argue, and cite in support of their position : Andress’s Appeal, 3 Out. 421; Milne’s Appeal, Id. 483 ; and Laforge <em>v. </em>Jayne, 9 Barr 410. These cases all apply to the relation of borrower and lender, and carry out the marked distinction that would exist when the transaction partakes of a more especial fiduciary relation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.3",359,[145,1152,1174,1037]]]'>In Laforge <em>v. </em>Jayne the language expresses distinctly the borrowing of a sum of money, and construes itself as an ordinary promissory note. The other two cases are equally explicit, and are both written in the language of ordinary due bills. The mere fact that the instruments are or are not interest bearing does not change their distinctive character as due bills or promissory notes, nor do wo think that fact alters the character of the certificate of deposit, as it is a well-known fact that between banks in running accounts interest is frequently allowed to the depositing bank, which certainly does not alter the fiduciary character of the deposit. The very nature of the business of banking is to invite the deposits. Their transactions with customers are on the basis of a one-sided confidence, that is to say, the depositor must be actuated by a confidence in the solvency of the institution where he implicitly deposits his money, without other evidence of indebtedness than the bank sees proper to give him; sometimes by an entry on a bank book, or perhaps by a written certificate of deposit, or in many cases by the mere entry of the deposit on the books of the bank alone. The profits of such deposits are always with the bank. The reciprocal advantage to the depositor is the supposed security he has in leaving his money in the vaults and safes of his bankers, and in the knowledge that it is always at his command.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b359-5" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[144,2190,1168,259]]]'>These banks, depending on the deposits as a basis on which their loans are made and their business conducted, usually make great efforts to secure deposits, and certainly regard with greater favor the time deposits, often allowing their customers interest for such deposits as an inducement to get the use of the money for an extended period.</p>

      <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>It may readily be seen that the relation is different than in the case of borrower and lender, from the fact that the bank is a common repository for the money of its customers, who voluntarily leave it for safe keeping. Borrowers in tbe common way of business are the ones who solicit loans, giving their notes and due bills, often accompanied with other securities or indorsements. The bank as a depository holds itself out to its depositors as ready to pay on demand, the simple borrower usually fixes a time before which he is not expected to pay. ' The cases cited by the plaintiff seem to be more applicable to the present case, viz.: Girard Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Penn Township, 3 Wr. 92; Finkbone’s Appeal, 5 Nor. 370.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[231,946,1181,118]]]'>The first case is analogous to the present in this, that it applies to the very relation of depositor and bailee — the individual and the bank.</p>

Must the action then fail by reason of the additional defence that no demand was made before suit was brought? Ordinarily demand would have been a condition precedent, but the law does not require a vain thing. When the party has put himself in a position that demand could not be made, by bankruptcy, discontinuance of business, etc., then it has been held that the bringing of suit is sufficient demand: Morse on Banks and Banking, page 45.</p>

That a certificate of deposit may or may not be treated as a promissory note Ave may refer to Morse on Banks and Banking, 2d ed., 63d page, et seq. On page 64 it is said the courts have inclined to hold them as promissory notes, especially when they are made payable otherwise than immediately or on <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>demand. If they are made payable at a future day certain they are simply promissory notes. The certificate in suit was denominated and stamped as such by the defendants. It was payable immediately, that is, upon its return. The clause allowing interest did not alter the time of payment, only increased the amount payable if the time of demand was extended beyond six months.</p>

Finkbone’s Appeal, 5 Norris 368, relied on by the other side is inapplicable as that was a clear case of bailment, the instrument specifying that the money was deposited “for safe keeping, to be returned in such amounts as she may want.” The case of Girard Bank <em>v. </em>Bank of Penn Township, also relied on by defendant in error, differs from this case, in that the defendant there was not a private firm but an incorporated bank, and the question was as to the rights of a depositor. We submit, further that it is essential that the demand be made within six years : Barton <em>v. </em>Dickens, 12 Wr. 518; Alexander <em>v. </em>Leckey, 9 Barr 120; Codman <em>v. </em>Rogers, 10 Pickering, <em>112; </em>Laforge <em>v. </em>Jayne, 9 Barr 410; Morrison <em>v. </em>Mullin, 10 Casey 12; Campbell’s Administrators <em>v. </em>Boggs, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20524" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Wright 524">12 Wright 524</a>. It will be contended that Fiukbone’s Appeal overruled these decisions. It appears in that case that the bar of the statute was prevented, at any rate, by a renewal or re-statement of account. The opinion, it is true, indicates that, under the facts of that case, the demand need. not be made within the six years. The renewal of the obligation, though, was conclusive in favor of the plaintiff in error, and hence the question of whether demand should be made, under the peculiar facts of the case, was not so impor<a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>tant as though it had stood alone. If demand within six years be not essential, the plaintiff might hold the claim indefinitely before making demand, and then bring suit just before the expiration of six years from demand. We confidently submit that the statute of limitations is not open to such uncertainty. In any view of the ease the judgment was erroneous, for the affidavits of defence raise a question of fact as to the alleged demand — a prerequisite to bringing suit — which should have taken the case to a jury.</p>
