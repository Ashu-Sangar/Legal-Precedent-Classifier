It is plain, however, from the reading of this paper, that the prohibitory clause cannot have the effect attributed to it. What Robert Evans desired was to have a home with his daughter and son-in-law, and he therefore bargained with them that they should keep him comfortably during his life. It occurred to him that they might sell the land in his lifetime, or such interest in it as they might have, and thus turn him over to the keeping of strangers. He guarded himself against accident of this kind, because he wanted the personal service and attention of those with whom he was bargaining so long as he lived. This was the whole purpose of the provision, and it cannot, therefore, be rationally and fairly construed into an absolute prohibition against alienation after his death. This is sufficient to dispose of the case, for if we should concede (which we do not) that Jeffries and his wife took only a life estate, the fact that the husband is still living would prevent a recovery. So long as he lives his children can have no legal claim to the possession under the contract. When a tenant for life conveys a greater estate than he holds, the conveyance <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>does not work a forfeiture, but is effectual to pass such estate as lie has.”</p>

The conveyances by Jeffries being in violation of the condition against alienation, worked a forfeiture. It is evident from the context that the word “ heirs ” in the agreement was used by Evans in its popular sense of “ children.” An estate for life to A. and B., and after their decease to their children, gives only a life estate to the first takers, and a remainder in fee to the children : Gernet <em>v. </em>Lvnn, <a href="/citations/?q=81%20Pa.%2094" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="81 Pa. 94">81 Pa.

Jeffries, the plaintiffs claim title. On the other hand the defendants claim under the said Howell H. Jeffries, to whom, with his wife Ann, at the date above mentioned, Robert Evans executed the agreement or conveyance, the construction of which gives rise to the present contention. Jeffries is still alive, but his wife, Ann, is now dead, and was so at the commencement of this suit, so that the question, turns upon the title of Jeffries and his vendees, the defendants. The court below holding that there was, by the conveyance above referred to, a life estate in the said Jeffries which he was at liberty to convey, non-suited the plaintiffs. We think that in this there was no error. The agreement of the 27th of September is, on the point in controversy, i. e., the right of Jeffries to sell his life estate, somewhat obscure, but we do not see that we can make a better construction of it than did the learned Judge of the Common Pleas. Those parts of the agreement material to this controversy are as follows : “ That said Robert Evans of the first part agrees to give his farm unto the said Howell H. Jeffries and Ann, his wife, to farm during his natural lifetime, for the consideration of keeping him comfortably in food and clothing and necessaries. Said. Robert Evans further agrees that after his decease said Howell H. Jeffries and Ann, his wife, shall have said farm for their use during their lifetime, and after their decease to go to their heirs after them forever, provided said Ann Jeffries will leave any children, otherwise the farm is to go to the nearest relations of said Robert Evans.

Jeffries and Ann, his wife, agree to fulfil the foregoing conditions, and also <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>agree not to transfer or sell tbeir right of aforementioned farm to any person whomsoever.

    <p id="b433-4" data-blocks='[["BL_433.3",433,[120,641,1172,391]]]'>This agreement, as construed in the court below, and as we also are inclined to construe it, does not involve tbe question of forfeiture for a breach of tbe condition in restraint of sale. Had Jeffries and bis wife attempted a sale of the premises during the lifetime of Robert Evans, the question as above stated would have been pertinent and material, but as nothing of the kind was done until after the death of Robert Evans, and of Ann, his daughter, this subject, under the construction winch we have adopted, requires no discussion.</p>
    <p id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[122,1032,1175,909]]]'>The first part of the agreement amounts to a mere lease of the farm during tbe life of Evans, and the condition, for obvious reasons, restrains a sale of this right during that period, but wo cannot see that it prohibits the sale of the superadded life estate which commenced at tbe death of the grantor. Tbe very contrary seems, in a blind way, to be indicated in tbe latter part of the condition: “ For be it understood, that said Robert Evans grants no power to sell or transfer the privilege of these presents to any other than the within named Howell H. Jeffries and Ann, his wife.” Tins would seem to indicate that he intended to grant a power of sale to Jeffries and his wife jointly, and as the first clause of the condition seems to exclude such power as to the right granted (luring the life of Evans, it must apply to the life estate. It is true that lie may have intended that such sale should be made only by tlie joint conveyance of the husband and wife, but as tbe wife was dead at the time of the conveyance to Grumbling, her rights had then vested in him, and bis deed was as effectual to convey the title as would have been a joint deed executed in her lifetime : McCurdy &amp; Stevenson <em>v. </em>Canning, 14 P.

But in Huss <em>v. </em>Stephens, 1 P.
