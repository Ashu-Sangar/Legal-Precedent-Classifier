The 'plea of nolo contendere by the principal (no judgment or sentence having been imposed) is inadmissible, on the trial of the accessory, either to affect the accessory or to establish the guilt of the principal.

After the Commonwealth closed, the witness Alpert was called two or three times for cross-examination. Alpert was again re-called, as defendant said, for cross-examination, and the Commonwealth objected to this manner of proceeding and requested defendant to put his offer in writing. The matter was clearly within the discretion of the court. The offer to prove the finding of sand-bags upon Gordon and Geary was not offered to prove the guilt of Buck, but only as tending to show the guilt of the principals. Since the Act of March 31st, 1860, it is not necessary to show the conviction of the principal felon, yet it is indispensable to aver and prove his guilt on the trial of an accessory; and for this purpose alone'was the plea of Gordon and Geary offered.

      <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>The fact that the juror, William F. Barton, had served as a juror in the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Gordon et al., No. 5, of September Sessions, 1888, was not a sufficient ground of challenge for cause. It was a different ease, and involved an entirely different state of facts. The only way the defendant below could get rid of the juror was to challenge him peremptorily.</p>
    <p id="b509-4" data-blocks='[["BL_509.4",509,[175,727,1164,731]]]'>The second assignment raises a more important question. It alleges that the court below erred in admitting in evidence against the defendant the plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>which bad been entered by Gordon and Geary. The latter were charged in tbe same indictment as principals in tbe robbery; the defendant Buck being charged as accessory before and after the fact. Gordon and Geary, the principals, had, as before stated, pleaded <em>nolo contendere, </em>but had not been sentenced; and the trial proceeded as to Buck as accessory, upon the plea of not guilty. The Commonwealth then offered the plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>in evidence as proof of tbe guilt of the principals. It was objected to as incompetent and irrelevant to affect the defendant Buck, now on trial. It was clearly incompetent to show tbe participation of Buck in the offence. Was it competent to show the guilt of the principals; to prove that the robbery bad been committed to which it was charged Buck was accessory?</p>
    <p id="b509-5" data-blocks='[["BL_509.5",509,[175,1460,1162,686]]]'>The plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>is a mild form of pleading guilty. It is seldom used in this state, though in general practice in some of the New England states. “ It has the same effect as a plea of guilty so far as concerns the proceedings upon the indictment, and a defendant who is sentenced upon such a plea to pay a fine is convicted of the offence for which lie was indicted: ” Wharton’s American Criminal Law, § 538. The advantage, however, which may attend this plea is, that when accompanied by a protestation of tbe defendant’s innocence it will not conclude him in a civil action from contesting the facts charged in the indictment: Com. <em>v. </em>Horton, <a href="/mass/26/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="9 Pick. 206" data-case-ids="2058413" data-case-paths="/mass/26/0209-01">9 Pick. 206</a>. And in Massachusetts, under statute of 1855, c. 215, § 35, a defendant in a prosecution under that statute cannot be adjudged guilty on a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>unless it appears by tbe record tliat tlie plea was received with the consent of the prosecutor: Com. <em>v. </em>Adams, <a href="/mass/72/0359-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Gray 359" data-case-ids="1994714" data-case-paths="/mass/72/0359-01">6 Gray 359</a>.</p>

No man can be accessory to a crime which has never been committed. The authorities show that the guilt of the principal felon may be proved by the record of liis conviction, or by evidence <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>aliunde: 2 Starkie oil Evidence 9.

R. 134, it was said by Bbab.cb.OFT, J., and assented to by Lord KeNYON, that where the principal has been convicted, it is nevertheless on the trial of the accessory competent to the defendant to prove the principal innocent. And where two persons had been indicted together, one for stealing and the other for receiving, and the principal pleaded guilty, Wood, B., refused to allow the plea of guilty to establish the fact of the stealing by the principal against the receiver: <a href="/miss/18/0192-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="10 S. &amp; M. 192" data-case-ids="8839031" data-case-paths="/miss/18/0192-01">10 S. &amp; M. 192</a>.

What more is the plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>than a confession ? Had judgment been entered upon the plea the record would have been competent evidence of the conviction. But there was no judgment; only a plea which was at best but a qualified admission of guilt, and which might have been withdrawn the next day. We are of opinion that the plea was improperly received.</p>

As a general rule, when a man is arrested charged with the commission of a crime, it is competent to show upon his trial what articles, if any, were found upon his person at the time of such arrest. I do not understand this general proposition to be disputed, but it was urged that however true this may be as to Gordon and Geary, the evidence was not competent as against the defendant. We are unable to see the distinction. It was a part of the Commonwealth’s case — a necessity of the situation — to prove the guilt of the principals before the accessory could be convicted. This has been already sufficiently discussed. The testimony in regard to the sand-bags and revolvers comes directly within the same principle. If admissible against Gordon and Geary had they been on trial, it was also competent against the defendant,, not indeed t,o <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>show bis connection witb the offence, but to show the guilt of the principals.

    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[146,897,1170,551]]]'>The fourth and fifth assignments may be considered together. They involve a mode of practice which is not to be commended.

Defendant then proposed “ to ask the witness, Alpert, on the stand, questions affecting his (the witness’s) credibility, and the court, on demand of the Commonwealth, requires defendant to put in writing his questions — to which order and qualified refusal to admit the offered evidence defendant excepts, and here assigns it as error.”</p>

It was the right of the District Attorney to object and ask the court to rule it out. It was an attempt to prove an alleged fact by incompetent evidence. The proper mode of proving a conviction for embezzlement, or any other crime, is the production of the record. It is the highest and best evidence.</p>

A witness may sometimes be badly damaged with the jury, as well as have his feelings outraged, by asking him improper questions when on the stand. Where this line of cross-examination occurs it is always proper for the judge to require the questions to be put in writing and handed up to him.
