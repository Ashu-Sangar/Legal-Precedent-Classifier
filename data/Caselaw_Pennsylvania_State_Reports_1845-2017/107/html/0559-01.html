MoElroy owed him. But ejectment is not a remedy for the collection of debts, and cannot be lawfully employed to extort their payment. It is manifest, therefore, that the defendant has not maintained his claim to this land in good faith, but that bis conduct in harassing the wife of his alleged debtor by two ejectments on a title which the evidence before the Master shows clearly to be worthless, in taking non-suits after putting in all the evidence within his power and knowledge, in asserting that be would continue to harass her in the same manner, and in demanding money as the price of peace under the cloak of purchasing his title, was fraudulent, and gives a right to the wife to seek aid from a court of equity: Lyon’s Appeal, 11 P.

McElroy, the plaintiff, and lias rendered it so unmarketable that it is in danger of being sacrificed to satisfy encumbrances against it. Bills of peace, to remove clouds from title constitute a well defined and long established branch <a id="p566" href="#p566" data-label="566" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*566</a>of equity jurisprudence. Says Story in his work on Equity Jurisprudence, 12th Ed. § 711: “ It is very common in courts of equity to entertain suits for the purpose of removing a cloud resting upon the plaintiff’s title. This is done upon the ground that it is for the interests of both parties that the precise stat.e of the title be known if all are acting bona fide; and if not, that a merely colorable and pretended claim is a fraud upon the real owner, and as such should be extinguished.” See also High on Injunctions, § 372. But the counsel for the defendant contend that unless the legislature have explicitly delegated such power to the Courts of Common Pleas, we in this state are without any such jurisdiction, and they deny that such ever has been delegated. But whether it ever has been delegated or not, the Supreme Court said in Pollard <em>v. </em>Shaffer, 1 Dali. 210, and again in Jordan <em>v. </em>Cooper, 3 S. &amp; R. 578, that “Equity is part of the law in Pennsylvania,” and therefore there must be somewhere jurisdiction to remove a cloud from a title. In this connection the paragraph just quoted from Story offers a solution. “If the parties act in good faith,” he says, “ it is to both their interests that the precise state of the title be known.” This then could be ascertained here by having a verdict and judgment in ejectment at law. But if one of the parties has only “ a colorable and pretended claim, then it is fraud upon the real owner.” The Acts of 1840 and 1857 have conferred upon the Courts of Common Pleas, first in Philadelphia and then throughout the state, chancery jurisdiction over frauds. The Master is of the opinion that the evidence adduced before him shows that this court has jurisdiction of this case upon this ground, to wit, that the defendant’s claim of title is col-orable only, and therefore a fraud upon the real owner, Sarah B. McElroy.</p>

But the court enjoined him. In Lyon’s Appeal a wife owned land subject to mortgage. Judgments were recovered against her husband, creditors alleging the land to be his. They bought the mort<a id="p567" href="#p567" data-label="567" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*567</a>gage, issued execution on it for the purpose of securing tbeir judgment. The court enjoined the creditors from proceeding until they should execute an assignment to the wife on payment of the debt, interest and costs; for, although they had a right to execution on the mortgage at law, equity will look to the use to be made of the power, and if it be aside from the legal right to have satisfaction, will restrain the improper use.</p>

There the plaintiff was the owner of a warehouse and lot, and after he purchased it a lot of machinery remained there, the property of its former occupants, whom he notified to remove it, and received a reply threatening to hold him responsible for the defendant’s interest in the machinery and real estate. He asked the court, among other tilings, to decree that he had a good title. The Supreme Court dismissed the bill, reversing the lower court, saying, among other things: “ If there is anything certain in the equity practice of Pennsylvania, it is that a court cannot by bill bring before it parties having adverse claims to land, and between whom there are no relations of trust or contract, and settle their several titles by decree. If it be said that Grove was in possession, and therefore could not bring ejectment in order to test the appellant’s claim, it may be answered tlie goods of the partnership were upon tile premises before his entry, and if either of tlie partners claimed to Iiavt) them there of right, there was nothing to prevent the appellee from testing that right by ejectment.” But in that case there was no fraud, no title, even colorable, exhibited to the court, and tlie facts sliown in tlie bill as pointed out by the court, gave them a remedy by bringing ejectment at law. “The truth of the case seems to be,” said the court, “ that the appellee, alarmed by Barclay’s ambiguous threat, has endeavored to interpose the decree of a court between himself and the possible consequences of the exercise of his own right. This, however, he cannot do. A trustee may seek the advice and protection of a court of equity, but such is not the right of an ordinary person.

Nothing is better settled in Pennsylvania than that where two persons assert conflicting legal titles to land the remedy is at law. This principle has been recently forcibly stated by Mr. Justice GORDON in the following language : “ If there is anything certain in the equity practice of Pennsylvania it is that a court cannot by bill bring before it parties having adverse claims to land, and between whom there are no relations of trust or contract, and settle their several titles by decree. We know of no power in equity or elsewhere by which the owner of an adverse title can be called into court by the party in possession to assert and defend that title, on penalty of forfeiture should he refuse to do so. While this might be a convenient and speedy method to settle title, the Statute of Limitations interposes, and a claimant cannot be compelled to assert his right or test his claim within a time less than the statutory period ” : Barclay’s Appeal, 12 Norris 50. To the same effect are North Penna. Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Snowden, 6 Wr. 488 ; Long’s Appeal, 11 Norris 171. The action of the court cannot be sustained on any assumption of fraud, for there is no fraud charged in the pleadings: Brightly’s Equity, p. 72, § 57. It cannot be on the allegation that appellant’s title was obtained contrary to law. A creditor has a right to sell whatever right he believes the husband has in property standing in the wife’s name. Equity cannot be used to obstruct the creditor in the collection of his claim: Winch's Appeal, 11 P. F. S. 424. The creditor in this case lawfully selling, the purchaser lawfully bought. Consequently his title was not obtained contrary to law. The recital of facts by the Master, as showing unlawful and fraudulent conduct in appellant, is not supported by the evidence. There was no proof of anything said or done by him showing bad faith, want of confidence in his title, attempts to extort, threats to harass, or demands of money as price of peace. But from all that appears he acted in the conscientious belief that the husband, whose title he <a id="p570" href="#p570" data-label="570" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*570</a>bought, bad an interest in that property, and that he sought to establish by his proceedings. The Statute of Limitations allows him ample time within which to test it, and if he brings the actions the law allows, and from want of sufficient preparation chooses to take non-suit, the costs fall upon himself, the loss is his own; nothing is thereby determined against him. Equity jurisdiction in Pennsylvania depends on express statute: Dohnert’s Appeal, 14 P. F. S. 311. It has not made such strides as to take from the holder of an adverse title the right to have the facts tried by a jury.</p>

The facts found by the Master — as distinguished from his inferences from facts and his assumptions of facts — instead of making out a clear case of exclusive ownership and title in the wife, make out a clear case to the contrary. The entire evidence of the plaintiffs themselves, taking it as true, shows that the property, the title of Samuel B. McElroy in which was sold to the appellant, was not purchased by the means of Mrs. McElroy alone. They allege that she realized in 1855 from sale of her Venango property $6000 in notes. Those were given by.her to her husband, to be used in his business, that of dry goods merchant, and the amount to be repaid to her, when she should want it to buy a home. There was no agreement that he should pay her interest. He says that by extensions and renewals of the notes he, in the course of some years, along in 1858, ’59, ’60, ’61, realized therefrom $2000 more. That he must have made by his skillful handling of the paper, obtaining evidently even more than legal interest. That income from the notes his wife did not and could not claim under 'their arrangement as hers. It belonged to himself. Then she had not more than $6000 in her husband’s hands from that source. She got no more means from any source until August 27th, 1867, when they allege the sum of $19,892.98 was received for her by her husband, being the proceeds of sale of an interest she had in Allegheny county land. This, added to the $6000, gives the amount of her entire separate estate as $25,892.98 — all having been put in her husband’s possession and under his control, for use in his business, until she would call for repayment. Before getting this latter and larger amount of money, on the 7th day of April, 1866, appellees bought the Black property in Twentieth ward for $25,000, the husband paying down cash $10,000 and giving the customary securities from himself and wife for the residue, $15,000. That residue was not paid up and mortgages satisfied until May 9th, 1868, when the interest thereon would amount to over $1875. The husband made all the payments, which, from those figures, make a total of $26,875, <a id="p571" href="#p571" data-label="571" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*571</a>being nearly $1000 more than the amount of his indebtedness to his wife. Her means alone had not then bought and paid for the Black property, but his money and credit contributed thereto.</p>

They paid the consideration in part by selling and conveying to Bates the Black property at $82,000, and the remaining $8000 they raised by <em>¡jointly </em>incurring an indebtedness of $9000 to another party.

Bills of peace to remove clouds from titles and to prevent multiplicity of suits, are well-recognized grounds of equity jurisdiction, and this under the head of fraud: 1 Story on Eq. •Jurisprudence, § 711; High on Injunctions, Secs. 64,827; Orton <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Howard%20263" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="18 Howard 263">18 Howard, 263</a>.</p>

      <a id="p574" href="#p574" data-label="574" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*574</a>The facts found show that the land referred to in this bill was purchased by Mrs. McElroy, and paid for out of her separate estate, and that no part of the consideration which she paid therefor came to her from her husband. It was therefore not liable for his debts, and the sale on an execution against him passed no title to the appellant. The facts stated were well known to the latter before this bill was filed. He had brought two actions of ejectment for the land based on his purchase as the property of her husband. Each case was brought to'trial. Both parties gave all their evidence. After counsel had addressed, and the court had charged the jury, the appellant (then plaintiff) took a voluntary nonsuit in each case. There is no after discovered, or additional evidence tending to impair the validity of the title of the appellee. Nevertheless with this full knowledge that his pretended title is worthless, the appellant intended, and threatened, to bring another action of ejectment against the appellee, for the same land, and on his same pretended title. These acts and declarations of the appellant have cast a cloud on the title of the appellee. The Master also found that the appellant has not maintained his claim to the land in good faith, but that he continues to harass the appellee and demand money as the price of peace under the cloak of purchasing his title, which constitutes such a fraud as to give her a right to seek aid from a court of equity: Lyon’s Appeal, 11 P. F. S. 15.</p>

As therefore it is contrary to both law and equity to thus sell it, a court of equity will enjoin against the sale: Hunter’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20196" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Wright 196">4 Wright 196</a>; Lyon’s Appeal, 11 P.

    <p id="b594-7" data-blocks='[["BL_594.5",594,[215,1760,1168,599]]]'>The case is therefore within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. The sale, under the facts clearly proved, was contrary to law, and the continued threat of annoyance is prejudicial to the interests of the community and the rights of the appellee. Equity is part of the law of this state. The rules of equity are as binding as those of law: Hawthorn <em>v. </em>Bronson, 16 S. &amp; R. 269. The appellee has no adequate remedy at law. She is in possession of the property. She cannot therefore bring ejectment. Twice has the appellant practically admitted that he has no claim to the land. His pretended claim has become a fraud upon the appellee, and should be extinguished: Story on Eq. Juris. §711; High on Injunctions § 872. The able report of the Master, affirmed by the court, fully sustains the decree.</p>
