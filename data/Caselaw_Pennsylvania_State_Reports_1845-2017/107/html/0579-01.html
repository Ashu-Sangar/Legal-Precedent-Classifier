Patterson, dated September 9th, 1797. Thomas B. Patterson conveyed the same to Samuel Ewalt by deed dated September 17th, 1803, and Samuel Ewalt sold his interest in the same to James Gil-lam and John Nickle by articles of agreement dated August 27th, 1814. James Gillam got into the possession of the entire premises, and remained in possession up to the time of his death, preceding which he made his will, which is recorded in Allegheny county in the Register’s office, in Will book No. 6, page 33, in which he appointed James Payne executor of his will, who proceeded and obtained a patent on Rayburn’s warrant for the heirs or devisees of James Gillam, dated February 23d, 1847, and having' obtained a patent for the same, said Payne also obtained a quit claim to himself from the heirs of John Nickle, deceased, dated April 24th, 1847, and then said Payne, executor of the will of said James Gillam sold by <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>deed dated. March 24th, 1848, the property of said James Gillam to William A. Payne, a part of which plaintiff claims is the property in controversy in this suit. When James Payne applied for a patent he employed Mr. Hastings to survey the property in order to get a description of it, and said surveyor, in the presence of the two chain carriers, Joshua Nickle and Joseph Payne, who were directed to carry the chain and measure the distance along the line of Samuel Wilson’s until it reached the line of Samuel and Isaac Large, across a portion of Peter’s Greek, and that they then ran along the line of said Samuel and Isaac Large to tlio land of Hugh Kennedy, and from the point where the Large line met the Kennedy line; thence along the Kennedy line until it reaches the Páyne line, while the patent calls for the adjoiners, Wilson and Large. The courses and distances in the patent will not meet, nor do they roach the Large line in any one place, showing plainly that the surveyor returned to the surveyor’s office a different survey from that which he ran on the ground. While the survey that the surveyor returned is marked on the ground, it is not the survey that was made for James Payne, executor of James Gillam, by said surveyor; consequently, the line which is described in the patent and marked on the ground is <em>not the </em>line of the survey made on the ground for James Payne, executor of James Gillam, deceased. In the trial of the cause the testimony of Joshua Nickle was read in evidence, which evidence showed that Mrs. Howard purchased but about three acres from James Gillam, and that being the case the Howard claim is derived from tlio Gillam claim from the Commonwealth, and the defendants are estopped from denying the Gillam claim, which is now the claim of William A. Payne. The testimony of Joseph Payne and Nickle agreed as to the location of the line surveyed on the ground by Hastings, and they both stated that the line that Hastings surveyed and which they claimed was the line run by Hastings on the ground, and that said line ran along Wilson’s line until it reached the line of Samuel and Isaac Large, aud thence along the line of Isaac and Samuel Large until it reached the Kennedy line, and from that point on the Large line along the Kennedy line until it reached the Payne line. The warrant called for all the land included within the boundaries of the Wilson line, the Large line and the Kennedy line, which would include and contain the land now in controversy. The court below, notwithstanding these facts, ordered a compulsory nonsuit to be entered, thereby depriving plaintiff the opportunity of going to the jury on the facts as to there being a mistake or a fraud perpetrated on the said James Payne, executor, by the return of the surveyor to the land office.”</p>
