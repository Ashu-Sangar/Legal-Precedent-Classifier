Railroad Company to build a short elevated railroad, from its terminus at the foot of Grant street on the Monongahela River, along the riyer front, over that portion of the highway known as “ Monongahela Wharf,” between Grant street and Smithflold street in said city. Said ordinance was passed in pursuance of an Act of Assembly approved April 15th, 1869, entitled “An Act to authorize the Select and Common Councils of the City of Pittsburgh to vacate streets and alleys in said city.” In a suit in equity by a property owner to enjoin the building of said elevated railroad: 1.

      <em>Held, </em>however, that a certain Act of April 1st, 1868 (P. L. 547), which authorized saidP. &amp; C.

      <em>Held, </em>further, that if a warrant for said ordinance were otherwise wanting, it would be found in the subsequent general Act of June 4th, 1874 (P. L. 282), which authorized and ratified contracts between cities and railroad companies for the re-location, changing or elevating oE railroads within such cities.</p>

The definition of a “branch” railroad, under said Act of 1868, does not depend upon either its length or direction. A branch of a railroad is a section of railroad, which may be an offshoot from the main road, or a direct extension from the terminus. The necessity for such branches, and their direction, rest in the will and discretion of the president and directors of the corporation by which they are to be constructed. Western PennsylvaniaR.R. Co.’s Appeal, 3 Out. 155, approved.</p>

Would it be a branch if it were a mile long, and not a branch if it is five hundred feet long. Who has established <em>length </em>as a criterion of a branch railroad ? Is it not a branch because it is elevated? Who has said that a branch must be on the surface of the ground? Is it not a branch because it extends from the present terminus of our main line to and into a new passenger depot ? Why must a branch not extend to a new passenger station erected for the accommodation of the public traveling by the old main line ?

Does the purpose to reach a private factory make it a branch, and to reach a public depot, make it not a branch ?

    <p id="b576-4" data-blocks='[["BL_576.6",576,[222,510,1172,1878]]]'>It seems from the statement of facts which has been submitted to us, that the Pittsburgh and Connellsville 'Railroad Company, acting under and in accordance with an ordinance of the common and select councils of the city of Pittsburgh, is about to extend the line of its road from its present station on the eastern side of Grant street, along and upon the Monongahela wharf, to the' eastern side of Smithfield street. In view of*the rapidly increasing traffic of this road, it has been deemed advisable, both by the company and the city councils, that it should be thus extended, and a new passenger station built over the said wharf, yet in such a manner, nevertheless, as not to obstruct the passage of ordinary vehicles to and from the river. To prevent this the appellants, who are owners of property fronting upon Water street and this public landing, filed the bill which gives rise to the present controversy. It is admitted that the proposed work will result in damage, at least of an incidental character, to the complainants, hence, their right to maintain this bill, in the absence of a superior or countervailing right on part of the defendant, is not disputed. The question then is: under what authority does the Railroad Companjr assume to occupy the public wharf or thoroughfare in question ? The answer of the appellee is, first; that such authority is conferred upon it by the ordinance above mentioned, and by the Act of the 15th of April, 1869, which empowers the city councils to contract with the three railroad companies therein mentioned, or either of them, for the vacation and closing up of the whole or any portion of any street or alley in the said city. But we do not agree with the proposition that this Act at all applies to the case in hand. Our dissent is not founded upon the objection that the ground in question may not be embraced under the term “ street,” but because the design proposed does not require the vacation or closing up of the whole or any part of a street, but simply the occupation in common with the public of part of a city highway called the “ Monongahela Wharf.” This no more requires vacation than did the occupation of Liberty street by the railroad tracks now in use upon it. Neither is it necessary in order to warrant the action of the city councils, and the proposed occupancy by the defendant, that the latter should first acquire the property adjacent to the intended extension. The Act of 1869 does not, therefore, sustain the assumption of the appellee, and had it nothing more substantial upon which to ground its claim there could be no place found for it in a court of equity.</p>

We cannot, however, see how this becomes a material question in the present controversy; for if this corporation has the power to extend its line over the wharf, then the contract between it and the city authorities is a matter which concerns themselves only, and with which third parties cannot be allowed to interfere.</p>

We think it is. We cannot agree that the definition of such a structure shall depend either upon its length or direction. If the projection of a completed road for one square is too short for a branch, then, what distance will be required to <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>allow the use of this term. The question involves in itself its own absurdity. The mistake is found in giving too narrow a definition to the word “branch.” According to Worcester it may mean, “ any distinct article or portion ; a section ; a subdivision.” But if for the word “ branch ” we use “ section ” the subject under discussion is relieved of all possible obscurity. In like manner are we delivered from hesitancy in the matter of direction; that is, whether we are to regard the word “ branch ” as merely an offshoot of the main road, or whether we may apply it to a direct extension from the terminus, since the substitution of the word “ section ” dissipates anything like doubt on this score. Moreover the case of the Western Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s Appeal 3 Out. 155, is in principle so like the case in hand that it may be regarded as having settled the question we are now considering. This case was ruled under the 9th section of the ^.ct of April 4th, 1868, the language of which is, in all material particulars, similar to the Act conferring branching powers upon the defendant corporation. In commenting upon this part of the statute, Mr. Justice Stebbett, who delivered the opinion of this court in the case cited, says : “ The main contention of the appellant was that the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad Company has no authority to extend its road west of the eastern line of Sandusky street, because its predecessors in title had located, marked, and determined the route of the Road, and by accepting the ordinance granting the right of way to the east line of Sandusky street, had selected and finally fixed that part of its western terminus; and because the appellee had completed the road to that point and there fixed its terminal depot.The branching power given by the 9th section of the Act of 1868, is sufficiently broad and comprehensive to authorize the construction of the road in question as a branch, and there is no valid reason why it may not be constructed from the terminus as well as from any other point of the main line of the road.”</p>
