A., one of the assignees, sought to revive the same as to his share therein, by issuing a scire facias, in which, besides other variations, the amount oi the debt stated was different from the original judgment. B. et al., assignees of other portions of the original judgment, more than five years after the entry of said judgment, filed a suggestion, under the term and number of A.’s sei.'fa., that á judgment of revival be entered for the amount of their collective shares, which was accordingly entered. The court afterwards decided that A.’s scire facias was ineffectual, owing to the variance between it and the original judgment.</p>

B. Gratz, administrator of Christiana Ferrence and thirteen others, who were the persons to whom the State Bank had assigned parts of the $20,000 remaining due on the Bank's judgment of $28,120.72 against George Winters, No. 145, August Term, 1877, after entering the credit of $10,264 thereon.</p>

This sum of $16,532.95 was then apportioned among the said assignees of judgment No. 145, August Term, 1877, and before the Auditors, F. M. Ott, and LeRoy J. Wolfe, Esquires, appointed to distribute the proceeds of Winters’s real estate (as set out in Dietrich’s Appeal, <em>supra) </em>these said assignees claimed the fund by virtue of the revival judgment of $16,582.95, on the ground that Dietrich’s sci. fa. to No. 42, August Term, 1882, continued the lien of the entire original judgment.</p>

Much that was said in that case is applicable here. The appellants took no step towards the revival of the judgment within five years from its date. After the five 3rears had expired they came into court and attempted to take advantage of the writs issued by Mary J. Dietrich and Catharine Creamer. They did not ask to amend those writs; indeed it is difficult to see what standing they would have had to amend writs to which they were not parties; but they filed a suggestion upon which an additional judgment was entered October 7th, 1882, for $16,532.95. But the original proceedings to revive, as we have seen, were abortive. The appellants might have disregarded them, and by issuing a proper writ within five years have revived the judgment and continued the lien. But they allowed the five years to slip by and then attempted to save their lien by tacking their suggestion to a worthless writ. It needs no argument to show that this cannot be done.</p>
    <p id="b202-8" data-blocks='[["BL_202.8",202,[243,1808,1181,648]],["BL_203.1",203,[185,438,1173,130]]]'>It was contended, however, (see 3d Assignment) that there was no necessity to revive the judgment; that the rights of the parties were fixed as of the date of the assignment, and that under Miller’s Appeal, 11 Casey 481, the equitable ownership of the assigned property passed to the creditors. That it did so pass may be conceded. But it passed to the general creditors, subject so far as the real estate is concerned, to the liens held by particular creditors. This gave the latter an advantage or priority over the general creditors. This advantage they could retain by reviving their judgments, and in no other way. To hold that the liens against a man’s real estate may be continued after five years without revival, because of his assignment for the benefit of creditors, would be substantially to repeal one Act of Assembly and enact a new one.
