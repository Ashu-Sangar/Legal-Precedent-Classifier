J., 1782. It was held, “ the signing of a deed is now the material part of the execution ; the seal has become a mere form, and a written, or ink seal, as it is called, is good.” In Liggett <em>v. </em>Long, 7 Har. 499, the deed under which the defendant in an ejectment defended was unsigned, but sealed; it Avas rejected as evidence of title, but was admitted as evidence of" a sale on which to found a claim for improvements by defendant. In Watson <em>v. </em>Jones, (4 Nor. 117) Justice GORDON said: “ Technically there can be no deed without a seal, for it is the seal which makes the deed; nevertheless we well, know that a valid conveyance of land may be made without it [that is, an actual seal]. As long ago as McDill <em>v. </em>McDill, (1 Dali. 63), it was held that the signing of a deed was the material part of its execution, and that the act of sealing had become a mere form.” Thus the “ seal ” of to-day does not answer the purpose of the impressed wax of the olden time; still it is held sufficient for compliance with form, because a signing is now required from which Avhen subscribed and authenticated the actual sealing may be, presumed: Long <em>v. </em>Ramsay, 1 S. &amp; R. 73; Miller <em>v. </em>Binder, 4 Cas. 489. The Statute of Frauds requires the signing as well as the sealing. That statute requires such signature in the following among other cases: the assignment, grant or surrender of all leases, estates, or interests in lands, tenements, and hereditaments, not being copyholds. This certainly seems to include all assurances by deed, though the opinion that it does so is by no <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>means universal: Ooocb <em>v. </em>Goodman, 2 Q.

A deed purporting to convey the separate estate of a married woman in Pennsylvania must be executed in conformity with the Act of February 24, 1770 (Purcl. Dig. 460, pi. 18), which provides that to dispose of and convey the estate of the wife in lands, “it shall and may be lawful for the said <em>husband and wife </em>to <em>malte, </em>seal deliver and <em>execute </em>any grant, bargain and sale, lease, release, feofment, deed, conveyance, or assurance in the law whatsoever .and after <em>such execution to appear </em>..... <em>and, to acknowledge </em>the said deed or conveyance, etc.,” followed by the separate examination of the wife. “ Our statutory provision for a wife’s conveyance by joinder with her husband, and acknowledgment on separate examination, is a substitute for a fine, by which alone the common law allowed her to part with her land.” Gibson, C. J., in Schrader <em>v. </em>Docker, 9 Barr, 14. The separate deed of a married woman conveying her real estate is void, even though her husband had previously deserted her. And the Act of 1848 confers no power upon a feme covert to convey unless her husband join in the deed : Thorndell <em>v. </em>Morrison, 1 Casey 326; Pettit <em>v. </em>Fretz, 9 <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dallas%2063" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Dallas 63">Id. 118</a>; Trimmer <em>v. </em>Heagy, 4 Harris, 484; Peck <em>v. </em>Ward, 6 <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dallas%2063" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Dallas 63">Id.</a> 506 ; Dunham <em>v. </em>Wright, 8 P.

It is not stated as one of the things necessarily incident to a deed at common law: Co. Litt. L. 1, C. 5, Sec. 40, 35 b. A due sealing thereof was deemed a sufficient execution. This, however, was by reason of a very general inability to read or write: 1 Reeves’s Hist. of Eng. Law 184, in note. In 1 Blackstone’s Com. 305, it is said to be requisite that the party whose deed it is should “ seal, and now, in most cases, I apprehend should sign it also.” Pie proceeds to state that under Saxon rule seals were not of much use in England. Their method, for such as could write, was to subscribe their names, and whether they could write or not to affix the sign of the cross. On the conquest by the Normans they introduced waxen seals only, instead of the English method of writing their names and signing with the sign of the cross. These seals, however, generally had specific devices to distinguish them from each other.</p>

The sufficiency of such a form of seal,when the deed is signed by the maker, was affirmed in Long <em>v. </em>Ramsay, 1 S. &amp; R. 72. It is true in Maule <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Barr 329, Mr. Chief Justice Gibson did say that he did not entirely concur in what was said in those cases, that the signing of a deed was the material part of its execution, yet he admitted it to be the most powerful evidence of the joint or separate .ensealing thereof. In that case, however, the question was whether covenant could be maintained against the grantee in a deed when he had neither signed nor sealed it, but it concluded, “ in witness whereof the said parties have hereunto interchangeably set their hands and seals the day and year first above written,” and was signed and sealed by the grantor alone.</p>

On the contrary, in Watson <em>v. </em>Jones, 4 Norris 117, McDill <em>v. </em>McDill is cited approvingly by Mr. Justice Gokdoít. The recognition of any rule which dispenses with the necessity of <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>the signature of the grantor would be fraught with great mischief.

This Act requires both husband and wife to join in the conveyance to pass the real estate of the latter. Its directions are imperative : Trimmer <em>v. </em>Heagy, 4 Harris 484. What specific acts must they both do ? The Statute answers, “ make, seal, deliver, execute and acknowledge the deed.” Sealing and delivering are not the only requisites which must precede the acknowledgment. They must first make the deed. This clearly imports the signing' thereof. Until that is done it would be a forced construction of this language to say they had made a deed. The manifest meaning of this word, in the connection in which it is used, is that the deed shall be duly prepared, and be signed by them. The sealing is referred to as a separate act.</p>

The Act of 1848 confers no power upon a feme covert to make a valid conveyance of her real estate unless her husband joins in the deed: Thorndell <em>v. </em>Morrison, 1 Casey 326; Stoops <em>v. </em>Blackford, 3 Id. 213 ; Glidden <em>v. </em>Strupler, 2 P. F. Smith 400 ; Dunham <em>v. </em>Wright, 3 Id. 167. She has no capacity to contract for the sale of her real estate, nor to convey it otherwise than in the precise statutory mode conferring the power: Innis <em>v. </em>Templeton, 14 Norris 262.</p>
