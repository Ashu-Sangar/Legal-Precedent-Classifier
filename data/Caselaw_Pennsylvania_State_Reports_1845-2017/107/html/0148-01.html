    <p class="summary" id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.7",170,[219,1077,1176,897]]]'>This raises the question whether the receipts of defendant derived from its business, conducted as above stated, were, within the intent and meaning of said Act, paid to it “ for transportation; ” it not being pretended by any one that they ■were paid either for tolls, telegraph, or express business. A careful examination of section seven of the Act will show that its scope extends beyond companies engaged directly in the business of “transporting freight or passengers.” It imposes the tax upon “every company.leasing to or from another corporation, company, or limited partnership any ..... device for the transportation of freight or passengers ; ” it includes “ any palace car and sleeping car company,” and it provides that “ where the works of one corporation, company, or limited partnership are leased to or operated by another corporation, company, or limited partnership, “ they shall adjust the taxes between them, but “ the Commonwealth shall first look to the corporation, company, or limited partnership operating the works,” and if the tax is paid by them the lessor company “ shall not be held-liable under this section for any tax upon the proportion of said receipts received by it as rental for the use of said works.”</p>

It is the owner or lessee of the cars for which consideration of the receipt of the ordinary fare from those who <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>use tliem, the railroad companies agree to furnish the motive power to draw them. And for the consideration of the use of this motive power, the defendant agrees that the railroad companies may receive the ordinary fare. But the payment of this does not entitle the passenger to be transported in defendant’s cars, nor do the railroad companies undertake so to transport him. For this privilege he must pay an additional price to the defendant, and if this did not entitle him to be so transported, he would never pay it. The main purpose of the passenger in taking his seat or sleeping-berth in defendant’s ear, is to be transported. The sitting on one of their chairs — more comfortable, perhaps, than a seat in the first-class railroad car — or lying in one of their berths, is a mere incident. The passenger is influenced by precisely the same motives and feelings as be is who pays full fare, and travels in a first-class car, instead of taking second-class at a reduced rate. In either case the price paid is primarily for transportation, the only difference being that in one case a higher price is paid for better accommodations by the way. If llie railroad companies owned the palace and sleeping cars, and charged those passengers who chose to travel in them a higher rate of fare than those paid who travelled in their other ears, no one would think of claiming that the sum realized from the difference of rate, was not received “ for transportation,” but that the transaction is divided between the two cannot change its essential character.</p>

It manufactures and owns, or leases, cars known as sleeping coaches and hotel cars, which it permits to be used upon railroads. It has no right of eminent domain, no railroad or motive power. The railroad company alone transports the passengers. The Pullman Company is simply a hotel company on wheels. It provides lodging and rest for the weary, and meals for the hungry. It does not make any contract to carry a passenger. It will not even sell him a berth until he shows that he has paid the railroad company for his transportation. The Pullman Company receives pay only for the incident. Tn case of an accident to a passenger caused by a defect in a Pullman palace car in which be is travelling the railroad company is alone held liable, for the car must be turned over to that company in good order, and be approved by its general superintendent, and if it gets out of order it is the fault of the railroad company. The Act of 1879 does not tax receipts incident to transportation, but only those for transportation. These receipts are derived by tbe railroad company, which does pay the tax thereon.</p>

It is not upon the property or franchise of the corporation, but, we contend, upon the business done within the state, measured in amount by the extent of such business or the degree to which its franchise is exercised in its transaction: State Tax on Railway Gross Receipts, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Wall.%20294" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="15 Wall. 294">15 Wall. 294</a>. If it is “ doing business ” within the state, it is sufficiently here, both in person and property, to bring it within the taxing power of the state in respect to the business done within her borders. In the transaction of such business it enjoys the protection of the Commonwealth, and is subject to liability to taxation so long as the tax is not laid directly upon the subjects of commerce, but upon the business, measured by the extent to which the franchise is exercised.</p>

    <p id="b175-6" data-blocks='[["BL_175.8",175,[151,1262,1177,605]]]'>The Act of June 7th, 1879, sec. 7, P. L. 112, imposes the same rate of tax upon the gross receipts from business done within this state by foreign corporations as upon corporations created by this Commonwealth. No discrimination is made against the foreign — none of their receipts are liable to the tax, except for business done within this state, and all the receipts of the domestic <em>from </em>their entire business, whomever it may be done, are liable. There is no attempt in the statute to exclude foreign corporations as carriers of passengers, or to charge any corporations for the privilege of engaging in commerce. This statute differs in some respects from the Act of March 29lh, 1881, in Indiana, which was held to be violative of the Constitution of the United States by the Circuit Court, District of Indiana.</p>
    <p id="b175-7" data-blocks='[["BL_175.9",175,[143,1870,1178,523]]]'>A state has power to tax the gross receipts of transportation .companies, incorporated under its laws, engaged in the business of transporting passengers and freight out of, into, through, and within the state: State Tax on Foreign-held Bonds, <a href="/us/82/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="15 Wall. 300" data-case-ids="3424279" data-case-paths="/us/82/0300-01">15 Wall. 300</a>. Upon the authority of that case, the court below ruled that the Act of 1879 was not in conflict with any provision of the Constitution of the United States. The statute should be beld valid by the state courts unless it is palpably unconstitutional, for their decision that the statute is invalid is final. We are not convinced that it is plainly unconstitutional, and, therefore, affirm the judgment on the opinion of the learned judge of the Common Pleas.</p>
