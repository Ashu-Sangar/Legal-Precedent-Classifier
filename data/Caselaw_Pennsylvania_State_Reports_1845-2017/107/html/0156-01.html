The argument is that its cars are personal property, and as they are not permanently located in this state, but pass into, through, and out of it, this personal property has no taxable <em>situs </em>in Pennsylvania, and could not be taxed specifically in any given .locality, and therefore it is contended, as the tax on capital stock is a tax on the property in which that capital is invested, the latter cannot be taxed.</p>

It would be carrying the principle to a dangerous extreme so to decide. We hold, therefore, that the proportion of the capital stock of the defendant invested and used in Pennsylvania is taxable under these Acts, and that the amount of the tax -may be properly ascertained by taking as a bails the proportion which the 'number of miles operated by defendant in this state bears to the whole number of miles operated by it, without regard to the question where any particular car or cars were used.

For tlie convenience of the travelling public, by avoiding repeated changes of ears upon connecting lines and over long routes <em>of </em>railroad, and to avoid inconvenience incident to the maintenance of this business under two different managements, it was found expedient, in 1870, to enter into an agreement whereby Pullman’s Palace Car Company became the lessee of the one hundred and nineteen cars of the Central Transportation Company, and undertook to perform the contracts of the latter company with the various railroads in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. By that contract the <em>ownership </em>of the ears remained in the Central Transportation Companj’, and that company has paid tax to the state oil its entire capital stock, <em>i. e. </em>on its entire property, which iucludes tax on these cars. To tax these cars again in the name of the Pullman company is double taxation not contemplated by the Act of Assembly.

The coaches of the company are its property. They are operated within this state. They are daily passing from one end of the state to the other. They are used in performing the functions for .which the corporation was created. The fact that they also are operated in other states cannot wholly exempt them from taxation here.
