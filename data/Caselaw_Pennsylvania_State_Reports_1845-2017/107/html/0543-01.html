The proviso to that Act is express and mandatory, making notice to the Auditor General in all cases an essential prerequisite to the entertaining by the Common Pleas of any proceeding for the change of name of any corporation.

The question of jurisdiction, now raised for the first time, depends solely on a matter of fact — whether or not notice was given to the Auditor General. That question of fact was for the Court of Common Pleas, and if it had been raised in that court it would have been adjudicated, and made a part of the record. The presumption is in favor of the regularity of the proceedings of courts of record, and no evidence has been ot-ean now be produced to impeach that presumption. A mere suggestion of the party complaining, in relation to a question of fact, of which the law requires no record to be made, is insufficient. The application was made to amend the charter and change the name, not under the Act of 1869, but under the old general law and its supplements authorizing the Common Pleas to charter associations for literary, charitable or religious purposes, and to amend such charters, &amp;c.</p>

      <a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>The taxing Acts require all <em>business </em>corporations to 1‘egister their name in the Auditor General’s office, and to make annual reports to that officer, and churches are exempt by law from taxation. The purpose of the Act of April 20th, 1869, was to maintain in the office of the Auditor General a correct list or record of business corporations for the purpose of taxation. Registration in the office of the Auditor General was a prerequisite of doing business within the Commonwealth. -Such corporations might avoid taxation by a mere change of name, effected by a proceeding in a county court, without some such legal requirement as the Act of 1869 imposes. But it cannot be presumed that notice of a change of name of a church corporation, not subject to taxation, was intended to be required. Corporations. for religious, charitable and literary purposes, may be incorporated and maintained without notice to the executive or to the Auditor General; therefore it would be unreasonable to suppose that the legislature intended to class them with business corporations in the matter of notice to the Auditor General of a change of name merely. But we submit that the amendment of the charter, involving a change of name also in this case, was authorized by the Act of October 18, 1840 (supplemental to the Act’ of 1791), and that the provisions of the Act of April 20th, 1869, do not apply.</p>

With the evidence and those considerations which influenced the court in making up its decree, we have nothing to do. The power of the Court of Common Pleas to change the name of a corporation is found in the first section of the Act of April 20th, 1869; previously to the date of this Act, it had no authority to entertain proceedings for such purpose. This power is necessarily special, and conferred by legislative enactment, for in the general or common law jurisdiction of that court is found no power either to erect corporations, alter their charters or change their names. Now, the Act above referred to thus provides: “No proceedings for such purpose,” that is, for the change of the name of a corporation, “ shall be entertained by the courts, until notice of such application is given to the Auditor General, and proof of such fact is produced to the courts.” ■ But in looking over the records of this case, we discover no intimation of a compliance with this provision. Did <a id="p547" href="#p547" data-label="547" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*547</a>we find a statement to that effect either in the petition or decree, it would be regarded as sufficient, for as has been already said, with the proofs we have nothing to do; we look only at the record. But therein we find no such statement, and without it the court’s jurisdiction nowhere appears. We cannot entertain the idea, so strongly urged in behalf of the defendant in error, that this part of the statute is merely directory, and that a compliance with it need not appear, and our dissent from this proposition is founded upon the fact that the language of the statute is imperative; in the absence of conformity with its provision, there is an absolute prohibition of the action of the court. “No proceeding for such purpose shall be entertained; ” the Act confers the jurisdiction, and by the Act that jurisdiction is positively limited to such cases only in which notice has been given to the Auditor General.</p>
    <p id="b567-4" data-blocks='[["BL_567.4",567,[139,1064,1168,852]]]'>It will thus be seen that the power of the Common Pleas is confined to a particular class of cases, and unless the case under consideration appears, from the record, to be within the statutory class, there is nothing to support the jurisdiction of' the court, and its decree must necessarily be invalid. It is very true, that outside of the command of the statute, there does not seem to be much reason why this provision should be applied to religious and other charitable corporations, whose charters are not filed in the Auditor General’s office, but in the office of the .Recorder of Deeds of the county in which the corporation has been established. Why the Auditor Gem oral should have notice of the change of the name of a corporation of whose charter he has no official information, is, something for which a reason cannot easily be given. But, whether wise or unwise, such is the statute, and we can neither amend nor disregard it. Whilst, therefore, everything else in' the record before us seems to be regular and unexceptionable,, in this, an exhibition of the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter under consideration, it is fatally defective, and: consequently the decree founded upon it must be reversed.</p>
    <p id="b567-5" data-blocks='[["BL_567.5",567,[397,1917,902,78]]]'>It is now ordered that the decree of the court: below be reversed and set aside.</p>
