In my judgment it did not continue. The arrangement made between the parties was (as I understand it and so instruct you upon the law of the case) that while possession of this propert}r was not taken by the plaintiffs in such a way as to relieve the company of <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>all care of it — not merely as common carrier but in any other aspect — that by ail arrangement the custody was to continue in the defendant company for a short period of time, at the convenience of the plaintiffs, because for the reason stated they did not feel disposed at the time to take the goods into their actual custody. Therefore, I regard the relation subsisting between the property of these plaintiffs and the defendant company, as warehousemen ; not as common carriers.</p>

Not an extraordinary degree of care nor a very slight degree, but such care as an ordinarily prudent man would give to his own property under the circumstances — dependent upon the circumstances, upon the surroundings; because that care might be greater under one state of facts than under another. Apparently there was nothing in this case to provoke any undue care or more than the ordinary care of a prudent man. It was a deposit upon a sufficient wharf in the city of New York at a customary place for the deposit of baggage and freight remaining there under cover, in the care and under the supervision of a number of watchmen and other employees.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b516-8" data-blocks='[["BL_516.8",516,[259,1338,1171,557]]]'>A. That point I affirm. In my judgment, at most, it was but a breach of the arrangement, a breach of the contract if you choose, between the plaintiffs and the defendant eompanjr, and the mere failure in itself would not be negligence unless there is something about the surroundings which would indicate a want of care in not transferring. The leaving of the property upon the Inman pier was not, what is called in law the proximate cause of the loss if there be more, than one. The proximate cause of' this loss was, clearly, the fire. As Mr. Shiras has illustrated, the failure to comply with that arrangement on the part of the company might have been the saving of the goods if the fire had occurred upon the other pier instead of upon this.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-9" data-blocks='[["BL_516.9",516,[256,1894,1170,384]]]'>We look only <em>to </em>the proximate cause, not to the remote cause, and the proximate cause was not the leaving of the property there, but the fire, and I instruct you that the leaving of it there was not of itself such an act of negligence as would make the defendant liable, and was not, in my judgment, negligence at all, in the legal meaning of the term. So that, I think, you can safely dismiss from your minds anything in relation to that conversation, whether the terms were used about risk or not, or what the arrangement was.</p>

Not that they shall absolutely show you just how the fire occurred, because that might or might not be practicable, but the surroundings of the tire, as, in the absence of evidence of the loss by fire, by theft or otherwise, there would be nothing before us to show that it was not the act of the defendant, itself. It may have converted the property to its own use or it might have been negligent, and in that way be liable, notwithstanding the loss did occur from a casualty, which, properly explained and understood, would relieve it from responsibility. It has-shown, possibly to your satisfaction, that the property was destroyed by fire upon the pier. The witness Smith stated' that ho had seen the property upon the pier immediately before the fire, that it had not been removed and that the pier and its contents were destroyed. So that you will probably be satisfied that the goods were lost upon that pier and that the-loss was by fire. You then turn to the surroundings of the-fire and ascertain whether there is evidence about it which indicates a want of proper care on the part of the defendant, producing that fire. Was it the result of negligence? Does, it appear from all the surroundings ? If it does not appear, the company is not liable for the loss that bas occurred to the plaintiffs. It was one of the misfortunes sucb as we all suffer in this world. Tt does not follow because property is lost in the custody of somebody else that that somebody else is necessarily responsible for the value of the goods. It does not follow that where an accident occurs to one, that necessarily somebody is responsible for that accident. It must be determined by the circumstances. This defendant company would not be responsible unless the facts indicate that it were guilty of some negligence, the want of ordinary prudence and. care which persons give to their property. If you should find that to be the state of facts and fail to find this want of.' prudence and care, this uegligenee, then your verdict would, be for the defendant.</p>

The plaintiff, however, gave no evidence of negligence other than the alleged breach of an alleged agreement to remove the goods prior to the time when the fire occurred. The burden of proof to show negligence— gross negligence, we contend — was on the plaintiff. The judge ruled that the breach of agreement to remove, if there was an agreement and a breach, would not of itself constitute negligence, but left it vaguely to the jury to find negligence “in the surroundings,” if they could. There was no evidence that defendants were bailees for hire, but on the contrary that if bailees they were gratuitous bailees, and the judge should have instructed the jury that in such case they were only liable for'gross negligence. The judge erred in saying that the plaintiff’s passage money and freight for extra baggage were legal considerations for a subsequent undertaking to permit the plaintiff’s goods to remain on the pier. Defendants had a clear right to refuse such permission, because they did not receive compensation therefor. We submit that upon the completion of the voyage and landing of the goods, where the plaintiff took possession of them and superintended the custom house inspection, there was a complete delivery to the plaintiff.</p>

They differ as to some of the terms of the arrangement; one alleging that on the same day the defendants were to move the goods to the National Pier, and put them under lock and key, and that nothing was said about the risk; tbo other, that nothing was said about moving the goods, and that tbe permit to leave them was expressly at the plaintiff’s risk. The jury were instructed that if they found the facts as alleged by the defendant, the law in relation thereto was correctly stated by the defendant’s counsel.</p>
    <p id="b519-8" data-blocks='[["BL_519.10",519,[142,2290,1169,174]],["BL_520.1",520,[258,441,1172,1022]]]'>Upon the facts as testified by tbe plaintiff, it is obvious that the defendants’ responsibility as common carrier ended with the arrangement for keeping the goods until called for by the plaintiff, and thenceforth the liability of the defendant was <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>that of a bailee for hire. It was the same as if the passenger had not called for his baggage within a reasonable time. A passenger must be allowed a reasonable time after arrival of his baggage to call for and take it away, and during such time the carrier continues responsible according to the strict rule of law relating to common carriers. When the liability as carrier ceases he holds the baggage under a modified liability. His duty to exercise care over the property remaining in his hands grows out of the original contract, and be is therefore bound to exercise ordinary care in keeping and preserving it; the original contract, though modified in respect to the degree of liability assumed from a reasonable time after the arrival of the goods, being understood to contemplate a possible delay, and to cover the delivery: Edwards on Bailments, § 90; Hutchinson on Carriers, §§ 708, 712; Burnell <em>v. </em>New York Central R. Co., <a href="/ny/45/0184-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="45 N.Y. 184" data-case-ids="2049751" data-case-paths="/ny/45/0184-01">45 N. Y. 184</a>. Where the contract is to carry goods by sea from port to port, it is the duty of the consignee to receive the goods out of the ship or at the wharf. If they are not accepted by the consignee the carrier should put them in a place of safety; and when he has so done he is no longer liable on his contract of affreightment: Richardsons. Goddard, 23 Plow. 28. So, a passenger should call as soon as practicable for his baggage, but if he does not, the carrier is bound to care for it or send it to a fit storehouse.</p>
    <p id="b520-4" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[258,1472,1169,598]]]'>The arrangement between the plaintiff and defendant must be considered in connection with their original contract. There was no actual delivery of the property to the plaintiff; on the contrary, the defendant promised to keep it at the instant when delivery might have been tendered. The learned judge of the Common Pleas rightly ruled that there was no such delivery as relieved the defendant from the care of the property, and that from the time of the promise the property remained in the defendant’s keeping under a modified liability, as that of a warehouseman. Hence, the third assignment of error is not sustained. Nor is the first. The declaration, it is true, sets forth the contract of the defendant as a common carrier, and though it is not liable as an insurer of the goods, its modified liability grows out of that contract.</p>
    <p id="b520-5" data-blocks='[["BL_520.5",520,[255,2071,1167,384]],["BL_521.1",521,[157,421,1166,948]]]'>A common carrier is regarded as an insurer of the safety of the goods against all losses except such as may be caused by the acts of God or the public enemy; and exceptions may arise from the fault of the owner, or from some inherent defect in the goods, or upon an express contract that the carrier shall not be liable for loss from a specified cause. In all such cases the burden is upon the carrier to establish the fact which will bring his case within an exception to the rule. When the carrier has shown that the loss was occasioned by <a id="p501" href="#p501" data-label="501" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*501</a>a cause from tbe liability of which be is protected by law or by contract, it will not be presumed that his negligence contributed to the loss, but the presumption will be, in the absence of proof to establish his negligence, that the carrier has done his duty; and if it has been shown that the loss resulted from such cause, without also having shown that the carrier was negligent, the burden of proving his negligence devolves upon tbe plaintiff. This rule seems to be supported by a decided preponderance of authority: Hutchinson on Carriers, §§ 765-767. It has been established in New York and Pennsylvania, and considered as if applicable to the case of a bailee who receives goods to store for a compensation. Where a carrier, by contract, was exonerated from a loss by five, lie was field liable only as a bailee for hire; and it was decided that the bailor could not recover upon simple proof of the destruction of tbe goods by fire, be must go farther and show that tbe loss was caused by tbe negligence of the bailee: Lamb <em>v. </em>Camden &amp; Amboy R. &amp; Tr. Co., <a href="/ny/46/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="46 N.Y. 271" data-case-ids="2052630" data-case-paths="/ny/46/0271-01">46 N. Y. 271</a>; Farnhm <em>v. </em>Camden <em>&amp; </em>Amboy R. Co., <a href="/pa/55/0053-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="55 Pa. 53" data-case-ids="1470740" data-case-paths="/pa/55/0053-01">55 Pa. St. 53</a>. In tbe latter case it was said: “ That where a bailee accounts for a loss in a way not to implicate himself in a charge of negligence, this is a sufficient defence, unless the plaintiff proves negligence.”</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[155,1370,1165,385]]]'>The plaintiff contends that these and like cases are where the liability was limited by contract, and that the rule should not be extended. But such limitation was held to operate no further than to put the carrier in the place of a bailee for hire. There is no reason why the rule should not apply to all bailees who are only liable for the loss of goods when the loss is caused by their negligence, especially to carriers who may become subject to a modified liability after the termination of their strict liability as carriers.</p>
    <p id="b521-7" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[157,1756,1161,429]]]'>The defendant prayed instruction : “ That if the jury find that the goods in question were discharged from the steamship and delivered to tbe plaintiff on the pier or wharf, and that said goods were subsequently left upon said pier, in the custody of the defendant’s employees to await the convenience of tlie plaintiff, and that the same were destroyed by fire, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.” As already remarked we are of opinion that the testimony did not warrant a finding that the defendant was a gratuitous bailee, and therefore this prayer was properly refused.</p>
    <p id="b521-8" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[153,2185,1164,257]],["BL_522.1",522,[229,414,1176,346]]]'>In showing that the goods were destroyed by a fire which burned property of the defendant, as well as of <em>the </em>plaintiff, the defendant did not show circumstances that warranted a finding that the fire was caused by the defendant’s negligence. Even if tbe circumstances in evidence were such as to leave it doubtful whether the fire was caused by the defendant’s <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>negligence the plaintiff could not recover. The jury must find the fact of negligence from evidence, and if the proofs leave the question in doubt, the burden being upon the plaintiff, he has failed to establish his right. Hence the prayer for instruction ought to have been affirmed, namely, that the defendant is not liable for the loss of the goods by fire unless the plaintiff proves, to the satisfaction of the jury, that the fire was occasioned by the neglect of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[229,760,1177,343]]]'>The plaintiff rested upon proof of a prima facie right. This was repelled by oral testimony which undoubtedly satisfied the jury that an accidental fire destroyed the pier and all the goods thereon including the plaintiff’s; and if it did, there not being evidence that the fire was caused by the defendant’s neglect, the verdict should have been for the defendant. But the fact was for the jury, and therefore the defendant’s fifth point was properly refused.</p>
    <p id="b522-5" data-blocks='[["BL_522.5",522,[490,1105,910,75]]]'>Judgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.</p>
    <p id="b522-6" data-blocks='[["BL_522.6",522,[490,1242,651,34]]]'>Same <em>versus </em>Elizabeth Smart.</p>
