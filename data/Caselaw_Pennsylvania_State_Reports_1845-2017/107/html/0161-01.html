Such payment of orders, the amounts of which were charged to the account of the maker, is not equivalent to a,n assignment of the labor claims so as to entitle the person paying the same to such preferred claim.</p>

Tbe orders were charged by Rheeling directly to Hurd, to whom he looked for payment. Rheeling could claim from the fund in court only through the <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>laborers who had liens against it, but Hurd was substituted as a debtor, and the amount of the orders charged up to the workmen by him. Hurd then owed nothing to the laborers, and Rheeling had accepted Hurd as his debtor. The latter was simply individually responsible to the former. This is the effect of the transaction as the Auditor understands it, and if he is right Rheeling must look alone for payment to Hurd. The Auditor is referred to the Philadelphia Trust Company’s Appeal, 2 W. N. C. p. 593. But that case does not decide the point in favor of Rheeling. Accordingly the claims thus presented are disallowed.”</p>
