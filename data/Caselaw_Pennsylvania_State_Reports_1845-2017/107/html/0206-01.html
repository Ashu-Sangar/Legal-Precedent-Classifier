Stover became sureties for stay of the judgment entered on said note without their knowledge or consent. They further averred that at the time said stay of execution was entered the amount of the judgment could have been realized by execution against George Stover, who, however, soon afterwards became insolvent. They therefore claimed, that as the interposition of Andrew S. and Samuel G. Stover as bail for stay of execution, for the sole benefit of the principal debtor, George Stover, had involved them, as sureties, in ultimate liability for the debt, which they had been compelled to pay under execution, they were entitled to be subrogated to the. plaintiff’s remedies, not only as against the principal debtor, but also as against Andrew S. and Samuel G.

I am of opinion that the plaintiffs, from what they have been able to make out, are not entitled to a verdict at your hands.Now it will not be contended that the fact that the money was not paid at the time of the legal stay of execution, but when the subsequent execution was brought against the defendants, a judgment against the Stovers puts the defendants in any better shape than they would have been if they had paid before the last judgment had been obtained, — the simple fact would not have put the defendants in better condition than if they had paid before the later judgment, and taken a transfer of that original judgment, and issued a <em>scire facias </em>against the sureties for the stay of execution. And since it could not be <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>contended that these defendants were liable by virtue of the terms of the recognizance — because by virtue of the very terms of the recognizance they were only to be liable in the event that the defendants did not pay, (and. the defendants had paid,) it must be said that they are liable because of some other reason ; and it is said that they are so liable, because by their act these sureties in the original judgment were prejudiced, — that by th.e intervention of the sureties for stay of execution, the original sureties in that judgment suffered or might have suffered harm; and upon that notion it is, that it is supposed the plaintiffs here have a right to look to the sureties for stay of execution. But I am of opinion that it is not in fact so, that the original sureties under the original judgment were prejudiced by the action of the bail for stay of execution entered. I am of opinion that if Mr. Stover procured his brothers to come there and become bail for the stay of execution for all the defendants, though it was without the knowledge or assent of the two defendants, Messrs. Forney and Wolff, that they were not and could not have been prejudiced thereby.Hence I have given my reasons for claiming the opinion that the plaintiffs ought not to be subrogated in this case to the rights of the original plaintiffs as against the defendants in this case, who were the sureties for stay of execution, and your verdict will therefore be for the defendants.”</p>

In Schnitzel’s Appeal the record of the judgment showed that Berg was^the principal debtor and Mast the surety; and the proof was that Schnitzel became bail for stay of execution at the request of Berg, for his sole protection and against the protest of Mast; and that Berg gave Schnitzel indemnity against the risk he thus took. It was clear that Schnitzel knew that he was becoming sponsor for Berg alone, and he protected himself accordingly. In the case at bar the record of the judgment shows that George Stover, James P. Wolff and Lewis S. Forney were joint and several debtors; and the proof is that the defendants here became bail for the stay of execution for <em>all </em>the defendants, without any indemnity from either of them, and without any knowledge of the relations of the defendants in the judgment, except what was shown by the record. It is clear that the defendants here did not know that in entering bail for stay they were imperilling any rights of Wolff or Forney, and they never dreamed that they were becoming sponsors for George Stover alone. They became bail for <em>all three defendants </em>willingly, and asked no indemnity. But in Schnitzel’s Appeal it was urged that Berg and Mast were bound by the <em>same </em>judgment, and as Schnitzel became bail for them jointly, that Mast by paying the judgment acquired no right of subrogation against him. The court (WOODWARD, C. J.), in delivering the opinion, say: “If the facts justified the position there would be considerable force in it, but the record of the original judgment showed that Berg was the principal debtor and Mast the surety, and the Auditor reports that Schnitzel became bail at Berg’s instance, &amp;c.” We submit that the facts in the case at bar are not only such as to “justify the position” that would have “ considerable force in it,” but they are such as fall within the principle underlying the decision of Schnitzel’s Appeal. The bail entered in the case at bar was on a joint and several judgment, for the benefit of <em>all </em>the defendants therein; without objection from any of them; and without indemnity or request for the same on the part of those who entered it. We submit, therefore, that neither by the terms of the recognizance of bail, nor on the ground of superior rights or equities, nor by the authority of decided cases, are the plaintiffs here entitled to judgment against the defendants.</p>

After the term of stay had expired, two of the defendants in the judgment, who are the present equitable plaintiffs, paid the same and now seek to collect the amount thereof out of the sureties on their recognizance. The court correctly instructed the jury to find for th.e defendants. They had no knowledge of the relation which the defendants in the original judgment bore to each other. When they entered into the recognizance they did not know that the present plaintiffs yere sureties. They therefore assumed the obligation, relying on the credit of all the defendants in that judgment.
