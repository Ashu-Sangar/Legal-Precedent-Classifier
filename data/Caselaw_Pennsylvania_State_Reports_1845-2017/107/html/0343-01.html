The property was bound by a recognizance in the Orphans’ Court for about $1,470, the annual interest on which, to wit: $87.88, was payable to Margaret Krise, widow of Henry Krise. At tlie time of the sale, to wit: October 1st, 1888, tbe interest was unpaid to the widow from tlie 29th of December, 1881. If the court be of the opinion that the total amount of interest from 29th of December, 1881, to October 1st, 1888, $151.69, should be paid to tbe widow, then judgment to be entered for defendant; but if the court be of the opinion that only one year’s interest, $87.88, and not for the fractional part of the year in addition, should be paid to the widow, then judgment to be entered for tlie plaintiff for $63.81.”</p>

The statute relating to partition provides that the widow’s purpart or share of the real estate shall be valued, and the same together with interest thereof shall be and remain charged upon the premises, and the legal interest thereof shall be annually paid by the person holding such real estate, to said widow during her life, and she may recover the same by distress or otherwise, as rents are recoverable.

And though the assignment of her <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>share may thus be made, she has an estate in the land, and it vests in her <em>eo instanti </em>the husband dies : Gourley <em>v. </em>Kinley, <a href="/pa/66/0270-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="66 Pa. 270" data-case-ids="432463" data-case-paths="/pa/66/0270-01">66 Pa.

    <p id="b365-4" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[145,910,1162,343]]]'>The law provides that the interest shall be paid to the widow annually. The estate being for life the interest stops at her death. “ For what becomes payable in her lifetime she may distrain, and so may her personal representative after her death, for she is substantially a tenant for life of a rent; ” but her personal representative cannot distrain for the interest which had accrued and was not in arrear at her decease : Henderson, Executor, <em>v. </em>Boyer, <a href="/pa/44/0220-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="44 Pa. 220" data-case-ids="484303" data-case-paths="/pa/44/0220-01">44 Pa.

    <p id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.5",365,[140,1255,1166,732]]]'>In view of the nature of the widow’s estate, her annual interest cannot be deemed merely as interest on money. Unlike the lien of a judgment, or most other liens, her estate is unaffected by a judicial sale of the land. A lien, like a judgment, which will be discharged by a sheriff’s sale of the land, whether due or not, if the proceeds be sufficient, will be paid with accruing interest till date of the sale, and the purchaser takes the land freed from such lien. But the widow’s estate is not a lien, and the rent or interest in the nature of rent, which had not become due before the sale, remains as part of her estate. It has been often ruled that by such sale the lien of arrears due the widow is divested; but there is not even a dictum that the accruing interest not due at the time of sale does not continue a lien. Until due the interest is not in arrear. The widow has no right to demand it till due. She is not bound to take it piecemeal from different persons, part before due and part after.</p>
