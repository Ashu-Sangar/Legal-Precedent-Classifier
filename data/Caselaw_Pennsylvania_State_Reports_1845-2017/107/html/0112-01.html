    <p class="summary" id="b134-8" data-blocks='[["BL_134.8",134,[233,1722,1178,478]]]'>This might readily be conceded were the only effect of the Act to prescribe the mode of procedure in making the increase. But, as the Act requires every corporation “accepting the same ” to pay a bonus, and it is assumed by the Commonwealth that an increase made as prescribed in it would be an acceptance of the Act, it necessarily follows that if the Act applies to defendant at all it subjects it to the payment of a bonus not imposed by its charter, or by any general law existing- at the time and applicable to it. And the same result would flow from the application of the provisions of section 15, Act of May 1st, 1868, to this company.</p>

But there is a clear and substantial distinction between a bonus and a tax. The power of taxation is an incident of sovereignty, and is co-extensive with that of which it is an incident. All subjects, therefore, over which the sovereign power of the state extends, are, in its discretion, legitimate subjects of taxation ; and this may be carried to any extent to which the government may choose to extend it: Cooley on Taxation 4. This power exists from necessity, it does not rest upon contract, nor does it imply a consideration in any ordinary sense of that term.</p>

Bouvier defines it thus: “A premium paid to a grantor or vendor, as — the bank paid a bonus to the state for its charter. A consideration given for what is received.” So in Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Maryland, <a href="/us/88/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="21 Wall. 456" data-case-ids="3411452" data-case-paths="/us/88/0456-01">21 Wall. 456</a>, the distinction between a tax and a bonus is clearly drawn, and the stipulation contained in the charter of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, requiring it to pay to the state of Maryland one fifth of the whole amount received by it for the transportation of passengers, is declared on page 478, to be nothing more or less than a bonus, such as a state has a right to exact for the grant of a franchise, and on the facts of that case the law imposing it was held valid, because it was a bonus and not a tax.</p>

Hence it is that local assessments for the opening, grading, and paving of streets, licenses, imposts, or duties on imported goods, and even labor on tbe highways have been held to be included within the general term “ tax ” or “taxes,” where there was a plain intent in the taxing statute itself so to include them: Burroughs on Taxation, § 5; Hammett <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 15 P.

That Act is entitled “ an Act to revise, amend and consolidate the several laws <em>taxing </em>corporations, brokers and bankers,” and it established, inter alia, a uniform rate of <em>bonus </em>on the increase of stock of corporations. The intent to include bonus within the general sense of “taxing” corporations is clear, and such was the contemporaneous construction of the Act during the period of six years which elapsed prior to the Act of 1874, which supplied a fuller and more complete method, applicable to all corporations. By the subsequent increase of its capital stock the defendant corporation must be held to have accepted the Act of 1874, which did not trench upon any of its vested rights but only provided a method of procedure for the exercise of those rights, under conditions which it was entirely competent for the legislature to impose.</p>

The utmost it can claim under that Act is a bare right to increase, and whilst the grant itself may imply a power to exercise it, yet the method of its exercise remained subject to the control of the legislature, under such conditions as it might see fit to impose.
