      <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>This was an appeal by Catherine E. Speidel, widow of Lorenz Speidel, deceased, from a decree of the said court discharging a rule to show cause why the executors of the said Lorenz Speidel should not appraise and set apart to the said Catherine Speidel property to the value of three hundred dollars out of the estate of her said husband and pay to her one third of the personal estate of said decedent absolutely.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-4" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[156,727,1180,778]]]'>An answer was filed by the executors, and the cause was referred by consent to J. W. F. Swift, Esq., as examiner and Master, who reported the facts to be substantially as follows : The said Lorenz Speidel and Catherine E. Speidel, formerly Folmer, were married in 1829, and lived and cohabitated as man and wife, until 1868, in which year they executed a written agreement to separate. This contract was not produced, and the testimony as to its contents was conflicting. The Master found, however, from the testimony, as matter of fact, that by its terms each relinquished whatever marital rights either might have in the respective estate of the other; that the wife received as a consideration a portion of her husband’s estate, and that the parties thereupon ceased to cohabit, and that such separation was actual, immediate and continuous up to the year 1882, when Lorenz Speidel died testate. Subsequently the said Catherine Speidel notified the executors that she elected to take against her husband’s will, and under the Intestate Laws, and thereupon filed this petition.</p>
