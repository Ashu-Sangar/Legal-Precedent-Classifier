After due notice to A. and demand of possession under claim of forfeiture, the city took possession of the engines, refused to make further payments for them and claimed damages. A. denied the allegations of the city and claimed that there were large sums due him on the contract, and for extra work. The contentions were submitted to the mechanical engineer, who after full hearing and testimony, decided that there was nothing due A.; that he had been fully paid for work done and materials furnished, and that he owed the city certain sums specified, by reason of Ms breach of contract in furnisMng inferior iron and castings. The referee accordingly reported that A. should pay the city said sums; and on his refusal to do so, the city brought suit against B., the surety on his bond. <em>Held,</em>

N. C., 546</a>, does not apply to the present case. That was not on an agreement to submit disputed questions relating to performance, or of damages arising on the contract, and between the parties thereto; but it was to provide for a final decree of a distribution of the fund between parties who were not legal parties to the agreement. The trustee was not entitled to any share in the distribution. Its purpose was not to settle the sums due as between the parties, but to make a final decree of distribution. It was therefore held the trustee could not set up the agreement so as to take away the jurisdiction of the courts.</p>

It does not deny the law to be as therein stated; but it is ruled on the language of the agreement which the court construed to limit the submission to the specific matters named. While wo may think that construction rather forced, yet it in nowise controverts the rule of law, so often declared as to the binding effect on all matters of dispute which come within the prospective submission. There was no stipulation in that agreement by which either party waived and released all rights of action under or “ by virtue of the contract,” as there is in the present case.</p>

No irregularity in the examination of witnesses, nor in the conduct of the arbitrator, appears. No corruption or misbehavior of the arbitrator is shown. The award then is as conclusive on the parties to the agreement, upon the matters then directly in issue, as if it was a judgment: Whar. on Evidence § 800 ; Merrick’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="478842" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0009-01">5 W. &amp; S. 9</a>; Lamb <em>v. </em>Miller, 6 Harris 450.</p>
    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[242,1206,1178,554]]]'>3. It is further contended that if the award be conclusive on Hartupee, it is not on the surety. Why not ? He was duly notified of the time and place of hearing, and that he might attend the hearing and take part therein if he saw proper. He appeared personally and by counsel. Thus he had an opportunity to be heard, and was heard .at length. He was directly interested in the questions being tried and in the award to be rendered. He had a right to make defence to the claims of the city, and did so, and he controlled the proceedings on the part of the defence. He had the right to adduce testimony, and to cross-examine witnesses of the other side. He availed himself of all the rights of a party in the trial.</p>
    <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[244,1770,1178,561]]]'>Hartupee had agreed, in case of his failure to perform the contract, that he should be liable for any damages the city might sustain by reason thereof. The surety had agreed that Hartupee should “well and truly keep- and perform all the terms and conditions of said contract.” The contract provided that <em>anj </em>question or dispute between the parties, that should arise under it, should be referred to the engineer, whose decision should be final. The surety became bound for the fulfilment of every part of the contract. The manner of ascertaining the measure of disputed damages, and all other questions arising thereon, was a part of the contract. He was bound for the acts and omissions of his principal in the contract: Giltinan <em>v. </em>Strong, 14 P. F. S. 242.</p>

The surety became substantially a party on <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>the trial before the referee, and a privy to tbe award. A court looks beyond the nominal party, and treats as the real party one whose interests are involved in the issue, and who conducts and controls the action or the defence, and holds him concluded by any judgment which may be rendered: Peterson et al. <em>v. </em>Lothrop, 10 Casey 223. When there is full opportunity, by notice or otherwise, to come in and. to adduce evidence and cross examine, then the judgment is a bar, even when the persons having this opportunity are not parties to the record: Whar. on Ev. § 763. While a recovery in ejectment against a covenantee is not evidence of the defect of his title against the covenantor unless the latter had notice, yet if he had notice, and especially if lie defended the suit, it is conclusive: Leather <em>v. </em>Poultney, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Binn.%20356" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="4 Binn. 356">4 Binn. 356</a>; Bender <em>v. </em>Fromberger, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%20436" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="4 Dall. 436">4 Dall. 436</a>; Coates <em>v. </em>Roberts, <a href="/rawle/4/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="4 Rawle 100" data-case-ids="1823581" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0100-01">4 Rawle 100</a>; Chambers <em>v. </em>Lapsley, 7 Barr 24.

That is true: but as his principal could not appeal, the rights of one in that respect were equal to the rights of the other. The agreement for which the surety became bound waived that right. It follows this award was as conclusive against the surety as against the party named therein.</p>
    <p id="b455-5" data-blocks='[["BL_455.5",455,[125,1547,1175,334]]]'>It is not necessary to refer to the authorities which hold that the record of a judgment against the principal is not evidence to establish the debt against the surety.

The fraud, however, must be actual and intentional, and not constructive, such as flows from an erroneous or unjust judgment. Partiality and some improper conduct of the arbitrator in making the award will not impeach it unless the party benefited thereby be implicated in that misconduct: Brad dick <em>v. </em>Thompson, 8 East, 344. The award of a referee to whom questions of law and of fact are submitted cannot be impeached and avoided unless by proof of fraud practised on him, or by proof of mistake or accident, by which he was deceived or misled so that in fact the award is not the result of his own judgment. A mistake in drawing conclusions of fact from evidence, or in <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>adopting erroneous rules of law, does not avoid the award: Boston Water Power Co. <em>v. </em>Gray, 6 Metcalf 131.</p>
