Snare, as high constable of said borough, on the ground that certain of the ballots east were illegal, in that instead of being printed with the heading “Borough,” as directed by law, they were headed “ Republican Borough Ticket.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b203-10" data-blocks='[["BL_203.12",203,[182,1734,1171,646]]]'>The petition averred that the officers of the general election held for said borough on the third Tuesday of February, 1884, liave certified and returned that Harry H. Snare received 246 votes for said office, and Cyrus Zerby received 237 votes; that said election was undue and illegal; that manj' ballots which were illegal, for the reason above stated, were voted and counted against Cyrus Zerby as though they were legal, notwithstanding objection thereto was made to the election officers. The petitioners averred “ that should the illegal votes be taken from the whole number of votes cast in tbe first ward of said borough, then Cyrus Zerby, and not Harry H. Snare, would receive a majority of all the legal votes in the borough of Steelton, and be entitled to the office of high constable of said borough.” The petitioners therefore prayed for an order, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

L. 92), as to the headings of tickets, was directory merely and not mandatory: citing McCrary on Elections, 126, 194, 400 ; Wheelock’s Case, 1 Norris 297 ; Boileau’s Case, 2 Pars. Eq. Cas. 603 ; Brightly’s Elec.

L. 634), is <em>in pari materia </em>with the Act of 1866, section 71 of which provides: “ All tickets folded and endorsed as aforesaid, and personally delivered by the voter, <em>and none other, </em>shall,” &amp;c., &amp;c. The Act of 1866 provides that voters are “ authorized and <em>required </em>” to vote by tickets classified and headed as therein directed. These statutory provisions, we contend, are essential and mandatory; hence the ballots in this case which the court below termed “ irregular and improper ” were absolutely illegal and void. If this be so, the averment in the petition that if they had not been counted Zerby would have been elected, -was sufficient to give jurisdiction, and the court erred in quashing the petition. The Act of 1874 merely requires that “ the petition shall concisely set forth the cause of complaint,” &amp;c.: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Woelper, 3 S. &amp; R. 40; Melvin’s Case, 18 P. F.
