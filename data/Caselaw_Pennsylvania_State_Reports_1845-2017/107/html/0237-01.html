It must be proved that he knew exactly the state of the party having the equity when he acquired the legal title: Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 S. &amp; R. 496. The Act of March 29th, 1827 (P. L. 156), provides that the recorder shall prepare and keep two indexes for each and every book in which deeds and mortgages may be recorded, one for the names of grantors and mortgagors, and one for the names of grantees and mortgagees. Therefore, in point of fact and utility, the index is part of the registry. The same Act requires an index called the judgment docket. It has been held under this Act that the plaintiff is bound to see that his judgment is properly entered: Wood <em>v. </em>Reynolds, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 406" data-case-ids="481757" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0406-01">7 W &amp; S. 406</a>; Ridgway, Budd. &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 3 Harris 177. A fortiori, parties who claim that the registration of a deed is constructive notice to a subsequent purchaser or mortgagee, should be bound to see that the conveyance is properly indexed as required by the above Act of March 29th, 1827, as the effect of a deed, unlike the lien of a judgment, is unlimited in duration. Before the Act of March 27th, 1865, P. L. 34, it would seem that a conveyance of land by the corporators to the corporation was necessary in order to vest the title. But by the 5th section of that Act, which is supplementary to the Act of 21st April, 1854, the original Act for the incorporation of mining companies — it is enacted, “ that it shall be deemed and taken to be the true intent and meaning of the Act to which this is a supplement, that the right, title, and interest of the owners in and to the lands, leasehold, or other interest mentioned and described in the certificate in writing, required by the first section of said Act, should vest in the company therein named, and without any further conveyance or assignment, and free and discharged from all claim of dower; and it shall be the duty of the Recorder of Deeds of the county in which said certificate is or shall be recorded, to enter the names of parties signing said certificate among the grantors in the 'index of deeds and conveyances in his office.” The first section of the Act of April 21st, 1854, requires the certificate to be recorded in the office for recording of deeds, in a suitable book to be <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>kept for that purpose, evidently meaning’ a boob kept exclusively for the purpose of recording certificates or articles of association, and not the boob in which deeds are registered; and for the purpose of giving information to subsequent purchasers of the existence of such a corporation, of whom it was formed, and what lands are embraced therein, the names of the parties signing said certificate, must be entered among the grantors in the index of deeds and conveyances in his office. Where then must the purchaser loob for the articles of association which divests the title of the corporators, if there is no index to guide them? Not among the registrations of deeds, because the certificate is not recorded there. The only place he can acquire the information is among the registrations of articles of association, — with no guide or finger mark to indicate that the grantor in a recorded deed has parted with his title.</p>

An examination of all the indexes of deeds in Forest county, discloses the fact that the names of Alexander McAudrew and Samuel Wann are not among the grantors. What farther search is required ? On the faith of what the mortgagee finds or is presumed to find, he parts with his money, and receives and records his mortgage. Is there any negligence, laches or fraud, as in Peebles <em>v. </em>Heading, imputable to him? What farther search could he make? Is he bound to look or have the Recorder look, through all the records, page by page, in the office ? The remarks of Read, J, in Luch’s Appeal, 8 Wr. 523. wherein he says “if it were a deed, it would be recorded in the deed book, and you would find it by examining the appropriate index,” have the merit of good sense, and accord with the general practice. Although the point decided that a mortgage must be recorded in a mortgage book has been questioned in the subsequent case of Schell <em>v. </em>Stein, 26 P. F. S. 398, the remarks of Judge Read about the examination of the appropriate index are not disapproved. This last cited case merely rules that if the deed be duly recorded and <em>indexed </em>in the same volume, it will be constructive notice, although it be not entered in the general index book. In Speer <em>v. </em>Evans, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20144" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Wright 144">11 Wright 144</a>,-the mortgage was recorded, but not indexed. One question was whether the record was constructive notice to a subsequent judgment creditor, and another, whether the creditor had actual notice. Speaking of the record, WOODWARD, C. J., says : “ But it was not duly indexed, and not therefore constructive notice to third parties — as a guide to inquirers, the index is an iudis-<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>pensable part of the recording, and without it the record affects no party with notice.” In Smith’s Appeal, Id. 140, where the Christian names of the partners were not entered or indexed, Woodward, C. J., says: “Actual notice of a mortgage or judgment supplies a defective or omitted index of the registry. The law requires him (the creditor), to have it (the judgment), properly docketed and indexed.” The lien docket is not the <em>record </em>of judgments, but the essential index of them. It does not make a judgment, but refers to one supposed to be already madePer Lowjrie, C. J., in Ferguson <em>v. </em>Staver, 4 Wr. 216.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b262-6" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[248,901,1186,1556]]]'>The question in Clader <em>v. </em>Thomas, 8 Norris 343, was whether the record of the instrument in the miscellaneous book was a proper recording of it. There was no objection that it was not properly indexed — the objection was that it should have been recorded in the <em>mortgage </em>book, and indexed there. The court below held that the instrument was properly recorded in the miscellaneous book, and this court affirmed the ruling. There was no question raised about the index whatever. In G-lading <em>v. </em>Frick, 7 Norris 463, to which the court refers in Clader <em>v. </em>Thomas, as an authoritative precedent, Pax-SON, J. says: “The instances are rare in which an Act of Assembly designates the book in which an instrument must be recorded. Where such a direction is given in a statute, its terms must be complied with or the record would be worthless. So in Brown and Wood's Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.N.C.%2035" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 W.N.C. 35">3 W. N. C. 35</a>, another case relied upon by the court below. There the mortgage was left for record, and entered by the Recorder on his entry book, giving the names of the mortgagor, and mortgagee, the date, the place where the mortgaged premises were situated, and gave the receipt as required by section 3, Act 28 May, 1715, 1 Purd. 458, and the Act 28 March, 1820, Id. 478. This entry created the lien, and that is all that was decided in the case. It probably would be sufficient constructive notice to a purchaser because of the entry which would lead him, on inquiry, <em>to </em>the fact that the mortgage was left for record. Nor is the •question raised, here ruled by the case of Schell <em>v. </em>Stein', 26 P. F. S. 398, the other case cited by the court below, because the only question there raised, was whether an omission to index •the deed on the general index docket, when it had been recorded in the deed book, and indexed therein, invalidated the instrument as against a subsequent purchaser, and the court ruled that if the instrument was recorded and indexed in the book in which the deed was registered, it was sufficient, and as there was no law which requires the Recorder to keep a general index to all the deed and mortgage books in his office, it. was not necessary to index it in his general index.</p>

      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>All the decided cases arose under the general recording Acts. Had the Recorder certified on the instrument that it had been recorded, and had failed to record it at all or enter it on his entry book, it cannot be pretended that it would be notice to a subsequent purchaser. When the same section of, the Act which dispenses with a conveyance, requires the Recorder to index the names of the corporators among the grantors of deeds, is it assuming too much to require that all its provisions be complied with in order to change the character of a bona fide, to that of a mala fide purchaser ?</p>

Who is the party here? Not Stockwell, certainly. As Me Andrew and Wann are his grantors and also some of the grantors of $he Forest County Oil and Mining Company, and some of the parties in interest therein as grantees, is it requiring too much of them to hold that it is their duty, or the duty of the corporation, to see that the record of the articles is indexed in the manner provided by law, the same as creditors are bound to see that their judgments are properly indexed in the judgment index? If this rule be not applicable, then the party whose act caused the injury will be protected, and the innocent one must suffer. When the corporation had a remedy against the Recorder for his neglect of duty, and Mr. Stockwell was without redress, and the act of the corporators in signing the certificate and in not having the record properly indexed, was the cause of the injury to Mr. Stockwell, it certainly is not in accordance with justice and the principles of equity that he bear the loss.</p>

    <p id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[145,772,1172,987]]]'>The duty of the Recorder was to record it, and the responsibility rested upon him for any default in the nroper discharge of that duty; the consequences of his default could not be visited upon the owner, who had done all that the law required in depositing the deed in the office for that purpose. A different doctrine was perhaps, declared in Luch’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20519" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Wright 519">8 Wright 519</a>, where it was held that mortgages must be recorded in a “ mortgage book,” and that they are not properly recorded in any other book, where they cannot be found by means of a “mortgage index;” but that case was expressly overruled in Glading <em>v. </em>Frick, 7 Norris 460, where it was said by PaxsoN, J., “ We feel ourselves constrained to return to the rule laid down bv Chief Justice GfiBSON in McLanahan <em>v. </em>Reeside, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20511" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Watts 511">9 Watts, 511</a>; ‘It is, indeed,’ says the Chief Justice, ‘of no account that the conveyance and the articles were not recorded in the book set aside for mortgages ; the keeping of such a book is an arrangement to promote the convenience of the officer by contracting the surface over which he is to search, for a particular thing; he is bound to furnish precise information, get it as he may, of every registry in his office, whether made in the right place or not.’ ” Clader <em>v. </em>Thomas, 8 Norris 348, and Paige <em>v. </em>Wheeler, 11 Norris 282, are to the same effect.</p>
    <p id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[141,1767,1175,561]]]'>The remark of Chief Justice Woodward, in Speer <em>v. </em>Evans, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wright%20141" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 Wright 141">11 Wright 141</a>, that the index is an indispensable part of the record, is not to be regarded as an adjudication to that extent; that case turned upon the question of actual notice: Schell v. Stein, 26 P. F. S. 398. No duty rested upon the Forest County Oil and Mining Company, to supervise the action of the Recorder, to see that he made the record and indexed the conveyance: Brown &amp; Wood’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.N.C.%2035" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 W.N.C. 35">3 W. N. C. 35</a>; Wyoming Bank’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20W.N.C.%20567" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="11 W.N.C. 567">11 W. N. C. 567</a>. Constructive notice of the conveyance must, therefore, be imputed to the holder of the Stockwell mortgage, as well as to those claiming under it: that notice being the implication which the law attaches to the registration of the certificate.</p>
