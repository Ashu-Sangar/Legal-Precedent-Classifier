The lots were laid out with reference to certain streets and alleys, which were opened, and the controversy here is as to one of these lots, the size, location and boundary of which is in no way called in question. It is identified as the second lot, according to the plan, upon which was built the house now occupied by Albert C. Burns. Albert C. and Joseph Burns were the sons of a deceased brother. In order to establish a gift of this lot by James Burns to them, a number of witnesses was examined. From the testimony of these witnesses, we learn that about the year 1867, James Burns erected a small dwelling house upon this lot, and that whilst the building was in process of erection, he repeatedly stated that he was building the house for Albert and Joseph Burns; statements to this effect were made to some ten or twelve witnesses. To several of the same witnesses he stated that he had in his hands money of Joseph Burns which he was using to build the house, and that when it was completed be intended to give <em>the lot </em>to Albert and Joseph; to a number of them he stated, after his nephews had entered into the possession, that he <em>had given </em>them the lot as a gift, and that it was theirs. The theory of the defendant is that the house was built with the money of Albert and Joseph Burns, in James Burn’s hands, and that the gift wras of the lot only. <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>Samuel Bilford testifies as follows: — “James Burns called me in, while passing the building, and stated that he was building the two houses jointly; he said that the one house he was building for Joseph Burns and Albert his brother, . . . . that Joseph Burns had given him money for the purpose of consummating the house. He intended to add some money with the money ho had received from Joseph Burns, and when it was completed he was going to give Joseph Burns and Albert a deed for the same, that the house was theirs; he owed this to Joseph and Albert Burns on account of their father, who was a brother/’</p>

After the house was built, Albert took possession, and, if I mistake not, Joe was in the office then at the railroad. ‘ Now,’ says he, ‘ this house is Albert’s and Joe’s ; I gave it to them, it is their house.’ .... After the house was finished and Albert was in it, he wanted a kitchen; the old gentleman came to me,.says he, 51 built him a house and gave him a lot; he wants me to build a kitchen ..... he can build it himself.’ ”</p>

To John Brown, the decedent said he was putting up the house for Albert and Joseph, that it would be a poor thing if an uncle as rich as he was could not afford to give his nephews a home. In 1873, he said to James McCafferty that he had built the house for Albert and Joseph, and that he made it a present to them.</p>

Galbraith testifies to the payment to James Burns, by Joseph Burns, of money to be applied to the building of the house, and states that James Burns admitted that the <em>house </em>would soon be paid for; to Alfred Hale, however, he after-wards admitted that the house was fully paid for. There is no denial or contradiction of these facts; the plaintiffs have produced no witnesses to testify to any act or declaration of the defendant, or of his deceased brother, inconsistent with his claim in this suit, or the truth of the facts proven; in this respect the case at bar is readily distinguishable from that class of eases of which Rankin <em>v. </em>Simpson, 7 Harris 474, is one. 'Hiere is, perhaps, some indistinctness as to the precise time <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>when these respective declarations were made, but enough appears as to time to indicate that admissions of a gift were distinctly made before, about the time of and after the donees had gone into the possession. It also appears, clearty, that possession was taken in pursuance of the gift, and not otherwise. The gift was in contemplation whilst the house was being built, and its completion was urged by the donor in order that the donees might enter into the enjoyment of it. The possession was open, notorious and exclusive, and has been maintained for fifteen years and upwards, prior to the bringing of this suit, eight years of that time being before the date of the adjudication of James Burns’ lunacy, in which time no claim of title or for rent appears to have been made, nor has any other act of ownership or authority been exercised over the premises by James Burns or his trustee in his lifetime or his heirs since his death, until the bringing of this suit. What the cost of the house was, or how much James Burns contributed to it if anything, does not clearly appear; it is estimated to be worth $800, the lot about $150. It would appear, however, that a considerable part of the money, if not all, which was used in the construction, was the money of Joseph or Albert Burns.</p>

Such a lapse of time would render the proof of his claim and the settlement of his accounts exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible. James Burns, who was the custodian of the defendant’s money, is now dead. Joseph Burns is also dead, and the defendant himself is thereby rendered incompetent as a witness. We are of opinion that the evidence in this case is sufficient to establish a parol gift, that enough has been shown to take the transaction out of the statute of frauds, and that under the special facts shown it would Ije unjust to rescind it, and that the court was justified in submitting the cause to the jury.</p>
