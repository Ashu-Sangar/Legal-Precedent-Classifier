As a general rule, a sale of personal property is not valid as against the creditors of the vendor, unless possession be delivered by the vendor in accordance with the sale. In determining the kind of possession necessary to be given, regard must be had not only to the character of the property but also to the nature of the transaction, the position of the parties, and the intended use of the property. No such change of possession as will defeat the fair and honest object of the parties is required.</p>

An insolvent father sold his daughter a mare for a valuable consideration, which was promptly paid. The father and daughter lived together on a farm, and the mare was kept at the time of the purchase with the father’s other live stock. No formal transfer of possession ever <em>took </em>place. The mare remained upon <em>the </em>farm, and was kept and used as before by the father and daughter and other members of the family. The evidence as to the extent of the change of possession was conflicting. Some witnesses testified that the daughter used and treated the mare as her own property after the purchase, and that her father and brothers admitted that the mare was her property. It was testified on the other hand that after the sale the father used the mare as before, as one witness said, “most all the time;” that on one occasion he claimed to own her and offered to sell her as his property, and that the blacksmith’s bill for shoeing her was charged to his account., About a year after the sale, the father and daughter moved to another farm and took with them the mare which was used and kept as before. Some months later, the father and daughter separated,,the daughter moving <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>to another farm and taking the mare with her.

J., the following facts appeared : Prior to the 1st of April, 1878, the mare in question was the property of Jonathan Forney, who was at that time indebted to It. B. McClure on a running account, upon which suit was brought and judgment obtained by McClure against Forney, on May 4ih, 1878, for $69.82. On or about May 1st, 1878, Jonathan Forney who was at that time insolvent, sold the said mare to his daughter Emma Forney for $75, which was paid on the conclusion of the contract. At that time, Emma was living with her father on a farm, known as the Stewart farm, in which Jonathan Forney owned tlie life estate and Emma the remainder. Previous to the sale, the mare had been kept on the farm with the other live stock of Jonathan Forney. No formal transfer of possession took place. The mare was kept and used after the sale as before, but it was shown that thenceforth Emma used the mare as ber own property and claimed its ownership. The mare continued on this farm, being used by various members of the family, until the spring of 1879, when the plaintiff and her father moved to another farm owned by one Brown, and took the mare with them. Here the plaintiff remained until June, 1879, when she separated from her father and moved to her brother’s farm in West Virginia, taking the mare with her. Her father subsequently returned to the Stewart farm, which was situated about three quarters of a mile from the brother’s farm, and occasionally borrowed and used the mare.

In the spring of 1878 when I left the farm the mare was kept there with the rest of the stock on the farm; it was my father’s stock; it was kept in that condition until I went to Brown’s. I went to Brown’s in February, 1879. In February, 1879, after the sale he (Jonathan Forney) moved to the Brown property in Middletown ; I went with him; he rented part of the house. He did not rent the stable and barn; Brown may have let him have stabling room; he did not have it rented. I do not know what he used as a stable; he used an out-building; there is a pretty large coal-house that he hitched in generally. I stayed there until about the middle of June, 1879. This mare was taken to that farm and kept there while I stayed there; my father had other horses there; two other horses. I do not recollect how they were kept. While I was there, before I went to the Virginia farm, she was kept there on the place. I do not recollect how thejr were kept; he had other horses there; I do not recollect of their being in the stable; he fed my mare when he used her, and when he rode her I fed her sometimes myself; she was kept there in the large coal house, hitched in there; and sometimes let out on the farm with Mr. Brown’s horses. My father kept his two horses with Mr. Brown’s horses. When I went to Virginia I took the mare with me. Father stayed on the Brown farm until 1881; he lived there. When I went to the Virginia farm, I kept my mare on my brother’s farm where I stayed. I went to Brown’s farm in February and stayed until about the following June, I went then to my brother’s farm. I did not go'to my own farm.. During the time my father stayed at Brown’s my brother kept the mare there; Ido not recollect of any of my father’s property being there; I lent the mare to father sometimes to ride up to Brown’s and he would come back and leave her with me; I alwaj^s had her when I wanted her and would get her from my brother’s or any of them; 1 could get her when my father wanted to use her. I cannot recollect of father’s having her at Brown’s any time. He did not have her at the Brown farm nearly all the time; he did have her occasionally; I had her in my possession, and would loan her to him sometimes; he did not keep her more than me.”</p>

First, was the purchase of the bay mare by the plaintiff fair and bona fide, and paid for with her own funds ? Second, was there such a legal possession as gave her a complete title not only against her father, but against his creditors ? As to the first question: if you are not satisfied, and the' burden of the proof is upon her to satisfy you, that the purchase of the bay mare was a fair, bona <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>fide purchase, then your verdict should be for the defendants, and you need not consider the second question. It will be for you to say if, under all the evidence, 3rou are satisfied that Miss Forney did purchase this bay inare from her father with her own money. If you find that she did, then you will proceed to consider the second question, that is, was there such a legal possession as not only gave her the title against her father, but against his creditors? The general rule of law is that the sale must be followed up by such an open, notorious, exclusive, and continuous possession by the purchaser as is calculated to advise creditors and others of the legality7- of the ownership. What is such a legal ownership in any particular case must depend upon the circumstances of each particular case.</p>
