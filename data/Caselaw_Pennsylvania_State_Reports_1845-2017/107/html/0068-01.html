Ibid : Buffaloe <em>v. </em>White-deer, 3 Harris 182. It is well settled that a settlement in this <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>state is not lost until another is acquired, no matter how long the pauper may have wandered from one district to another. And as the provision in our statutes for the removal of paupers into other states is nugatory, because there is no power by which it can be carried into effect (Limestone Township <em>v. </em>Chillisquaque, 6 Norris 294), the settlement remains. The learned judge relied on Toby Township <em>v. </em>Madison, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%2060" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Wright 60">8 Wright 60</a>, in which the court say: “ Under our statutes the removal is to be to the place where the pauper was last legally settled, whether in or out of Pennsylvania.” But it has since been decided that the courts of this state have no power to send a pauper beyond the limits of our own state: Limestone Township <em>v. </em>Chillisquaque, 6 Norris 294. The lunatic was committed to the hospital under § 6 of Act of April 20th, 1869 (P. L. 78, Purd., 970, pi. 6.). This act makes no provision for the support and maintenance and expenses of removal of the persons so committed. The liability must be fixed by either the 11th section of Act of April 14th, 1845 (P. L. 44Í, Purd. 971, pi. 19), the latter clause of which in regard to cases “ where such person has no legal settlement in any township or district in this Commonwealth, but only a residence therein,” would seem to be repealed by the Act of February 17th, 1854 (P. L. 85, § 1, Purd. 972, pi. 20). And this Act of February 17th, 1854, is inconsistent with the Act of April 8th, 1861 (P. L. 249, § 4, Purd. 973, pi. 31), which enacts, “ whenever an indigent insane person shall hereafter be sent to said hospital, the city or county from which he or she was sent, shall be liable to the trustees of the hospital for his or her maintenance, and shall have remedy over against the proper township where by existing laws the township is liable for the support of such pauper, and the overseers of the poor of such township shall have remedy over against the property of the pauper, or against any relative required by law to maintain him or her to the extent of their liability under the poor laws.” What do the words “existing laws’’mean in this section ? To what Act or Acts of Assembly do they refer ? Evidently to the Act of June 13th, 1836, Poor Laws. This is a general law relating to all classes of poor, sane or insane, and most likely to have been in the mind of the legislature when the Act of 1861 was passed. Besides this construction would produce uniformity throughout the state. The Act of April 8th, 1861, is very similar to the first section of the Act of April 22d, 1863 (P. L. 539, Purd. 974. pi. 34) in relation to Western Pennsylvania Hospital, under which it was held the township was liable: Harmony Township <em>v. </em>Forest county, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.N.C.%2037" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 W.N.C. 37">8 W.

In Limestone v. Chillisquaque, 6 Norris 294, it is ruled that where one abandons his settlement in Pennsylvania, and acquires a new one in another State he not only loses his settlement in the former State, but ceases to be a citizen thereof. On this authority the pauper must be regarded as a foreigner, so far as the poor laws of the state are concerned. Thompson having lost his settlement in Delaware township by having acquired one in Kansas, the next question is: does the liability of Delaware Township, for his maintenance, continue so as to give the county a remedy over against it. The answer to this question must depend not on the poor laws, but on the statute regulating the transfer of insane paupers to the State Lunatic Asylum. The 11th Sec. of Act of April 14th, 1845 (Purd. 971, pi. 19), makes it the duty of courts “ to certify to the trustees the legal settlement of such person, if he or she have any legal settlement in this commonwealth ; and if such persons shall have no such settlement, then to certify the place of residence of such person at the time of offence committed; and the poor district so certified to be the place of settlement or residence of such person shall be chargeable with the expenses of his or her care or maintenance and removal to and from said asylum.” This refers to insane criminals, but may be applicable also to the case of insane paupers. If there were no other Act of Assembly the liability of Delaware township to the county would hardly be questioned. But the Act of February 17th, 1854 (Purd. 972, pi. 20), provides: “ That where such person has no legal settlement in any township in this commonwealth, but only a residence therein, the county shall be chargeable.” When an indigent insane person is placed, by direction of the court, in one of the. lunatic hospitals of the state, the county is primarily liable to the trustees for his or her care and maintenance, with remedy over against the township or poor district “ where, by existing laws, the township is liable for the support of such pauper,” the township or poor district to be reimbursed out of the estate of the lunatic, if he or she has any, or by relatives if they are of sufficient ability: Ex parte Blewitt, <a href="/citations/?q=32%20Leg.%20Int.%20336" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="32 Leg. Int. 336">32 Leg. Int. 336</a>. The “ existing laws ” under which a township or poor district, as the case may be, is made liable for the maintenance of paupers in a State Lunatic Hospital, are to be found in but a single section of the Act of April 14th, 1845 (Purd. 971, pi. 19), namely § 11. This section provides, that it shall be the duty of the. court, in all cases where they shall commit" any person to the asylum, <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>to certify to tbe trustees tbe legal settlement of sucb person if be or sbe have any legal settlement in this commonwealth, and if such person shall have no sucb settlement, then to certify tbe place of residence of such person, and the poor district so certified to be the place of settlement or residence of sucb poor person, shall be chargeable with the expense of bis or her care and maintenance, and removal to and from said asylum. This certification, however, is not to be made until after due notice has been given to the constituted authorities having control of the poor in the township or district to be charged, and this notice is material; for, under the first section of the Act of February 17th, 1854, Purd. 972, pi. 20, which was a supplement to the Act of April 14th, 2845, and which very properly recognizes a distinction between a legal settlement and a residence as applied to paupers, a township or district thus notified might come into court and show that some other district was the true place of settlement of the lunatic, and thus legitimately escape liability (Shenango Twp. <em>v. </em>Wayne Twp., 10 Cas. 184) ; or that the lunatic was not settled in such district, but only resided therein at the time-of the transfer to the asylum; in which case tbe liability for care and maintenance would fall upon the county. The case of Overseers of the Poor of Harmony Twp. <em>v. </em>Forest County, 10 Nor. 404, was under the Western Hospital Act and has no application here.</p>

Little, if anything, respecting settlements is left to be determined from ancient usage, or by analogy. Tbe statute contemplates that a person may lose his settlement by acquiring a new one without the state as well as within, and provides for the removal of a pauper “ to the city, district or place where he was last legally settled, whether in or out of Pennsylvania.” It may be difficult, and often impossible, to remove a pauper from this state to his place of settlement in another; this provision may be nugatory as regards its enforcement, and yet material in ascertaining the intendment of the statute respecting persons coming into a district from another state.</p>

If the settlement of the pauper is in another state or country to which he cannot be removed, the district where he resides when he becomes chargeable is liable for his support. This is the general rule, subject to some statutory exceptions, as, for instance, when the court commits a pauper to the State Lunatic Hospital, who has no legal settlement within this commonwealth, but only a residence therein', the county wherein he is found a lunatic shall pay the expenses of his maintenance and removal. A person who has acquired a legal settlement in another state, after he had a settlement here, seems to stand on like footing as a person who never was in this state.
