J., the facts appeared as follows: Both parties claimed title through Alfred Myers and James Hughes, who were owners of a larger tract of some two hundred acres of which the land in controversy was a part. Hughes died in July, 1861, and Myers in November, 1864, each leaving a will which gave full power to his executors to sell and convey land and to execute conveyances for sales previously made by the testator. From the testimony offered in behalf of the plaintiff it appeared that on February 15th, 1864, Alfred Myers, with the acquiescence of the executors of Hughes, who ratified the sale, sold the two hundred acre tract of land to John Henderson for eight dollars an acre, <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>payable in annual instalments of $250. I. N. Owens testified rhat a short time after the agreement of sale to Henderson and before the first payment was due on it, he agreed with Henderson by written articles (which were lost) to pay him $100 for his equitable interest in the land and take his place as purchaser from Myers and Hughes’ executor, who agreed to this substitution of Owens as vendee and were to make a deed directly to him. The consideration money was paid as agreed and on June 1st, 1876, a deed was made by Myers and Hughes’ executor directly to Owens for the land. Owens gave his judgment bond as security for the residue of the consideration, which was entered up the same day. In June, 1877, execution was issued thereon, and on January 6th, 1881, the property was sold at sheriff’s sale, under a vend, ex., to William II.'Barb, the plaintiff. The defendants proved that on February 25th, 1864, Henderson entered into articles of agreement with Stephen White for the sale of a part of the ‘tract purchased from Myers et al., consisting of the premises in dispute, for eight dollars an acre. White went immediately into possession and so continued until 1876. On August 1st, 1876, White made an assignment for the benefit of liis creditors to E. M. Sayers and J. S. Moore, and they by deed dated June 17tb, 1879, conveyed the premises in controversy to H. 'C. Sayers, tlie defendant.

Both parties claimed under James Hughes and Alfred Myers, who died testate, the former in July, 1.861, and the latter in November, 1864, having respectively given their executors full testamentary authority to sell and cqnvey real estate, of which they died seised, and make deeds for lands sold by them respectively in their lifetime. In February, 1864, Myers, by articles of agreement, witnessed and ratified by one of Hughes’s executors, agreed to sell and convey to John Henderson a tract of land containing 200 acres, more or less, including the land in dispute, for eight dollars per acre. Af-terwards, on June 1st, 1876, the executors of Hughes and Myers conveyed the land to Dr. I. N. Owens, and took from him a judgment bond as security for residue of the consideration. On that bond judgment was regularly entered the same day, and thus became a purchase money lien. During the continuance of the lien execution was issued on the judgment, and by virtue thereof the land in dispute vras levied on, sold and conveyed by the sheriff to the plaintiff in January, 1881. <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>The plaintiff’s testimony, as already observed, tended to prove these facts. Some of them were matters of record, and such of them as were not conclusively established by record evidence or conceded by defendant were clearly for the consideration of the jury; and we cannot assume that under proper instructions they would not have been found in favor of plaintiff. There was also evidence tending to prove that shortly after the articles of agreement were signed, Henderson, with the assent of his vendors, transferred his interest therein to Dr. Owens, and thus it came to pass that the deed was made directly to him and his bond taken for the unpaid purchase money.</p>
    <p id="b270-4" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[223,948,1180,691]]]'>The plaintiff, resting his claim upon the testimony tending to prove the facts above stated, requested the learned judge to instruct the jury as set forth in his first point. He refused to so charge, and therein we think there was error. It is a familiar principle, and one that needs not the citation of authority to support it, that a sheriff’s sale on a purchase money judgment, the lien of which is continuous and cotemporaneous-with the conveyance of the land, vests a good title in the purchaser, and divests all equitable interests in the land, subordinate to the legal title Bound by the lien of the judgment. Prior to their conveyance to Owens the vendors held the legal title as security for the unpaid purchase money, and if, when their deed was delivered to him, his judgment bond for purchase money was taken and entered up the same day, they acquired a lien on the legal title thus conveyed, which remains in full force until divested by the sheriff’s sale.</p>
    <p id="b270-5" data-blocks='[["BL_270.5",270,[220,1641,1178,563]]]'>The equitable title, under -which defendant claimed, was derived from White, who bjr articles of agreement contracted to purchase the land from Henderson a few days after the latter agreed to buy the whole tract from Myers and Hughes’s executors. The equitable title thus acquired by White, and by his assignees transmitted to defendant, was clearly subordinate to the legal title bound by the purchase money judgment on which the land was sold, and hence it was divested by the sheriff’s sale. If the jury had been permitted to consider and pass upon the testimony, and had found, as they might have done, that the allegations of fact embodied in plaintiff’s first point were-true, there is nothing in the case to exempt it from the operation of the principles above stated.</p>

The fact of the conveyance by the executors to <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>Owens was not questioned, and if the jury had found, as they might hare done from the evidence, the other facts embodied in plaintiff’s first point, it was the legal title that was sold, and the equitable title of White, which was subordinate thereto, was divested. It follows from what has been said that the point should have been affirmed.</p>
