The report oil an Auditor appointed to distribute the fund was filed and confirmed <em>nisi, </em>when the next of kin of B., the decedent, filed a petition of review, setting out that they had no knowledge of the filing of the account, and that certain specified items therein were overcharges. Upon the report of an Auditor appointed in pursuance of the petition, the court opened A.’s account for a review and re-hearing on the items alleged to be erroneous. An Auditor was again appointed, and in his report surcharged A. to the amount of $582, on the ground that certain items paid by him for B.’s board and attendance (including the $750), were excessive. It appeared that B. was a lunatic, and on account of his loathsome habits it was particularly burdensome ami disgusting lo take care of him.'

For error of law, apparent on the face of the record; 2. For new matter which has arisen since the decree.

He was authorized to make the payment by a solemn decree of the court confirming his account, fairly and regularly filed and advertised.
