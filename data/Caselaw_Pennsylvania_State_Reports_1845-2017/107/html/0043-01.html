    <p class="summary" id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.6",64,[226,772,1182,431]]]'>We are of the opinion that the Treasurer’s sale of 1868 was void for want of jurisdiction. The Act of 29th of April 1844, expressly provided that “ no sale shall be made of such lands for the purpose aforesaid, until the owner or owners thereof shall have refused or neglected to pay the taxes 'aforesaid for the space of two years.” Neglect or refusal for the space of two years must precede the sale, and is essential to the jurisdiction of the Treasurer to sell land, if the same is in fact seated. Lapse of time may cure many irregularities, but cannot make valid a sale void for want of jurisdiction.</p>

Taxes due a year, land unseated and so sold, are the essentials to title.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b65-5" data-blocks='[["BL_65.5",65,[173,1137,1180,998]]]'>From the authorities, it would seem to be clearly settled that what is necessary to give a County Treasurer authority and jurisdiction to sell land for unpaid taxes is: 1st. That it be unseated. 2d. That it has been assessed with a tax by some lawful authority, and 3d, that the tax has been due and unpaid more than one year; and that any and all irregularities in the “ assessment or in the process,” by which it has reached the treasurer, or in his occasional omissions of duty, not prejudicial to the owner, are cured by the Act of 1815 or barred by the Act of 1804. (See opinion of C. J. THOMPSON in 7 P. F. S., on page 27.) These rules apply to and describe the situation of the plaintiff's land and title, and therefore the Court below erred in rendering judgment against him, for want of jurisdiction in the Treasurer to sell. The Court below holds that the land could not be sold either under the Act of 1844, or the Act of 1815, the result of which is that the taxes cannot be collected at all, which is clearly against the policy of the law. The conflict of construction, however, is/eadily compromised, and the lost taxes saved, by a proper application of the prohibitory provision of the 3d section of the Act of 1804 and the curative clause of the 4th section of the Act of 1815, to the irregularity of its assessment which wrought no injury to its owner.</p>
