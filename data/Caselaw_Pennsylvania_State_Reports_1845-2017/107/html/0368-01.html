A. gave B. a judgment note for $40, upon wMeh judgment was after-wards entered'by a third party to whom, the payee had transferred it. A. then filed a petition setting forth that B. came to his house and showed him some money, which “looked to be good money,” and offered to bring him $200 of it, within a few days, for $50 in cash; that A. had no casia, and B. accepted his judgment note for $40, payable in one year, in lieu of the $50 cash, but never delivered the $200; that A. afterwards discovered that the whole transaction was a fraud, and the note consequently without consideration. The petition therefore prayed that the judgment be opened and A. let in to a defence.</p>

Haj^den came to my house and showed me some money which looked to me to be good money, and told me he would give me two hundred dollars of it for fifty dollars. I did not wish to do so, but he talked to me and finally offered me two hundred dollars of it if I would give him $40. I had no money and told him so. He said he would take my note at one year. I finally gave him my note for $40, payable in one year and dated November 15th, 1882. He promised to bring me the,money in a few days. That I have since discovered the whole matter to be a fraud, and have never received the money which he promised, nor anypart thereof. The note is wholly without consideration. I therefore pray the court to open above judgment which was entered on said note, and let me into a defence.”</p>

The entry of a judgment on a warrant of attorney does not render the contract executed, and does not preclude an inquiry into the character of the consideration: Ham et al. <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/pa/87/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="87 Pa. 63" data-case-ids="1057852" data-case-paths="/pa/87/0063-01">87 Pa. St. 63</a>. The contract between Hayden and Kunkle was part parol and part written, in which Hayden promised to give Kunkle 8200 in one month from the 15th of November, 1882, in good money, and Kunkle gave Hayden his judgment note for 840, payable in one year. The same kind of a bargain was again made when Hayden received the $50 note. If a contract is enforced against one party it must be enforced as to the other. No court would compel Hayden to perform his promises. Yet the court below enforces upon Kunkle the performance of his part of the contract. The fact that the consideration to have been furnished by Hayden is alleged by the appellee to have been spurious money, is sufficient to render the contract void: Comly <em>v. </em>Hillegass, <a href="/pa/94/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="94 Pa. 132" data-case-ids="485925" data-case-paths="/pa/94/0132-01">94 Pa.
