By an agreement between B. and D. proceedings in partition were instituted in which B. took one share at the valuation, and the other share was sold by a trustee for a full price to one who was acting in D.’s interest, and convened to him.

Mary Dick died in 1869 or 1870 intestate, leaving her surviving her husband, the defendant, and two children, Joseph and Jeremiah. Joseph died soon after, an infant; and Jeremiah, who was sickly, survived about three years longer, during which time his father was his guardian. Joseph Guffey left also another daughter, Mrs. Rebecca Greenawalt, who was living when the transactions occurred which gave rise to the controversy in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-4" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[257,782,1185,1082]]]'>In the summer of 1871 Martha, who was then Mrs. Pinkerton and afterwards intermarried with J. D. Milligan, filed her petition in the Orphans’ Court for partition of the premises. The sheriff’s jury divided the land into two purparts, A. containing 57 acres 121 perches, appraised at $122.50 per acre; and B. containing 55 acres'138 perches, appraised at $115.41 per acre. A rule being entered on the heirs to appear and take or refuse the land at the valuation, the plaintiff, Martha, elected to take purpart B. at the appraised value and accordingly entered into recognizance to pay one half of the appraised value to Dick as the guardian of Jeremiah. The other purpart was not taken at the valuation and the court appointed Sheriff Kilgore as trustee to make sale of it. It was purchased by one Hamilton at $252 per acre, or $14,553 in all. The defendant paid the costs of the partition to the sheriff, amounting to $528.29, and gave him a receipt as guardian for one half the purchase money coming to his son, and also produced and delivered to the sheriff the plaintiff’s receipts for the other half of the purchase money. At the same time he satisfied the plaintiff’s recognizance for $8,221.71 given by her when she took purpart B. The sheriff executed and delivered to Hamilton a deed for the property, which he in turn shortly afterwards conveyed to Dick. Hamilton paid no money to the sheriff and was paid none by Dick for whom it was conceded he was acting.</p>

Mrs. Milligan then brought this suit to recover from Dick $7,012.35, the amount called for by the receipt she had given him to enable him to settle with the sheriff, less $3,221.71, the amount of her satisfied recognizance. The manner in which Mrs. Milligan’s receipt was obtained and the purpose of its procurement were questions of fact in dispute. The substance of the testimony in behalf of the plaintiff was that Mr. Dick told her that his son would not live to enjoy the land; that he himself did not want it; that she ought to buy it in at the sale ; that she could then convey the one half of part A. to her sister, Mrs. Greenawalt, and that the land would thus be kept in the line of the blood of Joseph Guffey, from whom it came. This accorded with the desire of the <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>plaintiff, and sbe expressed her intention of attending the sale and bidding on the land. She was prevented from doing so by the defendant, who said he would save her that trouble and have the land bid in for her; that he had thought of several men to do the bidding, and had finally selected ’Squire Hamilton.</p>

That this arrangement was concluded by the payment of the costs, $528.29, by Dick, and by the conveyance of one acre of purpart “A.” to Mrs. Milligan to equalize her acreage.

The plaintiff, therefore, has sustained no injury and cannot recover the money claimed out of .the purchase money on the Kilgore sale, and the inheritance to the land also. Therefore the plaintiff cannot recover in this case.</p>

If the proceedings and sale were fair and honest, and Dick was the purchaser, while not competent to buy the interest of his ward in his own right, he might purchase any other interest in the land. But as to the share of the ward, he could only hold it in trust for him or his heirs in case of his death.

If the contract was not so specific in its terms that a chancellor could enforce it, will the law protect him in withholding reimbursement of tbe money paid him on the faith of the contract? No principle is better settled than that tbe buyer can recover from the seller, for breach of a parol contract to sell and convey land, so much of the purchase money as was actually paid. It is no defence, that the terms of the contract were not specific and definite.

Nothing appears in the case to warrant the instruction given in answer to the defendant’s third and fourth points, namely, if the “plaintiff and defendant entered into any arrangement for the purpose of diverting the course of descent and securing the land to her, to the wrong and prejudice of the heirs of Mary Dick and Jeremiah Dick, of whom defendant was guardian, she would be <em>in pari </em>delicto, or a party to the wrong, and could not recover upon the strength of any promise made by the defendant.”</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[229,1168,1183,770]]]'>The defendant’s seventh and eighth points ought to have been refused. He purchased at judicial sale, by the agency of Hamilton, and the real question is, whether the plaintiff has been paid her share of the purchase money. The trustee who made the sale was entitled to receive the amount of the bid; instead, he took the receipts of the parties who would receive the money in the distribution. The defendant had the benefit of the entire share of the plaintiff in making paj'ment to the trustee; the validity of his title is not involved in this action. When the sale was confirmed, and the deed executed by the trustee, the title was vested in the purchaser, as respects the plaintiff. It is foreign to this issue to inquire whether the ward could, if he would, defeat the defendant’s title to any part of the land. The defendant has refused to convey to the plaintiff, and although the parol contract was vague in its terms and void under the Statute of Frauds, if there be no other defence, she can recover all the money paid him on account of the contract.</p>

In any view of the case, evidence that a number of years after the partition, the plaintiff had sold her land, and what was the price, was irrelevant; and it was impertinent in cross-examination, as it would have been in chief. It cast no light on the transactions involved in the issue.</p>
