A married woman, having no separate estate of ¡her own, cannot go to a person and contract to buy a house. That contract would amount to nothing. If there was anything deeded the title would be in the husband. This case is a step further in advance of that; this is a case where the wife gets the money — borrows the money, if you chose to call it so— from an old friend.It was owned by the bank, a third person; she borrows the money, a friend agrees to let .her have it, and she buys the property. The money is loaned <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>and she pays the cash, gets the deed and has her little home. The husband is in debt, and of course creditors have rights as well as anybody else.

The only fact for you to decide is this: Was this done in good faith ? Because, no matter how the money was gotten, if she and her husband had an understanding that they were to do this, get the money, put it in the property, and then he would give his bond with her, it would not be worth anything. The law would not permit that transaction at all. If that was done in that way you ought to have no hesitation as to your verdict. [But I think this would be the law : That if this lady borrowed the money in good faith, although she borrowed it, it would be buying it from a third person without the husband having anything to do with it — no arrangement about it in any way — in that case I think she could hold the property.] That view differs from the view’ of the learned counsel; but, as I say, I believe that to be the law, and so instruct yon in this case.</p>

Even if she have a separate estate, she cannot hold land purchased on credit, as against her husband’s creditors, unless she proves affirmatively that the same was purchased distinctly upon the credit of such separate estate: Bucher <em>v. </em>Ream, 18 P. F. S. 421; Lochman <em>v. </em>Brobst, 6 Out. 481; Leinbach <em>v. </em>Templin, 9 Out. 522. The above doctrine is applicable to this case; there is no difference in principle between the case where a married woman purchases land upon her personal credit, and where she borrows the money from a third person upon her personal credit with which to pay for laud purchased by her. In either case her bond given to secure the debt is void, but if executed also by the husband it is binding upon him-: Schlosser’s Appeal, 8 P. <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>F. S. 493; Quinn’s Appeal, 5 Norris 447. Mrs. Siegel, then, having no separate estate when this land was conveyed to her, the obligee in the bond is restricted in his remedy to Frank Siegel, the husband. His personal liability is the only obligation given to the lender of the $8,500 which purchased this land. It was his credit and the security of this land accompanying it which procured the means that purchased it; not the wife’s, for she had no separate estate, could make no contract, and therefore had no credit. This land, then, came to the wife through the husband’s means, his bond and covenants ; and at the time of its conveyance to her he was indebted to these plaintiffs in the debt upon which they recovered the judgment under which the land was sold to them, and it was liable to satisfy their judgment. Under the undisputed evidence in the case we submit that there was no question for the jury, and the court should have affirmed our point.</p>

But we assert that this case fulfils that condition. It was not a purchase upon credit, for the vendor was paid in full, in cash, by the wife, who acquired the money independently of her husband. The plaintiffs say — true, but she <em>borrowed </em>the money from Mrs. Gearhardt with which to pay the vendor, and as she could not bind herself by such contract to repay, the loan was made on her husband’s credit and the equitable title to the land became his. We answer, that it is immaterial to this issue whether Mrs. Gearhardt made a gift or a loan of the money to Mrs. Siegel. Mrs. Gearhardt is not here complaining, or seeking to enforce any contract either as against Mrs. Siegel or her husband or his creditors. Mrs. Gearhardt testified that when she offered the money to Mrs. Siegel and the latter said she could not pay her back, Mrs. Gearhardt replied: “Don’t worry about that; if you ever sell it you can pay me back.” That was the only stipulation at the time of the transaction. Mrs. Siegel testified that her husband “ didn’t want to consent to it at all.” At the time of the loan nothing was said by any one about credit or security; the'fact that a bond and mortgage was afterwards given by Mrs. Siegel, in which her husband joined for conformity, can have no effect upon the original transaction, which the jury has found was <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>bona ñdo. A married woman can mortgage her separate real estate, her husband joining, without rendering it liable to his creditors:- Brown <em>v. </em>Pendleton, 10 P. F. S. 419; Glass <em>v. </em>Warwick, 4 Wr. 140; Ramborger <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 2 Wr. 146 ; Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1 Casey 81. The fact is patent that Mrs. Siegel acquired the money independently of her husband or his credit; when in her hands it was her separate estate, and it is immaterial how she acquired it, otherwise than from her husband. She has shifted the burden of proof and rebutted the presumption that the money was her husband’s, and beyond that his creditors have no right to pry.</p>

Catherine Siegel, one of the defendants below, is a married woman; has never been a feme sole trader, and has not any separate estate. She bought the house and lot which is the subject of this controversy; took the deed in her own name, and paid for it wholly with money borrowed from a friend. Subsequently she joined with Frank Siegel, her husband, in giving a bond and mortgage upon the house for the borrowed money. The property was then levied on upon an execution issued upon a judgment recovered against her husband, and the right, title and. interest of the latter sold by the sheriff to the plaintiffs below, who brought this action of ejectment to recover the possession.

The disability of a married woman <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>to contract is a rule of the common law so familiar that a ¡reference to it seems almost unnecessary; and the Act of 1848 and its supplements did not, and were not intended to change the law in this respect except to bind her separate estate in special cases and in the manner therein specified. This is settled by abundant authority. It is sufficient to refer to Caldwell <em>v. </em>Walters, 6 Harris 79; Glyde <em>v. </em>Keister, 8 Casey 85; Keiper <em>v. </em>Helfricker, 6 Wr. 325; Steinman <em>v. </em>Ewing, 7 Id. 63; Schlosser’s Appeal, 8 P.

It is also a rule too firmly established in this state to be shaken, that a married woman cannot bujr either real or personal estate upon credit, unless she is the owner of a separate estate, in which case she contracts upon the credit of such estate: Robinson <em>v. </em>Wallace, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20129" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Wright 129">3 Wright 129</a>; Wieman <em>v. </em>Anderson, 6 Id. 311; Baringer <em>v. </em>Stiver, 13 Id. 129; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Toner, Id. 231; Rush <em>v. </em>Vought, 5 P.

S. at page 426, “If she (a married woman) purchases property with borrowed money or on credit, it belongs to her husband as it respects his creditors, and is liable for his debts.” The same doctrine was re-asserted in the recent case of Lochman <em>v. </em>Brobst, 6 Out. 481, and many of the authorities are there referred to.</p>

If Mrs. Siegfel had given the bond and mortgage of herself and her husband to the vendor for the purchase money, it is too plain for argument, under the authorities that the equitable title would have been in her husband, and liable for his debts. Does it make any difference that she paid the vendor the purchase money by means of a loan obtained from a friend ? We think not. It was still a credit. Upon whose credit ? Not upon her credit, certainly, for she had no personal credit; the law permits her none, and she had no separate estate upon the credit of which she could contract; The purchase was upon the credit of her husband; he gave his bond for the whole of the money, and upon a judgment recovered upon that bond his other property, if he has any, may be swept away and applied in payment for the real estate in controversy. In such case what would be the remedy of the creditors if we allowed the title of the wife to stand? It requires but a moment’s reflection to see that were we to sanction the doctrine contended for by the defendants in error, we would open the door to the most serious frauds. It would enable married women whose husbands are embarrassed, to buy upon credit, give the obligations of their husbands for <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>the purchase money, and apply his property through the machinery of the law in payment.</p>
