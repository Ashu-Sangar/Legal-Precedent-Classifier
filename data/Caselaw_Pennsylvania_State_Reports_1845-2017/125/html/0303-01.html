On December 21, 1875, by writing under seal, in which her husband joined “ to show his concurrence,” Diana Sandt assigned the policy to Andrew J. Brown, one of the defendants in the present bill. Diana Sandt died in the year 1884, leaving to srrrvive her seven cliidren who are the other defendants in the bill. Daniel P. Sandt died the present year.

The Germania Life Insurance Company is a corporation of the state of New York, having its home office in the city of New York. So far it appears this company has no branch office anywhere. It is not pretended that the company ever delegated its right to accept or reject proposals to any one. It follows, in the absence of any direct evidence one way or the other on the subject, that in the case at bar the proposals must have been accepted in the state of New York, which, as has been seen, makes the consequent policy a New York contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b330-6" data-blocks='[["BL_330.5",330,[267,1128,1187,1276]]]'>This much being established, and bearing in mind that the assignment in question was made December 21,1875, what remains for decision is free from difficulty. In Frank v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., 3 Cent. R. 414, it was expressly decided by the New York Court of Appeals, that an assignment made in 1869 by the wife, of a policy of insurance held by her upon the life of her husband, was absolutely void. In delivering the opinion of the court in that case, Rapallo, J., says: “In 1873 the doctrine of those cases,” referring to many previous decisions to the same effect as the principal case, “ was recognized by the legislature by conferring upon married women the power to assign their policies, when they had no children, on complying with certain formalities: Laws of 1873, chap. 341; and in 1879 full power to assign was conferred upon them without those conditions, provided the husband consented to the assignment: Laws of 1879, chap. 248.” We make this citation for the purpose of pointing out the difference between Frank v. Mutual Life Ins. Co. of N. Y., <a href="/citations/?q=55%20Am.%20Rep.%20809" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="55 Am. Rep. 809">55 Am. Rep. 809</a>, and the case of Anderson v. Goldsmidt, 5 Cent. R. 787, so much relied on by the learned counsel for Mr. Brown. In the latter case the assignment was made after the act of 1879, and was sustained for that reason. In the former case, as in the case at bar, the assignment was made before the act of 1878, and it was declared void for that reason. For the same reason the present assignment must be declared void.</p>

In 1865 the Ger-mania Life Insurance Company, a New York corporation, issued a policy of insurance upon the life of Daniel P. Sandt, a citizen of Pennsylvania, for two thousand dollars. It was made payable to Diana Sandt, the wife of the insured, for her sole use, with a provision that “ in case of the death of the said <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>Diana Sandt before tbe decease of the said Daniel P. Sandt, tlio amount of the said insurance shall be payable after her death to her children for their use, or to their guardian if under age.” In 1875 both husband and wife joined in an assignment of the policy to A. J. Brown, the appellant. In 1884 Diana Sandt died leaving her husband and seven children to survive her. In 1888 Daniel P. Sandt, the insured, died. The assignee of the policy and the children of Mrs. Sandt made claim to the amount of the policy, and the company properly asked the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton county, where all the claimants lived, for leave to pay the money into court, and that the claimants interplead with each other. If the assignment of Mrs. Sandt was effectual to vest in her assignee a good title to the policy, then he was entitled to the fund.</p>

The extent and character of her title appeared plainly on the face of the policy. She was the payee named in the first instance, but the promise to her was not an absolute and unconditional promise to pay to her, or to her administrators, executors or assigns, but a promise to pay her upon condition that she was living when the policy should fall due.</p>

Tlieir right to the money depended upon the terms of the contract, which was payable to them if she "vyas not living at the death of the insured. They were parties to the contract, as truly as she was, and with as clear a right to sue upon it, upon the happening of the contingency that made them the payees, as she could have had if living. Her assignment put her assignee in no better position than she occupied, and conferred upon him no greater interest in the policy. Her death in the lifetime of her husband extinguished her interest in the policy, and it can no more survive in the hands of her assignee than in her administrator. The condition on which her right to recover was to end, and that of her children was to arise has happened, and the contract of the insurance company is now with the children, and must be enforced by them for their benefit.</p>
