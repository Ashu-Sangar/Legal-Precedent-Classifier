Subsequently at a time when the Scheppers had paid 88 per cent of their indebtedness with interest at seven per cent, there was a third extension agreement, to which, however, the Dunn Brothers declined to become parties.

They were then held as collateral security for a loan of $30,000. This loan was soon taken up and paid by the Bullocks. Six of these notes for $5,000 each, were then discounted by the Dunns and the other two were held as collateral. The Dunns asserted that these two were held as collateral for all the indebtedness of the Bullocks to them. Your auditor finds, however, that they were held as collateral security for the sum of $1,500 only. On September 12, 1873, the Dunns resold to the Bullocks two of these six notes. On September 17, 1873, the Dunns bought two more Scheppers’ notes of the Bullocks, each for $5,000. Afterwards, about the date of this purchase, to wit, September 17, 1873, the Dunns sold to the Tradesmen’s Bank one of these notes, and that note then finally passed out of the possession and ownership of the Dunns. The result of'this transaction was that at the time of the failure of the Bullocks, September 27, 1873, the Dunns should have had in their possession, as collateral security, two Scheppers’ notes for $5,000 each, and only five notes which they had discounted. But they also held one note to which they had no title whatever, for which they had given nothing at all, and which was the property of Bullock’s Sons as against them, the Dunns, and <a id="p602" href="#p602" data-label="602" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*602</a>the possession of which they are entirely unable to explain; all of these notes, without exception, being notes issued by Seheppers Brothers expressly for the purpose of furnishing the Bullocks with funds with which to buy wool on commission for the Seheppers. The facts about this last note came to the knowledge of the Seheppers only in 1881. They had paid precisely the same amount of money upon it as they had paid upon the other notes; that is, they paid 88 per cent of the principal and interest at the rate of 7 per cent, and they are therefore entitled now to be credited with the amount paid upon this note on account of any liability on any other notes.</p>

Nor is it a matter of any importance to the S choppers whether the general collateral referred to be treated as covering only the said two notes, or as including also the other undiscounted note.</p>

S., and but for the finding of the master upon the present issues, it would have seemed no easy matter to set up a plausible defence to the plaintiff’s claim. What was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to have been the error of the rulings below in the bank case was, we think, the same view which, governed the master here, namely, that the contract which in this case is shown- to have been made between the firm of Benjamin Bullock’s Sons and Dunn Brothers was so far of an illegal and immoral char<a id="p603" href="#p603" data-label="603" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*603</a>acter as to tlirow a doubt over the whole of plaintiff’s contention.</p>

Bullock, acting for the firm, had every right to use them as collateral security for loans in the manner he did, when he deposited them with Dunn Brothers. The question as to what was the nature of the agreement which was made between Joseph W. Bullock and the Dunn Brothers is a plain one. That agreement was undoubtedly that all the notes deposited by Bullocks with the Dunns should stand as a continuing collateral security for any loans or discounts which the latter might make for the benefit of Benjamin Bullock’s Sons while the deposit lasted; in this aspect of the case, every difficulty disappears and the conduct of the parties is natural and sensible; without such an arrangement, most of what was done exhibits no motive or reason, is without consistent explanation, and leads to no intelligent end.</p>
