I got these notes in my possession when I paid them. You can see when that was, on the notes; when they fell due at the Miners Bank at Pottsville. I bought Stratton and James’s interests in the colliery at sheriff’s sale. They could not carry it on. If my memory is right I bought the colliery for the claim which I had against it, $12,000. I had not paid that at that time; I only paid the notes when they fell due. I think one note was paid; the others were in the hands of Emanuel Strauss.” The court found, inter alia, as follows : “ The weight of the evidence is, and we find, that in consideration of the confession of this judgment [No. 773 June Term 1859], and his purchase of the interest of Stratton and James in the colliery, Bast agreed to pay the other notes which he had indorsed for Stratton and James to Hexter, and also to release the mortgage given to him by William James and Susanna James.....That the real estate described in the mortgage was the property of Susanna James, owned by her in her own right; that when she inquired as to the nature of the paper she was requested to sign, her husband told her that it would not hurt her, and beyond this no explanation was given; that no examination of Mrs. James, such as was required by law, was made by the magistrate nor did he take her acknowledgment of the mortgage.” Upon the foregoing and other findings, the court on February 14,1876, entered judgment in the scire facias for the defendants.

Hexter, having taken an assignment of the mortgage and these notes without recourse to Bast, would be bound by his contract in that respect. If it turned out that the parties who were obligated by the mortgage and notes wore unable to pay them, it would be a contract between the parties which would bind the plaintiff in this action. But it was claimed here that there was fraud, misrepresentation, deceit, practiced by Bast in assigning this mongage and these notes to Hexter, and it is a well known rule of law that fraud will vitiate all contracts into which it may enter. The question you are to determine is, whether at the time of the assignment of the mortgage and notes to Hexter, there was such misrepresentation, such fraud, such deceit practiced upon Hexter, as would authorize him to bring an action to recover from Bast damages which he sustained in consequence of such misrepresentation.</p>

There was evidence in that case — it is hardly necessary for me to discuss it, only it has been referred to before you by counsel to an extent which I think was scarcely warranted — there was evidence in that case that is not in this case. Parties were sworn then that are not sworn now, and the reasons for the action of the court in that case, the reasons for their conclusions, are not matters for your consideration.

The whole of it must be taken into consideration, of course, in making up your minds as to the effect you will give it. He, first, as read to by counsel, swears that lie never agreed to release James, if he would give him a judgment. He states he paid these notes as they fell due, or one was paid; that is, he lifted them as they fell due; one was paid and the others in the hands of Emanuel Strauss, and it would seem subsequently passed into the hands of Bast.

But the usual rule is that the payment of the mortgage will extinguish the notes secured by the mortgage, and the payment of the notes will extinguish the mortgage which it is intended to secure.</p>

That the agreement of November 1, 1870, which Gideon Bast executed at the time he delivered over the assignment of the mortgage against William James and Susanna James for $12,500, recorded in Mortgage Book O, page 203, and the three promissory notes, dated May 1, 1858, for $1,166.66 each, to Abraham Plexter, the plaintiff in this case, certified and represented that no payment had been made on the said mortgage and notes, except the amounts as credited on the judgment which Bast held against Stratton and James, by the sheriff’s sale of the interest of Stratton and James in the personal property, which appears from the evidence, amounted to $1,500, less the amount due for labor liens, and from the sale of Stratton’s real estate; but there is no evidence in the case that Stratton’s real estate was sold, or that any sum was realized that could be credited on the mortgage and notes.</p>

It is a mere recital of the facts, and asks us to say to you that there is no evidence in the ease that Stratton’s real estate was sold. The only evidence, I believe, upon that subject, is in the paper which passed between Hexter and Bast on the day of the assignment, November 1, 1870, when the agreement of settlement was entered into, in which paper, Mr. Bast certifies that he received nothing on the notes, except what he received through the judicial sale of the personal estate of James and Stratton and the sale of the real estate of Stratton. What sheriff Hobart sold, except what he sold at the colliery, does not ap¿)ear. I must say to you that this branch of the case is very unsatisfactory to me, as I suppose it will be to you, because the ground for damages ought to be plainly shown. Inasmuch as Mr. Hexter had notice here that Bast did not transfer to him the whole amount of the notes, that he only transferred to him what had been left after taking out of it the proceeds of the judicial sale of Stratton and James’ interest, and the sale of Stratton’s real estate, it is very important for a jury to know exactly what those amounted to, in order to ascertain what really was assigned to Plexter. Neither party has shown that. It has been shown that the personal property, as I understand it, was sold for $4,500. There is nothing here to show what the real estate was sold for, if there was any real estate sold, and you are thus left in the dark upon what I regard as a very important matter in this case.5</p>

Chief Justice Sharswood, delivering the opinion, said: “It was held at first that in an action on the case for deceit against a party who had sold a personal chattel to the plaintiff, to which he had no title, that it was necessary to aver a scienter. But this doctrine was subsequently exploded, and an averment of possession considered sufficient, as the vendor must be intended cognizant of his own title, the sale being necessarily an affirmation of title. It may now be regarded as well settled, that a party, selling as his own, personal property of which he is in possession, warrants the title to the thing sold, and that if by reason of defect of title, nothing passes, the purchaser may recover back his money, though there be no fraud or warranty on the part of the vendor. This doctrine is held to apply to choses in action as well as other descriptions of personal property.” This was a sale of shares of stock which turned out to be a fraudulent over-issue of stock. The court says: “ Shares of stock in a corporation are choses in action, giving a right to dividends and an interest in the capital. The certificate is the evidence of such ownership, and there can be no doubt that if the certificate is forged, or the holder is not such bona fide, so that he has no claim on the corporation, the vendor would be liable to his vendee on the implied warranty of title.” The question was argued here at some length as to implied warranty, and this case seems from what I gather to meet this point.9</p>

To support it the rule requires that the plaintiff must show that the representations under which he acted were untrue, known by the defendant to be untrue; that they were such as were calculated to induce the plaintiff to act, and that he, believing those representations, acted in accordance with his belief. The representations <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>must be both false and fraudulent. A positive statement of a falsehood, or suppression of material facts which the plaintiff ought to have known, would constitute the falsity: ” Cox v.

The falsity does not consist simply in stating that which is untrue; it may sometimes consist in suppressing or keeping concealed what is true. If the jury believe that the defendant acted honestly, that he believed that what he stated was true, then this form of action could not be sustained, although another form of action might be. This is the general rule governing actions of this character, actions of deceit, actions for alleged fraudulent representations which induce a party to act to his hurt, and which give him a right to recover in consequence of the injury he has sustained through the fraud or misrepresentation of the party with whom he is acting.] 18</p>

In an action of ejectment, the pleadings are so general that 'they do not show the grounds for a recovery. Does the same rule hold in a scire facias sur mortgage ? The writ recites the mortgage with particularity. The issue is made up by pleading, and nothing can be tried except what appears within the four corners of the pleadings, set out' with such particularity as to leave no doubt as to what was tried, and upon what a verdict or judgment was based: See Coleman’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20272" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="62 Pa. 272">62 Pa. 272</a>; Zeigler v.

While parol evidence may be received to explain and limit the effect of a judgment, wherever it is not inconsistent with the record, none of the cases hold that you can read the testimony of living witnesses taken upon the former trial. Gideon Bast was a witness upon the trial of the scire facias, and, being dead at the trial of this case, his testimony as taken was read by the plaintiff.</p>

The papers of date November 1,1870, are to be considered as constituting a single transaction, and the question is whether taken together they constitute a warranty of title. There is certainly no express warranty, because there are no words which amount to an undertaking that the defendant would be responsible in any event for the obligations transferred to the plaintiff. There was no implied warranty. Mere representation does not constitute a warranty: McFarland v. Newman, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%2055" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="9 W. 55">9 W. 55</a>; Whitaker v. Eastwick, <a href="/citations/?q=75%20Pa.%20231" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="75 Pa. 231">75 Pa. 231</a>. The transfer of the mortgage, as well as the notes, was made, by express agreement, without recourse to Gideon Bast in any event whatever. The employment of that language, which is in the contract of sale between the parties, excludes the possibility of warranty as to title or otherwise: Chitty on Bills, 288; 1 Parsons on Contracts, 460; Baglehole v. Walters, 3 Camp. 154; Schneider v. Heath, 3 Camp. 208.</p>

It is contended that the plaintiff could have recovered either upon an express or implied warranty, and that the question of misrepresentation, fraud or deceit, had no bearing upon his right to. recover in case of a warranty. Such is not the rule in Pennsylvania. This court has decided in a number of cases that there is a broad distinction between an action on the case for deceit, and an action in assumpsit upon a warranty. In the former case the warranty may be given in evidence for the purpose of showing the representations, but in addition it must be averred and proved that the representations were known to be false : Erie City I. Works v. Barber, <a href="/citations/?q=102%20Pa.%20163" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="102 Pa. 163">102 Pa. 163</a>; s. c., <a href="/pa/118/0006-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="118 Pa. 6" data-case-ids="556763" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0006-01">118 Pa. 6</a>. Applying the principle stated in the case last cited, we find that the original declaration in this case was in assumpsit, and subsequently, after the statute barred a recovery for any cause of action different from that set out originally, an amended declaration was filed, not in assumpsit upon a warranty, but in case for fraud and deceit. It therefore became <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>material for the plaintiff to prove a scienter: Erie City I. Works v.

    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.6",94,[241,563,1186,767]]]'>This is an action on the case for deceit. Some of the counts in the declaration might perhaps be read as for an injury arising ex contractu; but, as the plaintiff stated at the trial that the injury complained of arose ex delicto, that the original as well as the amended declaration set forth a cause of action in deceit, and the defendants, conforming to that theory of the case, entered a plea of not guilty, we will consider the questions presented as they were presented at the trial in the court below. It would be unfair to the learned judge to do otherwise, for it would appear that it was upon this suggestion of counsel the amended declaration was filed, and the trial conducted as in deceit. The plaintiff' having thus indicated to the court his election to consider the counts as for deceit, the cause should be considered as if the pleadings were consistent and the- action wholly in that form.</p>
    <p id="b94-7" data-blocks='[["BL_94.7",94,[238,1338,1186,406]]]'>Some of the counts are for deceit, by means of fraudulent misrepresentations, and some upon a fraudulent breach of warranty, and all are based upon the certificate accompanying the transfer of the notes and mortgage, which it is claimed creates an express warranty of the facts therein contained. The plaintiff avers that by means of this warranty, which was false and fraudulent, the defendant in his lifetime sold, and the plaintiff was induced to buy, the securities in question.</p>
    <p id="b94-8" data-blocks='[["BL_94.8",94,[236,1751,1184,559]]]'>This involves the construction not only of the certificate, but of the various transfers and the release, which, it must be conceded, taken together constitute a single transaction. A warranty, although a collateral contract, must form part of the transaction involving the sale. If the vendor have the possession no special form of words is necessary to create it; an affirmation at the time of the sale is sufficient, provided it was so intended. It is enough, if the words used are not equivocal, and if it appears from the Avhole evidence that the affirm-ant intended to warrant, and did not express a mere matter of judgment or opinion: Warren v. Phila. Coal Co., <a href="/pa/83/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="83 Pa. 437" data-case-ids="1050749" data-case-paths="/pa/83/0437-01">83 Pa. 437</a>.</p>

    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[232,722,1177,1030]]]'>The matters set forth in the certificate were certainly not the expression of a mere opinion, or of the defendant’s judgment, in reference to any matter of which he might or might not be correctly informed; it was the positive statement of a fact which was peculiarly and indeed exclusively within his knowledge, and the statement was one upon which Ilexter had a right to rely. That it was intended as a warranty cannot be questioned, and, whether it was or not, was a question of law to be determined by the court upon an examination and construction of the paper. But it must be confined to the particular matters specified therein ; it has no reference and contains no statements, as to the proper execution of the mortgage, nor is there any evidence that the defective acknowledgment of the mortgage was known to Bast. That he knew his certificate was false, however, is apparent, for, although when called as a witness on the trial of the scire facias, he denied having released James and wife, yet he confessed that- he purchased the mortgaged premises at the sheriff’s sale for the claim lie had against it, $12,500, and this is in accord with the plaintiffs claim in the present case.</p>
    <p id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[227,1761,1180,609]]]'>It is true the transfer of the mortgage, which was admittedly the only available security, was “ without recourse to the said Gideon Bast in any event whatever.” These words have no technical import, perhaps, in the transfer of noil-negotiable instruments ; they are important only as they may indicate the understanding of the parties, that the plaintiff should take the mortgage subject to every risk, as well the solvency of the parties, as the validity of the mortgage itself ; but there is no process of reasoning that could extend the effect of this clause to prevent his liability for the eotemporaneous, positive, though fraudulent, representation and warranty, that nothing had been paid upon it, except as stated.</p>
    <p id="b95-7" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[273,2380,1133,43]],["BL_96.1",96,[216,354,1214,859]]]'>The general rule is, that to support an action of deceit, pro<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>perly so called, it must appear that the fraudulent representation complained of was untrue; that the defendant knew, or ought to have known, at the time it was made, that it was untrue ; that it was calculated to induce the plaintiff to act upon it, and that, believing it to be true, he was induced to act accordingly: Cox v. Highley, <a href="/pa/100/0249-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="100 Pa. 249" data-case-ids="498383" data-case-paths="/pa/100/0249-01">100 Pa. 249</a>. As a general rule, the statement must be both false and fraudulent; but, if a person take ‘ upon himself to state as true, that of which he is wholly ignorant, he will, if it be false, incur the same legal responsibility as if'he had made the statement with knowledge of its falsity: the fraud consists in representing that he knows that of which he in fact is consciously ignorant. So, too, if a person is thrown off his guard and deceived, by a false and fraudulent warranty, it is sufficient to prove the warranty broken, to establish the deceit: Addison on Torts, 1181; for one will be presumed to know of the existence or non-existence of a fact which he undertakes to warrant.</p>
    <p id="b96-5" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[233,1231,1189,1178]],["BL_97.1",97,[194,355,1180,302]]]'>The first and third assignments of error are to the refusal of the plaintiff’s offer to read the record of the action on the scire facias. The first embraced the offer of the entire record, including the testimony taken in the cause; and the third embraced only the findings of fact, the conclusions of law, and the judgment entered thereon. The action was in the name of Hexter, to whom the mortgage had been assigned, in the form and manner regulated by statute; Bast had no notice of the proceeding and had no control over it; he had no light to adduce testimony, or to cross-examine the witnesses, and could not have reviewed the judgment. But the judgment was, notwithstanding this, admissible to show that Hexter had exhausted his legal remedies, and had failed to recover ; and we think it was competent for the plaintiff to exhibit the issue formed by the pleadings, in order that it might appear upon Avhat ground the judgment went against him, and, if these Avere too general in form for that purpose, it Avas proper for him to resort to the findings of fact, the conclusions of Iuav, and the judgment entered thereon. These findings were perhaps hot receivable in evidence as proof of the facts stated therein, but they were without doubt evidence of the exact^nd particular ground of the defendants’ recovery. If that trial had been by jury, other methods of proof recognized in our practice would <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>necessarily liave been pursued, but tlie formal findings filed of record certainly furnished the best evidence of this fact of which the case was capable. The general principles upon which this proof was admissible are illustrated in the cases of Kauffelt v. Leber, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0093-01" class="citation" data-index="47" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 93" data-case-ids="12169016" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0093-01">9 W. &amp; S. 93</a>; Follansbee v.

    <p id="b97-5" data-blocks='[["BL_97.4",97,[190,665,1193,1336]]]'>It is said that the findings of the court in the previous case were read in the hearing of the jury, in connection with the offer of the judgment, without objection; but, even if this were so, their legitimate and proper effect was wholly neutralized in the charge, as will appear by an extract from it as follows : “ The fact, the judgment of the court,” says the learned judge, “ that he could not recover in that action, is before you, because had he then recovered, he would have no ground of action now, and it is only because he then failed to recover in the proceedings on the mortgage against the property of Mrs. James, as a married woman, that he is authorized now to come into court and claim to recover in this action. There was evidence in that case — it is hardly necessary for me to discuss it, only it has been referred to before you by counsel, to an extent which I think was scarcely warranted — there was evidence in that case that is not in this case. Parties were sworn then that are not sworn now, and the reasons for the action of the court in that case, the reasons for these conclusions, are not matters for your consideration. The conclusion itself, namely, that Ilexter failed to recover is before you in evidence, and properly, as showing the right to institute this action.” The court was right, we think, in excluding the testimony of the witnesses, in admitting the judgment, and also the testimony of Bast; but we think the offer of the pleadings, of the findings of fact, and conclusions of law, were also admissible, for the particular and special purpose stated.</p>
    <p id="b97-6" data-blocks='[["BL_97.5",97,[187,2009,1178,303]]]'>We are of opinion, also, that it was proper to prove that there was a suit in equity between Hexter and Bast, although this does not appear to have been very important, for the purpose of showing the matter out of which came the release, and to show the consideration upon which the transfer of tlie securities and the warranty were based.</p>
