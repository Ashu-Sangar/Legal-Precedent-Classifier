They stand upon an agreement of facts which differs only as to the term of office and the amount of commissions paid to the defendants, respectively, by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, whilst they occupied the office of county treasurer, for services performed to and on behalf of the state. These services were duties which they were required to discharge for the benefit of the state, and had relation solely to the collection, safe keeping and payment over of the portion of the revenue of the commoirwealth which had been received by them for the use of the state. To Martin was paid as commissions the. sum of $17,952.32, and to Irving the sum of $20,479.03. That each of the defendants properly performed the duties which were enjoined upon them by law, in the collection of the public moneys and payment of the same to the city and state, is fully admitted; and it is also agreed that they settled their accounts as city treasurer with the controller of the city; that the city solicitor entered satisfaction upon their official bonds and upon the judgments entered thereon, under the authority of ordinances of the city, passed for that purpose; the controller having certified that their accounts had been settled and that there was no default thereon. The only question presented for the decision of the <a id="p589" href="#p589" data-label="589" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*589</a>court is, whether the commissions which were paid to the defendants by the state belong to the city of Philadelphia and should have been paid into the city treasury; or whether they are the property of the defendants and are of right retained by them. The contention of the plaintiffs is founded oh the fifth section of article XIV. of the constitution of the state and the act of March 31, 1876. The said fifth section provides, that the compensation for county officers shall be regulated by law, and that all such officers, who are or may be salaried, shall pay all fees which they may be authorized to receive into the treasury of the county or state, as may be directed by law. There is in this section the further provision that in counties containing over a hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants all county officers shall be paid by salary.</p>

Such officers are forbidden to receive fees for their own use or for any other use, except for the use of the county- or state, for any official service whatever. Sections 9 and 15 are also regarded by the plaintiff as supporting their contention. The ninth section requires county officers who shall collect collateral inheritance taxes and taxes- due the state, on writs or legal proceedings, or fees otherwise belonging to the state, to pay the same quarterly into the state treasury. To this is added the declaration that all commissions on the collection of such taxes as are now, or may hereafter be, allowed by law shall be deemed and taken as part of the regular fees of the officer collecting the same, and shall be accounted for accordingly. The fifteenth section provides that salaries shall be in lieu of moneys, fees, perquisites or mileage, which are now, or may hereafter be, received by any officer named in the act, and when received by county officers as compensation, fees or perquisites, from any source whatever, shall in all cases belong to the county, and shall be paid into the treasury, except when required to be paid to the state. The answer which the defendants make to this claim of the city is, that the settlement <a id="p590" href="#p590" data-label="590" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*590</a>with the city controller is final and conclusive between the parties, as it was made with full knowledge of all the facts by the authorized officer of the city; that there is no pretence of fraud, accident or mistake of any kind or in any degree entering into'the settlement, which ended with councils directing the city solicitor to enter satisfaction on the official bonds of the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b614-5" data-blocks='[["BL_614.4",614,[254,707,1185,302]]]'>It is also, and even more strongly contended that the city treasurer, in acting for the state in the collection of its revenues, performs distinct and separate duties, which are imposed on him by the laws of the commonwealth, and that in the discharge of these duties he does not act for the city or in his capacity of city treasurer, but as the officer, agent or employee of the state,</p>

This line of policy, which was adopted prior to 1794, has never been departed from, for the reason that time and experience have fully tested both its usefulness and its efficiency. Nothing has been found injurious to the state or the county by requiring the same officer to serve two masters- at the same time, because the interests of the two do not conflict. That the position in which county treasurers stand under the law is, in some respects, anomalous, may be admitted; but if they are to be regarded as holding two distinct offices at the same time, why should that not be allowed, when the functions of the two are not incompatible or repugnant. The legislature have continuously in effect declared that there is no repugnancy, and this ought to be regarded as a conclusive answer to all objections upon this ground.</p>

The condition reads: “ He shall keep safe and account for all moneys received by him for the use of the commonwealth, and shall faithfully discharge all duties assigned to him by law in behalf of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.” The bond which is given to the city is conditioned to perform the duties of city treasurer as the same are defined by law and the ordinances of the city of Philadelphia. In every essential particular these bonds differ; each one standing by itself and for the benefit of its separate obligees, and is given to secure different and independent results; one to protect the county and the other the interests of the state.</p>

The rate at which such compensation has been made has always been prescribed by law, being in the form of commissions or percentage on the amount collected. This has never been treated or designated as a fee or as fees; indeed, the meaning of commissions or percentage, as established by immemorial legal usage, is so wholly different from the meaning of the word fees, when used to designate compensation for legal services performed by an officer, that it is impossible to mistake the one as meaning that which is signified by the other. Prior to the passage of the act of March 31, 1876, the commissions paid by <a id="p592" href="#p592" data-label="592" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*592</a>the state were never treated as fees, and were never regarded as being anything different from commissions paid to otlier persons for servios of like character, as those paid to an executor or administrator, trustee, agent or attorney.</p>

It was decided in the case of The Commonwealth v. Laub, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 435" data-case-ids="1854651" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0435-01">3 W. &amp; S. 435</a>, that by the forty-ninth section of the act of April 15, 1834, P. L. 546, the accounts of county treasurers of moneys received for the use of the commonwealth must be settled by county auditors, and not by the auditor general. It was stated, on the argument of this case, that the account of one county treasurer had been settled by the controller of Philadelphia, who by law exercises the powers and functions formerly possessed by county auditors. If The Commonwealth v. Laub was ever considered as a correct exposition of the law touching this question, it has been, so far as is known, disregarded by the legislature, and, as we have been informed, by the city controllers, county auditors and auditors general ever since, with the one exception to which we have referred.</p>

The act does not seem to us to take from the commonwealth’s accounting officer the right, or relieve him from the performance of the duty of settling the accounts of county treasurers, in relation to the moneys of the state in their hands. If the act of 1834 is still in force, the auditor general may, in the exercise of his discretion, call upon county auditors to audit, settle and adjust <a id="p593" href="#p593" data-label="593" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*593</a>the accounts of county treasurers and other county officers, but his superior jurisdiction and control over the same has not been taken from him by the act of 1834.

The court say that bond given to the city is given by the city treasurer as such; that it is an official bond given in his character as city treasurer; but that the duties imposed on him by the state, and for the state, are in no sense a part of his duties as treasurer of the city; that the city is no party to these duties, and is not concerned with regard to them. We think that this position, on which the defendants mainly rest their resistance to the claim of the city, is well taken, because the county treasurer cannot be regarded as an officer of the city or county when he does not act for the municipality nor under its control, and is not accountable to it.

If it was intended that salaries were to be substituted for compensation, in the form of commissions paid by the state to its collecting officers and agente, as we understand the law, this has not yet been done, and until such action is taken, the law as it stood at the time of the adoption of the constitution, which regulates the payment of such commissions, remains in full force and effect: Perot’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0335-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="86 Pa. 335" data-case-ids="1056608" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0335-01">86 Pa. 335</a>; Crawford Co. v.

If the act of 1876 is applicable only to county officers when acting for the local or municipal authority which they represent, and does not apply to such officer when performing duties to the state, under special requirement of thq commonwealth, the act drops out of the cause, as having no proper <a id="p595" href="#p595" data-label="595" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*595</a>standing in it.

Moreover, by the condition of the official bond to the city, the city controller is authorized to determine, finally and conclusively, the amount of any default that may happen, enter judgment therefor, and issue execution, which shall not be opened or set aside at the instance of the obligor or his sureties.
