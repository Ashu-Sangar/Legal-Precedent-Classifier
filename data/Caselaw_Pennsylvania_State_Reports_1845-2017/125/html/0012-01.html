It directs how the sale shall be advertised and defines the effects of it. The mode of procedure, therefore, having been provided, it must be followed. The act of 1806, provides that “ in all cases where a remedy is provided or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by an act or acts of assembly of this commonwealth, the direction of said act shall be strictly pursued.” Numerous decisions have settled the law, that by force of this act, when a remedy is pointed out in an act of assembly it is exclusive of all others.

Subsequently, and while this writ was in the hands of the sheriff in full force and unexecuted, a second execution came into his hands.

    <p class="summary" id="b39-5" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[207,776,1178,967]]]'>Justice Paxson in Ms opinion, says: “ The precise question for our determination, under the case stated, is whether it was the duty of the sheriff when informed by the special levy contained in execution No. 88 October Term 1875 (the second execution), of the interest of Lloyd in the firm referred to, to have levied upon said interest under the prior execution No. 55 September Term 1875 (the first execution); and, if so, whether such levy upon such prior writ, would have been entitled to priority of distribution. Eacb of these propositions must be answered in the negative. Since the passage of the act of 1873, the mode therein prescribed must be pursued. As writ No. 55 September Term 1875, did not conform to the act, the sheriff was under no duty to levy, upon the partnership interest under it, and if he had done so, upon distrilration it would have been postponed to the latter.” It may be said that Hare v. Commonwealth does not exactly decide the question before us, but the dictum of Justice Paxson squarely ruled it. He is too eminent a jurist to announce in an opinion, what is not law.</p>

    <p id="b43-5" data-blocks='[["BL_43.4",43,[239,457,1185,868]]]'>In Kaine’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20278" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="92 Pa. 278">92 Pa. 278</a>, the executions, instead of containing a special command to the sheriff to levy on defendant’s interest in the firm of which he was a member, were in the ordinary form. Under both writs, however, the sheriff levied on that interest, as though he had been specifically directed to do so, and on the first writ, he sold the interest so levied on, and realized therefrom the money in court for distribution. The other writ was returned with the levy, and a venditioni exponas thereon was afterwards issued. This court, recognizing the validity of the sale on the first writ, awarded the money to it. The present Chief Justice, speaking for the court in that case, said: “ These executions were in the usual form, and the sheriff might well have refused to make a levy under them. But he did levy and sell, and the money 'is now in court for distribution and claimed on each writ. To which must it be applied ? Obviously to the one on which the sale was made. The record shows that it was made on the Kaine writ,” etc.</p>

Commonwealth, <a href="/pa/92/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="92 Pa. 141" data-case-ids="490918" data-case-paths="/pa/92/0141-01">92 Pa. 141</a>, as ruling that a levy, made under an execution in the ordinary form, upon a defendant’s interest in a partnership is void and of no effect. In that, we think, he misapprehended the principle involved in that case. There, as here, two executions had been issued against a common debtor, the first in the ordinary form, and the second in the special form authorized by the supplement of 1873. The sheriff still had the first in his hands, unexecuted, when the second came into his possession. Both he and the plaintiff in the first writ were theretofore unaware that defendant had any such interest in the partnership. It was held that the sheriff when informed of the fact, was not bound to levy on the partnership interest, under the first writ, and he did not do so, because he was not so directed by the writ. In the case at bar, the sheriff, acting under verbal directions, did make an actual levy on the defendant’s interest in the partnership of Bueftner &amp; Stoneback, at least one day before appellee’s writ was issued. The levy thus made was good, as against the subsequent special execution and levy, subject to the first levy, and the fund raised by the sale is applicable to appellant’s exeeu<a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>tion. In any view that can be taken of the sheriff’s returns, whether we regard them as returning the money made out of the sale of defendant’s individual personal property, or out of sale of his interest in the partnership of which he was then a member, the appellee is not entitled to the fund in controversy.</p>
