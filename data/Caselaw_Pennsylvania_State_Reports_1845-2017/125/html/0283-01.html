      <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>By the terms of the bond the Homestead was liable for the debt, and is, primarily, the fund to which other creditors of defendants could compel Brooke to first resort for payment. What then is the contention of defendants, as shown by the depositions and documentary evidence submitted to the court ? Many of the material allegations in defendant’s petition are not sustained by the facts. The court can find no evidence from which defendant’s first allegation, to wit: of fraud, is maintainable, or anything reflecting upon the character of the gentlemen assailed. These very persons have been made the defendant’s witnesses and they are bound by their testimony. Neither fraud nor want of consideration appears; even Daniel Kemmerer in his deposition does not swear to any fraud. The next contention is that on May 30,1884, Daniel and Henry Kemmerer made a deed to Joseph V. Kendall for various properties described in the mortgage, as well as for all their personal property, and that at the same time Kendall made a declaration of trust to sell and dispose of the same for the benefit of creditors as therein specified; that, therefore, the transaction was a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors and that, the bond and warrant having been entered subsequently to such deed of assignment, no execution thereon was permissible. Whilst we are of opinion, under the authority of Johnson’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=103%20Pa.%20376" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="103 Pa. 376">103 Pa. 376</a>; Watson v.

Bullitt, <a href="/citations/?q=57%20Pa.%20229" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="57 Pa. 229">57 Pa. 229</a>, that the transaction was, in legal effect, a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors, and whilst the ordinary entry of judgment upon a bond, under such circumstances, confers no right of execution, the fact that this bond and warrant are secured by mortgage, duly recorded previous to such deed of assignment, has been overlooked. The lien of said judgment relates back to the date of the mortgage, and, therefore, the lien being prior to the date of assignment for benefit of creditors, the right to issue execution must prevail. In the case of McCall v. Lenox, 9 S. &amp; R.. 302, it was held that “ if a bond and warrant of attorney are given accompanying a mortgage, a sale of the land under a fieri facias and venditioni exponas, issued on the judgment entered upon the warrant, avoids a lease made by the mortgagor after the mortgage, but before the entry of the judgment on the warrant. In the case of Bury v. Sieber, <a href="/pa/5/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="953588" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0431-01">5 </a><a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a><a href="/pa/5/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Pa. 431" data-case-ids="953588" data-case-paths="/pa/5/0431-01">Pa. 431</a>, a deed of conveyance made part of the purchase money a lien upon the land. A bond was issued for the same amount, a reference to the bond appearing in the deed. Upon this bond judgment was obtained and the premises sold at sheriff’s sale. It was held that the purchaser at sheriff’s sale took a clear title, notwithstanding that the original purchaser sold the land and the judgment was not obtained until after his so selling, because the lien of the judgment related to the date of the lien in the deed. So, too, in the case of Commonwealth v. Wilson, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%2068" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="34 Pa. 68">34 Pa. 68</a>, it was held that there is a clear union between the mortgage and the judgment on the bond, and the lien of the judgment necessarily relates back to the date of the mortgage. The right of the execution creditor to sell, cannot be defeated upon this ground.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b314-5" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[243,1089,1186,823]]]'>The next contention is that the assignee, Kendall, sold a few tracts of land, and that Brooke, at his request, released the premises sold from the general lien of the $30,000 mortgage. The answer is that by the declaration of trust the actions of Kendall in the settlement and payment of claims were expressly made binding upon the grantors. A mortgage creditor has a right to execute such releases. The release prejudiced no one; the proceeds of the sale were mainly paid over on account of the bonds mentioned in the $30,000 mortgage, and, to make the sales and the title clear of incumbrance, Kendall had to pay part of a second mortgage held by Kutz, and also a dower. The moneys Brooke received paid Mrs. Brooke in full and the guardian bond in part. The transactions complained of were strictly necessary in carrying out the trust. It does not lie in the mouths of the defendants to find any fault on this account.</p>

Harrison, by deed, all the assigned estate then remaining unsold, for the alleged consideration of $21,900, which covered the sum total of the liens unpaid, and that because Brooke knew of the transaction and did not object, his remedy is against the assignee. But the evidence shows that no consideration passed for this deed, and that Kendall found great difficulty in making sales on account of Kemmerer’s interference with him; that to facilitate the trust the property was deeded to Harrison, and a sale could be made by Kendall; <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>Harrison was to transfer to purchasers; that up to the time of the present proceedings but $3,300 worth of property had been sold, and the money was properly appropriated in carrying out the trust. That more property was not sold seems due to the opposition of Kemmerer, who pronounces the deed a fraud and interferes with the carrying out of the trust. Defendants ought not to be permitted to impeach this deed, and Daniel Kemmerer does in his testimony and at the same time charge the assignee with the proceeds of the sale, and asks creditors to claim the fund. Nowhere is it shown by the depositions that plaintiff has been hard, or that he assented to any agreement to yield his right of lien, or execution, or look to anything but the land for payment, and the evidence shows that all the land will be needed to pay the debts of the grantors.</p>

L. 551, gives to mortgagees the right to release portions of the mortgaged premises, but if such release be made, the proceedings to recover on the mortgaged premises unreleased, must be by scire facias under which the mortgagors have the right to defend. The act makes no provision as to the effect of a release, leaving that to be decided by the established principles of law and equity, according to which the effect of the release must depend upon the. circumstances of the case : Taylor v. Maris, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20R.%2057" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 R. 57">5 R. 57</a>. By releasing his mortgage and permitting the purchase money realized from the land released to be paid upon other liens, the plaintiff did a wrong to Plenry Kemmerer, the surety mortgagor, and released him and his mortgaged property from any further liability: Holt v.

Henry mortgaged his interest in a certain tract of land called the Homestead, as security for a debt of his brother Daniel to the plaintiff, Brooke. The mortgage was a joint mortgage by Daniel and Henry covering several tracts belonging to Daniel and, as already said, the Homestead of Henry. But Henry personally owed nothing to <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>Brooke, and the bond to Brooke which accompanied the mortgage expressly stipulated that Henry joined in it and the mortgage, solely that the Homestead should be security for the loan to Daniel. Subsequently Henry and Daniel conveyed their property to a trustee to sell, and pay liens. The trustee sold several parcels of Daniel’s land, and as he did so, the plaintiff Brooke released the lien of his mortgage, and allowed the proceeds of the sales to be paid to the other liens, none of which were prior to his, and one at least was admittedly posterior. By this conduct he discharged the land of Henry from its obligation to him.</p>
    <p id="b317-5" data-blocks='[["BL_317.4",317,[207,948,1190,1426]]]'>But on the facts averred in the petition Daniel was equally entitled to relief. As already said he and Henry had conveyed all their real estate to one Kendall in trust to sell. Whether the instrument was technically an assignment for the benefit of creditors, it is not material at present to inquire. It was a trust to sell, “ pay the liens in the order of their priority,” settle other liabilities, and pay over any balance remaining to the grantors. Under it Kendall was a trustee for the Kenunerors and his duty under the very terms of the instrument, was to pay the liens in the order of their priority. Instead of doing so, he sold from time to time, paid liens out of their order, and plaintiff not only permitted but actively assisted him in so doing by releasing his first lien on the lands sold, and yet allowing the proceeds to go to other liens none of which were superior to his and at least one inferior. It is alleged in the petition, and the depositions seem to sustain the allegation, that without touching Henry’s Homestead and also leaving untouched portions of Daniel’s land, enough money had been realized by sales of other parts to pay plaintiff’s lien as well as the others which stood upon an equal footing with it, and that upon an accounting by Kendall it would appear that plaintiff had been paid in full. Kendall did not account nor does he seem to have given any information. On the contrary he made a fraudulent and colorable sale to one Harrison, with a nominal consideration of $21,950, but in reality without the passage of a cent of money, for the very purpose of preventing the owners of the land from learning what he, their trustee, was doing with it.</p>

    <p id="b318-5" data-blocks='[["BL_318.4",318,[258,524,1185,356]]]'>It is said that Kemmerer (meaning as I understand it, Daniel) was troublesome and impeded the transactions, and that the scheme was the only way to facilitate a settlement. It may be that the actions of Kendall, and the participation of Brooke in them, are susceptible of an honest explanation, but if so, it ought to be made to a jury, for as the case now appears explanation is badly needed.</p>
