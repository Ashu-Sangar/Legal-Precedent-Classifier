Co. could not have been successfully accomplished without a great concession by the holders of the Schuylkill Navigation securities. This was well known, and the action of the board of directors of that company to which all holders look, was awaited with great expectation and interest. A settlement was reached between the negotiating parties and it was vital that it should be accepted by the great body of the creditors of the navigation company without delay. The plaintiff was a member of this board, and he had participated in the meetings and negotiations which preceded the settlement and resulted in it. This fact, and that he was a very large holder of the securities affected, was also well known.</p>

Nothing was published or put forth other than this circular, and if an inquiring stockholder or bondholder had looked at the minutes of the meeting of the board held June 23, 1887, he would have only been informed that a general discussion had been had, and that the plaintiff and another opposed the proposition. For all that appears on the minutes, for there is no statement of the vote, any one might very well conclude that the opposition of Messrs. Hutchinson and Love had been overcome, and that the resolutions were adopted by a unanimous vote.</p>

A statement was given showing that out of $12,457,134 of securities, those holding $11,785,333 had accepted the plan. There is no pretence that the plaintiff did not vote for the resolution adopting this circular. More than this, if an inquirer had asked of the Girard Life Insurance, Annuity and Trust Company, the depository under the plan, if Mr. Love was depositing his securities, the answer would have been in the affirmative, for he did deposit $4,500 of the very boat and car loans now sued on, five hundred shares of preferred stock, and $4,000 loan of another issue.</p>

An advisory committee, of the stockholders and bondholders had assisted in the negotiations, but its functions had terminated. The plan was dependent upon its acceptance by the board of managers of the Schuylkill Navigation Co., and to it the eyes of the security holders were turned. “ Directors occupy towards the corporation which they represent positions of trust and confidence, and owe to it all the duties which persons occupying such positions ordinarily owe to their cestuis que trust.....

The fact that they recommended the scheme and selected a depository cannot in itself make that which would otherwise be a contract with each individual stockholder and bondholder who deposited his certificates, a contract with the corporation. The selection of a depository and the recommendation by the board, were both collateral to the contract, and formed no part of the condition upon which the promisor agreed to be bound. “ To render a consideration valid, it must be the express or implied condition on which the obligation of the promise depends : ” Hare on Contracts, 212.</p>

In passing the resolutions of June 23, 1887, the board of managers of the Schuylkill Navigation Company manifestly acted in their individual and not in their official character. It <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>may be conceded that “every creditor of the Schuylkill Navigation Company had a right to look to the board of directors of that company for guidance,” but it by no means follows that the “ plan was dependent upon its acceptance by the board of ■managers.” The plan was dependent upon its acceptance by each individual stockholder or bondholder. An attempt on the part of the board to accept the plan on behalf of the corporation would have been ultra vires: 1 Morawetz on Corp., §§ 512-14; Kean v. Johnson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Stock.%20413" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Stock. 413">1 Stock. 413</a>; Martin v. Cont. Pass. Ry.

No ease can be found sustaining the position that a director can be estopped from asserting his individual rights as a bondholder and deprived of his property by reason of the action.of a board of which he is a member, unless he has concurred in such action, or the facts are such as to render the subsequent assertion of his individual rights a fraud: Ridgefield v. N. Y. R. Co., <a href="/conn/46/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="46 Conn. 375" data-case-ids="755829" data-case-paths="/conn/46/0375-01">46 Conn. 375</a>, and Greencastle v. Black, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Ind.%20559" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="5 Ind. 559">5 Ind. 559</a>, are express authorities against it. To constitute an estoppel it must appear affirmatively that “ the actor, having no means of information, was by the conduct of the other induced to do what he otherwise would not have done: ” Bell, J., in Commonwealth v.

It would be detrimental frequently to the success of such a plan as this, if not impracticable, that a dissenting member of the board should, in order to establish his individual rights as a non-assenting holder, be expected to publish the fact of his dissent to the general public.” Such a course would doubtless have been prejudicial to the success of plaintiff in error’s scheme, and distasteful to its promoters.</p>

The acceptance or re<a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>jection of the proposition depended on the personal action of each share- or bondholder. The board of managers had no power in the premises. The proposition was binding on the shareholders and bondholders only so far as it was accepted by them in their individual capacity, and their respective holdings' deposited for exchange on the terms proposed; and not even then, unless, in the judgment of the reconstruction trustees, sufficient stock and securities were received to justify them in carrying out the scheme.</p>
