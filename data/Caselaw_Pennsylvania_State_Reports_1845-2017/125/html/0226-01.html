It appears that this was a mutual mistake that arose by reason of the passage of a law in 1878 fixing the fees of the sheriff in certain cases, and making it less than it was under a previous fee-bill.]1 For instance, under the act of 1878 tire sheriff’s fees in each criminal case was fixed at one dollar. Under the act of 1868 it had been $1.25. For summoning jurors to the court under the bill of 1868 it was fixed at thirty cents, and under the act of 1878 it was reduced to twenty-five cents; also with regard to commitments and capias there was a slight reduction in each one of these cases under the act of 1878.</p>

Therefore the sheriff made out his hill under a wrong impression as to the law; and, instead of making out his hills in criminal cases for one dollar he should have made them out for $1.25, and so with regard to the other cases; and this suit was brought here for the purpose of recovering from the county the difference in the hill that he made out and the bill he should have made out under the act of 1868. That difference, according to the testimony in this case, undisputed, would amount to $659.40. There were some eight cases in which no fees at all had been paid and which it is admitted on the part of the defendant the sheriff would be entitled to recover. In all the other eases the hill is made out upon the theory that the sheriff should have been paid according to the fee-bill of 1868 and not according to the fee-bill of 1878.</p>

That, according to the testimony, amounts with the eight cases I have spoken of to 1659.40, and the sheriff would be entitled to demand interest on this amount from the time that he made demand for his fees, and if there is no proof here of any prior demand it would be interest from the time of the institution of the suit, I presume.] 3</p>

The act was intended to-“ ascertain and settle, as near as may be, the amount of public money received by such officer, and its application to public purposes or otherwise: ” see § 54 of the act. Section 55 provides for the filing of the report of the auditors with tire effect of a judgment “ against the real estate of the officer who shall thereby appear to be indebted either to the commonwealth or to the county.” Sections 56 and 57 provide for an appeal from the settlement, but you will look in vain for any section that furnishes a remedy against the county for moneys due the officer.

Monroe Boyer was sheriff of Schuylkill county from the first Monday of January, 1883, to the first Monday of January, 1886, and for his official services, where the county was liable, he presented bills, under the act of June 12, 1878, which were allowed and paid by the county commissioners.

The first step in this effort is an assumption that the auditors failed to discharge a duty enjoined by the statute, which requires that they shall annually audit, settle, and adjust the accounts of the commissioners, treasurer, sheriff, and coroner of the county. The correctness of this assumption may well be doubted, as it appears to conflict with the ordinary rule, that in the absence <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>of evidence it is presumed the officers did their duty: Pike Co. v.

It has been repeatedly held by this court that the act of April 15, 1834, which defines the powers and duties of the county auditors, constitutes a special tribunal for the settlement of the accounts of the officers named in it, with the necessary authority to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of papers, and to determine the indebtedness by or to the officer, and to enforce its collection. A reference to all the cases in which this construction has been placed upon it, is not deemed necessary. Many of them are collected in Northampton Co. v. Herman, supra, and in Blackmore v. Allegheny Co., <a href="/pa/51/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="51 Pa. 160" data-case-ids="999839" data-case-paths="/pa/51/0160-01">51 Pa. 160</a>. It is true that in most of these cases there was an adjudication by the special tribunal created by statute, the effect of which was discussed and considered in connection with the rights and duties of the auditors and the officers whose accounts they are authorized and required to settle, but there is no intimation in any of them that the statutory tribunal and the Court of Common Pleas have concurrent jurisdiction in the adjustment of these accounts. That the former has original and the latter appellate jurisdiction of the subject matter of this controversy is conceded. It is the right and duty of the officer to have his accounts examined and passed upon by the county auditors, and if he is not satisfied with their decision he may appeal from their report to the Court of Common Pleas, and have an issue and trial by jury; but he has no right to elect in which forum he will first proceed for the settlement and enforcement of his claims. The statute has provided an adequate remedy; its directions must be strictly pursued, and it precludes a common law action.</p>
