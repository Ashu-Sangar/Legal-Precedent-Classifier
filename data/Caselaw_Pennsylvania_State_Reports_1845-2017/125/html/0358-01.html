I don’t know where it is. I can’t find it. I have looked for it. I told Widdall that I had put the property in my daughter’s name, and was going to carry on business in the name of A. L. Garsed. When I commenced in that way the capital we had was $100. On September 4, 1885, I bought the first bill of goods from Widdall in the name of A. L. Garsed. I always purchased in the name of A. L. Garsed. That $100 with which we started was soon gone, by April 13th. Then my son borrowed money from Mr. Baldt. My son’s name is George L. Garsed. lie bought stock of Thomas Henry &amp; Sons. The stock was afterwards delivered at the mill in the name of A. L. Garsed. I have carried on business since that in her name.”</p>

My brother was the engineer; my' father at times had charge of the outside business, and myself at times. . . . .

He said the reason was, he was in difficulty with Boyd, White &amp; Co., and if we billed the stock to John Garsed he feared it might be attached.

The learned judge below, in a clear and impartial charge, fairly submitted to them the question of the ownership of the property levied upon. He could not properly have withdrawn it from the jury as requested by the defendants’ fourth point. Nor was it error to refuse the defendants’ first and second points. To have affirmed either would have been equivalent to a binding instruction which, as before observed, would have been improper. Aside from this, the first point was so inartificially drawn, that the court could not have affirmed it under any circumstances. The learned counsel evidently intended to ask for an instruction that if the property assigned by John Garsed to A. L. Garsed, was not accompanied by delivery of possession, the assignment was void as against creditors, and the verdict should be for defendants. The last clause of the point, “the verdict should be for defendants,” is a very common and very dangerous addition. It often prevents its affirmance, when the law as stated in the point is entirely correct. In the point referred to, no question is raised as to the possession of the property assigned; it refers only to the “ business,” and in this respect we think it was defective. The familiar rule that an assignment to be good as against creditors must be accompanied by delivery of possession, refers to visible, tangible property. The “ transfer of the business ” is an uncertain, equivocal expression, <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>and may mean property, or it may mean good will. The affirmance of the defendant’s second point would have been clear error. ' The title of A. L. GarsecL could not have been defeated by the mere declarations of her assignor. Yet upon these the court below was asked to give a binding instruction in favor of the defendants.</p>
