W. Fredericks where the lower pier was connected with the shore above the mouth of Fishing creek, on the south bank of Bald Eagle creek, up said stream and nearly in the centre thereof, to an island opposite the farm of Welsh, which is the third farm east of the plaintiffs’, at a cost of about twenty thousand dollars and being a,bout three fourths of a mile in length, with a capacity to hold about two million feet of logs; the amount of lumber floated down said creek being largely increased each year. In 1869 the corporation built an addition of eight piers at a cost of twenty-four hundred dollars, extending up said creek from the island above named to a point opposite the western line of William Huff’s land, which is the second farm east of the plaintiffs’. These piers, beginning at the head of the island, are north of the middle of the creek and gradually approach the northern bank, the upper one and the one next to it being sixty-six feet six inches from that shore and two hundred and sixty-five feet four inches from the southern shore. At a distance of one hundred and thirty-five feet eight inches south from said pier, is the head of the island in the creek. The distance across the head of the island is sixty-one feet eight inches and from there to the southern bank of the creek is sixty-eight feet. For the purpose of turning the logs and lumber floating down the creek into the boom, a sheer, which is made of square timber bolted together, three sticks, and about three feet wide, and about one hundred and twenty-five feet long is fastened to the next to the upper pier, and to the upper pier it is fastened by a chain that can be lengthened or shortened at the pleasure of the person managing it. During a flood when logs and lumber are running in the creek this sheer is kept extended towards the north shore and reaches within twenty-five feet four inches of that shore. By means of the chain attached to it from the upper pier it can be drawn in to that pier, and there is no evidence that any person has been delayed, impeded or prevented from navigating said creek with rafts, boats, logs or other lumber by reason of said boom or of the sheer, although it is established beyond controversy that the whole bed of the creek has on several occasions been filled with logs from shore to shore and that it was caused by the acts of tins corporation, whether by connecting the end of <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>the sheer with the north shore by a log fastened to it as alleged by the plaintiffs, or by allowing the loose logs to run into and remain in the eddy said to exist there, as alleged by the defendant, and thus fill up the narrow passage between the end of the sheer and the shore, is immaterial.</p>

The contention on the part of the plaintiff is, that under the provisions of this section, the defendant is only authorized to erect and maintain its booms on the south half of Bald Eagle creek, and that its structures must be restricted and confined to the south half of the <em>stream; </em>and, as the master has found that the piers of the corporation above the island are placed beyond the middle of the creek, it is an exercise of corporate power not conferred by the charter, and that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief prayed for. While it is true that the words “south side ” are somewhat indefinite, yet we think there can be no difficulty in arriving at their correct interpretation. We are of the opinion, that the words “south side” were meant or <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>intended for the south shore or bank of the creek, and not as claimed by the plaintiffs, the south half of the stream. Webster’s Dictionary defines, “side,” as the “margin, edge, verge or border of a surface, as the side of the field, the side of a river.” In the criminal procedure act, § 49, the word side is used as synonymous with bank. “ In all cases where the side or bank of any navigable river or creek, canal or inland navigation, or the centre or other part thereof shall constitute the boundary of any two counties, it shall be,” etc.] 1 [We are aided in this interpretation by the fact, that the second section of defendant’s charter is an exact copy of the second section of the West Branch Boom Company’s charter: Act of March 29, 1849, P. L. 245, except that in the proviso to the second section of the charter of the West Branch Boom Co., the words “that said boom shall not extend more than half-way across said river,” have been omitted from the proviso contained in the second section of defendant’s charter, thus indicating that defendant was not to be restricted to the half of the stream, and that the only limitation to the exercise of its corporate power was, that the navigation of the creek was not to be impeded so as to prevent the safe passage of rafts, boats, logs, etc.] 3 This being our construction of the defendant’s charter, it is unnecessary to consider the various exceptions filed to the report of the master. [The defendant being in the exercise of powers which were granted by its charter, the plaintiff must resort to the remedy provided by the third section and their bill cannot be maintained.] 3 A court of equity will not entertain jurisdiction where a statutory remedy has been provided; the latter must be pursued.</p>

Admitting, for the sake of the argument, the court below was right, in his interpretation of defendant’s charter, deciding that she has the right to erect and maintain her boom structures in the north half of Bald Eagle creek, “ and that the only limitation to the exercise of its corporate power is, that the navigation of the creek is not to be impeded so as to prevent the safe passage of rafts, boats, logs, etc.,” still we contend the court erred, in dismissing plaintiffs’ bill, because it was plainly and amply proven, that the permanent boom structures of defendant extended nearly across Bald Eagle creek and sometimes the company attached one end of a log to the upper end of the sheer boom and the other end of it to the north shore and thus closed the entire stream; that at different times in 1881, 1882, and 1883, the logs stopped by said structures on the spring floods would roll under one another, pile up and pack together solid to the bottom of the creek, and would thus fill up the boom and above it from shore to shore, making a dam across the whole creek.</p>

A party whose right is clear may sleep upon it until his demand becomes stale. He may look on while valuable structures are erected, when he might successfully object, and remain silent until large sums have been expended or important intervening interests have grown up. In such eases the fact that he might have objected at the outset will not avail him. A suitor must not only appear in a court of equity with clean hands, but he must come with reasonable promptness, in good faith, and with a just and equitable demand; otherwise the conscience of the chancellor will not be moved. If an injunction is prayed for where upon a consideration of the whole case it ought not in good conscience to issue, a mere legal right in the plaintiff will not move the chancellory</p>

The Bald Eagle Boom Company was incorporated in 1859. Its boom was constructed soon after. In 1868 and 1869, the addition to the boom complained of by the plaintiffs was built, and a shear boom hung to turn the logs from the north shore of the stream into the main structure. The boom as extended has been in constant use since 1869. It is in an important sense a public improvement, in the maintenance and use of which the lumbermen and owners of timber lands on the Bald Eagle creek and its tributaries are interested. Thousands of dollars have been invested in it and in mills that are made accessible by it, and many millions of feet of timber are annually caught in it and rafted out to be manufactured at the mills in Lock Haven and other places down the stream. During all this time the plaintiffs have not been heard to object to the work of construction, but have ap<a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>plied for and secured an assessment of their damages on account thereof; and on one or more occasions, since, have recovered damages resulting from an overflow of their land when the boom was filled with logs.</p>
    <p id="b211-5" data-blocks='[["BL_211.4",211,[219,572,1180,302]]]'>The plaintiffs now assert that the boom company had no right to build the piers of the extension of the boom where they were built in 1869, and ask that the corporation be “restrained by injunction from continuing and maintaining their booms erected in said creek and forever hereafter from the erection and maintenance of like illegal structures in the same.”</p>
    <p id="b211-6" data-blocks='[["BL_211.5",211,[220,882,1180,613]]]'>This denial of the right of the boom company, coming after so many years of acquiescence, after the boom has become a necessity to the mills that have grown up in its neighborhood, and after the damages sustained by the plaintiffs in consequence of the construction of both the original boom and the enlargement in 1869 have been assessed at their instance and paid by the boom company, comes too late to be conscionable. There is no equity in the plaintiffs’ case, and the court below would have been fully justified in dismissing the bill for that reason. But if we turn now to the question of construction presented by the first and second assignments of error, the plaintiffs are equally without solid ground on which to stand.</p>

But what is a boom ? It is an inclosure or artificial harbor for logs and lumber, of which one side is furnished ordinarily by the natural bank of the stream and the other is provided by the piers and the timbers or other obstruction to the passage of logs which connect them together. An act authorizing the construction of a boom on the south side of a stream is authority to use the shore <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>on that side as part of the inclosure and to erect in connection therewith the piers necessary to complete the inclosure on the other side.</p>

In the act before us the only limitation is found in the proviso which declares that the piers shall be so built as “ not to interfere with the navigation of the said creek or its branches.” The boom is to be so built that the south shore shall be occupied for that side of the inclosure. The open channel for navigation is to be on the north side, and is to be sufficient for the purposes of navigation. Subject to the restriction in the proviso, the boom company may so locate their piers as to enable them to meet the purposes for which their incorporation was intended.</p>
