He gave the company what is called a premium note in the sum of $560, which was to be held by the company to secure the payment of the assessments which might be lawfully assessed against him. Shortly after his policy was given, Mr. Thropp suffered a loss by the burning down of the insured building. He brought suit against the company to recover the insurance money, and that was resisted by the company, because, as it said, Mr. Thropp had surrendered his policy and had declined to pay the assessments which had been made against him. In this' suit, however, it was decided that <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>Mr. Thropp was still a member of the company at the time the loss occurred, and that what he had done or left undone did not make void his policy. It is not necessary to go into detail in explanation of the points involved in that case. Sufficient to say Mr. Thropp recovered a verdict against the company. Then the company assessed him for the losses which occurred at different times during the life of his policy, that is from the time the policy began to operate until the expiration of the five years for which it was to run. If Mr. Thropp was, as was decided when he recovered the insurance money, a member of the company, it follows he was also liable to be assessed in the company; for it was part of his contract to submit to all lawful assessments made by the company in order to raise money to pay for the losses of those insured in the company, and for necessary expenses of the company.</p>

They say that when the building burned down that canceled the policy. They say further! that he sold the property soon afterwards and ceased upon the execution of that deed to be a member of the company. I instruct you, however, that neither the destruction of his buildings by fire, nor the alienation of the property by deed, of themselves made void the policy. It still continued during the period for which it was taken. Each party must stand by its own bargain. The insurance company is bound to observe the engagements it makes to the insured, and the insured is bound to perform his part of the obligation which he agrees to perform for the company ; and it is not for us to decide in this case whether it was an imprudent bargain or otherwise.

Such assessments would, under the contract of the parties, be for losses occurring during the term of the policy, whether they were actually made before or after the policy expired. This by-law was in force at and before the time when the policy to the appellee was issued. By one of the provisions of the policy, it was agreed that the policy was made and accepted in reference to the by-laws of the company, and also the application and conditions annexed, which are made a part of the policy, and to be used and resorted to, in order to explain the rights and obligations -of the parties. By this provision the by-laws in existence at the date of the policy became part of the contract of the parties. There is a proviso annexed to the 34th section of the by-laws, which more fully explains its meaning. It is as follows: ‘ Provided, however, That should' the assured give sufficient security for the payment of all future assessments on policies above referred to, and then in that case, the whole amount of the claim shall be paid in full.’ This clearly explains that the insured shall continue subject to all future assessments, although his own policy has practically expired by reason of the destruction of the property insured, and the clause authorizes a substitution of security for the payment of future assessments, in place of a retention of part of the money due on the policy for the loss sustained. By the second clause of the 31st section of the bylaws, it is provided that, ‘ All premium notes which have expired, and are not in force at the time such assessment is declared, shall nevertheless be liable to assessment for all unpaid losses, which existed at the time of the expiration of such premium note or notes, pro rata with all other premium notes then in force.’ Under this clause it is manifest that assessments may continue to be made upon premium notes which have expired, for all losses which occurred while the notes were in force. In addition to this, the policy contains a provision that, ‘ the insured has deposited a premium note subject to the payment of such assessments as may be made thereon for the purpose of paying losses and necessary expenses of the company occurring <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>during the term of this policy.’ Whatever may be said in reference to the reasonable or unreasonable character of a contract with such provisions, it is enough for the purposes of this case to know that the contract of these parties is of this character. We see nothing contrary to public policy in it, nor are we aware of any other consideration affecting its^validity on this account, and therefore, so far as the courts are concerned, they are bound to enforce it as they find it.”</p>

The 32d section is as follows :..... Here then is a by-law -which expressly provides for the circumstances with the manner in which the policy of insurance may be surrendered in case the insured sells the property. But it is expressly provided that the cancellation of the policy shall take effect the day the same is received by the secretary. There is no evidence in this case of the compliance on the part of Mr. Thropp with the requirements of this section. He did not surrender his policy; it was not received by the secretary from him for this purpose; and therefore for all practical purposes it remained in existence until the expiration of its term, and Mr. Thropp was liable under his contract to pay the assessments for losses which occurred at any time between May 25, 1877, and May 25, 1882.

A proceeding for that purpose, commenced by petition on the part of the company, has been given in evidence, and it appears that the court decided that it was not entitled to retain in its hands at that time the amount of these assessments. It had paid over, after Mr. Thropp had been successful in his suit, the amount which he recovered, less the amount of the assessments which were claimed against him, and its petition was to have set off against the verdict these assessments, so that the judgment might stand only for the balance, and the court granted <a id="p434" href="#p434" data-label="434" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*434</a>a rule to show cause why this should not be done, and after-wards dismissed the rule. It is said on the part of the defence that this estops the plaintiff from a recovery of these same assessments in this suit. It does not appear from the record before the court upon what ground the court made its decision and dismissed the rulebut it also appears that, at the time, the plaintiff was not in a condition to claim the retention of these assessments, because it had not at that time given notice to .the defendant, Mr. Thropp. The case was decided February 7, 1888, and. notice of these assessments was not given to Mr. Thropp until October 8,1883, and the decision of the court in disallowing the company to retain these assessments out of the amount of the verdict might readily have been based upon that ground; and therefore the company was not in a condition in which they were entitled to enforce its rights for the collection of these assessments, supposing it to have been entitled to them. I rule, therefore, that those proceedings in Dauphin county court do not estop the plaintiffs in this case from recovering the assessments which they claim, provided they have been lawfully assessed.....</p>

You have heard the testimony in relation to the manner in which they were made, and you have heard the arguments of counsel upon that subject. In the- first place assessments made by a board of directors of a mutual company like this are supposed to be regularly and lawfully made. But the defendant has filed in this case an affidavit which put upon plaintiff the necessity to show how they were made, in order that the court and jury might judge whether they were lawfully made or not. [If they were made according to the basis, as detailed to you by the secretary, who was a witness in this case, they were made in a regular manner, unless you can find by the evidence that they were fraudulently made or were grossly in excess of what was needed to meet the liabilities of the company.] 3 In judging of these subjects a reasonable latitude must be allowed to <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>the directors in levying their assessments. They have a right to take into consideration the financial condition of their different members who are insured, and calculate the probabilities as to whether certain assessments can be collected or not; and, if it happen that a large number cannot probably be collected, they have a right in adjusting their basis to take that fact into consideration, allow for it and fix the basis accordingly. If they acted fraudulently or with wanton injustice and partiality, their assessment would be void; but in order to find that it will be necessary for the jury to determine by the testimony that such is the case. Fraud must always be proved; it cannot be assumed, and therefore tbe jury can only draw that inference from testimony which clearly convinces them that fraud has been exercised, or that the directors had wantonly or from gross mistake made assessments excessively disproportionate to the needs of the company. Is there any evidence in this case that more money was raised than was needed for the expenditures? If there is no testimony of that kind, it is for you to take into consideration that there is no surplus fund, and that fact may be used in determining whether or not the assessment actually was excessive, and in order to make it void, it must be grossly excessive. You will have the books and papers which have been given in evidence with you; you can examine them at your leisure, and upon these questions they may be used to determine the fact, taking into consideration the explanations which have been made, and giving them that weight which you consider them entitled to.</p>

The secretary in his testimony showed that these assessments were all made in the following manner: As far as it was practicable to do so, the assessment to pay each loss was laid exclusively upon the notes given for policies in force at the time the loss occurred, and those given for policies issued after the loss, but before the assessment was levied, were omitted. The by-law of this company relative to assessments has been construed by this court in Susq. M. F. Ins. Co. v. Gackenbach, <a href="/pa/115/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="115 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="551802" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0492-01">115 Pa. 492</a>. There the court says : “ The plaintiff concedes that the policies in force at the time the assessment was declared, which were not in force at the time the losses and liabilities were incurred, were not included in the assessments. Its secretary, called to prove the claim, testified that there were a large number of such policies, and that they were not included. It follows that assessment ‘ No. 9 ’ was invalid, and that the court rightly ruled the plaintiff could not recover.” As all of the assessments upon which this suit is brought were levied in the same manner as was assessment “ No. 9,” in that, they were all invalid, and the court below was clearly in error.</p>

Where an insurance company gives notice to a policy holder that he has been assessed for one amount, it cannot at the trial prove him to be liable for another and be allowed to recover the latter.

The case was tried before the publication of the opinion of this court in Insurance Company v. Gackenbach, <a href="/pa/115/0492-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="115 Pa. 492" data-case-ids="551802" data-case-paths="/pa/115/0492-01">115 Pa. 492</a>, and the rulings of the learned judge below were at variance with the decision in that case. On an examination, however, of a correct copy of the by-law under which the assessments were made, it has appeared clearly that this court, speaking through our late brother Teunkey, was misled by an incorrect copy in the record of that case, and the mistake has been rectified in the opinion in Susquehanna M. F. Insurance Company v. Stauffer, filed herewith. [See ante p. 416.]</p>
    <p id="b464-9" data-blocks='[["BL_464.10",464,[250,2255,1179,96]]]'>The main contention in the present case having been thus settled, the others can be disposed of without difficulty.</p>

It is sufficient to say that the relevancy of the question was not apparent from any evidence then in the case, nor was any offer made to follow the question with such evidence. The ground assigned here was not pointed out to the judge at the trial, nor is the evidence shown to us which would support it. The evidence is that the assessments were made for losses only, and whether the secretary or directors improperly received compensation for their services, though important to the policy holders as members of the association, was not relevant to the issue on trial.</p>
    <p id="b465-5" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[217,913,1182,395]]]'>Several of the assignments relate to the variance between the amounts of the assessments as stated in the notices to the defendant, and the amounts, as proved at the trial. The instruction by the learned judge below, that an error in the amount arising from miscalculation, would not prevent the plaintiff from recovering the amount really due, was entirely correct. Mere errors of statement of amounts do not destroy the true claim.</p>

It is difficult to see why it should do so. It was not an adjudication of the right of action on the assessments, but of the company’s right to use them in payment of a particular judgment. Set-off against a judgment is not of right, but of grace, and is only-granted where a special equity is shown to justify it. What reasons moved the Dauphin county court in its refusal, we do not know, nor is it material that we should. It is sufficient that the adjudication was not upon the claims as a cause of action. Susquehanna Ins. Co.’s App., <a href="/pa/105/0615-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="105 Pa. 615" data-case-ids="454306" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0615-01">105 Pa. 615</a>, is not contrary to this view, as in that case the court simply distributed a fund paid in for the very purpose. Even if it had gone further, and decided that under the circumstances equity would allow the set-off against a judgment, it would not now follow that the refusal of the Dauphin county court to allow the set-off in this case, was an adjudication of the right of action. In the very case in 105 Pa. it was held that even a previous action <a id="p442" href="#p442" data-label="442" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*442</a>for the assessments, and judgment against the company therein, were not a bar to the company’s claim on the assessments, inasmuch as it was shown that the failure of the plaintiff was for want of notice of the assessments given to the defendant in the action.</p>
    <p id="b466-8" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[240,596,1189,872]]]'>The only remaining question is, whether the destruction of the buildings by fire and the subsequent sale of the land, terminated plaintiff in error’s liability to further assessments. It may be conceded, that ordinarily and in the absence of a special contract, this result would follow, as held in Wilson v. Insurance Co., <a href="/pa/19/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="19 Pa. 372" data-case-ids="970685" data-case-paths="/pa/19/0372-01">19 Pa. 372</a>, but it is quite clear that the law of this case is otherwise. The contract stipulated for the payment of the assessments that should be made for all losses <em>during the term of the </em>policy, without regard to the destruction of the property, or other hardships. There was a provision for surrender of the policy in case of sale of the land, but no surrender was made under it.
