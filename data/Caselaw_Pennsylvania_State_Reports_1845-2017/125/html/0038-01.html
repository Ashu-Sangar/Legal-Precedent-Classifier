      <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>The court in conformity to the 22d section, directed that the real estate should be sold. For what purpose was it sold? The petition upon which the order was granted scheduled the debts, and stated that there was no personal estate to pay them, and further stated that it would require the sum of $250 annually to support and maintain said lunatic, and that the income of Iris estate was insufficient for that purpose. The order then clearly was for the purpose of raising money to pay said debts and maintain said lunatic. Even without noticing the order of the court to sell, a close reading of the act seems to indicate that the moment George Blake was declared a lunatic, the rights of the creditors as they then existed immediately attached and became a charge on the assets, as they subsequently came into the hands of the committee: Wright’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/8/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Pa. 57" data-case-ids="959504" data-case-paths="/pa/8/0057-01">8 Pa. 57</a>; if all could not be paid in full, then pro rata, as the accounts may be ascertained by subsequent proceedings. The act even provides that a creditor may issue a summons against a lunatic and have the amount thus ascertained by judicial process. And it was held in Eckstein’s Est., 1 Pars. 59, that the amount thus ascertained “ if prosecuted bona fide to judgment would be conclusive, as to the amount and merits of plaintiff’s demand.”</p>

To obtain this order certain debts were scheduled, as being at the time existing claims against the lunatic. On the faith of that petition, to pay the debts of the lunatic and to maintain him, the order to sell was granted. The fund thus realized, was realized for a specific purpose. The arm of this court was extended to prevent the consequent wrangle which would have ensued had not this course been pursued. The real estate having been converted into cash for the purpose of paying the debts and maintaining the lunatic, can it be possible now, that the court has not jurisdiction to distribute the fund among these claimants, obtained, as Chancellor Kent observed in Brasher v. Cortlandt, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Johns.%20Ch.%20402" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Johns. Ch. 402">2 Johns.

In such a case the creditor’s rights attach immediately after the assignment by the act of the assignor himself; in the case under consideration by operation of law. Can it be successfully held that in the case of an assignor, dying after the assignment, that the executor of the assignor could obtain the whole fund for distribution to and among the creditors at the time of his decease ? The debts may have been increased; can the creditors be subjected to the possibility of such an increase, or the necessary expense incurred in both settlements ? The committee here is entitled to commissions; so would the executors be. The full cost of an administration would be incurred and the fund lessened, so that practically nothing would be left to distribute. After the payment of all debts, the balance of course would have to be paid the executors. So are they here.</p>

In that case the officer of the law, the sheriff, was directed by his writ to sell the real estate to satisfy the judgment. After this purpose was accomplished, and the payment of the liens against the decedent, obtained during his lifetime, the balance only was paid to the executor or administrator. If Morrison’s Case was an authority for the counsel citing it, it should have ruled that the entire fund was to be paid to the administrator.

If Frankenfield’s Appeal rules this case, then the debts, which under Wright’s Appeal became a charge, are by the death of the lunatic diverted and postponed to those made subsequent to the approval of the inquisition.

The auditor thereupon filed his supplemental report in accordance with the opinion of the court, awarding the fund to the executors. Ellwood M. Wheatland, the principal creditor of George Blake, deceased, filed exceptions <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>to the action of the court, which were overruled, and the report confirmed; whereupon Wheatland took out this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b70-5" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[255,456,1184,239]]]'>The only question for our consideration, in this case, is whether or not the balance in the hands of the committee on settlement of his accounts was, at the death of the lunatic, rightly awarded to his executors to be administered as assets of his estate.</p>
    <p id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.5",70,[255,713,1182,345]]]'>It is contended on part of the appellant, that the committee held this fund upon the terms of a trust, dver which the Common Pleas had full jurisdiction, that the Common Pleas had the power of distribution upon the footing of that trust, and that the distribution having been partially proceeded with, should have been made to and among the creditors directly and not to the executors.</p>
    <p id="b70-7" data-blocks='[["BL_70.6",70,[255,1077,1185,1331]],["BL_71.1",71,[198,344,1180,510]]]'>The committee of a lunatic is, by the act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 597, intrusted with the management of his entire estate, real and personal; it is his duty to apply so much of the income thereof as shall be necessary to the payment of his just debts and engagements, to the support and maintenance of the lunatic and his family, and to the education of his minor children. If the income shall not be sufficient for the purposes stated, he may, under the direction of the Court of Common Pleas, having jurisdiction of his accounts, apply so much of the principal of the personal estate as may be necessary. If the personal estate shall not he sufficient the court may make an order authorizing the committee to sell or mortgage a part or the whole of the real estate. In such case, the expediency of selling a part or the whole, the terms of sale, and the amount of security required, are all matters for the determination of the court before the order issues, and upon a return, if the order of sale is confirmed, upon the committee giving security to the satisfaction of the court for the faithful application of the proceeds, according to the duties of his trust. Thus it will be seen that the sale of the real estate is under the immediate control and supervision of the court; indeed, the committee is but the receiver of the court, from which he derives his powers, and the fund, when it comes into his hands, is a trust fund as much in custodia legis as if deposited in bank to its credit, or locked up in the strong box of the court, under the care of its officers : Eckstein’s Est., 1 Pars. 59. This fund, as wé have <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>seen, is, in tbe first instance, applicable to the payment of his just debts. This was one of his specific trusts, declared by law, subject to which the committee held the fund in dispute. At the death of the lunatic the terms of the trust expired, but it still remained for the committee to settle his accounts, in order that the trust moneys in his hands might be applied according to the terms and conditions of the trust. The fund in his hands, as we have said, was in the custody and control of the court, and it was within the power and it was the duty of the court to see that it was properly applied.</p>
    <p id="b71-5" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[197,863,1180,920]]]'>It is certainly true, as a general rule, that the Orphans’ Court alone has authority to ascertain the amount of a decedent’s estate and to order its distribution among those entitled to receive it: Whiteside v. Whiteside, <a href="/pa/20/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="20 Pa. 473" data-case-ids="972329" data-case-paths="/pa/20/0473-01">20 Pa. 473</a>; it is equally true that the Court of Common Pleas has not power to decree distribution of a fund in the hands of a trustee among the heirs or next of kin of the deceased cestui que trust: Johnson’s Est., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20119" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Whart. 119">2 Wh. 119</a>; it must be awarded to the personal representatives, in order that after administration it may be distributed under the direction of the Orphans’ Court, according to law: Frankenfield’s App., 11 W. N. 373. But when the decedent’s estate consists in part or in whole of moneys or property held upon the terms of a trust, the personal representatives can take only what remains after the trust is executed or fully settled; as in case of the death of one of two or more partners, his executors or administrators are only entitled upon the footing of an account after the payment of the joint debts: Story on Part., 367, 557.</p>
