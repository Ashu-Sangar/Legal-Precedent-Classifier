The auditor surcharged the accountant with the sum of $2,511.90, the amount of certain building association mortgages and the interest thereon, which were secured upon the real estate of the decedent sold- under an order of this court for the payment of his debts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b408-9" data-blocks='[["BL_408.9",408,[249,1284,1184,1127]],["BL_409.1",409,[213,370,1183,664]]]'>It appeared that the premises were subject to a ground-rent, and also to the balance due to the association upon the said mortgages. It was so stated in the order of sale and also in the hand-bills and advertisements. But at the time of the sale it was announced by the auctioneer that the exact balance due upon the mortgages was not ascertained, and that for the purpose of enabling buyers to bid' intelligently, and know- exactly what they were paying for the property, he would cry the sale as if he were selling subject to the ground-rent only, and that at whatever price the property should be struck off, it would be the price of the same incumbered only by the ground-rent. In pursuance of this arrangement Michael Keegan bought the premises for the sum of $4,850, and in his settlement with the accountant she allowed him to deduct from the said purchase-money the sum of $2,511.90, the sum which it was then ascertained was the balance due upon the said building association mortgages. With this amount the auditor has now surcharged the accountant, upon the ground “ that what the auctioneer or any one said upon the subject is immaterial; that the mortgages were fixed incumbrances, which the purchaser was obliged to take subject to, and his bid could only be so regarded,” etc. While the law as stated by the auditor is undoubtedly <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>correct, that purchasers at an Orphans’ Court sale buy subject to all the fixed incumbrances, yet equity will not permit the auctioneer, who is the agent of the seller at a sale of this kind, to dig a pit for the unwary purchaser to fall into. It is not an immaterial thing what the auctioneer' says; on the contrary, it has been held that “judicial sales, especially those made under the direction of the Orphans’ Court, should be so conducted as not to mislead or entrap bidders. Notwithstanding the maxim of caveat emptor is applicable to such sales, it is still the duty of those who conduct them to act in good faith and as far as possible avoid any misdescription or misrepresentation as to the quality or quantity of the property offered for sale: ” Schug’s App., 14 W.

    <p class="summary" id="b409-5" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[207,1043,1187,810]]]'>Now, in this case, while in all the proceedings in this court the existence of these mortgages upon the premises was fully recited, yet, at the sale, for the convenience of buyers, and necessarily for the advantage of the estate, the sale is conducted as if there were no mortgages there. This fact is admitted by every one, and is so found by the auditor, and yet in face of it he rigidly applies a rule of law to work a great injustice, as if the law were so inflexible as never to bend. In the cases above cited, it was held that even years after the confirmation of a sale by the Orphans’ Court, where it still has a grasp upon the fund, it will set aside a sale in order to do justice, where a purchaser has been misled or deceived by the person making the sale. Under the facts of this case, this sale might well be set aside, but we think justice will be substantially accomplished by refusing this surcharge. This exception is therefore sustained.</p>

That the purchaser of some of the decedent’s real estate bought the same for the accountant, and she was thereby guilty of a fraud upon the estate; and 2. Because the accountant was guilty of collusion wdth Michael Keegan to present a fraudulent claim against the estate. The evidence utterly fails to establish either of these propositions. In regard to the first one, the evidence shows that the purchaser bought with his own money and for himself, and has held the title and possession ever since; and, except<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>ing a vague statement by the accountant that “something might turn up ” by which she would get the money to buy the property from the purchaser, there is no evidence to sustain this allegation. In regard to the second charge, we will consider the alleged fraudulent claim of Michael Keegan in the consideration of his exception to the auditor’s finding on that subject, and, as we there find that the testimony fails to establish any fraud, this exception must be sustained.</p>

It would have .been very easy for those resisting this claim to have put the truth of his statement to the test. If his testimony was misunderstood, he had the right to explain it, or, if he made a mistake, he had a right to correct it. It does not follow that a fraud has been attempted because a man makes a mistake in his testimony. In every case a fraud must be proven, it cannot be inferred; and in this case the evidence falls far short of being sufficient to establish a fraud. At the most it is simply a case of mistake, which was afterwards corrected. We do not see how the auditor could have found anjr fraud from this testimony, and upon this ground not only to reject the claim, but also to disallow the accountant her commissions for alleged participation in it.
