When once Noll’s interest in the land is established it is clearly none of his business to interfere between Bordner- and Brooke. Noll admits that when Brooke’s mortgage was placed on record, March 27, 1886, he owed $1,600 principal and one year’s interest, which latter he paid a short time after. He is willing to pay his indebtedness to the party entitled to receive it, and we presume he will demand a deed conveying Bordner’s title. Now the only thing Noll came in to do was to establish at once his interest. That being ascertained and fixed there is no reason why the case should not proceed against Bordner. If the judgment is entered against Bordner as to his interest in Noll’s land, upon execution the sheriff will sell and convey Bordner’s interest, and when Noll then pays his indebtedness, the sheriff’s vendee upon receiving the money will make the necessary deed to Noll and thus assure to him his title in full accord with the terms of the original contract.</p>

The fact that Noll continued in possession, controlling, using and improving the property as his own, and paying the taxes thereon, must necessarily have been regarded by the referee as significant, and as notice to the plaintiff of Noll’s title. These facts were abundantly sufficient to charge the plaintiff with the duty of inquiry, and to make it the duty of the court to deal with him as though he knew all he would have learned by inquiry: Rowe v.

L. 84, relating to defeasances, is inapplicable, because it was not yet enacted when this instrument was executed. Bordner’s conveyance was not a deed of trust, but a mortgage, a pledge or security: Lance’s App., <a href="/pa/112/0456-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="112 Pa. 456" data-case-ids="546558" data-case-paths="/pa/112/0456-01">112 Pa. 456</a>.</p>

While thus the legal owner, he made a mortgage <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>to Brooke, duly executed and recorded. Brooke thus acquired a lien on the land, perfectly good against Bordner and every one claiming under him, and having brought suit on his mortgage, what is there to stand in the way of his recovery? So far as Bordner and his assignee are concerned, nothing. Bordner mortgaged all the title he had to Brooke, and when he subsequently made an assignment, the assignee took nothing but an equity of redemption, because his assignor had nothing else to give. As between Brooke and the assignee, the former had an equity at least equal in force and prior in time, and had his legal right in addition. So far, therefore, as this is a scire facias against Bordner and his' assignee, it is the ordinary case of mortgagor and mortgagee, and there is nothing to prevent judgment and execution in the ordinary course of law.</p>
    <p id="b503-5" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[183,1079,1186,922]]]'>But the scire facias being with notice to the terre tenant Noil, the latter is entitled to come in and make defence pro interesse suo. It is found by the referee, and uncontested, that Noll made an agreement with Bordner, at the time of the latter’s purchase, verbal then, but subsequently reduced to writing, by which Bordner was to take the title, subject to the right of Noll to have it conveyed to him, upon the payment of a certain sum of money. A portion of this sum has been paid, and it is agreed that $1,600 remain due. Bordner’s title, therefore, was subject to a trust in favor of Noll, which made it, in effect, a mortgage, and it would be so treated in equity. The referee, therefore, held that it was only a mortgage, and could not be again mortgaged by Bordner to Brooke. But this is a purely technical objection, and can apply only to "a technical mortgage, and Bordner’s title was not technically a mortgage. In law, it was the full title to the land, and a mortgage of it was none the less a mortgage, because the title, in equity, and upon certain terms, was defeasible by Noll.</p>

If the suit had gone on in the ordinary way to judgment and execution, which, as we have seen, could not have been prevented by Bordner or his assignee, and Brooke had purchased the land at the sale, Noll could then have come <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>in by bill, to establish his equity and compel conveyance of the legal title on payment of the amount due. Having been brought in on the scire facias, his rights against tire plaintiff are neither greater nor less. His land is subject to the mortgage, with a right to he released on the payment, not of the amount of the mortgage, but of the balance due on the original agreement with Bordner. That balance having been due to Bordner as holder of the legal title, is now due to Brooke as mortgagee of that title; and as Noll had no equity to compel Bordner to convey the legal title without payment of the balance due, so now he has no equity to compel a release of his land from the mortgage, without payment of the said balance to Brooke. Upon such .payment, however, Noil-will be entitled not only to a release of the mortgage by Brooke, but also to a conveyance of the title by Bordner, or whoever may.then stand in his place.</p>
