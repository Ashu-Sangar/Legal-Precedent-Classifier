Lambeth, and the complainant’s intestate, W. R. Lafourcade, were the owners of two letters patent of the United States for improvement in fly fans, Nos. 150,855 and 186,248, dated May 12, 1874, and January 16, 1877, respectively, issued to William R. Fowler and duly assigned to the said Samuel W. Lambeth and William R. Lafourcade. By a previous agreement between the said Lafourcade and Lambeth, on October 17, 1879, it had been agreed that each party should possess his one half of the said patents free and uncontrolled by the other party. Prior to June 5, 1882, each party was manufacturing and selling fly fans under these patents, and each employed the Bridgeport Brass Company, of Bridgeport, Conn., to manufacture the fans under separate yearly contracts <a id="p554" href="#p554" data-label="554" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*554</a>made by each with said company. Lambeth also owned other letters patent relating to fly fans, and the fans made by him were superseding the fans manufactured for and sold by Lafourcade. This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Lafourcade, who in the spring of 1882 offered his fans to the trade at cost prices. In order to stop this competition and effect an arrangement between the parties by which the business could be carried on at a profit, the secretary of the Bridgeport Brass Company brought about an interview between Lafourcade and Lambeth. This interview lasted three or four hours, and resulted in the signing by Lafourcade and Lambeth of the agreement set forth in the bill filed. This agreement was in substance that Lafourcade would discontinue the sale of the said fly fans, and that in consideration therefor Lambeth would pay to the Bridgeport Brass Company a certain price per dozen on the fans delivered by them to Lambeth or to his order after that date, and that said sum should be. paid over by the Bridgeport Brass Company to Lafourcade. It was further stipulated in the agreement that Lambeth should pay over to Lafourcade a certain price per dozen upon fans which Lambeth then had in the hands of parties consigned for sale, and that the fans should be sold only at certain prices therein named. This agreement was signed by Lafourcade and Lambeth, and witnessed by the secretary of the company, and at its foot was written an agreement by the Bridgeport Brass Company to pay over to Lafourcade the specified sums per dozen, when such amount should be paid over to it by Lambeth in accordance with the agreement. No time of duration is mentioned in the said agreement. The paper was prepared and written by the secretary of the company, and when submitted to both Lambeth and Lafourcade objection was made (it does not appear by which one) that no time during which the agreement was to remain in force was mentioned, and also that nothing was mentioned as to the fans which Lafourcade then had in other parties’ hands upon consignment. With regard to the first objection, it was then and there agreed that the contract should remain in force so long as it was for the mutual interest of both parties ; that Mr. Lafourcade could resume the sale of fans and Mr. Lambeth could discontinue the payment of the sums at any time. As to the second objection, Lafourcade represented <a id="p555" href="#p555" data-label="555" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*555</a>that he had but a very small number of fans on consignment, and it was agreed that Lambeth should take these fans out of his hands at cost price. The circumstances under which the agreement came to be made, and the conversation that took place at the time of the execution of the written agreement, as above found by the master, were proven by the testimony of but a single witness, viz., Mr. Kissam, the secretary of the Bridgeport Brass Company. It is not contradicted by any other testimony, but on the other hand is not supported by the testimony of any other witness.</p>

On the other hand, it was understood and agreed that if Lambeth, for any reason, saw fit to discontinue the payments of said sums he could do so, in which case Lafourcade should have the right to go into the market and sell under the patents in which he was part owner, Lambeth settling for the sale of fans up to such time. It was upon this express agreement and understanding that Lafourcade and Lambeth signed the paper.....I was present at the time of the execution of the paper and was the witness to the execution. The verbal agreement was made as I have before stated as to the right of either party to terminate it at any time. This was before and at the time of execution and it was upon this express agreement that the paper was signed by Lambeth, Lafourcade saying that in the event of Lambeth terminating the agreement he, Lafourcade, would put the fans at cost of manufacture.”</p>

In November, 1884, Lambeth notified the Bridgeport Brass Company that the agreement should terminate at the end of the season of 1884, and requested them to notify the parties interested to that effect. They did notify Mr. Lafourcade’s widow. It does not appear that they also notified the plaintiffs in the case, but as no question has been raised on that point it is not material. On December 6, 1884, the Bridgeport Brass Company paid over to the Real Estate Title Insurance and Trust Company, as administrator of the estate of Lafourcade, the sum of $900.12, which was the full amount remaining due under the agreement by Lambeth to the brass company, and by the brass company to Lafourcade’s estate to the close of the season of 1884.</p>

In enumerating the exceptions to the rule that parol evidence cannot be given to vary a written document, he states that evidence may be given to show “ the existence of any separate oral agreement as to any matter on which a document is silent, and which is not inconsistent with its terms, if from the circumstances of the case, the court infers that the parties had not intended the document to be a complete and final statement of the whole transaction between <a id="p557" href="#p557" data-label="557" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*557</a>them. This is a practical and common sense rule. The construction of the instrument is in the first case for the court, but if the court should be of opinion that the instrument was intended to be incomplete as to any of its terms, then as to such terms parol evidence may be admitted.</p>

In the absence, however, of any such well settled legal presumption, it is for the court to say whether, under all the circumstances of the case and the language of the document itself, the parties intended' it to be complete as to all its terms, bearing in mind, of course, another presumption of law, that in cases of doubt a document is presumed to contain all the terms of the agreement. Applying these principies to the instrument in question, the master is of opinion that the agreement bears on its face evidence that it was not intended to definitely fix the period of its operation. It was made between competitors in business, both selling fly fans under two patents which expired at different dates. It provided that one of these parties should pay to the Bridgeport Brass Company (which had been manufacturing the fans for both) a certain sum per dozen on all fans manufactured by it to his order, and that said company should pay over these sums to the other party. It does not appear from the agreement that the Bridgeport brass company was under any obligation whatever to continue to manufacture these fans for any definite period of time, and it appears from the parol testimony, which was clearly admissible to explain the surrounding circumstances, that in point of fact, the Bridgeport Brass Company was manufacturing these fans under yearly contracts with each party. No provision is made in the agreement for any payment by Lambeth in case the Bridgeport Brass Company should cease manufacturing. In the judgment of the master, it appears evident that the parties did not intend to contract by this agreement as to the length of <a id="p558" href="#p558" data-label="558" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*558</a>time during which it should run, but left that to be determined upon by a contemporaneous or subsequent agreement. This being the view of the master, he is also of opinion that the parol testimony was admissible to show a contemporaneous agree'ment as to the time, and as this parol testimony, though but of a single witness, was not contradicted, and was not inherently improbable or inconsistent with the other facts in the case, it must be considered as establishing the fact that the parties did make a contemporaneous agreement that the arrangement should last only so long as both parties should desire, for their mutual advantage, to continue it.</p>

It was argued with great earnestness and ability by the counsel for the complainant that an agreement relating to the manufacture of articles under a patent, is presumptively intended to continue during the life of the patent. No case has, however, been cited to the master in which it has been decided that there is a legal presumption to this effect. The fact that the agreement relates to a patent, may, in connection with other circumstances, aid the court in construing, its meaning with regard to the length of time during which it is to operate; but there is no well settled legal presumption which will enable a court to say that the intention of the parties in an agreement relating to patentable articles is to make the agreement operative during the term of' the patents. Even if there was such a presumption it could hardly be applied in a case where the articles were being manufactured under two different patents which expired at different dates. In the absence of any such presumption there is nothing in the agreement which will enable a court to fix any term for its duration, and, on the contrary, the fact that the moneys werej to be paid only for fans manufactured by the Bridgeport Brass Company, which was under no agreement with both parties to manufacture for a definite period of time, would of itself indicate that the agreement was not intended by the parties to last for a definite fixed period. There being nothing to enable the court to fix a definite term, the legal presumption would apply that applies in all cases where parties <a id="p559" href="#p559" data-label="559" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*559</a>enter into a contractual relation without fixing a term during which it is to continue, viz., that it is to continue during the will of both parties. A very familiar illustration of this presumption is found in the case of partnerships where, if no term is fixed in the agreement, either party may dissolve it at ■will. For the reasons above given, the master is of opinion that whether the agreement of the parties as to time is allowed to be proved by the parol testimony given in this case, or whether the agreement as to time is to be deduced by the interpretation of the written instrument alone, in either case the contract between Lambeth and Lafourcade was one which could be terminated at the will of either party upon proper notice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b583-5" data-blocks='[["BL_583.4",583,[195,965,1180,347]]]'>As it appeared from the evidence that Lambeth did so terminate the agreement, and as it further appeared that all the moneys due under said agreement up to the time of its termination have been paid to Lafourcade’s estate, the master is of opinion that the plaintiff’s bill should be dismissed with costs, and he recommends that a decree to that effect shall be entered.</p>

    <p id="b584-8" data-blocks='[["BL_584.8",584,[232,1270,1197,1072]]]'>There appears to be nothing in this record that requires a reversal of the decree. The written agreement, set out in the bill, being silent as to how long the same was intended to continue in force, it was clearly competent for the defendant to prove by oral testimony that the parties did not intend to bind themselves by said agreement for any definite period of time, but purposely left that to be settled, either by a contemporaneous or subsequent agreement. The competency of parol evidence for such purpose as that, is recognized in numerous cases, among which are Greenawalt v. Kohne, <a href="/pa/85/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="85 Pa. 369" data-case-ids="440522" data-case-paths="/pa/85/0369-01">85 Pa. 369</a>; Bown v. Morange, <a href="/pa/108/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="108 Pa. 69" data-case-ids="539244" data-case-paths="/pa/108/0069-01">108 Pa. 69</a>; Thudium v. Yost, 20 W. N. 217; Thomas v. Loose, <a href="/pa/114/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="114 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="549986" data-case-paths="/pa/114/0035-01">114 Pa. 35</a>. The evidence on that subject was quite sufficient to warrant the master in finding that the parties did make a contemporaneous agreement that their written contract should continue in force “ only so long as both parties should desire for their mutual advantage to continue it.” He also found, upon sufficient evidence, that defendant, in pursuance thereof, did terminate the contract. In view of these and other facts found by the learned master, there was no error in dismissing the bill. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.</p>
