Upon that subject we say to you that when one person brings suit against another to recover damages alleged to be caused by the negligence of the defendant, this negligence must appear to be what is called, in law, the proximate cause, the direct cause of the injury. For instance, if one man turns the water from his house, or lot, in a direction where it runs harmlessly to a stream, and can do no injury to any person; diverts it from its former course, but conducts it in a new course, where it is entirely harmless, and some third person, for whose acts he is not responsible, comes and takes that water, and diverts it into a neighbor’s cellar, the conduct of that first party is what is known, in law, as the remote cause of the injury. It is not the direct, or proximate cause, but there is another party intervening between his action and the injury, and the law says that the injured party cannot recover against the first; party for that injury. But in the construction and maintenance of their canal the defendants were required to have regard to the conditions then existing. If the defendants so constructed their canal as to leave water percolating through the bottom and working into the gravel, which found a natural water course in that gravel, and flowed harmlessly into the river, and subsequently some person, by <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>the erection of some structure in the street, had cut off that water course, and diverted- the water to the plaintiffs’ injury, the defendant could not be held responsible, because their act had occasioned no injury, but the injury came from the act of another person, afterward intervening. [But in maintaining their canal, the right of parties to construct sewers in the street must be recognized. And when they repaired the canal, whatever act they do with reference to repairing and maintaining it, must be done with reference to the situation as it actually existed at the time.] 7</p>

Is there any evidence in this case that this sewer has had any effect upon the course which the water has taken after it left the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Basin? This sewer has not been opened, nor the surroundings of the sewer examined, west of Second street.] 6 We think that if the evidence justifies you in finding that the defendant was guilty of negligence, in constructing or maintaining this wall, and the defendant sets up that by the act of some other party the water, after it left the canal, was diverted from its natural course on to the premises of the plaintiffs, then the defendant is bound to show that. In that case the burden of proof rests upon the company and it is bound to show you that this sewer did divert the water, and was the instrument and reason of turning the course of the water to the premises of the plaintiffs. Has it done so ? Is there any evidence in this case from which you can infer that the action of the water, or its course, has been affected in any way by the existence of this old wooden sewer ? [This sewer was lawfully constructed in the street; and, if the defendant, subsequent to the erection of the sewer, so managed its canal that the water passed out from it, and came in contact with that sewer, and was so turned into the premises of the plaintiffs, we do not think that the defendant could set up the existence of the sewer to relieve it from the responsibility.

If such negligence is not shown, that is an end of the case, and the verdict must be for the defendant. If you find the negligence, then is there any evidence in this case to show you that notwithstanding the negligence of the defendant, the water passing from its canal would have passed harmlessly into the river, except that subsequently some other person had interfered by the construction or erection of a new channel, by which he diverted the water coming from the canal from its natural flow and channel, and turned it on to the premises of the plaintiffs ?

There was no such connection between the repairing of the basin wall and the flooding of either cellar, as to present them in the relation of cause and effect; and the mere fact of percolation of water from the basin was not evidence of negligence in its construction or repair. The testimony was entirely barren of evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant. The plaintiffs’ second and third points should, therefore, have been refused, and the defendant’s second point affirmed, as it is well settled that an act performed in pursuance of lawful authority and in a proper manner, like the construction and maintenance of defendant’s canal, subjects the owner to no liability for consequential damages: Dykeman v.

In its absence, the percolating water would have been diffused throughout the soil, without injury to any adjacent property, as it had been for forty years before its construction, and as it still continued to be in all other directions. Had it remained unobstructed, it would still have afforded an outlet to the water as it had done for a dozen years previously. But when the water was deprived of this outlet it formed a channel outside the sewer by which it finally made its way to the plaintiffs’ cellars, which it never would have reached in the natural course of percolation. It is clear therefore that the sewer was the proximate cause of the injury: ■ Pittsb. South Ry. Co. v.

The cases are distinct, having been brought by different plaintiffs for distinct injuries suffered from the same cause. In one of them, the plaintiff is Emma Goldstein, who claims damages to her dwelling-house from a flow of water into her cellar; in the other, the plaintiff is Nathan Jacobs, who claims to have been injured by a similar flow of water into the basement of his barn and stables. As the evidence, to a large extent, was the same in both eases, they were, by agreement of counsel, tried together in the court below and were argued together in this court.</p>

But the enjoyment of this right carries with it the correlative or correspondent duty to construct and maintain the canal and basin in such substantial manner as not unnecessarily to annoy or injure others. The plaintiffs, in order to recover, must, therefore, establish the fact of negligence; for if we concede the right to maintain the basin, and to use it in connection with the canal, damages resulting to another from the lawful use by the owner, in the absence of malice or negligence, are damnum absque injuria: Penn.

These subjects of inquiry were submitted to the jury in the plainest and most explicit manner: “ Are you satisfied,” says the learned judge in his charge, “ that the water found in the cellars of the plaintiffs came from this canal?.....It is for you to determine this first question. Did the water that disturbed these plaintiffs come from the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company’s basin ? If it did not, if it is not shown to have come from there, then the plaintiffs could not recover in this action..... But if it is shown to have come from the canal basin the next question is, have the plaintiffs shown to you that it came from the basin by reason of some negligence on the part of the defendant. Before the plaintiffs or either of them can recover against the company, they must show, first, that this water came from the company’s canal; and, second, that it came by reason of some negligence on part of the defendant in maintaining that canal. And, as we have said, the burden of establishing these facts is upon the plaintiffs.”</p>

There was evidence that when the water in the basin was high it flowed into the cellars, and when it was low it did not; that the connection between tbe basin and the cellars was such that the swell of the water when a boat came in caused an increased <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>flow into the cellars. These facts certainly pointed to the canal basin as the source of the difficulty. There was evidence, also, that the water first appeared in these cellars about the time, or very shortly before the old Avail fell in, and continued to come in from that time until the cellars were drained by the new seAver. The Avitnesses testified as to the rebuilding of the Avail, as to the materials employed, the season of the year, and the condition of the soil when it Avas rebuilt, and generally as to the method of construction. The fact was conceded that before the year 1885 the water did not run into these cellars, and that after that it did. From all these facts an inference might fairly be drawn that the floAV of water was OAving to the imperfect condition of the basin or to the negligent construction of the wall.</p>
    <p id="b282-5" data-blocks='[["BL_282.4",282,[272,1085,1184,663]]]'>The evidence, it is true, was not strong, but it was of suffieien C strength to compel a submission of it to the jury. There was doubtless countervailing proof, but the whole question Avas one of fact, and the jury was the proper tribunal for its determination. It appeared, also, that the matter had been brought to the company’s notice, and an investigation showed that water was in fact escaping in considerable quantities in the rear of Knapp’s store. An ineffectual effort was made to stop the leak; whether this was conducted with due diligence Avas also for the jury. Upon an examination of the Avhole case, although the testimony on this point is certainly meagre, Ave are of opinion it would have been error in the court to have AvithdraAvn it from the jury.</p>

But Snyder, vrith the leave of the municipal authorities, certainly had a right to construct a seAver, and to conduct the water in his cellar to the river. The municipality made no complaint then, and makes none now; after the lapse of twelve or thirteen years, in a contro<a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>versy between other parties, the sewer will be presumed to have been constructed with their assent. The sewer must, therefore, be regarded as a lawful construction., and being such, the company cannot protect itself from the consequences of its own negligence, by charging them to the action of the sewer. The company was bound to construct and maintain tlie basin in a good and substantial manner; to exercise diligence and care, proportioned to the risk which sucb an undertaking involved to the property of others, and was bound to take notice of the existence of any lawful structure or construction, which might be affected thereby, or by means of wliich tlie property of others, through their negligence, might be affected.</p>
