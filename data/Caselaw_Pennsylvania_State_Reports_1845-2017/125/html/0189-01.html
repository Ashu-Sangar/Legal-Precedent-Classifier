The grant here is “ the right and privilege of taking and conveying the stream fór the use of the tract” then conveyed, “to be conducted where it formerly was, for the purpose of erecting water-works.” The right is to take the stream; the manner of taking is to be as it formerly was; the use is for that tract, and the object is the erection of water-works. In other words, the grantee is entitled to take this stream for the purpose of erecting waterworks, for the use of the property conveyed, but in doing this, he must conduct it where it was formerly conducted.

The contracting parties had in mind the old turning mill, its former location, and its limited necessities. The property was about to be divided, and it was proper that the purchaser of this water power should be entitled to have and enjoy it, as its former owner had, without hindrance on the part of the purchaser below. We do not think that it was intended to give him the right to put in pipes, conduct the water of the stream a mile away, and there erect his reservoir and stand-pipes, and thus use all the water, to the exclusion of his neighbor on the stream below. It is true, the object of the grant was the erection of water-works. But what kind of water-works were contemplated? The language of the grant and reservation will indicate their character. The right to take the stream was to erect works for the use of the tract conveyed, and the reservation was for the same use. The erection of water-works for the use of a tract containing sixty-four acres is one thing, and it strikes us as a very different thing from the erection of water-works to supply the engines of a large and active railroad company. The one might not be seriously objectionable to the owner below. He might reasonably believe that such works would not consume all the water of the stream, and be content to take his chances for a sufficient supply for his wants. We think the complainant is justified in construing the grant in the Parke deed, and the reservation in the Dowlin deed, to mean that the works were to be erected for the use of the Parke tract; and for the purpose of erecting such works, the water of the stream might be conducted where it formerly was.</p>

The testimony upon this point, was furnished entirely by the complainant. From the testimony it appears that prior to the erection of the woiks of the respondent, the water of the stream was sufficient at all times for the uses of the farm of the complainant. This property was so divided into fields that he could water two thirds of it by the stream. Since the erection of the works, ho has been deprived of the use of the water more or less every year. In dry seasons, no water whatever passes down. This compels him to make other and inconvenient arrangements for watering his cattle. The rental value of the property has depreciated. The estimate of this depreciation runs from seventy-five to one hundred dollars a year.</p>

It is true the right to take the <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>water includes all the water of the stream, and it was to be taken for the purpose of erecting water-works. But the grant was also subject to the limitation that it was for the use of the Parke tract, and it was “ to be conducted where it formerly was.” There was evidence that the water had been formerly taken by a race-way for the use of a small turning mill which was abandoned many years ago, but of which there were still some remains at a time within the memory of one or more of the witnesses.</p>

Upon a review of the testimony he concluded that the plaintiff was injured to the extent of an annual reduction of $75 in the rental value of his land, and he allowed him that amount aggregated for seven years, being the time between the erection of the appellant’s works and the filing of the bill. We think this allowance was reasonable and was justified by the evidence. But he also recommended and the court entered a decree for a perpetual injunction restraining the appellant from any further taking of the water. In this we think there was error inasmuch as it appeared that the plaintiff had stood by and permitted the defendant to proceed with the erection of its works and diversion of the water at a very heavy expense without taking any legal steps to prevent it for so long a period as seven years. It is true there was correspondence between the counsel for the plaintiff and defendant upon the subject, in which the claim of the plaintiff for compensation was presented, and there was a promise that it should be considered, which does not seem to have been done. Nevertheless, the plaintiff took no active steps till he filed the present bill, in 1882, seven years after the water was diverted.</p>

We think the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for his injury, but it should be complete compensation, and when ascertained it should be final. It should not be excessive or unreasonable, and it should not be allowed as annual damages, but as the price of the privilege to continue the use of the water. As the master has ascertained the measure of the injury by an annually recurring sum, it is only necessary to capitalize that amount and add it to the amount due to the time of the decree in this court, and thus give the plaintiff complete compensation, which we accordingly do.</p>
