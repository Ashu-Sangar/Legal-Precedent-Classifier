Upon that land the plaintiff erected, in 1879, a saw-mill, and built roads and bridges to facilitate the hauling of the logs to the mill.

It is the duty of the court to construe the contract read to you, and under and by force of which the plaintiff claims here; and, assuming that the logs were destroyed by reason of the unassisted negligence of the defendant, the first inquiry that confronts us is, had the plaintiff such a property or interest in these logs, or such a possession or lien upon them as enabled him to maintain this action for their destruction.3</p>

It is doubtless true that under the agreement between Mercy B. Taylor and the plaintiff, the title to the logs was in the former at the time they were destroyed by fire. We consider it equally true, however, that he had an interest in them which will sustain this suit against the defendant company. He had the possession, and a lien for the work and labor expended upon them. Clearly, it was not in Mrs. Taylor’s power to deprive him of possession or lien. He could have held them against her had she attempted to deprive him of either. Nor can we doubt that had a stranger taken the logs away he could have sustained a suit therefor in his own name. This being so we are unable to see how a settlement between Mercy B. Taylor and the defendant company can deprive him of the right to sue the latter to recover the value of his interest whatever it was. Hence, when the plaintiff offered to explaiii the receipt given by Mrs. Taylor to the company, and to show that the $1.75 per thousand merely represented Mrs. Taylor’s interest in the logs, we think the evidence should have been admitted. Whether the defendant company has been guilty of such negligence as renders them liable in this action is a matter not before us. All we decide is that the plaintiff had such interest in the property as entitles him to maintain this action.</p>
