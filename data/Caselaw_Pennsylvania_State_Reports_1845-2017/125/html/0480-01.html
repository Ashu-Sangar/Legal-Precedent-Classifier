The funds in dispute are still in Stauffer’s possession.

The force and effect of the sales will be considered later on. All of the petitioner’s other averments are controverted by the respondent. In disposing of the respondent’s technical interposition to the citation, the court takes the liberty of saying that the invocation is inapplicable. It neither comports with justice nor equity. The moneys in dispute remain still in the possession of the respondent, and can be returned to the petitioner without loss or injury to any one. The statute and decisions cited in support of his answer and argument are not applicable.' When the reason of a law ceases, it should become inoperative.</p>

Keim and DeBenneville Keim, “ during life, the possession, use, benefits, rents, issues, and profits ” of an acre of land in the borough of Reading, to be enjoyed by the said Isaac H. Keim and DeBenneville Keim during life ; “ and immediately after their decease, the same shall descend to their children in equal shares, or their heirs, yet so that the children of each only divide between themselves the share which belonged to their father.” And she further bequeathed to said DeBenneville Keim alone during life, “ the yearly interest on one thousand dollars cash and four shares of stock in the Farmers’ Bank of Reading, one sixth part of a fifth part of the residue of my estate; and immediately after his decease, the said principal of one thousand dollars, bank stock, sixth part of a fifth part of my estate, shall be equally divided between the children of the said DeBenneville Keim or their heirs.” By the 16th item of her will, being her residuary clause, she bequeaths, etc., “ another of said fifth part shall be <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>equally divided among the issues of my deceased sister, Mary H. Keim.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b508-4" data-blocks='[["BL_508.4",508,[260,482,1187,409]]]'>' The question here suggests itself, What estate did DeBenneville Keim take under his aunt’s will in said acre of land ? Was it one in fee-tail, or only a life estate ? The answers to these questions must be gathered from the contents of the will. It expressly limits the estate to DeBenneville Keim for life, and further provides that immediately after his death the same shall be equally divided among “ his children or their heirs.” This language beyond a doubt limits the land to him for life.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b508-5" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[259,898,1188,653]]]'>I can see nothing in the devising clause to him, or in any other portion of her will, which might or could vest the premises to him in fee or in fee-tail. It is equally clear that she did not intend to make DeBenneville Keim the stock or ancestor through whom the “ children or their heirs ” should take by way of inheritance. On the contrary, it appears that he was only to enjoy the profits of this land during his natural life, and his children and their heirs, if any, should take the remainder, as immediate objects of her bounty. The word “ children ” employed, by a testator is primarily a word of purchase. It is only construed as a word of limitation when it can take effect in no other way: Buffar v. Bradford, 2 Atk. 222.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.6",508,[257,1571,1186,600]]]'>If the words “ or their heir's ” are to be regarded as words of limitation of the estate given to the remainder, the question is settled. It is, however, well settled that words of distribution with words of limitation superadded, show that those in remainder take not as heirs, even though described, as such, but as a new root of succession: Guthrie’s App., <a href="/pa/37/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="37 Pa. 9" data-case-ids="418953" data-case-paths="/pa/37/0009-01">37 Pa. 9</a>; Abbott v. Jenkins, 10 S. &amp; R. 296. If, on. the other hand, the words “ or their heirs ” are to be regarded to mean the child or children of DeBenneville Keim, then there is nothing that looks to a succession, and nothing that looks beyond the individuals mentioned in the will and in being at DeBenneville’s decease.</p>

      <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>As to the latter question, the learned judge of the Orphans’ Court was of opinion that the will gave a life estate in the lot to DeBenneville Keim and his brother, as tenants in common, with remainder to their children respectively ; but, inasmuch as the tenants for life both died without ever having bad any children, the money which represented the land reverted to the estate of the testatrix Esther High, to be distributed under the residuary clause of her will. In this we think he was right. Primarily and generally, the word “ children,” in a will, is a word of purchase, and, while it may be used to signify “ heirs ” or “ heirs of the body,” it will not be so construed unless the testator has employed other words indicative of an intention to use it as a word of limitation. The devise in this case is to “ Isaac H. Keim and DeBenneville Keim in common during life,” to be enjoyed by them “ during life,” thus clearly defining and limiting the estate given to them. The remainder is given to their children in equal shares, etc. The general rale undoubtedly is, that under a devise to one for life, with remainder to his children, the first taker has no freehold of inheritance. The fact that the devisee was without children when the will was made, as well as when it took effect by the death of the testator, does not change the rale : Cote v. Von Bonnhorst, <a href="/pa/41/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="41 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="480064" data-case-paths="/pa/41/0243-01">41 Pa. 243</a>.</p>
    <p id="b511-5" data-blocks='[["BL_511.4",511,[196,1559,1184,717]]]'>It is suggested that the use of the word “ descend ” by the testatrix, indicates an intention that the children should take directly from their respective parents, and not under her will, by way of remainder, but we think an examination of the whole will discloses no such intention. In the next preceding clause, after giving a life estate to other two of her nephews, she directs that immediately after the death of either life tenant, “ the undivided half of the one so dying shall go to and be enjoyed in equal shares to his children or to their heirs.” In this, she evidently intended that the remainder thus disposed of should go to the children under the provisions of her will, and not that they should take as heirs of their deceased parent. On the whole, we think there was no error in construing the clause of the will in question.</p>
