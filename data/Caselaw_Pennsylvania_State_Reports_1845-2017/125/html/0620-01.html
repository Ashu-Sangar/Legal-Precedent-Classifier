That the goods were duly transported to Philadelphia and delivered to the Ocean Steamship Company on September 23, 1887, for transportation to the consignees at St. Augustine, Fla.” About that there is no dispute. The goods were duly transported to Philadelphia and delivered to the Ocean Steamship Company on September 23, 1887, for transportation to Benhayon &amp; Gonzales, St. Augustine, Fla. As to that statement there is no dispute. That is followed, however, by this: “ The said Ocean Steamship Company forwarded the same by a steamer sailing from Philadelphia on September 28, 1887.” I do not know that there is any evidence as to the date that the defendant did forward them, and by a steamer sailing on September 28, 1887. “ That the goods were damaged by á fire breaking out in the cargo of the steamer while upon her voyage.” That the goods were damaged and lost by fire is an undisputed fact.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b646-6" data-blocks='[["BL_646.5",646,[263,1692,1201,718]]]'>This is the important part: “By the contract of the defendant it was not responsible for the negligence of or nonperformance of transportation by the Ocean Steamship Com- ' pany.” I answer that this would be affirmed if the jury find that the defendant did not agree to send these goods by the Atlantic Coast Line, either by special written contract, or by directions marked upon the boxes, as testified to by the plaintiff and by Mr: Snavely. If the directions were to send them in any other way, the company would not be exonerated if it broke its contract or sent them by the Ocean Steamship Company, instead of by the way in which they were directed. I instruct the jury to find as a question of fact, as to that point, as to what the obligation of the steamship company and .the company defendant is.1</p>

Even if the jury should believe that, at the time of the shipment of the goods, the original invoice delivered therewith did contain the words “Via Atlantic Coast Line, by fast freight,” the evidence shows that the proximate cause of the loss of the goods was a fire which took place on the steamer Dessoug, while the goods were in transit by the Ocean Steamship Company between Philadelphia and Savannah. The failure of the defendant to forward the goods by the Atlantic Coast Line was not the proximate cause of the loss, and the plaintiff cannot, therefore, recover from this defendant.</p>

I do not think this is a question to be determined by the principle which is sought to be invoked in the point which has been raised, that is, the fourth point. This is a question of a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant, and if the defendant broke its contract, and loss resulted from the failure, it was not a case of negligence, whether the injury resulted from a proximate or any remote cause connected with the loss of these goods. The question is as to whether there •was such a contract as I have referred to, where the defendant undertook to dispatch them in a partimilar way, whether it kept that contract or whether it broke it; and if the jury believe that the defendant broke its contract, and that the loss resulted to the plaintiff, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover his loss as against the defendant.3</p>

It is submitted that whichever way the case be looked at, whether as an action for breach of contract, or for negligent conduct, the charge upon the subject of the defendant’s liability for the loss of the goods was erroneous. The fact that there was a direction to ship by a certain connecting route did <a id="p624" href="#p624" data-label="624" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*624</a>not make the defendant liable for a loss by fire on the routé of a different carrier. The fire was' an intervening cause with which the defendant had nothing to do, and a loss by such a fire cannot be contended to have been the natural consequence of the delivery of the goods to the steamship company: Lancaster City v.

And if the case be looked at as a loss arising from a breach of a contract, it does not follow that the defendant is liable for every loss following the act.

If counsel for defendant tried this case upon the theory that it was founded upon a tort, he at no time made such intimation to the court.

It was not a suit to recover damages for the negligence of the defendant company, but for its breach of contract in not forwarding the cigars according to instructions. The plaintiff lived at Akron, in the county of Lancaster, Pa., and he shipped over, defendant’s road five cases of cigars to Benliayon &amp; Gonzales, St. Augustine, Florida. Each ease was marked “ via Philadelphia, care of Atlantic Coast Line, by fast freight.” When the cars reached Philadelphia, the defendant company, instead of shipping them as directed by rail, delivered the said five cases to the “ Ocean Steamship Company” of Savannah, and sent them by sea. They were destroyed by fire en route.</p>

It avers that “ in consequence of the carelessness, negligence and improper conduct of the defendant in that behalf, the goods have never been delivered to the said consignees,” etc. It is sometimes difficult, in the present free and easy mode of pleading, to ascertain accurately what is the precise cause of action. We are inclined to the opinion, however, that it was for broach of the contract to forward the cigars as directed. If the defendant company, for reasons of its own, saw fit to disregard instructions, and forward the cigars by steamer instead of by rail, and a loss resulted, it is too plain for argument the defendant would bo responsible for such loss.
