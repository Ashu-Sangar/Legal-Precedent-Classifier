The minutes of the conference for that year show that a statement was made by Bishop Simpson, and that the committee appointed by him made a report, which was adopted, accepting the trust “ with its conditions and limitations.” A board of trustees, composed of ten clergymen and eleven laymen, was elected, and the trustees so elected were subsequently organized, and from time to time • held meetings with a view to the proper establishment of a hospital under the provisions of the will.

D., deceased.” The account referred to was filed for the purpose of bringing before the court the question of the right of the persons so appointed to demand the surrender of the residuary estate of the testator; and as, at that time, no scheme had been devised for the hospital, and the trifling subscriptions which had been made were conditioned upon the receipt by the board of such estate, the auditing judge was of opinion that the heirs and next of kin were entitled to have it remain in the custody of the executor. The reasons for this opinion were thus expressed in the adjudication :</p>

But tire ‘ organization ’ of the scheme must precede the bishop’s certificate. ‘ I rely,’ he says, ‘ upon the said conference and bishop not to call for the payment of the money unless they have devised a scheme for the hospital, practical, and seemingly certain of success. I do not wish my estate wasted in an abortive scheme, nor buildings commenced unless the funds at command are sufficient to erect, equip and endow them.’ If the scheme should prove ‘ abortive,’ the estate is to go, at the expiration of the period prescribed, to his heirs and next of kin; and it will be abortive, in the sense understood by him, unless there should be funds ‘ at command ’ sufficient to ‘ erect ’ and 6 equip,’ as well as to ‘ endow.’ As the effect of the certificate, when properly given, is to take away the rights of heirs and next of kin, they are, under well-settled principles, entitled to demand a strict compliance with the preliminary terms of the will, and to insist that the fund shall be retained by the trustees, for their protection, in the meanwhile.”</p>

Can it be said that the scheme devised is ‘ practical and seemingly certain of success?’ The necessary funds are an essential part of success; and these, if not actually in hand, must, as the will declares, be ‘ at command,’ at least in the sense of the subscriptions by individual members of the board of trustees. The auditing judge is of the opinion, therefore, .that the estate cannot yet be taken from the accountant and placed beyond the reach of the heirs and next of kin of the testator. Two years, however, remain before it can be asserted that ‘ the impracticability of the proposed hospital shall have been demonstrated; ’ and there is little reason to doubt that in the meanwhile, everything will be done by the Methodist Epis<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>copal Church, of Philadelphia and its members, necessary for the organization and establishment of this charity.

The deed, which is dated June 6, 1887, and duly recorded, is from Nelson Beardsley to the Methodist Episcopal Hospital. Plans and specifications have been prepared by Thomas P. Lonsdale, an architect of experience, under the advice and suggestions of Dr. Billings, of Washington City, an authority of great eminence in all matters relating to the building and management of hospitals, aided also by Dr. Horatio C. Wood, one of the originators of, and for many years connected with, the hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. The scheme contemplates the ultimate erection of six distinct, separate buildings, each complete in itself, in two parallel rows, three buildings on each side, with a central building connecting with each, containing boiler, etc., etc. The buildings, which are to be on what is known as the <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>pavilion plan, are to be constructed of brick and' stone, two stories and a basement: the basement to be used for ventilating purposes, and the upper stories as the hospital. The cost of each building, as estimated by practical builders, is from $60,000 to $65,000, and of the central boiler-house about $10,000. The design at present is to erect the boiler building and one only of the hospital buildings; the others to be erected from time to time hereafter, as the receipt of funds from other sources may permit. One building, however, will make a complete hospital with a capacity for fifty-six patients. When all of the buildings are erected, the capacity will be six times as great. Dr. Wood, who is one of the advisory board of the trustees, testified as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b395-5" data-blocks='[["BL_395.4",395,[196,1033,1187,1389]],["BL_396.1",396,[274,361,1188,706]]]'>“ The scheme of the most modern hospitals is that they should be composed of a series of detached buildings, each one capable of accommodating from fifty to seventy-five patients, and each known as a pavilion. The Johns Hopkins Hospital is made up of a large number of these so-called pavilions, of one of which the plan is a copy. The plan has been gone over very carefully by Dr. Billings, who was originally sent by the Johns Hopkins Hospital to Europe to study all the hospitals there, who has probably constructed more hospitals than any other man in the world, who is the government expert in hospital matters, and who is known and recognized on each continent as an absolute authority in such matters. I do not think it is possible to have a plan which would afford better results for working purposes. If the hospital should grow by accumulation of funds, the increase comes, naturally and architecturally, by the addition of pavilion buildings, and there is therefore no waste of money for alterations, because everything is complete for an almost indefinite growth. The ground purchased is of large extent, sufficient for a hospital of 400 patients. The proposed hospital would probably average about 400 patients, continually present. It is hardly possible for a hospital to have all its beds occupied all the time. A certain number of beds must always be reserved for emergencies; and besides, some of the beds will have to be occupied, probably, by the help, and a few by private patients, so that I think it is fair, in estimating the cost of the hospital, to count on 40 beds in each building when the hospital is reasonably full. These <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>patients ought to cost about $1 per day. The cost of patients in the University Hospital is $1.11 per day; the Pennsylvania Hospital, $1.08, and the Episcopal Hospital, $0.96 per day. ..... If a hospital with 40 beds is run at the rate of $1 per day for each patient, the annual expenditure will be about $14,000. If the building and lot are paid for, and this sum of $230,000 is invested, the income will be about $11,500, leaving a deficiency of $2,500 a year. To meet this deficiency there is, first, a certain income from pay patients. I have never known a hospital whose prospects for its permanent success, at this stage of its procedure, were more certain or better. The income would be about $11,500, and the probable income from pay patients about $2,000, leaving $500 to be raised by the various churches.”</p>

To what extent the annual contributions are depended upon for meeting the annual expenditures is strikingly shown by the cases of these three hospitals, more especially that of the Jewish Church; and all of them are equally rigorous in their exclusion of homoeopathic and eclectic physicians from any participation in their management or in the treatment of patients. It is not to be supposed that benevolence prevails to a less extent in the vast body composing the Methodist Episcopal Church within the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Conference — including, as it does, the territory between the Susquehanna and the Delaware, and extending from the southern boundary of the state to Dauphin county on the northwest and beyond Stroudsburg on the northeast — or that the proportion of adherents to the old system of medicine is not so great as among the other denominations.</p>

He was doubtless familiar with the histories of the denominational hospitals of the city in which he lived, had read their annual reports, had noticed their growth from small beginnings, and knew the source upon which they relied largely, if not chiefly, for annual support. The subject of the disposition of his residuary estate had been before him for several years, and would naturally call for much careful thought and consideration. He was a practical man and a Methodist. He knew the authority of the conference, and had confidence in its integrity and sound common sense ; and the man whom it might select as presiding bishop could well be trusted. Hence, instead of himself suggesting it, and in this respect radically changing the provisions of the will, he left the determination of the scheme to the conference, indicating only the general locality in which the <a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>hospital should be erected. “ I authorize,” he says, “ the conference .....to organize in such way as to it shall seem best a scheme for this charity; ” and the certificate of the presiding bishop is the only authority required to entitle the persons whom he designates to receive the money from the executor.</p>

Had this been his intention, he would not have spoken of the required scheme as one “seemingly ” certain of success ; for success in that case must have been absolutely and necessarily certain. Throughout the codicil,' he seems to contemplate the possibility of failure, even after the money has been properly paid to the persons appointed to receive it. “ I desire,” he says, “ it distinctly understood, however, that in paying over my estate to such persons as shall be designated to receive it, my trustees assume no responsibility as to the practicability of the scheme nor as to the proper application of -the fund, thereto.” All that he required was that the conference and bishop should not call for the money until “ they have devised a scheme for the hospital, practical and seemingly certain of success.” -The question of practicability and seeming certainty of success was left exclusively to them, and a discretion thus given will not be controlled or interfered with by a court of equity unless a fraudulent or manifestly improper exercise of it should be attempted. As was said by Judge Strong in the opinion quoted in Williams’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=73%20Pa.%20285" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="73 Pa. 285">73 Pa. 285</a> : “ A court of equity does not interfere with a discretion reposed, except in cases of clear abuse, when the court can conclude that the donee of a power is acting in fraud of it.” . See also Perry on Trusts, § 911, and authorities there cited. There is not, nor could there be, any suggestion of fraud in the present case; and mo court could say that the scheme devised is not practical and seemingly certain of success, or, in view of the evidence already referred to, that it is at all likely, or even possible, that the estate wilP be “wasted in an abortive scheme.”</p>

The effect of this would be to read the will as if the words were “ moneys in hand,” instead of “ moneys at command,” though the expressions are by no means synonymous. The testator doubtless had in his mind the supreme authority of the church under whose auspices the hospital was to be conducted, and he certainly would regard moneys subscribed in the manner customary in the church as “ at command,” in the sense employed by him. Moreover, the condition of having funds at command, though it is to precede the commencement of buildings, is not required in advance of the payment by the executor to the persons designated by the bishop. The devising of a scheme, practical and seemingly certain of success, is all that is required for this purpose : and what is said by the testator in the sentence referred to is entirely satisfied by regarding it as uttered in the way of advice as to the subsequent use of the money.</p>
