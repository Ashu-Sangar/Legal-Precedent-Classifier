The correctness of this proposition is dependent upon the intention of the testator, as gathered from his will considered in its entirety. He first bequeaths to his wife all his estate, for her sole use as long as she lives. It is to be divided after her death. He makes no division of his estate himself, but directs it to be divided in the future. During the lifetime of the widow, the sale of his real estate was left discretionary with his executors: after her decease there was a mandatory direction to the surviving executor to sell it, to the end that he might divide it in 'accordance with the provisions of the will. The surviving executor must make the distribution, and by implication he has all the necessary powers : Gray v. Henderson, <a href="/citations/?q=71%20Pa.%20370" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="71 Pa. 370">71 Pa. 370</a>; Myers’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=62%20Pa.%20107" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="62 Pa. 107">62 Pa. 107</a>.

Assuming that the will did not give authority, express or implied, to the executor to sell the real estate after the death of the widow, the offer to show that he had in fact sold it and accounted for the proceeds, and that his account was settled and confirmed by the Orphans’ Court having jurisdiction thereof, should have been received in evidence to show that plaintiffs acquiesced in the sale for a period of sixteen years and were therefore estopped from questioning its validity. Ejectment is an equitable action. The time for the plaintiffs to speak and assert their claim was when the property was sold and the proceeds accounted for by the executor. One’s silence, when in good conscience he ought to speak, will close his mouth when he would speak: 2 Hermon on Estoppel, § 939.</p>

The objection was sustained and the proposed evidence excluded. This action of the court constitutes the first assignment of error.

It is not claimed that he ever had. any other than the testamentary power referred to. It may also be conceded, for the purposes of this case, that the inventory, executor’s account, etc., would have shown that the purchase-money mentioned in the deed was accounted for by the surviving executor, and that the estate was still indebted to him in the sum of $149.75.</p>

    <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[206,817,1180,1234]]]'>The devise, as we have seen, is to the widow for life, remainder in fee to Sarah Ermentrout and plaintiff below as tenants in common. It appears to have then occurred to the testator that for the better and more certain support of his widow, it was advisable to authorize his executors, in their discretion, to sell the real estate, invest the proceeds, etc.; and he accordingly created the testamentary power in question, directing the proceeds of the sale to be invested and interest paid annually to his widow, with the right to use as much of the principal as might be necessary for her support. It is very evident that testator’s wife was the chief object of his bounty, and that the power was created for her benefit, and for no other purpose. There is nothing in the will to indicate that it was intended to be exercised for the purpose of converting the land into money to pay debts or for distribution. The sole object was to provide for the supjiort of the widow, in case his executors considered it necessary to sell for that purpose. The power was therefore exercisable only during her lifetime, and upon her death it ceased to exist. No principle is better settled than that when the object for which a power has been created has been accomplished, or has become impossible or unattainable, the power itself ceases to exist: Wilkinson v.

There was a clear intent that the executor should make distribution, and the power to sell therefore survived.</p>
