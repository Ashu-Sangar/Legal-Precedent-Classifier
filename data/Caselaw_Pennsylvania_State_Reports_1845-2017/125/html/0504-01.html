    <p id="b529-12" data-blocks='[["BL_529.11",529,[194,1576,1182,512]]]'>It appears by the record in this case that the original action was brought against Sarah A. W. Krips, administratrix of Henry Krips, deceased, in January, 1872, but judgment was not obtained until March, 1886, more than thirteen years after the decease of the defendant’s intestate. A scire facias was then issued on the judgment to bring in the widow and heirs, and afterwards judgment de terris against them was entered in default of appearance. In April, 1887, the judgment was stricken off on the ground that it was improvidently entered. That action of the court has been assigned as error.</p>
