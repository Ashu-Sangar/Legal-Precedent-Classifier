They also claim, as set forth in the second count of their declaration, that Billings &amp; Fell fraudulently induced Rundell, the agent of Kalbfus &amp; Jones, to deliver to them hay that he had bought for Kalbfus &amp; Jones, some of which they claim that he had paid for with Kalbfus &amp; Jones’ money. So far as all the defendants are concerned, the question of conspiracy stands out in front, and there can be no recovery against them, unless you find a wicked and unlawful conspiracy on their part to cheat and defraud and injure Kalbfus &amp; Jones. A conspiracy is a false and malicious combination and agreement, not necessarily in words, but by operating together, to cheat and defraud or injure. They must either by agreement or understanding operate together in such a way as t'o result in injuring Kalbfus &amp; Jones, or eJse your verdict must be for the defendants. You cannot give a verdict for the plaintiffs unless you find from the evidence that there was a false and malicious combination and conspiracy, on the part of these defendants, to injure Kalbfus &amp; Jones by turning over and delivering the hay to Billings &amp; Fell, or a combination to induce Rundell to leave <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>the employment of the plaintiffs, by which they suffered loss. You have heard the evidence of the plaintiffs as to the declarations which they allege Rundell made at the time he was buying some of this hay, to the effect that he was purchasing for them, the plaintiffs, and you have heard Mr. Rundell’s testimony in denial or explanation of these declarations. I think he testifies that he did not, in any particular case, say that he was buying that particular hay for Kalbfus &amp; Jones.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b150-5" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[259,760,1188,1541]]]'>On the part of the defendants it is claimed, and they have given evidence tending to prove, that Rundell bought more hay for Kalbfus &amp; Jones than they could handle; that they could not, or did not take care of it as fast as he bought it, and that, for his own profit, and without any intentional or actual injury to them, and without any wrong or dishonest purpose or combination, he did buy hay for Billings &amp; Fell. If you find that Billings and Fell were acting honestly in this matter, and that there was no combination between them and Rundell, then there could be no conspiracy in this case. But if they did combine with Rundell to leave the employment of Kalbfus &amp; Jones, and to turn over to them, the defendants, the hay which they had purchased for Kalbfus &amp; Jones, then that would be a conspiracy. There is also evidence on the part of the defendants, that no part of the hay which Rundell had bought for Kalbfus &amp; Jones was turned over to Billings &amp; Fell. They also claim that when Welles bought the carload of hay at Troy, he agreed that that should settle all matters between them, and that he at that time had a full knowledge of just what Rundell had been doing. If that is true, that would be an end to the plaintiffs’ claim on that ground, although Rundell had done all that they claim, before that. Mr. Welles, on the other hand, denies that there was an agreement of settlement at that time. If you should find that there was no conspiracy, or that there was a settlement, as claimed by the defendants, then your verdict should be for the defendants. If, however, you find that there was such a conspiracy as we have described, and that the plaintiffs were damaged thereby, then you would be justified in finding a verdict in their favor for the amount of such damage.</p>

The damage sustained by the plaintiff is the ground of the action, not the conspiracy. Where an action is brought against two or more, as concerned in the wrong done, it is necessary, in order to recover against all of them, to prove a combination, or joint act of all. For this purpose it may be important to establish the allegation of a conspiracy. But if it turn out on the trial that only one was concerned, the plaintiff may still recover, the same as if that one had been sued alone. The conspiracy or combination, is nothing, so far as sustaining the action goes, the foundation of it being the actual damage done to the plaintiff.” If you find for the defendants, that is an end of the case.

The verdict in favor of Billings and Fell established that there was no fraudulent agreement and combination between the three co-defendants to defraud the plaintiffs. This finding deprives the case of every element of fraud, and puts the plaintiffs upon their contract with Rundell as the sole basis of their claim. But a breach of the contract cannot support an action in tort: Pollock on Torts, 4. As to Rundell, therefore, there can be no recovery at all, as the case contains no substantial element of injury save a breach of contract, and there is no claim in the declaration that will sustain the application of the doctrine of Laverty v.

Hyde, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 314" data-case-ids="1853531" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0314-01">2 W. &amp; S. 314</a>; Millingar v.

Applying the principles of these authorities to the facts of this case, the plaintiffs had a good cause of action in tort against Rundell.</p>

If Billings and Fell knew of Rundell’s agency for plaintiffs, or that the hay they received from him had been bought for plaintiffs, then they were parties to the wrong; but the jury finding that neither of them were parties to the wrong, then the principle of Laverty v. Vanarsdale, <a href="/citations/?q=65%20Pa.%20509" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="65 Pa. 509">65 Pa. 509</a>, prevails: “ Where the action is brought against two or more as concerned in the wrong done, it is necessary in order to recover against all of them, to prove a joint act or combination of them all. For this purpose,.it may be important to establish the allegation of a conspiracy. But if it turn out on the trial that only one was concerned, the plaintiff may still recover the same as if such one had been sued alone. This doctrine has recently been reaffirmed in Collins v. Cronin, <a href="/pa/117/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="117 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="555843" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0035-01">117 Pa. 35</a>.</p>

It was to put the court in full possession of the facts concerning the alleged former recovery, that the jury were directed to find specially all the facts tendered by the issue. The jury <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>passed upon these facts, disputed and undisputed, bearing upon the special plea. The record shows that upon the general issue there was a verdict for the plaintiffs, and on the special plea the facts were specially found, substantially as set out in the plea. The court properly treated them as the defendant’s plea, and as if demurred to by the plaintiffs, and being of the opinion that they did not constitute a bar, directed judgment to be entered on the verdict. This action is fully sustained by Tams v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/42/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="42 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="481542" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0402-01">42 Pa. 402</a>.</p>
    <p id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.4",155,[193,839,1181,714]]]'>4. In pleading a former recovery, it is essential that it should appear to have been, not only for the same cause of action, but between the same parties: Hampton v. Broom, 1 Miles 241; Peterson v. Lothrop, <a href="/citations/?q=34%20Pa.%20228" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="34 Pa. 228">34 Pa. 228</a>. Moreover, a judgment does not conclude anything incidentally arising in the trial in which it was recovered, nor does it conclude a matter immaterial to it, and which could not have been legitimately tried; Tams v. Lewis, <a href="/pa/42/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="42 Pa. 402" data-case-ids="481542" data-case-paths="/pa/42/0402-01">42 Pa. 402</a>; Hibshman v.

The record pleaded in this case is in form ex contractu. On the trial of the issue involved in it, the defendants could not set off or recoup any damages except such as arose out of the same transaction as that on which suit was brought: Gogel v. Jacoby, 5 S. &amp; R. 117.</p>

If this instruction was erroneous it lias not been made to appear. The action below was for a tort in the nature of a conspiracy. The declaration is not printed in the paper books; hence we can gather no information from it. In a prosecution for a conspiracy the combination is of the gist of the offence, and if that is not proved there can be no conviction. The offence is complete wdien the conspiracy is formed. In a civil suit for damages the rule is different. In the latter case, the mere combination injures no one, and, unless there is something done in pursuance thereof, I apprehend no action would lie. The rule is thus laid down in our latest case upon this subject, Collins v. Cronin, <a href="/pa/117/0035-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="117 Pa. 35" data-case-ids="555843" data-case-paths="/pa/117/0035-01">117 Pa. 35</a>: “ In an action against two or more, in case in the <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>nature of a conspiracy, if the tort be actionable whether committed by one or more, recovery may be had against but <em>one; </em>but if the tort be actionable only when committed under an unlawful conspiracy of two or more, recovery may not be had unless the unlawful conspiracy be established.” If the declaration had been printed we could have formed an intelligent opinion as to whether the tort in this case was of such a nature that all the defendants must have participated therein. It is becoming a too frequent practice to omit the pleadings from the paper book of the plaintiff in error. In all such eases we must assume that they sustain the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b156-5" data-blocks='[["BL_156.4",156,[281,939,1188,1181]]]'>The second assignment alleges that the court erred in entering judgment against the defendant below upon the special verdict. The jury found a general verdict against the defendant for |552. They also, at the request of the court, found certain facts specifically. The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs upon the verdict. In this we see no error. This was an action brought by the plaintiffs against the defendant to recover damages for a breach of his duty to them as agent. If the defendant, while acting as the agent of plaintiffs to buy hay for them, turned over the hay when bought for them and with their money, to the firm of Billings &amp; Fell, after a rise in the market price of the hay, for the purpose of getting larger commissions, or for any reason, he was acting in bad faith and would be liable to his employers for any loss they sustained thereby. The plea of a former recovery was of no importance and might well have been demurred to. It related to a suit to which the defendant was not a party. We see nothing in the record of that suit, so far as it was presented, to prevent a recovery by the plaintiffs in this suit against their agent for a fraud committed by him. The third assignment was to the admission of evidence. It is not in accordance with our rules and will not be considered. The remaining assignments are not important.</p>
