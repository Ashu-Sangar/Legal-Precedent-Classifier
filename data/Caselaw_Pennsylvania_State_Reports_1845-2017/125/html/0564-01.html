      <em>(a) W. </em>B., who died in 1875, bequeathed his estate to his widow for life, with remainder to his children. The estate consisted chiefly of judgments against a son which were liens on certain land. In 1877 this land was sold, on judgments subsequent to W. B.’s, to “ C. W., executor of <em>W. </em>B.”</p>

At the sale, notice was read and given that there were no debts of the estate, and that the executor had no right to make the sale. A request was made to have the sale adjourned, until the right of the executor to make the sale without an order of court could be further investigated. This sort of protest against the sale was entered into by all the heirs of the decedent,- except the mother of Edmund Gumaer, who became the purchaser of one of the farms, and she was only silent, that is, did not insist upon a sale. The executor insisted upon completing the sale then and there, and sold one farm worth at least $3,000 to Edmund Gumaer, for $455, and he sold the other farm to S. J. Strauss for $50, which was worth at least $1,000.</p>

He is still owner of the title. The said Strauss was not at tho sale. He was and. is a co-office-tenant with G. L. Halsey, Esq., who acted as attorney for the executor in making the sale. It seems he instructed Mr. Halsey to bid off the property-for him, if it were sold cheap. For Halsey’s friendship in the matter he received $100 from Mr. Strauss. A Mr. Zimmerman is now the owner of the Strauss title, but he had notice of the clamor made by the heirs against the sale.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b591-7" data-blocks='[["BL_591.6",591,[174,718,1181,1086]]]'>With this state of facts, what right have we to wrest from the purchasers their title, whether it be good, bad or indifferent? No creditor of the decedent exists to complain of the manner of making the sale, and the “heirs” entered into their own contract or trust relation with the executor. So far as Wells held the title for the heirs, he held, not as executor of the decedent, but as their own creature, their agent or trustee; and, so far as he held it solely for Pardon T. Barber, he also held it extra the will and extra his office as executor, and in either case we have no jurisdiction. There being no creditors, and, having entered into express trust relations with the heirs, the executor did not purchase and hold by virtue of his office as executor, as was the case in Billington’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20R.%2055" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 R. 55">8 R. 55</a>; Oeslager v.

    <p class="summary" id="b591-8" data-blocks='[["BL_591.7",591,[177,1810,1177,497]]]'>We do not charge the executor with fraud. At most he was guilty only of mismanagement which resulted in securing an inadequate price for the land, and for this cause we might have set the sale aside at any time before the delivery of the deed. Before the sale we might have restrained the executor from making the sale, upon showing that the estate, as such, was likely to be jeopardized. But, having acquiesced in the sale so long, the matter has gone beyond our control. The estate of Williams Barber, deceased, is not, as such, any longer interested.</p>

Perhaps a court of equity may have authority to declare the sale void for want of authority to make it. Perhaps an action at law will lie against the executor’s estate for damages. Perhaps the heirs may make their defence successfully in the action of ejectment now pending. No matter, however, whether any opportunity exists elsewhere or not, to have the case decided upon its merits, it seems clear to us that this court is now powerless to afford the relief prayed for, and the petition is therefore dismissed at the costs of the petitioners.</p>
