If the jury believe from the evidence in this case, that from the knowledge plaintiffs had of Bierce’s manner of conducting their business, they had reason to believe that he had been conducting it fraudulently or dishonestly, and therefore discharged him and took the bond of Pierce and Holmes to secure them for any balance that might be found due Frost’s Sons, without disclosing to said Holmes the grounds of such belief and discharge, this would bo a fraud upon Holmes, and plaintiffs cannot recover against him.</p>

If they had known of dishonest transactions in this business conducted by Mr. Pierce for Frost’s Sous, by which the amount then due from Pierce to them was enlarged, perhaps they might have been required to make it known to the surety. But in this case, the evidence does not show that Frost’s Sons had knowledge of any dishonest transactions on the part of Mr. Pierce, nor does it appear, throughout the subsequent examination of the matter, so far as it is disclosed in court, that any dishonesty-on the part of Pierce was ever disclosed. There is nothing in this case to show that the amount for which Mr. Holmes is required to be responsible, was ever increased in any way, or affected by any dishonest transaction on the part of Mr. Pierce. This bond, given by Mr. Holmes had no reference to subsequent services that might be rendered by Mr. Pierce, who was to be placed in a capacity of trust by Frost’s Sons. But it had <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>reference to the settlement of transactions which were then fully consummated, and related entirely to the past, and bound him simply to pay an account that was then actually due from Mr. Pierce, when the amount was ascertained. We do not think there is any evidence in this case which would justify us in submitting to you the question as to whether this bond may not be defeated because of the withholding from Mr. Holmes of some information then in the possession of Frost’s Sons as to the dishonesty of Pierce.15</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b356-4" data-blocks='[["BL_356.4",356,[231,824,1183,199]]]'>6. Holmes cannot be compelled to pay the costs made in the account render suit of Frost’s Sons v.

    <p class="summary" id="b356-7" data-blocks='[["BL_356.7",356,[225,1237,1187,863]]]'>It is argued by the defendants’ counsel that the examination provided for in that bond, should be an examination conducted by both of the parties to the transaction, Mr. Pierce and Frost’s Sons, by which they should mutually reach a conclusion which should adjust, to their satisfaction between them, the amount due from Mr. Pierce to J. O. Frost’s Sons, and that this amount having been so ascertained, would fix the sum for which the surety in this bond should be held responsible; that this examination was to be concluded within two months from the date of the bond; that such an examination, conducted by both parties, by which they should arrive at a result which would be conclusive between them, so fixing the sum for the payment of which Mr. Holmes was to be held responsible, was a condition precedent to the demand upon Mr. Holmes; that without the sum being ascertained in this way, and in this time, there could be no demand made upon Mr. Holmes, and no breach of this covenant could be shown.</p>

It is not alleged, upon either side, that an examination of that character was conducted, within that time. And we think that as this action is so intimately connected with other proceedings which have been had in this court, growing out of this same transaction, it is important that a uniform construction should be given to this bond, in all these proceedings, in order that whatever construction is ultimately held, it shall work to settle fairly and properly the controversy between these parties.</p>
