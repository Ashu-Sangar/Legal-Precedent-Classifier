Plaintiffs are therefore not innocent holders for value, before maturity, by purchase in the ordinary course of trade. Defendant is entitled to make every defence against them that he could make against the original holder. After diligent inquiry deponent has been unable to find any such party as L. A.

    <p id="b671-6" data-blocks='[["BL_671.5",671,[231,782,1180,614]]]'>1. An examination of the affidavit of defence discloses no such facts as would warrant the inference of fraud as a defence to the note. There was no warranty concerning the quality or productiveness of the oats, and a mere representation of quality does not constitute a warranty: Whitaker v. Eastwick, <a href="/pa/75/0232-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 232" data-case-ids="1036678" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0232-01">75 Pa. 232</a>. The oats association did not guarantee payment for the oats sold for defendant; all that they promised to do. they did, namely, find purchasers for sixty bushels of oats at ten dollars per bushel. If there was any fraud, the defendant entered into the contract with his eyes open, and hence the transaction did not constitute a fraud upon him: Benj. on Sales, 555.</p>
    <p id="b671-7" data-blocks='[["BL_671.6",671,[232,1403,1181,666]]]'>2. But admitting, for the sake of the argument, that a fraud was committed upon the defendant, in obtaining the note in question, how can that affect the plaintiff's in this case ? The affidavit avers that while Miller held the note he delivered it before maturity to the plaintiffs “in payment and satisfaction of an old debt that he owed them.” Here is an admission that plaintiffs received the note for a valuable consideration, before maturity, and without any notice of any alleged fraud. To what profit, then, would be a trial, when the requirements to prove title, as laid down in Lerch Hardware Co. v. First N. Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=109%20Pa.%20244" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="109 Pa. 244">109 Pa. 244</a>, to wit, that “the plaintiff will be put to proof that he obtained it before maturity, in good faith, and for value,” is admitted?

The averment that while Miller held the note he delivered it to the plaintiffs to prevent the defendant from making defence on the merits, is of no avail: Forepaugh v. Baker, 21 W. N. 299. And the averment that plaintiffs are not holders for value, because they received it “in payment and satisfaction of an old debt,” etc., is of no effect, for “if the plaintiff received the note for, that is, as we take it, in payment of an <a id="p648" href="#p648" data-label="648" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*648</a>antecedent debt, he did purchase it for a valuable consideration : ” Bardsley v.

Moreover, nothing but clear evidence of knowledge or notice of fraud, or mala fides, can impeach the prima, facie title of a holder of commercial paper taken before maturity: Moorehead v.

The plaintiffs not alleging in the pleadings that they are •holders for value, and the affidavit of defence alleging that the note was procured by fraud, judgment cannot be entered for the plaintiffs. It will be noticed that in their statement of claim the plaintiffs sue as transferees by delivery, but they do not allege that the transfer was for value, or that they are holders for value. While bills and notes payable to bearer pass by delivery merely, yet in the face of the allegation that the instrument was procured by fraud, how can judgment be entered for plaintiffs when they do not even allege that they' are holders for value ?</p>
    <p id="b672-7" data-blocks='[["BL_672.6",672,[240,1337,1196,499]]]'>2. The affidavit of defence alleges that L. A. Beilhartz, the payee of the note is a fictitious name.

The unexplained use of the fictitious name as payee, is material here, taken in connection with the other facts alleged in the affidavit of defence, as evidence of the intention to commit a fraud on the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b672-9" data-blocks='[["BL_672.7",672,[247,1852,1184,456]]]'>3. The affidavit of defence alleging such facts as show that the note was obtained from the defendant by misrepresentation, and negotiated in fraud of his rights, it is sufficient to prevent judgment being entered for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence: Hutchinson v.

A special plea setting forth such a defence is notice to put the plaintiff to proof that he is a bona fide holder, and an affidavit of defence to the same effect would also be sufficient: Albietz v.

The particulars of the fraud are given, and it is also averred upon information and belief that the note was passed to the plaintiffs by Miller, the active agent in committing the fraud.

Taken literally it makes out no defence, and under the former affidavit of defence law, which required the filing only of a cojiy of the note, and supplied by intendment therefrom all the necessary legal requisites to the cause of action, would not have been sufficient to prevent judgment. But the procedure act of 1887 requires not only a copy of the writing but a statement of his case, to be filed by the plaintiff, and if we examine the statement we find that it avers only that “said Beilhartz (the payee) by delivery transferred the same to plaintiffs.” The peculiar language of this statement, not “paid,” or “sold,” or any similar word, but “by delivery transferred,” and the entire absence of date of transfer, or averment of value or consideration, passing from the plaintiffs to Beilhartz or Miller, deprive the statement of sufficient weight as a clear case for the plaintiffs, to entitle them to a summary judgment. Moreover the distinction between taking a note as absolute, or as only conditional payment and satisfaction of an old debt, is <a id="p650" href="#p650" data-label="650" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*650</a>so narrow, and depends so entirely on the exact facts, that the defendant should not be deprived of his right to have the facts fully developed upon a trial, unless the plaintiff has in his statement made out at least such a prima facie case as would meet the defence set up by the affidavit.</p>
