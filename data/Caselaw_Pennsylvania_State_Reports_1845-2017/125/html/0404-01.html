    <p class="summary" id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[220,774,1184,1284]]]'>The evidence shows that she paid $4,000 of moneys belonging to her separate estate, for the transfer of the judgment. Of this amount she raised $3,500 by mortgaging her own real estate, the title to which was in her long prior to the origin of the debt which was involved in the judgment. The remaining $500, the auditing judge finds, was paid out of the rents of her real estate, consisting of three houses and lots. These rents were paid regularly to her by the collector, and were kept by her in the house or carried on her person. The proof was, that she called upon the holder of the judgment and paid him $500 out of her purse on one day, taking a receipt therefor, and soon afterwards paid him the $3,500, which was identified as the proceeds of the mortgage. It is true that in the purchase by a wife as against her husband’s creditors, it must appear not only that the wife had a separate estate, but that she actually applied it to the purchase: Hause v. Gilger, <a href="/pa/52/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1002268" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0412-01">52 Pa. </a><em><a href="/pa/52/0412-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="52 Pa. 412" data-case-ids="1002268" data-case-paths="/pa/52/0412-01">412</a>; </em>Ileath v.

That fact is for the jury, and a jury would be justified in finding it in this instance. She may not, however, claim more than she actually paid for the transfer. The husband may have intended that she should become the owner of the entire judgment, but he had no power to give any part of his estate to his wife at a time when he was pressed by creditors and was on the brink of insolvency. This calls up the question as to the distribution of the balance of the judgment.</p>

That institution held the judgment to secure an indebtedness of the decedent of $3,200, and the further sum of $3,500, being the amount of two notes of Owen Smith to decedent’s order, which the bank had discounted for the decedent. These notes were accommodation notes, but were not known to be such by the bank, at the time they came into its hands. <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>They are still unpaid.

The answer to this seems to be that Owen Smith had no equity in the matter. When he gave his notes to the decedent he held himself out to all the world as absolutely liable for their payment, and, in-point of fact, the bank did not discover the character of the paper until May 6, 1884, after the decedent’s failure. The bank had a perfect right to say to the payee that it was willing to look only to the maker for payment, and this was all that it did when it released the control of the judgment. Owen Smith has not paid the notes and may never be obliged to pay them. Suppose he was subrogated to the bank as plaintiff; he could recover no more than the bank could. But' the bank would be met by an estoppel in the order to use, <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>which, as to the bank, was given for a valid consideration.

    <p class="summary" id="b431-5" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[256,613,1179,979]]]'>It was urged against the bona fieles of the transaction that the agreement with Menns showed that the order to use had been executed in blank; but this was explained by the fact that counsel was in doubt whether it was not preferable to make the transfer to a trustee, and thereupon the blank was left to permit the appointment of a trustee. Besides that, on December 10, 1885, more than a month before the agreement was signed, the receipt for $500 expressly stipulated that the judgment should be marked to the use of Mrs. Menns. It was also urged that the mortgage of the wife was accompanied by the bond of the husband, and was therefore a mere security for his debt. But this objection was put and answered in Brown v. Pendleton, <a href="/pa/60/0419-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="60 Pa. 419" data-case-ids="1014450" data-case-paths="/pa/60/0419-01">60 Pa. 419</a>.

    <p class="summary" id="b432-6" data-blocks='[["BL_432.5",432,[237,708,1185,1026]]]'>The reasons for awarding to the widow no more than the amount actually paid by her for the transfer of the judgment still remain. The decedent had confessed judgment for $6,700 to the bank, and this judgment to the extent of $3,500 was intended to protect the plaintiff from notes of Owen Smith which the defendant had indorsed and the bank had discounted. The bank, by an agreement with the defendant, released him from all liability as indorser upon these notes, and thereby admitted that so much of the judgment was paid. The balance, $3,200, with interest, was all that remained to the bank upon the judgment and was all which it could assign; and the wife of decedent, who stood in the shoes of her assignor, could take no more in the judgment than the assignor possessed. The effect of this release to the husband was to add $3,500 to his estate. Could he make, by paying her the full amount of the judgment, a valid gift of this surplus at a time when he was confessedly insolvent ? It is very hard to see how in principle such a transaction differs from any gift of his property by a failing debtor to his wife. Such a gift has always been regarded as a fraud upon creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b432-7" data-blocks='[["BL_432.6",432,[230,1742,1186,664]],["BL_433.1",433,[211,349,1178,251]]]'>It was found as a fact by the adjudication that the notes in question of Owen Smith were accommodation notes for the ■benefit of the decedent. They were so described by the witnesses. But the evidence given at the rehearing put a different phase upon them. The decedent, it was shown, gave his own notes for a corresponding amount to the claimant for the accommodation of the latter; in other words, the parties exchanged their obligations. Owen Smith, therefore, received full consideration for the notes he gave to the decedent. The notes of the latter were not paid at maturity but they were merged in a judgment which the claimant obtained against the decedent. Hence the notes which the bank holds against Owen Smith are his own debt. The bank could have sued the decedent upon <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>them as indorser, but certainly Owen Smith could not. This the auditing judge thinks disposes of claimant’s demand to be subrogated to the bank upon the judgment for §6,700, or upon the part of it which remains after the payment of the widow’s interest therein as assignee.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b433-5" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[210,608,1179,708]]]'>This conclusion is not affected by the evidence at the rehearing to the effect that the bank through its president promised the claimant that if he would pay the two notes it would repay him their amount when the Menns judgment for §6,700 should be collected, or by the further fact that in pursuance of this agreement the claimant actually paid the bank §2,100 on account of the notes. For the failure of the bank to redeem its promise the claimant has his remedy, but it must be had against the bank, and not this decedent, who was no party to the promise. The claimant has admitted the point by filing his bill in equity against the bank alone, in which he sets forth its sale of the judgment against Menns, and asked for relief, not in the shape of a subrogation, but by the surrender to him of his own notes.</p>

Menns, the younger, that the decedent, before the payment by his wife of §500 on account of the assignment, told her that the judgment was good for §6,700, and would be good as an investment. This witness was the son of Mrs. Menns. His willingness to testify on her behalf was shown by his immediately stating as a fact, what was simply his own inference, that “ therefore she mortgaged her own property to raise the money.” Assuming that the widow was advised to buy the judgment, and that she <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>had no actual knowledge that a part of it was to be released to her husband, and assuming, further, that the fraud of her husband, if there was fraud at all, against his creditors, could not involve her interests unless she was a party thereto: Benson v.

It was urged however, that the bank held the judgment in part as security for two notes made by Owen Smith for the accommodation of John H. Menns, the debtor in said judgment; that it was the duty of Menns to take up these notes; and, hence, that Owen Smith had an equity to be protected by the judgment to the extent that it was given to protect the notes. But it appeared there was an exchange of notes between Smith and Menns. Smith holds Menns’ notes for the same amount; has recovered judgment, and has been awarded a dividend thereon out of this fund. The equities between Smith and Menns are exactly balanced, or to speak more accurately, neither has any equity whatever. Each received a consideration for the notes he issued to the other, to wit, notes for a similar amount. Had each party paid his notes there would have been no difficulty; it is the insolvency of one of the parties to such a transaction that always makes the trouble.
