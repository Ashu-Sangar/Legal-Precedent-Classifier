He asked me upon what grounds did I suppose Dr. Smith had me arrested, and I told him the only thing that I could think of that would leave a ground for this was the fact that the college from which I graduated was in New Jersey at the time I graduated, while it was chartered by the laws of the state of New York. Well, he says, you are not practicing medicine at all, illegally or not, and there is no reason why you should be indicted for practicing medicine illegally, and he says: “I would have him arrested for perjury, and I would have him arrested promptly, and let your answer go out with the charge.”</p>

We consulted about it, and it got along, well, about 9 o’clock, and we went over to Alderman Brownwell’s. I think Alderman Brown-well came to Mr. Derr’s office, I am not certain — I believe I went over to Mr. Brownwell’s office, and signed the information. The information was written out, and we made the information. Mr. Derr wrote it out. I do not know what he wrote; he had a book from which he quoted there, a legal form, and he wrote out what he thought was right; and after the aider-man had taken my affidavit, and made out the warrant, he gave it to me, and he says, “ You had better give that to the constable now.” I think I had however got the constable— no, I believe I went then to find the constable to serve it. The reason why we served it that evening particularly is that we had been told that Dr. Smith was going out of town, and if we did not serve it that evening we would not get a chance to. So we sent up the constable that evening to serve the warrant, and the constable reported that Dr. Smith was out of town, and that he had left word at the house for him to come down and enter bail.</p>

I cannot recollect the date of that, but I presume that that is in evidence, too. After a conference, in which the facts were stated to me —certain facts were stated to me — -I gave the Doctor, as my opinion, as a lawyer, that he would be justified in prosecuting Dr. Smith for perjury, and in doing so promptly; and acting under my advice, he made the information.

I would not undertake to give the entire conversation; and some of the facts I already knew, having been the Doctor’s counsel, and having observed a controversy between him and Dr. Smith, I was already possessed of some of the facts. But in the first place, the Doctor told me his method, gave_ me an idea of his system, of what he was doing at his institution, and he told me, among other things, that he did not administer drugs. After having fully stated to me what he did, I told him it was my opinion that he was not practicing medicine within the intent and meaning of the act of assembly. He also told me he had a diploma from a college the name of which 1 forget. He told me the college had been chartered by the legislature of the state of New York. I think he said by the legislature. It had been chartered in New York, and at the time that he was graduated at that college it was located in the state of New Jersey. Now, upon those facts, I gave it as my opinion first that he was not practicing medicine, or, if what he was doing should be adjudged practicing medicine, that he was not doing so unlawfully.</p>

No, I would not like to say that; indeed, I should not think they were nearly all he stated to me. In addition to that, I might say, that it was manifest to me that what Dr. Smith had sworn to in his information was not true; and the next question I wanted to determine before giving an opinion was as to whether he had knowingly, or at least wantonly, sworn to what appeared to me as not being true. Dr. Smith had known Dr. Walter a <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>good many years and had known his system, known his method, and, therefore, I concluded that Dr. Smith knew that Dr. Walter was not administering drags; and I also understood from Dr. Walter that he was a graduate from the same college when it was still located in New York. Therefore I concluded that Dr. Smith knew that Dr. Walter had a diploma, and knew that in his practice he was not administering drugs. Now the next thing to determine was, as to whether he had any motive, and the newspaper article, which was referred to in our conversation — I do not think we had it there, I remembered having read it — was one of the elements taken into consideration — the newspaper article in which Dr. Smith threatened to do Dr. Walter some injury which was not defined. That furnished as I thought the motive. It was indicative of malice, of a purpose to injure Dr. Walter. The article, I believe, wound up with a quotation from Shakespeare.</p>

This is not only a right of the citizen, but it is a privilege which the law encourages; because it is to the interest of the public that crime should be punished, and the only way in which crime can be punished is that the offender or supposed offender should be apprehended and put upon trial. Therefore, the law is that if one man causes another to be arrested upon a charge of crime, and that crime is not proved, if the justice discharge the defendant, or if the grand jury ignore the bill, or the petit jury acquit the defendant, it does not follow that the man who was thus discharged or acquitted can turn around and recover damages against his prosecutor. Birt where the individual who was discharged or found not guilty can prove that the man who prosecuted him, instead of acting from honest motives, and acting prudently, acted maliciously and without probable cause, the law recognizes that a great wrong has been done to the citizen, and the injured party may punish the man who wronged him by bringing an action of this kind against him and recovering damages.</p>

This contention is well worthy the consideration of the court. But the court view the matter in this light: that what the circumstances were at the time Walter proposed to prosecute Smith we can know, for they have been disclosed in the trial of this case, and they are part of the plaintiff’s case; because a plaintiff bringing an action for malicious prosecution must show that there was want of probable cause and that there was malice. In order to show that there was want of probable cause, he must prove certain facts from which the jury can determine that there was the absence of probable cause. Taking the facts as the plaintiff’s case has disclosed them before us in this trial, and then taking the testimony of Walter, who tells us what he stated to Mr. Derr, and taking the testimony of Mr. Derr, in the opinion of the court, it is the court’s duty to say whether from this evidence it can be found that Walter did not fairly state his case <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>to Mr. Derr, and fully state it.

Therefore I say to you that that contention of plaintiff’s counsel cannot be assented to; and it is the duty of the court to say that if the testimony of the defendant, Walter, and of Mr. Derr is believed — if it is believed that what they testify is true, that is, when they testify as to what Walter told Mr. Derr, and that Mr. Derr advised the prosecution — then the jury could not find for the plaintiff, and a verdict of that kind could not stand, for it would be without evidence to support it; and it is the duty of the court to see that a verdict and a judgment is not made which has no evidence to support it.</p>

Every word of Mr. Derr’s testimony could be absolutely true, and yet the statement made to him by his client might be so incomplete, so lacking in some essential fact, so uncandid, or colored by malice or prejudice, as to be no defence at all. The law was accurately stated by the defendant’s counsel themselves, in their fourth point: “ When.....the prosecutor goes to a lawyer, and states all the facts to him in good faith, and he is advised by the lawyer that he has good grounds in law for making the criminal charge, and following the advice of the lawyer he in good faith commences the criminal prosecution, he is not liable in an action for malicious prosecution.” This point the learned judge properly affirmed, but in his charge he unfortunately omitted to add the necessary qualifications in regard to the client’s statement, upon which the counsel’s advice was founded.</p>
    <p id="b492-8" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[234,1439,1185,400]]]'>The instruction quoted, also gave the jury a false issue. As already shown the entire truthfulness of Mr. Derr’s evidence was not inconsistent with his client’s liability, and as Mr. Derr was probably known to every juror in’ the box, as a prominent member of the bar, whose veracity no one would think of questioning, the direction to decide their verdict on their belief in his truthfulness as a witness, gave the plaintiff no chance at all on the real issue in the case.</p>

This was an encroachment on the province of the jury.</p>

It is not however the advice that rebuts the presumption of malice, but the innocence of the defendant’s conduct, of which his seeking advice is merely evidence. Whether the advice makes out a good defence or not, depends on the good faith with which it is sought and followed. Such good faith is shown by the candor, fullness, and fairness of the client’s statement, upon which the advice was based, and its adequacy in those respects, whenever it is disputed, is for the jury to determine upon all the evidence.</p>

Were it not for this, we might pass over the errors complained of, as mere inadvertent slips of expression, which did no harm, inasmuch as the law was fully and accurately stated, not only in the affirmance of defendant’s fourth point, but in other parts of the charge.</p>
