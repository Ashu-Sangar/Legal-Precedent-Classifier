J. Alexander Simpson, Jr., Esq., was the attorney on the Van Stavoren writ. A sheriff’s sale under this levy was had, and just before the sale took place Mr. Simpson notified all persons present “ that Shupe’s interest in the property now being sold had been assigned before either execution issued, and that no title would pass by the sale.” <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>The sheriff, by direction of Van Stavoren’s attorney, Mr. Simpson, went on with the sale, and the property was bought by Wetherald for $1,850, which was duly paid to the sheriff.

    <p class="summary" id="b561-5" data-blocks='[["BL_561.4",561,[175,764,1182,1027]]]'>Mr. Hanson first reported that the confessed judgment to Van Stavoren was fraudulent and void as against Wetherald, a creditor of Shupe, because it had been confessed with an intent on Shupe’s part to delay and defraud Wetherald, and because it included an alleged indebtedness of $1,566.88 to Shupe’s wife, which had no real existence. Mr. Hanson was therefore of opinion that the judgment was fraudulent and void as a whole. In a supplemental report, however, he explained that his finding had been based on the supposition that in the reference to him it had been agreed that he should pass upon the validity of the Van Stavoren judgment. His attention was subsequently called to the fact that the reference to him was simply to distribute the fund. He therefore reconsidered Ms previous finding, and found that the fund should be paid to the Van Stavoren judgment, inasmuch as that judgment was first in time, and inasmuch, also, as there was no evidence that there was any collusive fraud; and that it was only for such fraud that a prior judgment could be held fraudulent and void as against subsequent judgment creditors. He therefore awarded the fund to the prior judgment.</p>

The said judgment was, as to $1,566.88 thereof, wholly without consideration, and, so far as that portion of the said judgment was concerned, was an attempt by Shupe to make to his wife a voluntary conveyance of his property, with the deliberate intent to defraud Wetherald, and prevent Wetherald from collecting a judgment which had been duly obtained.</p>

Upon the whole case, as presented to me, I should therefore find for the plaintiff, had not the question been already settled adversely to him by the ruling of the former referee.
