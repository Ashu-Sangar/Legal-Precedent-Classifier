    <p class="summary" id="b50-7" data-blocks='[["BL_50.6",50,[235,1181,1191,1231]]]'>Lewis K. Graver, trading as L. K. Graver &amp; Co., brought suit against the township of Plymouth to recover the value of a horse. The plaintiff claims that this horse was killed by reason of the negligence of the township of Plymouth, through its supervisors; that they failed to keep a certain public road in safe condition, and by reason of their negligence this horse got upon the railroad tracks and was killed. The first matter for you to inquire into is, was there any negligence liere on the part of the township in its failure to provide a barrier or protection on the side of this public road ? Negligence is the want of care according to the circumstances. Therefore you will have to take all the circumstances and all the facts into consideration, to determine whether it was negligence on the part of the township when they failed to provide barriers or protection on the side of tins road. It might be, that if there was a wide road here the failure to provide a barrier would not be <em>negligence; </em>and it may be that the road as it was, was not negligently kept. It is entirely for you to say whether a road such as you shall find this to be, after yofi have examined the facts, required a barrier or protection on the side to protect the public in its use. I will leave that to you, whether you shall find that under all the facts and circumstances in this case, a barrier, or some other protection, was necessary to protect the public in the use of this highway.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-4" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[202,370,1183,1326]]]'>
      <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>If yon find there was no negligence on the part of the defendant, that ends the ease, because if you find it was not necessary to have such a harrier there, that is the end of the case. If, however, you find there was negligence in their failure to keep a barrier there, then the next question for you to determine will be, did the plaintiff in any way contribute to the accident? Was he guilty of contributory negligence ? lie would be guilty of contributory negligence if he did anything that he ought not to have done, which helped to bring about the accident. Therefore, again, you will look at all the facts and circumstances in the case to see whether the plaintiff, by his driver or agent, did anything in this case that he ought not to have done, that helped to bring about the accident. Of course it will depend somewhat upon the character of this horse ; the temper, disposition or qualities, that you may find that this horse had. Because if a horse is ungovernable, or is very much afraid of the cars, it would be the duty of his owner, in driving him on a public highway, if he knows of a dangerous place, to avoid that place, or at least to take the best precautions, under the circumstances, to prevent any accident happening to him. Therefore, if you find that this was a horse that was given to fright, that was afraid of the railroad, you will say whether the driver was guilty of any contributory negligence when he failed to make such provision, in passing down that road, so as not to pass that point when the cars were by, if you find he could do so in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-5" data-blocks='[["BL_51.5",51,[205,1714,1182,717]],["BL_52.1",52,[261,368,1183,199]]]'>You will remember the testimony. He says he was up some distance from the point where the accident occurred, and lie knew of the railroad cars being down by Graver’s, and he says that he thought that while they were shifting there lie could pass down before the cars could reach him. And he also says that the horse was not subject to fright from the cars; “ not much,” I believe he says. Mr. Graver says, “ The horse was safe when at an ordinary distance from the train, but when only ten feet from a locomotive it takes a very good horse to stand the puffing and blowing. If this horse had been one hundred and fifty feet away I do not think he would have frightened much.” You will remember that testimony, and also the testimony of the witnesses on the part of the defendant, as to whether the disposition and character of this horse were such as made it <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>necessary for the driver to take any special precautions in passing this place. If he failed to take those precautions, when he had the opportunity to take them, and they were necessary, then he would be guilty of contributory negligence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b52-5" data-blocks='[["BL_52.5",52,[259,575,1186,502]]]'>There is still another question. Even if you should find that the township was guilty of negligence, and that the driver was not guilty of contributory negligence, before the plaintiff can recover, you must find that the failure to provide this barrier was the cause of the killing of the horse. You must find that that was the proximate cause which brought about the killing of this horse. If you find that it was not the want of a barrier, that a barrier itself would not have prevented the accident, but that there was some other fact coming in which brought about this accident, then the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>

The sixth section of the act of 1836 provides, that the public roads shall be effectually opened and constantly kept in repair, and at all seasons shall be kept clear of all impediments to easy and convenient passing and traveling, at the expense of the township, as the law shall direct. For any wilful or wanton failure to discharge these duties, the supervisors are personally liable, and the township is responsible in damages to those who suffer injury from their neglect: Dean v.

It may be said, generally, that they are bound for reasonable and ordinary care, according to the circumstances. Where no danger may be anticipated, or the peril is but slight, a less degree of vigilance will suffice, than where the danger is manifest: Turnpike Co. v.

But, granting that there was no physical obstruction or defect in the road, was there any other impediment to easy and convenient travel upon it ? It is said that the passage over it with horses and wagons was not safe; that it was located along and immediately adjacent to the track of the railroad, and that the effect of the passage of locomotives and cars on the railroad, at high rates of speed, in such near proximity to the road, was to frighten horses, in many cases to make them unmanageable, and that, in the absence of barriers erected for the protection of the public, the place was so dangerous that travelers were exposed to the utmost peril. It is argued that as there was a fence along the road, on the farther side from the railroad, and none between the road and the railroad, a horse, in attempting to escape from the object of its fright, w^as liable to turn on to the railroad, and that, anticipating the results likely to ensue, it was the duty’ of the supervisors to erect suitable barriers between the road and the railroad at this point.</p>

Holyoke, <a href="/mass/112/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="112 Mass. 362" data-case-ids="2111226" data-case-paths="/mass/112/0362-01">112 Mass. 362</a>. The question is, whether or not the dangerous place is in such close proximity to the highway, as traveled and used, as to render the use of the highway unsafe. The decision of such a question is most appropriately made by submission of it to the practical judgment and experience of a jury upon a consideration of all the proofs respecting it. This rule as applied to bridges is illustrated in the case of Newlin Tp. v. Davis, <a href="/pa/77/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="77 Pa. 317" data-case-ids="436322" data-case-paths="/pa/77/0317-01">77 Pa. 317</a>. In that case, the negligence alleged Avas the failure of the road supervisors to provide barriers or side rails to a bridge across the Brandywine. The bridge formed part of the public road; there Avere no side rails ; and the evidence showed that whilst the horse Avas being driven across the bridge, he frightened at a piece of plank nailed OArer a hole in the floor, commenced backing and, before he could be prevented, backed OArer the bridge into the creek, and the horse, harness and carriage Avere injured. The question of negli<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>gence was submitted to the jury, under instructions that it was the duty of tlie township to keep the bridge as safe, considering all the circumstances, as it was reasonably practicable to make it, and that it was for them to decide, whether the bridge was defective or not, in not having been provided with railings : the jury found for the plaintiff, and compensated him for the injury.</p>

At the right side of the road coming down the grade was a steep declivity, unguarded by barriers. Arriving at a point near the foot of the hill, the horse suddenly took fright at a steam thresher standing at the roadside, and sprang to the right, partly over the declivity ; becoming altogether unmanageable, he made a second plunge, and went over the precipice, upturning the wagon, and injuring the persons therein. The opinion of the court in that case was delivered by our brother Gbeien, who said: “ The immediately producing cause of the accident, in the present case,- was the unguarded condition of the roadside at the place where the accident occurred. If that unguarded condition of the roadside was an act.of negligence on the part of the defendant, it follows that the defendant, is responsible. Whether it -was negligence to maintain the road, at the place in question, without some kind of protection, was a question of pure fact, which it was the province of the jury alone to determine,” eto.</p>

The action was brought against the city for negligence in not sufficiently guarding one of the roads in the public park, by reason of which, the plaintiff’s horse, being frightened at a passing railroad train, fell into the Schuylkill and was drowned. The road was wide and level and contained no obstruction; the stream was on one side and a high bank of rocks on the other; the only defect alleged was that there was no guard erected between the road and the river. The court below submitted the question of negligence to the jury who found for the plaintiff, but, upon a point reserved, judgment was afterwards entered for tlie defendant, non obstante veredicto. Tlie learned judge below was of opinion that the fright and breaking away <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>of the horse was the immediate cause of the disaster, but this court took a different view of the case, and held that the negligence of the city in not providing a barrier, as found by the jury, was the proximate cause. “ If the road is so dangerous,” said Mr. Justice Gokdon, in the opinion, “ by reason of its <em>proximity to </em>a precipice, or any other cause, that common prudence requires extra precaution in order to insure the safety of the traveling public, why shall not the authorities be bound to such precaution ? ”</p>
    <p id="b60-4" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[262,837,1187,408]]]'>When the alleged impediment is a dangerous place outside the highway limits, the questions for the jury are, first, whether it is in such close proximity to the road as to render the highway unsafe for travel, and if so, second, whether the road supervisors have done what was reasonable and practicable, to guard against the danger. The place of danger, if not in the road, must be contiguous to it, or in such proximity as that the danger is practically the same as if it were contiguous.</p>

There is no such provision in the law; but it certainly is the law, and it has always been so understood, that whenever a public road is from any cause rendered so unsafe as to put the traveler in peril of his life, it is the duty of the supervisors to do what is practicable and reasonable, under all the circumstances, to render it safe; and the facts, in each case, should be submitted to the judgment and experience of the jury. It matters not, we think, whether the danger arises from an imperfection in the road itself, or from an excavation in it outside the traveled route, or from the existence of a declivity or stream of water at the roadside, or from a railroad upon which locomotives and trains of cars are accustomed to pass, if there is a concurrence of circumstances which ■ render <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>the road a place of peril and danger to the traveler, the township is held to do whatever is reasonable and practicable to avert the danger which threatens.</p>

The jury, upon a consideration of the whole ease, has found that the supervisors did not exercise that care and diligence which they should have exercised under the circumstances, and the question, as we have said, was for the jury. If the absence of barriers was a defect in the road, that defect was the proximate cause of the injury. “ Negligence may be tlie proximate cause of an injury, of which it is not the sole or immediate canse. If the defendant’s negligence concurred with some other event, other than the plaintiff’s fault, to produce the plaintiff's injury, so that it clearly appears that but for such negligence the injury would not have happened, and both circumstances are closely connected with the injury, in the order of events, the defendant is responsible, even though his negligent act was not the nearest cause in the order of time: Shear. &amp; Redf. on Negligence, 10.
