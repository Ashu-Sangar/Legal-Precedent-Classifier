    <p class="summary" id="b552-11" data-blocks='[["BL_552.10",552,[250,1493,1194,923]]]'>The act of 29th March, 1832, § 49, P. L. 206, with reference to the ascertainment of liens affecting the shares of parties in partition, so far as it provides for the appointment of an auditor, appears to. be permissive only, and not mandatory. It is, at least, intended for the protection of lien creditors and of the executor, administrator, or trustee, making the sale, whose duty it is, under the act of 17th April, 1863, P. L. 341, to “file an account of such trusteeship,” and, impliedly, to see that the money is properly distributed: Lucas’s App., <a href="/pa/53/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="53 Pa. 404" data-case-ids="1004718" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0404-01">53 Pa. 404</a>; Reed v.

The accountant does not complain of the action of the auditing judge in making distribution without the intervention of an auditor, and it appears from the searches that there were no liens except such as, at the request of the creditor, have been duly passed upon: Quilibet potest renunciare juri pro se introducto. Very clearly, objection cannot be made by any of the heirs, since it is to their advantage that the distribution should be made promptly and without expense.</p>

      <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>Nor is there more merit in the objection to the distribution by the auditing judge of so much of the fund as had been paid into court. Granted that the constitutional provision, giving rise to the court as now constituted and requiring accounts to be audited by the judge, unless all the parties request a reference, does not in terms apply where the fund with which the trustee making the -sale would otherwise be 1 chargeable, has been paid into court in accordance with the provisions of the act of 27th March, 1865, P. L. 45; there is nothing in the letter, and still less in the spirit of the constitution or of any act of assembly, which forbids the distribution without the appointment of an auditor. The act just referred to provides that in proceedings in partition in the Orphans’ Court, “ the moneys arising from such sales shall be paid into court and distributed according to law;” but a later act, 28th April, 1868, P. L. 105, provides that so much of the act approved 27th March, 1865, “as requires the money arising from such sales to be paid into court, be and the same is hereby modified, so that the court may, in its discretion, require such payment or make such order as may be just in the premises.” Under the act of 19th May, 1874, § 3, P. L. 206, either of the judges may hold the court, and, of course, make any order permitted by the acts of assembly. Where, as in the present case, all questions affecting the disposition of the entire fund have been determined in the settlement of an account embracing part of it, the Orphans’ Court would have small claim to bo considered a court of equity if, with the balance not only in its grasp but under its exclusive control, it should refuse to finish the distribution, until, after protracted delay and the depletion of the fund, the questions already passed upon had come before it a second time on exceptions to the report of an auditor. Even in the days of Lord Coke it was said to be “ an excellent and profitable law, concurring with the wisdom and judgment of ancient and latter times,” which disallows “ curious and nice exceptions tending to the overthrow or delay of justice : apices juris non sunt jura.” The modern authorities speak with still more emphasis: Hutchison v. Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=82%20Pa.%20483" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="82 Pa. 483">82 Pa. 483</a>; Allen v.

It is our duty to prevent self-sacrifice in such a ease, especially where it involves the destruction of other parties asking protection.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b554-5" data-blocks='[["BL_554.4",554,[268,563,1187,1075]]]'>Whether, after compelling their co-tenants to resort to ejectment, the exceptants can now assert that their previous holding was not adverse; and whether, assuming it to have been adverse, they are for that reason, as they certainly would have been had the holding been tortious: Foster v. Weaver, <a href="/pa/118/0042-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="118 Pa. 42" data-case-ids="556775" data-case-paths="/pa/118/0042-01">118 Pa. 42</a>, precluded from asking reimbursement for taxes and other expenses paid by them for the preservation of the property subsequently declared to be a tenancy in common, are questions which do not necessarily arise at this time. Since the moneys so paid were not to prevent sales under liens, the payments never became a charge on the property; and, even had there been liens originally, they would have ceased by reason of not having been duly revived before the sale in partition. As an unsecured debt, it is barred by the statute of limitations, except as to the comparatively small part accruing within six years. Moreover, the debt is not one running with the land; it is personal, purely, and demandable, if at all, against those who were co-owners when the payments were made, some of whom had parted with their ownership before the sale which gave rise to the fund. The vendees, of course, cannot be made responsible, nor can their shares be diminished by such a claim.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="ATs" data-blocks='[["BL_554.5",554,[269,1647,1184,555]]]'>There is a still further difficulty. The amount alleged to be due the exceptants for payments so made, still assuming their right to assert that they paid it as co-tenants, can only be ascertained as the result of an account debiting them with whatever they may have received from the common property, and such account is not within the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court. The authority to distribute a fund in partition is altogether statutory, and the principle under which a court of general equity powers, when once possessed of a cause, will make an end of all controversy, cannot apply: Ake’s App., <a href="/pa/74/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="74 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="1034748" data-case-paths="/pa/74/0116-01">74 Pa. 116</a> ; Landis’ Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phila.%20217" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Phila. 217">2 Phila. 217</a>.</p>

The sale which he succeeded in effecting was a most advantageous one, and this, <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>it would seem, was largely the result of his personal efforts. It is true the money, except to the extent of the sums paid to the auctioneer, was paid, in accordance with the act of 1865, into court, and the element of responsibility, usually compensated by an allowance of two and a half per cent, was therefore wanting; but such payment does not lesson the value of the services actually rendered, nor make it improper, in estimating this, to consider the amount realized, though not for the purpose of allowing a commission: Twaddell’s App., <a href="/citations/?q=81%2A%20Pa.%20221" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="81* Pa. 221">81* Pa. 221</a>.

He therefore cannot be likened to an ordinary trustee or executor, but rather to an auditor or master, whoso compensation should be fixed, not by way of a commission upon a fund with which he has had nothing to do, but measured by his services, and a fee awarded him compensatory for the services performed: Montgomery’s App., <a href="/pa/86/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="86 Pa. 230" data-case-ids="1056604" data-case-paths="/pa/86/0230-01">86 Pa. 230</a>.</p>

But conceding that the exceptants had a claim against their co-tenants for the payments made in their relief, where is their lien? What right have they to repayment from the moneys of Elkins and Widener, who purchased half the land in 1867, and to whom half the fund is awarded ? These vendees cannot, of course, be made responsible, nor can their shares be diminished by such a claim: Huston v. Springer, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%2097" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="2 R. 97">2 R. 97</a>. Moreover, equity does not favor stale claims. But one payment, that of 1883, was made within six years before the audit, when the claim was first advanced. The others are all barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

It is conceded on all hands that the services were efficient and valuable. If the trustee had been required to furnish security, the ordinary allowance would have been at least twice as much, and thus the expenses of sale would have boon increased. The fact that the parties interested in the fund to the extent of two thirds are not dissatisfied with the allowance, is strongly persuasive of its reasonableness.</p>

Ordinarily <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>the only claims that, of right, can be made upon a fund raised by the sale of land, under proceedings in partition, are the expenses, including costs, and liens on the land at the time it is sold. The latter by reason of the conversion of the land into money retain their grasp on the fund, and must, of course, be paid out of it. The former are charges on the fund in the nature of a lien for cost of producing it, and are always deducted before distribution. But claims for contribution, such as were presented in this case, if allowable at all, must rest on an equitable basis.</p>

For many years they were in exclusive possession and enjoyment of the land, all the while ignoring the title of their co-owners and excluding them from any participation in its management or control. During that time, they paid in their own right and for their own benefit, as they supposed, the. sums of money for which they now claim contribution from the appellees, who represent two thirds of the fund realized from the sale in partition. It also appears that the owners of an undivided moiety of the land, in May, 1887, sold their interest to Messrs. Elkins and Widener. They, as vendees of that interest, now rightly claim one half the net proceeds sale, less costs. Upon what principle, legal or equitable, can they be called upon to contribute to claims, none of which were liens on the land when they purchased, and of which it does not even appear that they had any notice ?</p>
