Clair, and that of this property about two acres were taken by the railroad company and about one acre was left; therefore it is for you to determine under the evidence in the case what was the value of the two acres taken; also, what damage was done, if any, to the acre that was left.] 8 That depends entirely upon the evidence in the case. It will not do for a jury to put a fanciful estimate on the property. They must be guided by the evidence in the case, and the weight of the evidence. In determining what the weight of the evidence is, you take into consideration not only the number of witnesses testifying upon one side or the other, but you must also take the character, the knowledge, the experience of the witnesses. In every man naturally there is some difference as to the weight of his testimony, depending very much upon his knowledge of the facts in the case, the experience he may have had, his age, and his opportunities for observation. All these are matters to be taken into consideration by the jury in determining the weight of the testimony. The jury is to determine what was the value of this land at the time it was taken by this railroad company, which was in July, 1885. What were these two acres worth at that time or what injury was done by the railroad?.....</p>

The opinions of these witnesses vary from, I think about $2,500 as the lowest estimate that is put upon the property by any one of the witnesses, as to the value of these three acres of land, up to about $12,000, as I understand the testimony of Joseph Picton, who swears that the property was worth from $3,000 to $4,000 an acre, three acres making $12,000. It b the duty of the jury to examine this evidence, estimate its <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>weight, and from all the evidence in the case, from the weight and character of the evidence, endeavor to come to a fair estimate of the value of this property, also to estimate the amount of depreciation or injury done to the property that was not taken.</p>

For instance, you have three acres of land. If it were out in the country and had no other value except as farm land, the natural value you would put upon it then, would be that of farm land. If it were so situated that it could he turned into town lots, then the natural estimate of damages would be its capability of being made into town lots; or, if it were eligible for manufacturing purposes, then its value for a place of business of that character. Of course, property in a town or on the outskirts of a town, as a general rule, would be estimated at a higher rate than if it were to be estimated merely as farm land, and the jury must determine, from the evidence in the case, what that value is. [If you find under the evidence in the case, that this property was adapted, for instance, for town lots, then ordinarily it would have a higher range of value than if it were simply used for agricultural purposes. You have heard quite a considerable amount of testimony with regard to the value of lots, how many lots it would make if it were cut up, how it could be divided and what the value of those lots would be. It would scarcely be a fair estimate of the value of the property to take this property and divide it all up into town lots, and say that each town lot is worth so much money, and that therefore, the whole property is worth that amount of money; because that presupposes that the moment that that property is cut into town lots, it could all be sold off at that figure. That is a question for you whether that would be the case, particularly with a piece of ground on the outskirts of a town, where perhaps the evidence would not show that the tide of improvement was going. It is a question of fact for a jury. For instance, if a piece of ground of three acres were to be cut up into town lots, 1 do not know how many town lots it might be cut into, whether 50 or 100, the question would bo how many a party would be likely to sell in one year, how long he would have to wait in order to <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>sell the balance, and the amount of taxes he would have to pay whilst he was holding the other town lots. Therefore, I say the estimate of the value of property based upon its value as town lots, would be ordinarily not reliable unless you also take into consideration, in estimating the value, that those town lots might remain on hand for many years without being sold. It is a question of fact for you to determine. Whilst its eligibility or capability of being made into town lots is something for you to take into consideration, in determining its value, yet it would not be a reliable estimate of its value for you to take the value of each town lot, if it were cut up into town lots, and fix that as the value, unless the evidence in the case showed that the moment it was cut up into town lots it could all be sold at once.] 5</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b472-5" data-blocks='[["BL_472.4",472,[253,1081,1189,1014]]]'>The same remark might apply with regard to the capability or eligibility of this property for manufacturing purposes. It never had been used for manufacturing purposes. It was a meadow, most of it, a portion of it situated on the slope of a hill, and the other portion on a level, somewhat swampy down near the railroad, according’ to the testimony in the case. Take the testimony as to the value of the property, and perhaps the most of the testimony of the witnesses upon this subject bears, in the first place, upon the value as a whole. We have not much evidence here as to the value distinctly of the property simply that was taken by the railroad company. The great bulk of the testimony is as to the value of the three acres as a whole, and also as to the value of that portion which was left. Therefore, I presume, under the testimony in this case, it would probably be the simpler and easier method for you, in the first place to determine the value of this property as a whole three acres, and then to determine what is the value of the property that still remains, that was not taken, deducting one from the other to ascertain the amount that the plaintiff would be entitled to with interest.</p>

The lot of land over which the line of the road belonging to the plaintiff in error had been laid, belonged prior to 1882 to James Cleary. He died in that year, and his title descended to his heirs-at-law of whom M. J. Cleary is one, and letters of admin<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>istration upon his estate were regularly issued to M. J. Cleary. A judgment had been recovered against James Cleary in his lifetime by A. E. Beck in the Common Pleas of Schuylkill county. After the death of James Cleary it was regularly revived against the administrator, and on the 11th of July, 1885, the lot in controversy was brought to sale by the sheriff, and sold to M. J. Cleary. On the 81st of July, 1885, the railroad company entered and located their line of railroad. This proceeding for the assessment of damages was begun by M. J. Cleary in May, 1887. The acknowledgment and delivery of the sheriff’s deed did not take place until April, 1888. It is well settled however that a purchaser at sheriff’s sale acquires an inchoate title in the land purchased by virtue of his bid, and its acceptance by the sheriff. The subsequent acknowledgment and delivery of the deed provides the purchaser with the evidence of his title which relates to, and takes effect as of the date of the sale recited in it. The title of M. J. Cleary to this land vested at the time of his purchase from the sheriff on the lltli of July, 1885, notwithstanding the fact that he was not provided with the legal evidence of his title until 1888. As his purchase was prior to the entry by the railroad company, this proceeding to assess damages against the company was properly begun in his name. After the damages have been fixed, and the money paid into court, it may be the question of the character of the plaintiff’s holding will be raised, and the court called upon to decide whether he holds the title as owner, or as trustee for the heirs-at-law of James Cleary, but that question is unimportant now. The title being in him, the damages are properly assessed at his instance. The first, second and third assignments of error are therefore dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b475-5" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[198,1930,1182,508]],["BL_476.1",476,[240,374,1188,1080]]]'>The fourth and fifth assignments raise a more serious question. The true measure of the damages sustained by any given lot of land is found in the difference between its selling value before and after the entry complained of: Read. etc. R. Co. v. Balthasar, <a href="/citations/?q=119%20Pa.%20483" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="119 Pa. 483">119 Pa. 483</a>. It is proper to consider for what purpose it may be used to advantage, in order to determine for what price it will sell. It may be salable as a site for the erection of a hotel, a factory, a dwelling, or a wharf, but it is not proper to lay before the jury proof of what the hotel or other structure would cost, together with proof of the value of the lot with <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>such structure upon it, and treat the difference between these sums as the value of the lot. Such a method would be speculative and fanciful. Equally improper is evidence showing how many building lots the tract under consideration could.be divided into, and what such lots would be worth separately. It is proper to inquire what the tract is worth, having in view the purposes for which it is best adapted, but it is the tract, and not the lots into which it might be divided, that is to be valued. The learned judge intended to guard this point in his charge to the jury, yet he seems to have left a question to the jury with which they had nothing to do. He said: “It would scarcely be a fair estimate of the value of the property to take this property and divide it all up into town lots and say that each town lot is worth so much money and that therefore the whole property is worth that amount of money; because that presupposes that the moment that property is cut into town lots it could all be sold off at that figure. That is a question for you whether that would be the case, particularly with a piece of ground on the outskirts of a town where perhaps the evidence would not show that the tide of improvement was going. It is a question of fact for the jury.”</p>
    <p id="b476-4" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[236,1460,1188,973]]]'>We do not agree with the learned judge that there was any such question for the jury in tliis case. The jury are to value the tract of land, and that only. They are not to determine how it could best be divided into building lots, nor conjecture how fast they could be sold, nor at what price per lot. A speculator or investor in deciding what price he could afford to pay, would consider the chances and probabilities of the situation as then actually existing. A jury should do the same thing. They are not to inquire what a speculator might be able to realize out of a re-sale in the future, but what a present purchaser would be willing to pay for it in the condition it is now in. This is a rule that is well settled and the court should have drawn the attention of the jury to it so as to have left no room for uncertainty on their part. They should have been told that they had nothing to do with the subdivision of this tract, the price of the lots or the probability of their sale; but that they were to ascertain the fair selling value of the land before and after the entry by the railroad company, in order to determine the actual damage done to its owner.</p>

      <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>The court was also in error in admitting the evidence offered to show why James Cleary had declined to sell or lease the land or the fact that he had done so. James Cleary might have had a reluctance to part with it for many reasons; he might have had a wise, or an unwise, confidence in its value as an investment, or a desire to see it occupied for some particular purpose, but his views upon this subject were not relevant to the inquiry before the jury. The questions before them were first, what was this land worth before it was touched by the railroad? Next, what was it worth as affected by the location of the road? When these questions were settled the damages were ascertained.</p>
