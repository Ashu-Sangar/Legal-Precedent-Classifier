As to the signature under the words, “ credit the drawer.” This phrase, “ credit the drawer,” has a well known commercial meaning. It is an order used on accommodation notes, by the indorser to a subsequent holder, to pay the proceeds of the note to the drawer: Steckel v. Steckel, <a href="/pa/28/0233-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="28 Pa. 233" data-case-ids="981570" data-case-paths="/pa/28/0233-01">28 Pa. 233</a>; Runyan v.

Looking at the face of the note in suit and its indorsements, it is to be inferred that the note was intended to be prepared in such form that Temple would be the last indorser. It is only on this theory that the proceeds of the note could go to his credit in the bank where discounted. Being last indorser, there could be no liability from him to the payee.</p>

Schmeck, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20451" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="28 Pa. 451">28 Pa. 451</a>.</p>
    <p id="b663-8" data-blocks='[["BL_663.7",663,[193,1706,1184,614]]]'>2. But our case rests upon the fact that the note in question shows by a note or memorandum in writing, more than an irregular indorsement. It shows that the object of the irregular indorsement was to give to the maker of the note credit with the payee; this being by the signature of Bennett Temple on the face of the note, under the words, “credit the drawer.” In other words, this case belongs to the first proposition set forth in Barto v. Schmeck, <a href="/citations/?q=28%20Pa.%20451" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="28 Pa. 451">28 Pa. 451</a>, to wit: “That where a third party indorses a negotiable note before the payee has negotiated it, he is liable to the payee if it can be proved that the object of the indorsement was to give to the maker credit with the payee.”</p>

The words, “ credit the drawer,” waive all irregularity: the irregularity of the note being in the hands and negotiated by the maker, and the irregularity of the indorsement. It says to the holders of the note, credit the drawer and I will be responsible. This agreement of waiver of irregularity is addressed to the holders, the plaintiffs; otherwise it is senseless.

The defence is that while Temple might be liable to an indorsee, he is not liable to the payees who are of necessity the first indorsers. The jury before whom the case was tried returned a special verdict, covering the important questions of fact, as follows: 1. That the administrators were made payees for the use of the present plaintiffs, the parties in interest. 2. That Temple wrote his name under the words “ credit the drawer,” and on the back of the note, before it was signed by the maker or the blanks filled up. 3. That the blanks were filled, the note signed, and the indorsement <a id="p641" href="#p641" data-label="641" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*641</a>made by the administrators after the indorsement by Temple. 4. That the plaintiffs have exhausted their legal remedies against Mancill &amp; Son, the makers. The court below entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b665-5" data-blocks='[["BL_665.4",665,[188,553,1182,1601]]]'>To sustain this judgment the liability of the defendant must rest either upon his indorsement, or upon his direction to “ credit the drawer.” His indorsement is of that sort described in our cases as an “ anomalous ” one. Though not the payee, his indorsement as to its order or place on the back of the note is first, that of the payees being under his. Before the passage of the statute of frauds in 1855, such an indorser was held liable to the payee as a guarantor, if such was the understanding when the indorsement was made, and the payee might write a contract of guaranty above the name of such indorser, and sue upon it: Leech v. Hill, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20W.%20448" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="4 W. 448">4 W. 448</a> ; Taylor v. McCune, <a href="/pa/11/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="11 Pa. 460" data-case-ids="404633" data-case-paths="/pa/11/0460-01">11 Pa. 460</a>. Since 1855 these cases have been necessarily departed from so far as to require a memorandum in writing “ signed by the party to be charged therewith,” as the evidence of any contract of guaranty. The indorsement which imports only the commercial contract into which every indorser enters, is not such a memorandum: Jack v. Morrison, <a href="/pa/48/0113-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="48 Pa. 113" data-case-ids="422216" data-case-paths="/pa/48/0113-01">48 Pa. 113</a>; Schafer v. The Bank, <a href="/pa/59/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="59 Pa. 144" data-case-ids="426972" data-case-paths="/pa/59/0144-01">59 Pa. 144</a>; Murray v.

The result of these cases has been to fix the position and legal liability of such an indorser as that of a second indorser. He is not liable to the payee, but, if compelled by a later holder to pay, he has a right to proceed against the payee for reimbursement: Slack v. Kirk, <a href="/pa/67/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="67 Pa. 380" data-case-ids="1022497" data-case-paths="/pa/67/0380-01">67 Pa. 380</a>; Eilbert v.

Patterson, <a href="/pa/84/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="84 Pa. 274" data-case-ids="1053528" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0274-01">84 Pa. 274</a>. Such an indorser may still be converted into a guarantor by an agreement in writing signed by him, but in the absence of the writing his liability is fixed by the law merchant: Eilbert v. Finkbeiner, <a href="/pa/68/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="68 Pa. 243" data-case-ids="1024559" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0243-01">supra.</a> It is clear, therefore, that the payees cannot recover against Bennett Temple as a guarantor, because of the statute of frauds; nor as an indorser, because they are prior parties to the note and liable to him.</p>

The Bank.” He then proceeds to expand these <a id="p642" href="#p642" data-label="642" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*642</a>words into the following: “ A. Mancill &amp; Son have this day made their promissory note for $1,000, which I have indorsed for their accommodation. The person to whom said note may be given for value is hereby authorized to give credit to said A. Mancill &amp; Son.” Now, unless this is the commercial meaning of the words “ credit the drawer,” the statute of frauds is as clearly violated as it would be by engrafting such a guaranty upon a mere indorsement. What therefore do the words mean ?</p>
    <p id="A0x" data-blocks='[["BL_666.4",666,[264,757,1188,1126]]]'>The legal relation of the parties to a bill or note to each other, is presumed to be that indicated by the order in which their names stand upon it. The maker is liable to the payee, the payee to his indorsee, and so on down the line of indorsements. The last indorsee is presumed to be the holder and owner of the note, and entitled to its proceeds. The note in question was made, by Mancill &amp; Son to the administrators of William Baker. They indorsed it. The indorsement of Temple being in law that of second indorser, he would appear to be entitled, as against the prior parties, to the proceeds of the note. The office of the memorandum we are considering, is to advise the bank or other party to whom it may be offered, that, contrary to the prima facies of the note, he is not the owner; that his indorsement is for the accommodation of the prior parties, and that as between him and them the drawer is entitled to have the proceeds of the note delivered to him, or passed to his credit. It is not a declaration that the maker is worthy of credit, nor a request that credit be given him upon the responsibility of the person signing the memorandum, but a statement that such person is not the owner in fact, though such in appearance, of the note to which the memorandum is attached, and disclaims any .interest in its proceeds.</p>

It was also wrong to say tliat “'the jury could look at the note, the indorsement, the words ‘ credit the drawer,’ and all the parol' testimony, and say whether the contract was original or collateral.” Since the statute of frauds, in 1855, parol testimony is not admissible to show a contract for the payment of the debt of another if over twenty dollars in amount, and the jury had no right to consider the parol testimony on that subject. <a id="p643" href="#p643" data-label="643" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*643</a>The indorsement was entitled only to the force which the general commercial law gives it; and the direction to credit the drawer was without significaney on the question of Temple’s liability as an indorser. It neither increased nor diminished his liability in any particular.</p>
    <p id="b667-5" data-blocks='[["BL_667.4",667,[189,629,1179,822]]]'>It has been urged that Roth v.

In that case Kline, the irregular indorser, was held liable, not upon his indorsement, or upon the words “ credit the drawer,” but upon a distinct and independent agreement to pay the note, founded on a sufficient consideration. In the opinion of this court, delivered by our brother Steerett, this appears very clearly. He says, on page 219: “ In view of the explicit instructions thus given, the jury must have found that the plaintiff in error, in consideration of obtaining the confession of judgment, promised absolutely and unconditionally to pay the balance due on the note, and that the judgment for $5,000 was given by Kline on the faith of that promise.” Such a promise furnished a distinct basis for liability to the payee, on which alone the recovery against Roth rested.</p>
