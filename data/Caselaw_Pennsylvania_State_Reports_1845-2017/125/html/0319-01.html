The prosecutor was sentenced, committed to the county jail for thirty days, and 'discharged according to law, without paying the 'costs'.

L. 683, in force in Bradford county, provides that the jury shall have the same control and jurisdiction over the payment of costs as in the Court of Quarter Sessions, “ Provided, That the county shall in no case be liable for either the prosecutor’s or the defendant’s bill of <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>costs.” That the county would be liable in case of conviction is shown by the case of Codding v.

It is conceded that the verdict and sentence in this case, if in the Quarter Sessions, would not make the county liable, as the law stood in 1861; but the act of May 19,1887, provides “ that the costs of prosecution accruing in every case of misdemeanor in any of the Courts of Quarter Sessions of the peace of this commonwealth shall, on the termination of the prosecution by the bill of indictment being ignored by the grand jury, or by a verdict of the traverse jury and sentence of the court thereon, be immediately chargeable to and paid by the proper county.” This extends the liability of the county. The verdict of the traverse jury, acquitting the defendant and imposing costs on the prosecutor now makes the county liable. That, act of 1861 making the control of costs the same in the justice’s court as in the Quarter Sessions makes the power of the jury in that court the standard by which the power of the other is to be measured, and when the one is changed or extended the other is changed and extended with it.</p>

But the sentence imposed by the justice in this case was not upon a conviction of the defendant in either form. The construction given to §§ 2 and 7 of the act, in Codding v. Bradford Co., <a href="/pa/116/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="116 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="554390" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0047-01">116 Pa. 47</a>, as well as the sections themselves, is foreign to this case.</p>

The act of May 19,1887, P. L. 138, does not affect or control in the slightest degree the “ jurisdiction or control ” of petit juries over the payment of costs under the act of 1860. To recover costs accrued in a criminal proceeding, from the county, a statute creating the liability must be shown: Crawford Co. v. Barr, <a href="/citations/?q=92%20Pa.%20363" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="92 Pa. 363">92 Pa. 363</a>.</p>

It was evidently the intention of the legislature in providing the special jurisdiction given in the act of 1861, and its supplements, to make it in all respects, save the expressed exceptions as to bills of costs and confinement in the penitentiary, “to have the same force and effect of a sentence pronounced by the Court of Quarter Sessions in like cases,” and that, in cases of acquittal as well as of conviction. The act of 1861 and 1887, being both remedial, are to be construed liberally : Lamoreux v. Luzerne Co., <a href="/pa/116/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="116 Pa. 195" data-case-ids="554360" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0195-01">116 Pa. 195</a>.</p>
    <p id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.6",346,[255,1524,1189,656]]]'>2. The liability of the county, in any particular ease tried under the act of 1861, is to.be determined by the standard of liability in the Court of Quarter Sessions, whether under the act of 1860, or 1887. It is the case of a special statute which can have no living force, no substantial vitality, except as a part of the general act of 1860 regulating costs and criminal procedure. The act of 1860 was modified by the act of 1887, <em>so </em>that the liability of the county for costs in misdemeanors, in the Court of Quarter Sessions, was increased to cover all cases, whatever the verdict of the jury said as to costs.

In the opinion it is said: “ It is conceded that the verdict and sentence in this case if in the <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>Quarter Sessions would not make the county liable as the law stood in 1861.” This is undoubtedly correct, for the simple reason that neither the act of 1861 nor any other law, prior to the act of 1887, imposed liability upon the county upon the particular conditions mentioned in the latter act. The act of May 19, 1887, P. L. 138, provides, “that the costs of prosecution accruing in every case of misdemeanor in any of the Courts of Quarter Sessions of the peace of this commonwealth, shall on the termination of the prosecution by the bill of indictment being ignored by the grand jury, or by a verdict of the traverse jury and sentence of the court thereon, be immediately chargeable to and paid by the proper county.” The conditions of liability on the part of the county as established by this act are, that the case shall be a misdemeanor in a Court of Quarter Sessions, that the prosecution shall have terminated by the bill of indictment being ignored by the grand jury, or that it shall have been terminated by the verdict of the traverse jury and sentence of the court thereon. None of these conditions either did or could-subsist in the present case. It was not a case in any court of Quarter Sessions, there was no bill of indictment by a grand jury, and the prosecution was not terminated either by an ignoramus, or by the verdict of a traverse jury and sentence of the Court of Quarter Sessions. The case was a proceeding before a justice of tbe peace, under a local law applicable to particular counties only, whose proceedings, it is true, are to have the same force and effect as in the trial of similar offences in the Court of Quarter Sessions, and with the same power in the jury to impose costs as is conferred upon juries in the Court of Quarter Sessions, but it is a special and limited jurisdiction still. The jury did not see ñt to impose any of the costs upon the county, and this would have relieved the county from any liability even in the Quarter Sessions until the passage of the act of 1887. But that act did not embrace cases arising before justices under the special and limited jurisdiction conferred upon them. It -was limited by its express terms to cases pending in the Courts of Quarter Sessions, and we cannot extend it beyond its plain words without invading the province of the legislature. The case of Codding v. Bradford County, <a href="/pa/116/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="116 Pa. 47" data-case-ids="554390" data-case-paths="/pa/116/0047-01">116 Pa. 47</a>, has no application. It involved the construction of certain sections of the act of <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>1861, establishing the special jurisdiction o£ the justices, but had no relation to the act of 1887, nor to any question such as we are now considering.</p>
