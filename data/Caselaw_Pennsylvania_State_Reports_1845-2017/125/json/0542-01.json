The only fund that came into the guardian\u2019s hands and as to which he is in default, was from the sale of his ward\u2019s real estate, made under an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court. When that order of sale was made the guardian gave a special bond, with another person as surety, conditioned for faithful application of the proceeds sale. The defendant was asked to become surety on that bond, but he refused to do so. This suit was manifestly brought on the wrong bond.\nJudgment affirmed.",
