        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 29th 1872, by\nAgnew, J.\nPrimarily the decision of this case rests on the question whether the sale of the property of Edward Devlin in Philadelphia, under the judgment of James Kitchenman, was a satisfaction of the judgment of Claghorn, Herring & Co. Benner v. Phillips, 9 W. & S. 20, is cited by the appellants as an authority that a sale of land by the sheriff \u201c is a payment of the amount for which it is sold; whether it ever reached the pocket of the creditor or not. He must look to the application of the purchase-money.\u201d This is certainly true as to the debtor, and that is the sense in which the language is to be understood. When the property of the defendant in the judgment, real or personal, is sold under execution, and the proceeds paid into the hands of the sheriff, it is a discharge of the debtor\u2019s estate to that amount; but what creditor\u2019s debt it will extinguish is a question to be settled only by the final distribution and appropriation. It is that alone which determines what creditor shall be thrown upon the fund, or shall suffer the loss if he passes it by. Universal practice and numerous authorities prove that the sale and receipt of the money by the sheriff'are not per se a satisfaction of any particular encumbrance, though the lien of it may be extinguished. Hence it has been held over and over again that a creditor having two funds subject to his encumbrance, may pass the first by and come in upon the second for payment; a thing he could not do were the fund first brought into 'distribution a satisfaction of his debt. Whether he will be permitted to do this, or, having done it, whether a junior encumbrance will be permitted to stand in his place by subrogation, will depend upon the equities among the lien-creditors which ought to prevail. The following cases abundantly support these positions : Bank of Pennsylvania v. Winger, 1 Rawle 295; Addams v. Hefferman, 9 Watts 529; Hastings\u2019s Case, 10 Id. 303; Ziegler v. Long, 2 Id. 205; Konigmaker v. Brown, 2 Harris 269; City of Philadelphia v. Cooke, 6 Casey 56; Del. & Hud. Canal Co.\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 512; Cummins\u2019s Appeal, 9 W. & S. 73.\nThis brings us, therefore, to the question, what the equities of the parties are, and on this secondary consideration the decision must rest. As it regards the fund for distribution, it is conceded that the judgment of Claghorn, Herring & Co. is the first lien. It is also the first lien on the funds in Philadelphia county. The case stands thus : The judgment of Claghorn, Herring & Co. was entered first in Philadelphia on the 21st of September 1868, and in Chester county by exemplification filed September 22d 1868. Carson & Co. entered their judgment in Philadelphia on the 26th of December 1868. James Kitchenman, one of the appellants, entered his judgment in Philadelphia on the 15th of December 1869, a year after the entry of the Carson & Co. judgment. He tranferred it by exemplification to Chester county on the 16th of December 1869. The mortgage of Hay & McDevitt, the other appellants, was recorded in Chester county on the 9th day of December 1869, nearly a year also after the entry of the Carson & Co. judgment in Philadelphia. It is obvious, from this state of facts, that when Carson & Co.\u2019s judgment was entered in Philadelphia the case stood thus: Claghorn, Herring & Co. had two funds to resort to \u2014 one in Philadelphia and the other in Chester county. Had a sale then taken place, there could have been no conflict of interests whatever. Carson & Co. having but a single fund to look to, could have compelled Claghorn, Herring & Co. to take their judgment out of the Chester county fund, and thus realized their own out of the Philadelphia fund, or could have been subrogated to Claghorn, Herring & Co., which would have been the same thing in effect-. Having this right in equity, it is clear that they had a right to accomplish the same result by their own act, and therefore could take an assignment of the judgment of Claghorn, Herring & Co., and take payment of it out of the fund in Chester county, and thus lift off the Philadelphia fund the encumbrance of the Claghorn, Herring & Co. judgment, and let themselves in upon that fund: Miller v. Jacobs, 3 Watts 477; Bank of Pennsylvania v. Winger, supra; Hasting\u2019s Case, supra; Del. & Hud. Canal Co.\u2019s Appeal, supra. Now, it is not 'to be doubted, that the recording of Hay & McDevitt\u2019s mortgage, and the entry of Kitchenman\u2019s judgment a year later, could not alter the status of the Carson & Co. judgment so as to compel them to suffer a loss, which they were not obliged to sustain when their judgment was obtained. Some of the cases already cited support this position, and it is obviously so in equity. On what principle of law or equity, therefore, can the appellants whose later encumbrances were subject to the prior rights of Carson & Co., ask us to deny their right as assignees of Claghorn, Herring & Co., to take the fund in question out of court? Had the assignment been obtained to frustrate equity and not to advance it, perhaps a different question might arise, but the facts here disclose no such question. McGinnis\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris 445, is not opposed to this conclusion. McGinnis failed to have himself subrogated to the judgments of McLanahan in Cumberland county, which took the fund from him in that county. Had he been subrogated in Cumberland county it is obvious that the judgments of Mc-Lanahan, which were first also in Franklin county, could be shown there to be satisfied only by the record in Cumberland county. But by the subrogation on the same record in Cumberland they would stand upon the record still open and unpaid in equity, and would therefore be entitled to take the fund in Franklin county, for McGinnis the equitable plaintiff by the subrogation.\nBut when McGinnis went into Franklin county, and there asked his Cumberland county judgment to be subrogated to McLanahan\u2019s in Franklin county, he was met by the declaration that the court would not undertake to settle claims not within their jurisdiction, and his application failed. Whether this was a good reason it is unnecessary to say, or whether the doctrine of equity is correctly stated in the opinion is unimportant, as the case differs from this in the material fact mentioned. Here Carson & Co. go into Chester county with an actual assignment of Claghorn, Herring & Co.\u2019s judgment, and their equity, as we have seen, is superior to that of either of the appellants.\nThe record of the judgment of Claghorn, Herring & Co. in Philadelphia affords no evidence of satisfaction there, and the equity of Carson & Co. as prior encumbrancers entitled them to call upon Claghorn, Herring & Co. to take their payment out of the Chester county fund.\nUpon the whole case, finding no error in the distribution made by the Court of Common Pleas of Chester county, the decree is affirmed with costs to be paid by the appellants, and the record is ordered to be remitted to the court below for distribution according to the decree.",

Phillips, 9 W. & S. 20; McGinnis\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris 445, distinguished.\nJanuary 16th 1872.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Agnew and Sharswood, JJ. Williams, J., at Nisi Prius.\nAppeal from the decree of the Court of' Common Pleas of Chester county: In the distribution of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate of Edward Devlin, deceased: No 103, to July Term 1871.\nThe defendant, Edward Devlin, owned real estate in Chester county, on which there was a mortgage in favor of Alexander Maybin for $1936.59, the lien of which dated from May 11th 1867. He owned real estate also in the city of Philadelphia.\nOn the 21st of September 1868, judgment was entered against him in the District Court of Philadelphia, in favor of Claghorn, Herring & Co., for $3706.50. This judgment was certified to Chester county, and on the 22d of September became a lien on Devlin\u2019s real estate there. On the 26th of December, H. L. Carson & Sons obtained a judgment in the District Court of Philadelphia against Devlin for $6000.\nOn the 9th of December 1869, Hay & McDevitt recorded a mortgage in Chester county for $2000 in their favor against Devlin.\nOn the 15th of December 1869, James Kitchenman obtained a judgment in the District Court of Philadelphia against Devlin for $6783.20. This judgment was certified to Chester county, and became a lien on Devlin\u2019s real estate there December 16th 1869. There were other liens against Devlin in Chester county which do not bear upon the question of distribution.\nOn the 9th of April 1870, Claghorn, Herring & Co., assigned their judgment's and liens, in both\u2019Philadelphia and Chester county, to Carson & Sons.\nUnder Kitchenman\u2019s judgment Devlin\u2019s property in Philadelphia was on the 6th of June 1870, sold by the sheriff for $4000; the proceeds remained in the sheriffs\u2019 hands. The land of defendant in Chester county was sold under the Claghorn judgment (assigned to Carson), on the 27th of October 1870, for $5900 ; this money was paid into court.\nAt the time of these sheriff\u2019s sales, the liens against Devlin, both in Philadelphia and Chester county, interested in the distribution were as follows:\n1867. May 11th. Alexander Maybin, 1868. September 21st. Claghorn, Herring & Co., District Court of Philadelphia. <\u00a3 \u00a3\u00a3 22d. Same transferred to Common Pleas of Chester county (assigned to Carson & Co.,)^ \u00a3\u00a3 December 26th. H. L. Carson & Sons, District Court of Philadelphia 1869 December 9th. Hay & McDevitt, mortgage in Chester County . . 2000.00 $1936.59 $3706.50 6000.00\n\u25ba $6,783.20 1869 December 15th. James Kitchenman, District' Court of Philadelphia \u201c \u201c 16th. Same transferred to Common Pleas of Chester county .\nThe distribution in Chester county was referred to Alfred P. Reid, Esq., as auditor.\nNo question was raised before him as to the right of Maybin\u2019s lien to be first paid out of the fund.\nBefore the auditor in Chester county, Hay and McDevitt and Kitchenman claimed to be paid out of the fund there ; taking the ground that the judgment of Claghorn, Herring & Co. (assigned to Carson) had been satisfied by the previous sale of the defendant\u2019s real estate in Philadelphia.\nThe auditor, however, awarded the fund to Claghorn & Co.\u2019s judgment assigned to Carson.\nExceptions were filed to the auditor\u2019s report and it was confirmed by the Court of Common Pleas. Butler, P. J.\nMcDevitt & Hays and Kitchenman appealed to the Supreme Court and assigned the confirmation for error.\nA. S. Letchworth and Porter (with whom was P. P. Monaghan), for appellants.\nThe principle that where the equities are equally balanced the legal course of execution is not disturbed, is not to be used to overthrow the equity of another person, and thus work injustice: Ziegler v. Long, 2 Watts 205. Subrogation of the surety will not be permitted to work injustice to the rights of others: Erb\u2019s Appeal, 2 Penna. Rep. 296; McGinnis\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris 445; Chancellor Kent, 5 Johns. 546; Goswiler\u2019s Estate, 3 Penna. Rep. 200. If neither party can invoke the equitable interference of the court, they are remitted to their legal rights; and the legal course of execution will not be disturbed : Miller v. Jacobs, 3 Watts 477. The execution in Philadelphia being several months prior to that in Chester county, fixed the rights of the claimants upon that fund, which could not be disturbed except by the application of the equitable principle above mentioned. The fund in Philadelphia is inore than sufficient to pay the Claghorn, Herring & Co. judgment, which is the first lien upon it. When the money goes into the hands of the sheriff, it is a payment of the amount for which it is sold, whether it ever reached the creditor or not. He must look to the application of the purchase-money: Benner v. Phillips, 9 W. & S. 20; The Penna. Bank v. Winger, 1 Rawle 295.\nJ. Perdue and J. D. Rodney, for appellees..\nIf a creditor has two funds, he shall not take his satisfaction out of that fund upon which another creditor has no lien: Lanoy v. Athol, 2 Atk. R. 445; Atty.-Gen. v. Tyndal, 2 Amb. 615; Aldrich v. Cooper, 8 Vesey 391; Cheeseborough v. Millard, 1 John. Ch. 412; Bank of Penn\u2019a v.
