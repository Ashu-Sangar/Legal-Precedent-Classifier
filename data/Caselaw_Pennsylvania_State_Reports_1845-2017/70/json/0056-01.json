    "head_matter": "George versus Braden.\nGeorge sold stock to Braden, and agreed that he -would take it back and return the price if requested, and delivered a certificate. Held, that Braden could recover the price without tendering the certificate; but that he must surrender the certificate to George or file it in court, before execution could issue.\nOctober 26th 1871.\nBefore Thompson, C. J., Read, Agnew, Sharswood and Williams, JJ.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland county: No. 129, to October and November Term 1870.\nThis was an action of assumpsit brought, July 2d 1866, by George Braden against John George, to recover $2000 \u2014 the sum paid by plaintiff to defendant for one-third of a share of stock in the Rynd Oil Company.\nThe jury found that in March 1865, the defendant said to the plaintiff, that if he would take the stock at $2000, he (defendant) would guaranty to pay him from 86 to 37 per cent, and his money back whenever called on; the plaintiff paid him the $2000, and the defendant afterwards gave him a certificate for the stock. About a year afterwards, the plaintiff demanded repayment of his money; no dividend had then been declared. The defendant refused to repay the money. The suit was brought without a tender of the stock at any time.\nThe defendant asked the court to charge:\u2014\n\u201c This being an action of assumpsit, the plaintiff cannot recover without tendering or offering to transfer to the defendant the stock he held'before the bringing of the suit, and there being no evidence in the case of such tender or offer to transfer, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d\nThe court (Buffington, P. J.) answered the point in the negative ; and there was a verdict for the plaintiff for $2500.\nThe defendant took a writ of error, and assigned the answer of his point for error.\nEdgar Cowan and S. P. Laird, for plaintiff m error,\ncited Connor v. Henderson, 15 Mass. R. 319; Hunt v. Silk, 5 East 419; Adams v. Richards, 2 H. Bl. 574; Buffington v. Quantin, 5 Harris 310; Dailey v.
