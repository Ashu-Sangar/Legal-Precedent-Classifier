But even admitting that there was a subsisting covenant, there was no breach of it by John Scott, which would subject him to an action upon it, in his lifetime, or his executors after his death. By the very terms of the instrument he had the right of possession during his life, “it was in no way to take effect until after the death of the said John Scott.” To sustain an action upon a covenant of warranty, there must be either an actual or constructive eviction by title paramount. The learned judge below, in his answer to the defendant’s fourth point, instructed the jury that the will and deed of John Scott, made subsequently to the 22d November 1849, was a breach of the covenant contained in the instrument dated November 22d 1849. No authority has been or can be cited to support the position that a deed or will subsequently made by a grantor is itself a breach of the covenant of warranty contained in his conveyance, more especially when such deed or will is a lawful act.</p>
