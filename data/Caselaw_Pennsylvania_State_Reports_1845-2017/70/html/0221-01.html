The plaintiff as supervisor made out the duplicate for road tax, adopting $8875 as the correct assessment of the defendant’s property, and the rate was fixed at one per cent., making the amount of defendant’s road tax $88.75. He was notified to work out his tax on the roads he; did so work to the amount of $22, and declined to work any more. On the 13th of July 1866, a warrant was put into the plaintiff’s hands for the collection of road tax, including the balance assessed on the defendant. The collector suffered the warrant to expire in his hands, and the township auditors charged him with the unpaid tax of defendant. The defendant refused to pay, principally on the ground that the raising of the valuation of his property from $2510 to $8875, was unauthorized by law.</p>

Until altered, or changed by the commissioners, the increased valuation was properly taken as the basis for the assessment of township-rates and levies for road and other purposes. If the defendant was aggrieved by the assessment, his remedy was by petition to the next Court of Quarter Sessions, as provided by the act. Having neglected to avail himself of the remedy furnished by the law for his redress, he cannot set up the illegality of the tax as a defence to this action. The objection comes too late. As was said in Clinton School District’s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith 315, the remedy for illegal taxation, when the general power to assess exists, is by appeal to those to whom the appeal is required to be taken; and if none be given, neither the Common Pleas nor this court can revise the judgment of the tax-officers. The court below should, therefore, have affirmed the plaintiff’s third and fourth points, and for the refusal to instruct the jury as therein requested the judgmént must be reversed.</p>
