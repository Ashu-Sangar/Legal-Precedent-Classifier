The Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny county was to appoint three commissioners to survey and sét off the district, and to subdivide it into sections, to lay out a general plan of the district and survey, locate and mark on it such streets, alleys and squares as they should think proper, giving them such arrangements and dimensions as should in their judgment best meet the wants and convenience of any future population. When the commissioners should have made a map of the district, with the streets, lanes, alleys, &amp;c., they were to file it with the Clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions, who was to give public notice of the filing, so that any one injured might object. The court was to hear and determine any objections and make any alteration that'might be deemed proper, and direct the plan with such alterations as might have been made to be recorded, and thereafter the plan should be taken and allowed as a general plan for the district for the purposes contained in the act, and the streets, lanes and alleys so approved were to be deemed, adjudged and taken as public highways.</p>

Speculative damages are not contemplated by the act.

The claim of Mr. Kier for damages, in addition to those found by the commissioner, is therefore disallowed. After the commissioner’s report was filed, and while exceptions thereto were under consideration by the court, one of the appellants, James McGinnis, to whom the commissioner awarded no damages, claimed the right to discontinue his appeal, and accept the damages awarded him by the viewers appointed by the city councils. We are all of the opinion that he had no such right. If we were to hold that a party can appeal from the award of the viewers appointed by councils, and take his chance of a more favorable award by the commissioner, or by other viewers appointed by court, and then discontinue his appeal as soon as he discovers the second award is less favorable to him than the first; it would encourage litigation, and lead to great uncertainty and confusion in adjusting claims for damages arising from the opening of streets.</p>

The proceedings must, therefore, be reversed; but as there is an evident misapprehension in the mind of the court, as well as that of the master, as to the Act of June 16th 1836, it will be proper to consider its provisions as applicable to the case before us.</p>
