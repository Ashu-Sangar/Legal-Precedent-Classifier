Some two weeks afterward I came down; found him on the street; asked him, if he had time to settle now; he said he had ; we went to his house; he pulled out a small stand drawer; took out a bunch o.f papers; this bill was among them. He then examined this bill over; he had two bills marked with a cross; they had John Sangston’s name on, and he said he would not pay them. He went over the balance of the bill and he said, it was all right, after I had made some explanations in regard to some of the items. He then produced his books; he went all over his books; didn’t appear very well satisfied at first with them; said ‘something was wrong.’ We went all over them <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>from the beginning, and I made his account some $20 better than he had it on his book; he handed me a pen and ordered me to change the figures on his ledger. He then put it down on this bill, under the aggregate of this account. Just before that, I told him that the saw-mill bill was not charged in my father’s account; he asked me what the old man charged for building the saw-mill ? I said $150. He said it was a pretty large bill. I told him father said he would send out and measure it and it would come to $175. He said ‘ rather than to go to that trouble to put it down at $150.’ We then took the amount off of his ledger and put it under this bill; struck the balance; the balance was $228.54. I then claimed interest on that sum from the date of the last charge; he said I was only entitled after six months; we both calculated the interest for fourteen, years, it amounted to $191.94; adding the principal and interest together, making $428. He said ‘ it was a pretty big bill, and that he would go over the next day and see the old man himself; that he thought he would throw off a part for the sake of getting his money.’ When I first saw him it was the latter part of May, and it was pretty well along in June 1864, when we made the settlement. Afterwards I had a small bill on him ; I was drafted and had to make up my commutation-money. I called on McClelland for my bill; he told me to borrow the money; that ‘it would take about all he could raise at present to pay the old man’s bill off.” My father died September 6 th 1864. In a conversation before we undertook to settle, and after I had got in the room, he said the statute of limitation or the limitations had never paid a debt for him, but paid him a good many. I notified the executor of McClelland about six months after McClelland’s death, that the boys had a claim against McClelland; did not state the amount.”</p>

He was not a party to the record and had no interest in the subject of the controversy, nor was he a party to the contract or account out of which the debt in suit arose, and no assignment from him was necessary to enable the' plaintiffs to maintain their action. Whatever interest he had was a resulting interest in the final settlement of the estate of Jonathan R. West. But as the action was brought, he had no interest in that particular claim, for the action was not brought for the benefit of the estate, but for the use of Jacob D. West, and George L. West, whose interest passed to D. N. Cooper. They were the parties conducting the suit. The release of Enos West was to George L. West, in whom the title of the estate of Jonathan R. West had apparently vested before, either by the act of the decedent or that of his representative. In this state of the record the release was primá. facie a release, and not an assignment. <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>Now, in the bill of exceptions, it does not appear that the right of Jacob D. and George L. West, to bring the suit, was denied or that proof of their title was demanded as preliminary to the objection to the competency of the witness. Since the Act of 1869, enacting that neither interest nor policy of law shall exclude a witness, the ground of Post <em>v. </em>Avery is removed by legislation. Now the policy at the bottom of that case and its sequents is reversed, and prima, facie all witnesses are competent so far as_ interest and policy are in the question. It therefore lay upon the defendant to show a ground of incompetency still remaining to exclude the witness. As the record stood then without objection, there was nothing to show that the estate of Jonathan R. West, or that Enos West had any interest in the controversy before the court. Since the act of 1869, the court, in order to act in good faith toward the legislative branch of the government, must discountenance all objections on the score of interest and policy unless they be made clearly to appear.</p>
    <p id="b187-8" data-blocks='[["BL_187.7",187,[244,1138,1162,766]]]'>The question upon the Statute of Limitations is without difficulty. This was not the case of a party promising to settle an account, or using any such ambiguous terms, and therefore it does not fall within Weaver <em>v. </em>Weaver, 4 P. F. Smith 152: McClelland’s Executor <em>v. </em>West, 9 P. F. Smith 487, and that class of cases. On the contrary, it was the case of an actual settlement of the amount, stating it and striking a balance and a computation of interest by both parties on the balance. There was but one witness and no contradiction of his testimony, and the paper itself on which the settlement was made, balance struck and interest added, was produced and identified. There could not be a plainer admission of a precise debt and certain amount, accompanied as it was also, by an express waiver of the Statute of Limitations before the parties took off the accounts of both sides. Indeed, it is a stronger case than Johns <em>v. </em>Lantz, 13 P. F. Smith 324, and well deserves the remarks made by our Brother Sharswood in that case. The answer of the court to the defendants’ point was therefore not erroneous.</p>
