On the trial the defendant made the point that no agreement in writing was shown signed by him, as required by the Act of April 26th 1855. This point was reserved-r — the jury being instructed by consent of the parties to find a verdict for the plaintiff for $723.63, if they should first find that the defendant’s letter of September 9th was written in answer to the plaintiff’s of September 10th. And coming now to consider the point, we are clearly of opinion that judgment must be entered for the defendant. What will constitute such writing as is required by the statute, has been much discussed in the English cases, and a good deal in those of our own country; but the time afforded us at present will not admit of a reference to them. That it may be found in a connected correspondence there is no room for doubt. As is said by Mr. Parsons (Parsons on Contracts, p. 298), it may be contained in one or in many papers, provided where there are several the pieces be so connected by mutual reference or otherwise, that there can be no uncertainty when taken together and -viewed as a whole. But this connection of the several parts cannot be made out by extrinsic evidence. If they may be read»apart, or in other connections, evidence is not admissible to prove that they were intended to be read together.</p>

And the plaintiff must rely entirely upon his letter of September 10th and the defendant’s of September 9th. If the dates agreed, these letters-would still not support the action. The plaintiff infers assent to his written statement from the defendant’s order for phosphate. And if the dates corresponded, this inference would' have the support of probability. But it is by no means <em>certain, </em>and the lack of certainty would be fatal. But the dates do <em>not </em>correspond. The defendant’s letter appears to have been written and mailed on the 9th, one day <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>
      <em>earlier </em>than the plaintiff’s; and purports to be an answer to one received on the 8th. It is impossible, therefore, to read it as an answer to the plaintiff’s of the 10th, and we cannot, as we have seen, resort to extrinsic evidence to explain this away and make the letters fit. Upon their face they show no agreement, and it would be as dangerous to resort to parol evidence to make an agreement out of them, as to prove an agreement by such evidence without them. Indeed, unless we change the dates and make the letters speak as of a different time, and then conclude that the defendant’s of the 9th was an answer to the plaintiff’s of the 10th, it does not appear even that the plaintiff’s was ever brought to the defendant’s knowledge. I believe the plaintiff says he forwarded it by mail. But while this affords evidence from which a jury might, probably, find that it was received, the law draws no such conclusion from it in this state, however the rule may be elsewhere: Tanner <em>v. </em>Hughes, 3 P.

He testified that his letter of the 9th of September he sent by Nathan T. Hayes, and that in consequence of the message returned, he wrote the letter of the 10th to the defendant, and that the letter of the latter, dated the 9th, was an answer to his of the 10th. It seems obvious that the plaintiff’s letter of the 10th was in consequence of a communication received from the defendant, for it refers to a proposition he had received from him about guaranteeing Ridgway and Miers’s undertaking, and about which he says he thinks it is “ a pretty heavy shave.” It seems equally apparent that the “shave” had reference to his inquiry in a <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>former letter, whether he, the defendant, would guarantee the payment by Ridgway &amp; Miers, and the answer, through Hayes, if he should fill their order for phosphate. No ingenuity conceivable would be equal to the fabrication of such circumstantial details in the absence of all truth. They certainly, together with the parol testimony, prove a mistake in the date of either the plaintiff’s or defendant’s letters, and in this case it is immaterial which.</p>
    <p id="b391-6" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[258,760,1164,474]]]'>But the mistake is what the learned judge below thought could not be proved without contravening the Statute of Frauds of 1855. We think this was error. It is the agreement to guarantee the debt or default of another, which the act requires to be in writing. The agreement would be good without a date, or even if it had an impossible date. The date is a circumstance of identification as to time only; proof of it does not add to, alter or change the terms of the agreement, although it might be forgery if inserted without consent or authority. I know of no case, however, in which it may not be established by parol proof if omitted in the writing by mistake, in the first place.</p>

This they did, and thus a contract resulted. In Shively <em>v. </em>Black, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20345" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Wright 345">9 Wright 345</a>, we held that the consideration of the guaranty to answer for the debt or default of another, although omitted in the writing, could be shown by parol. This was a liberality of construction of the act, equal, if not superior, to that desired in this case. It was shown by my brother Read, in the opinion in that case, that this is the present English rule, although long resisted in their courts. We think the contract found by the jury was legitimately deduced from the letters and testimony, and that the learned court erred in not entering judgment on the verdict. It will be done now here.</p>
