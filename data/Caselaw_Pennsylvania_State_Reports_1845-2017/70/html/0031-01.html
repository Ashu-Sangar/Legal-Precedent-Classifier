In the manner in which this case has been tried, we have not been allowed time and opportunity to make as full and careful an examination of this question as we could wish. We have no doubt that, so far as James McDermott, one of these defendants, is concerned, if he had been found again in possession any time within two years after the <em>hab. fa. poss. </em>was executed, he might have been again turned out, without further inquiry respecting the title. In 1863, however, when this action was brought, he is found in possession with his brother John, claiming as tenant in common with his brother’s title derived through a partition of their father’s estate, and claiming also the Roop title; and, worthless and unavailing as their title may be, as compared with the plaintiff’s, we are not clear that he is not entitled to be regarded as there under color of title, and not a naked intruder upon the former possession. And John, at all events, may fairly and reasonably claim to stand while he can, upon his evidence of title.

That was an ejectment for Samuel Bethel, one of the block, adjoining Philip Wager, one of these two surveys. The case was tried in this court, and submitted by Judge White to a jury, who found for the plaintiff, and upon whose judgment a verdict was entered, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court — adopting, as the report of the case shows, the location of the Barton surveys now here claimed by the plaintiff. Again, to No. 37, October Term 1847, as it appears in evidence, another ejectment was brought in this court by Henry Barklay, for almost the entire block, or over 17,000 acres, against various persons who had got into possession, and resisted his title. The case was twice tried, with a different result each time; in the first trial there was a verdict for the plaintiff, upon which there was a judgment that was reversed; and upon a second trial there was a verdict and judgment for the defendants. Subsequently, as the record of it in evidence shows, this plaintiff to May Term 1855, of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Pennsylvania, brought another ejectment against a large number of defendants, James McDermott, one of these defendants, among them, which was tried before Justice Grier, one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, holding that court, and an old and experienced Pennsylvania judge, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, upon which there was a judgment, and which after a writ of error was -sued out and dismissed, was ejected by a writ of <em>habere fa. possessionem. </em>The great question in all these controversies related to the location on the ground of the Barton surveys; and, to June Term 1863, eight years later, all the parties interested, as it seems, not being satisfied, this ejectment was brought by Murray Hoffman, Jr., against James McDermott, a party defendant in the former controversy, and John McDermott, who were found in possession of land which the plaintiff claims to be included in one or the other, or both of two of his surveys, which the defendants deny; and we meet here again, as the turning question, the old controversy respecting the location of the Barton surveys.</p>

And thence, when there was an effort to obtain large quantities, as was soon found to be the case, this regulation was evaded by the use of fictitious warrantee names, a large number of them representing and giving names to as many different tracts, and it resulted sometimes in the survey and return of large blocks of surveys. Then blocks were made and returned by the deputy -surveyor, in the location of a batch of warrants issued at the same time for one man, and were often fixed upon the ground by a line which was perhaps run the .whole extent of it, and bounded the block on one side; perhaps not the whole extent of it; and then the other tracts in the block would be laid down by protraction from that line. Sometimes a portion of the surveys were run and marked on the ground, and the others not run or marked; the tracts all calling one for another in its place in the block. Sometimes an occasional interior line was run; and sometimes none of the interior lines were run. Sometimes after one block was laid down, if there was-an effort for further appropriation, another block would be attached to it with sometimes the line between the two blocks marked, and sometimes not even that. These blocks of surveys were often made — what work -was done on the ground, done, perhaps, before the warrants themselves were in the hands of the officer, his own work, perhaps, or it might be of some one exploring for a party who wished to purchase and speculate in large bodies of lands of the Commonwealth. Afterwards, the surveys would be completed, returned into the office and accepted. Though it was the duty of the deputy-surveyor to run and mark on the ground the lines of every survey he located, this was scarcely ever done in locating <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>large blocks m mountain localities, and more particularly with respect to interior lines. It followed that such surveys or blocks of surveys, where they stretched over miles of wilderness in mountainous regions, after they would be returned would vary in many respects with regard to waters, especially small streams, and other things that it is not supposable, under the circumstances, the officer would refer to accurately.</p>

They substituted for marked trees, neglected by the deputy-surveyor, legal marks and monuments, which fix and define the owner’s survey, and shield and protect his rights, in every instance in which the officer did what he should not have done or left undone what he should have done.

But, in the absence of marks of its own, to fix on the ground a tract or a block, to meet and obviate the difficulty of there being no marks, the rule which we have stated has been necessarily settled and established as a rule of property. It followed that a survey without a solitary mark belonging to it, might be certainly and legally located by attaching it to or starting from a survey for which it calls, and which is found upon the ground, and has marks of its own, or from one lying beyond that again, and found by similar marks or monuments of its own. They may be fixed and attached together by some fixed call that can be ascertained on the ground, and it is in this way, that most of these blocks of surveys are or can be located, and in this way they may be legally and properly located.

They have examined Mr. Evans and Mr. Scanlan, surveyors, who, commencing their work at the Hoop and the older survey of Luke McGuire, traced the lines of a number of tracts called the Brown &amp; Harris, or Brown &amp; Co., testifying to their work, and producing the blocks from trees marked upon several of the lines of these surveys; and it is to be remarked that this evidence plainly shows the location on the ground of the surveys which they thus traced. And this is not disputed. Indeed, it was a proposition of the counsel of the plaintiffs to save time and trouble by admitting this location of these surveys called Brown &amp; Harris, or Brown &amp; Co. Starting at the point mentioned, they ran through these tracts till they come to where they located Hillery Baker; but it is not claimed that they found any marks or work belonging to it. These surveys called the Brown &amp; Harris are nearly two years younger than the Barton surveys, and of course the older surveys could not be located by the junior. You could not locate a survey by another that was not made at its date. The rule is, that an older survey fixed on the ground, is sufficient to locate a younger survey which calls for it; but it is not the law that an older one may be located by a younger; nor is it a rule or principle of reason. Yet it is in this way mainly that Mr. Evans, as he states, locates where he does the Hillery Baker or Philip Wager, pushing it away or removing it four miles from the land in controversy; on this ground mainly, and on what is claimed to be indicated by the representation of the waters, and what he discovered tending to lead him to that opinion in the combination of blocks of surveys which he made in the land-office, but more particularly upon the call of one of the plaintiffs’ surveys, — the Baker or Wager, — for ‘ Brown &amp; Co.’ How that call came to be there, or what surveys it relates to, must be a matter of speculation or conjecture, for there is nothing here which determines it.

You have heard his testimony to that effect, so also the testimony of Richard J.

If this be so, as these surveyors all testify, their testimony locates the Barton 52 where the plaintiff claims them to be, and so that the Baker and Wager tracts would include the land in controversy.</p>

And here we have the testimony of Judges Gwinn, Proudfoot and Gibboney, all fixing, in their judgment, the location of the Richardson, so as to place the Barton 52 where the Loudon would put them, locating' from the other end. This is cumulative and strongly corroborative evidence, tending to fix the Baker and Wager tracts where the plaintiff claims them to be. There was some evidence, it is true, offered by the defendants to show that another batch called the Barton ‘ 28’ are located down in the valley, off the mountain, which tends to show, as it is claimed, that the Richardson is located in a different place; but the testimony of William Reed, Esq.,.on that subject, who made an examination of the lines of that batch long ago, and also of the Richardson, is positive as to the connection of these two blocks on the side of the mountain, where it seems the other witnesses of the plaintiff put them. Now, if the Richardson lie there, and the Richardson and Barton call for one another as lying together, that location of the Richardson would locate the Barton. From either standing-point the Loudon or the Richardson, in the judg<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>ment of the witnesses of the plaintiff, his surveys may he located; and if from either the two branches of his evidence together, tending to the same point and corroborating each other, would seem, if the witnesses are believed, to furnish clear proof of the location claimed by the plaintiff.</p>

In view of the manner in which these old surveys were made and returned, it is scarcely to be expected that everything bearing upon the question of location, when a survey or block of surveys has to be identified or fixed upon the ground by evidence, would point the same way. On the contrary,.it is not unusual to find disclosed grounds for conflicting theories of location. In addition to sources of difficulty already noticed, there may be errors, as in tracing waters, particularly small streams, and sometimes discrepancies or conflict between the calls of warrants and the surveys upon them, &amp;c. As to such matters, it may be observed that the tracing of small streams upon blocks of surveys which have been mainly made by protraction, is not to be regarded as of much significance when found in conflict with calls and marks otherwise sufficient to identify and locate the surveys; and the calls of a survey, after it has been returned and accepted, are of more weight than the calls of the warrants where they do not agree. But where there is conflict in the evidence afforded by the calls or marks, or anything else indicating or tending to show where the tract lies, and to identify it on the ground, then the jury must be governed as when they have to deal -with discrepancies in testimony of witnesses. They must reconcile it if they can, and from the best conclusion they can form the whole evidence. And while the evidence in this ease would seem to us to locate these surveys where the plaintiff, claims them to be, it is, we repeat, not a question for the court hut for the jury.</p>

The 2d assignment is to the rejection by the court below of the certified copy of an agreement between the original owners of the surveys, or the lands in controversy, produced by them before the board of property upon a caveat dated April 6th 1795, to the acceptance of the returns of certain surveys. It was offered as evidence of location and boundaries. It is too clear for argument and, indeed, has not been disputed, that this agreement could not shift the actual location of the tracts in controversy, as ascer<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>iained by the original surveys made on the 24th and 25th August 1794 — returned into the office of the surveyor-general, and patents thereupon issued to the owner of the warrants on February 23d 1796. But it is contended that this agreement is evidence of an admission by William Barton, the patentee, of the location of the surveys, which ought to have been allowed to go to the jury to be considered by them with the other evidence in the cause upon that subiect. The agreement upon its face appears to have been made upon the basis of a draft or plat by Daniel Turner, “ which said draft,” it recites, “is now before them,” the parties. This draft or plat was not produced, and its non-production is not attempted to be accounted for except by the mere allegation that it is not to be found in the land office. From nothing before us can we infer that it was an official paper which ought to have been in the land office — although it is not improbable that it was — for Daniel Turner was an assistant of Col. Canan, a deputy surveyor at that time. “ He made numerous surveys, and Col. Canan returned them to the office7 Barr 72. Without that draft, to argue from an agreement, which at the most settles the boundary line of the surveys belonging to John Hannum and Charles Dilworth, as described in it, should have any legal operation in determining the proper location on the ground of the surveys of the Philip Wager and Hillery Baker warrants, belonging to William Barton, was a pure matter of speculation, and would be much more likely to mislead the jury than to assist their inquiries. With the draft before them upon which, perhaps, the surveys upon these very warrants were laid down, it might have been of some assistance; for the agreement expressly provides “ that the surveys made or to be made for the before-mentioned parties to these presents (including those of William Barton, the patentee), as the same are laid down in the general draft aforesaid for the other parties therein named, shall be and remain as they are therein laid down and described.” It is evident that no alteration was intended to be made in the location of these other surveys, and without Daniel Turner’s draft we are thrown necessarily upon other sources from which to determine their location. In Collins <em>v. </em>Barclay, 7 Barr 67—a case heard and decided in this court more than twenty-four years ago — an ejectment for one of the tracts in this block of surveys in which this agreement was in evidence, it was determined that it could have no effect upon the question of location, as I understand the opinion of Mr. Justice Burnside, either in fact or in law. He says: “ No regard was paid to the calls of the warrants, for that would have made them interfere with each other; nor to the agreement ; but the returns were generally if not altogether made by Turner’s draft. The owners of this large body of warrants never complained. Those returns were received and have remained accepted in the land office for more than half a century; and <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>whether there was a subsequent agreement of the parties changing the former arrangement before the board of property, is at this distance of time immaterial. The tract in question, as well as the lands in general, have been long since patented. The original owners have all paid the debt of nature; neither their representatives nor any subsequent intruder will be allowed to disturb their returns.” As indeed the agreement proposed merely to settle the boundary line of the Hannum and Dilworth surveys, with which there seems to have been some interference, and to be a quit-claim or release by the owners of these surveys “ to all other lands included or described in the aforesaid draft (namely of Daniel Turner), lying to the northward and north-eastward of the before-mentioned line (namely the agreed boundary of Hannum and Dilworth), running the course of south 30 degrees east;” it is not easy to perceive how this agreement can legitimately be considered as an admission by William Barton, that the compromise line or the Spanish oak at the corner where it starts were monuments, which had anything to do with determining the particular location of the Philip Wager and Hillery Baker surveys which by concession lie at a considerable distance from it. We are of opinion, therefore, that there was no error in the rejection of this paper.</p>

This suit was between other parties, and for other lands, though it may be,lying in the same block with those now in dispute. This record could certainly not have been given in evidence by William Barton or the plaintiffs below claiming under him against the defendants below; why then should it be admissible in their favor and against him ? I understand the contention now to be, that it may be evidence to show what were the grounds upon which he rested his claim in that case, and the location he then set up; and this by the notes of the testimony attached to the bills of exceptions which form part of the record. I pass entirely the question whether the bill of exceptions though attached to the record, is strictly any part of it, or if it is, whether the signature and seal of the judge, <em>diverso intuitu, </em>to certify his rulings to the court of errors, is a sufficient authentication, and can supply the oath of a witness that the evidence is the full substance of what the witnesses said. These notes of testimony are offered, it is said, as admissions by William Barton himself. But this is to carry the doctrine of admissions much further than it ever has been done. No decision can be found, which holds that the evidence of a witness produced by a party on the trial of a cause can be used against him as an admission in any subsequent suit between other parties, and relating to another subject of controversy. See Ayres <em>v. </em>Wattson, 7 P. F. Smith 360. It would be perilous, indeed, to any party to produce and examine a witness in court, if all that <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>he might say could afterwards he used in evidence against him as an admission. He admits, indeed, by producing him, that he is a credible witness but only <em>pro hae vice, </em>so far as that case is concerned. He does not admit that everything he says is true either in that or any other proceeding. A party in the same suit may give evidence which contradicts his own witness or shows that he was mistaken, though he cannot directly impeach his veracity. The case of Truby <em>v. </em>Seybert, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20101" class="citation" data-index="45" data-cite="2 Jones 101">2 Jones 101</a>, cited in the paper-book of the plaintiffs in error, does not sustain their contention. The point ruled in that case was, that if a party or his counsel in his defence make a concession of a fact within his own knowledge, which is pertinent in another issue with another plaintiff, the record of the first suit as introductory to evidence of the concession, and the concession itself, though proved by parol, are good evidence for the new plaintiff; and what is said by Mr. Justice Bell in that case is certainly true that a record between other parties may be admissible in evidence whenever it contains a solemn admission or judicial declaration by any of such parties in regard to the existence of any particular fact. But this certainly falls far short of holding that what is declared by a third person, produced as a witness, is to be received and treated as an admission by the party producing him.</p>
    <p id="b53-6" data-blocks='[["BL_53.6",53,[196,1364,1175,348]]]'>The 4th assignment of error is to the rejection of a certified copy of the caveat of Richardson and Norney, dated September 26th 1794, against the acceptance of the surveys known as the Barton surveys, which was accompanied with a re-offer of the agreement of April 6th 1795, before referred to. The same reasons which have been given to show the irrelevancy of that agreement, standing by itself, apply equally to this offer, and this' assignment is therefore dismissed.</p>
    <p id="b53-7" data-blocks='[["BL_53.7",53,[196,1710,1167,690]]]'>The 5th error assigned is to the admission of the testimony of James L. Grwinn, a witness called by the plaintiff below for the purpose of proving that the location claimed by the plaintiff on a former trial in the United States court in 1857, the record of which was in evidence, was the same as alleged in the present trial. That former suit was clearly admissible as persuasive evidence in this: Koons <em>v. </em>Hartman, <a href="/watts/7/0020-01" class="citation" data-index="46" data-cite="7 Watts 20" data-case-ids="1846845" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0020-01">7 Watts 20</a>; Levers <em>v. </em>Van Buskirk, 4 Barr 309. At all events it was in evidence, and we are not now dealing with the question of its admissibility. When the record of a former suit is in evidence it is settled that a party may give parol evidence of what transpired on the former trial, in order to show that it was the same subject-matter, and the same title which was then passed upon: Brindle <em>v. </em>McIlvaine, 10 S. &amp; R. 282; Haak <em>v. </em>Breidenbach, 3 Id. 204; Carmony <em>v. </em>Hoober, 5 Barr 305.

The book produced was proved by one of the commissioners of the county to be the original assessment. This book contained the name of the warrantee, the number of acres in the tract, the valuation and the rate. The amount of the tax was not carried out, but that was a mere matter of calculation. The land becomes debtor for the tax by being returned assessed and valued, and the rate per cent, fixed: carrying out the amount of the tax is merely clerical: Heft <em>v. </em>Gephart, 15 P. F. Smith 510.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[319,843,1168,476]]]'>' The 7th assignment of error is to the admission of several other treasurers’ deeds for other tracts in the same block for the purpose not of showing title but location. This was objected to specifically because the offer was not preceded or accompanied with evidence that there was an assessment and valid sale for taxes. Undoubtedly had these deeds been offered to show title under them, the objection would have been a good one. But if they would have been admissible if shown to have been founded upon valid sales to prove location, they were equally admissible without such preliminary proof: Sample <em>v. </em>Robb, 4 Harris 319; McCausland <em>v. </em>Fleming, 13 P. F. Smith 36.</p>
    <p id="b54-7" data-blocks='[["BL_54.7",54,[319,1319,1167,908]]]'>The 8th and 12th assignments of error may both be considered together, as they relate to the defence set up of the bar of the Statute of Limitations. There was no evidence of possession by the defendants of any part of the Philip Wager and Hillery Baker tracts, which were the premises claimed in this ejectment. There was no evidence, as the learned judge instructed the jury, that the field cleared within the Roop survey was within that portion of it which interferes with the Philip Wager and Hillery Baker surveys; nor has any such evidence been pointed out to us upon this record. The burden of establishing an adverse .possession to create the bar of the statute is undoubtedly upon the party who sets it up. The evidence given by Anthony Meyers and Luke Maguire is of the vaguest kind. They prove at most only an improvement upon some part of the Thomas Roop survey, but there is nothing in what they say from which an inference can be drawn that it was within the lines here claimed by the plaintiff below. If so, the evidence of the assessment of taxes to Michael McDermott for seated lands was clearly inadmissible. It was no evidence of title or possession, and while it might have been corroboration of other evidence on that subject, if any such had been given, in its absence it was totally irrelevant.</p>

The learned counsel for the plaintiffs in error falls back upon the <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>common law of England, and he may be right in regard to that law; for in England when a special jury is ordered, the sheriff attends with his freeholders’ book, from which the prothonotary of the court selects indifferently forty-eight names, from which the jury is struck and a venire issues to summon them: 3 Bl. Com. 357. But we have in this state a common law of our own, founded on uniform usage, and adapted to our habits and principles. Special jurors are not required to be freeholders, and a special jury is always struck from the panel returned to the general venire issued for the court, containing the names “which shall have been drawn from the proper wheel for the ensuing court.” A special venire is only required in case of a view: Act of April 14th 1834, Pamph. L. 368. Be this as it may, the defendants "did not challenge the array, which was the only proper mode of raising the objection. At all events, the exception should have been taken before the jury were sworn. They went to trial without objection, and it is too late for them now to complain.</p>
    <p id="b55-6" data-blocks='[["BL_55.6",55,[239,1138,1167,430]]]'>The 10th assignment of error is, that the court allowed the plaintiff to challenge peremptorily one of the jurors upon the struck list. The words of the Act of Assembly of March 29th 1860, Pamph. L. 344, are: “ on the trial of all civil suits now pending, or hereafter brought in any of the courts of this Commonwealth, the plaintiff and defendant shall each have four peremptory challenges.” However it may have been, had the question been <em>res </em>integra, it must now be considered as set at rest both by inveterate practice, and the early recognition of that practice by this court in Schwenk <em>v. </em>Umsted, 6 S. &amp; R. 354.</p>

In the connection in which the mistake occurred it could not have misled the jury, and even if it might, it was the duty of the defendants’ counsel to have called the attention of the learned judge to it at the close of his charge, when no doubt it would have been at once corrected. %</p>

This was a question of fact for the jury, and so they were distinctly instructed. The views of the learned judge upon the evidence expressed upon this point did not trench upon their province. Upon a question of this character, to be determined upon a great mass of complicated testimony, alleged to be contradictory and conflicting, it was not only his right but his duty to assist the jury by his knowledge and experience in threading the maze. We see no just ground which the plaintiffs in <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>error have to complain of any part of the charge, which was certainly both learned and lucid — two qualities which do not always go together.</p>
