This power of inquiry by the first section of the Act of 19th June 1871 (Pamph. L. 1360), may be exercised by this court, where, as in this case, the private right of an individual is injured and invaded by this corporation, claiming to have a right or franchise to do the act from which such injury results.</p>

The fourth section says: “The damages occasioned by the building and construction of said railroad,’.’ which means a railroad built and constructed by <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>the company created by the act, “ or of any partly built road which may be purchased by said company to the owners of private property on which the same may be located, and which shall not have been settled with or secured to said owners by agreement, shall be ascertained and paid in the manner provided in the General Railroad Law of February 19th 1849, and the several supplements thereto,” which clause does not apply to a built and constructed railroad like the present road purchased by the company, and there is therefore no provision for the ascertainment of damages in the case before us.</p>
