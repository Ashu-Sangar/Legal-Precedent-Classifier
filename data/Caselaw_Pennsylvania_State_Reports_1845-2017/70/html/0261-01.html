The prothonotary was not bound to receive the papers at his dwelling-house, and his acceptance of them there cannot be regarded as an official act. He did not receive them in his official capacity, but merely as the agent of the appellee; and their delivery to him on Sunday evening no more rendered the judgments and executions entered and issued thereon nullities, than if they had been handed to some other agent to be delivered the next morning to the prothonotary in his office. If, as was held in Baker <em>v. </em>Lukens, 11 Casey 146, a judgment will not be regarded as invalid because the warrant of attorney on which it was confessed appears to be dated on Sunday, there is still less reason for holding the judgments and executions in controversy to be invalid, for in neither of them do the papers appear to have been drawn or executed on Sunday.</p>

It is true that the latter appeared before the auditor and claimed <a id="p264" href="#p264" data-label="264" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*264</a>the fund, but on the coming in of the report he excepted to it on the ground that “ the auditor was appointed Avithout the fund being paid into court.” When this exception was made the court below should have ordered the fund into court before proceeding to distribute it.
