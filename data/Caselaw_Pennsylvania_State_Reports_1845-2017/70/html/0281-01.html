It cannot, however, be said that the plaintiffs were sleeping upon their rights, and were guilty of <em>laches. </em>The delay is sufficiently explained by the fact set forth more fully hereafter, that the settlement of these partnership accounts was actually in progress before arbitrators of the parties’ own choosing — ’first, Mr. Gay and Mr. Snyder, and afterwards Mr. Juvenal and Mr. Snyder, almost continuously from 1860 to 1865. That the defendant joined in these references is averred in the bill and not denied in the answer, and is clearly proved in the printed evidence.

Fourteen witnesses testified before the examiner, eleven of whom speak of the sale. Only <em>one, </em>William Hicks, says he <em>was present </em>— but he cannot say who was the purchaser. <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>Three of the witnesses say that it was sold under a judgment of William Hicks, but no such judgment appears in evidence. Several of the witnesses seem to have derived their knowledge from the sheriff’s handbills of the sale, one of which has been put in evidence by the defendant. But in all this there is not a single line of <em>direct </em>evidence that Jacob Peters purchased his brother’s interest at sheriff’s sale except Jacob Peters’s own declarations. It is left to be inferred. In connection with this, there is evidence of declarations by Rex Peters, in his lifetime, which seem to make the main strength of the defence ; they are therefore to be carefully examined, and are set out at length. Four witnesses testify to conversation with him, as follows: Mr. Wood says: ‘After the sale, Rex Peters told me, at various times, he had no interest in the business. He told me that if he had so many thousand dollars — I don’t recollect what the amount was — he would go into the business with Jacob Peters again.’ Mr. Beamer says: ‘He (Rex) told me that he had nothing to do with the stage line, that he was out, and that Jacob was the proprietor.’ Mr. Carman says: ‘ He (Rex) made the remark that he would be like Phoenix, and also said that at that time he had nothing to do with the lines which were running. ' I have heard him mention repeatedly that he had no connection with the lines that were running.’ Mr. Miller says: ‘After the sheriff’s sale, I had reason to inquire partichlarly whether Rex had anything to do with the omnibus concern. He said he had nothing to do with it, and didn’t want to.’ It was also proved that about the time of the alleged sheriff’s sale, several of the omnibus-coaches, which had been lettered outside ‘L. R. and J. Peters,’ were repainted, and the lettering changed to ‘ J. Peters, Jr.’ * * * The defendant attempted -to prove that from the date of the alleged sale, Rex Peters ceased to exercise control as a partner in the business — but in this I think he has failed. * * * The evidence offered by the defendant on the question of the sheriff’s sale is entirely circumstantial, and it is remarkable that, even taking in the declarations of Rex Peters, which form so strong a link in the chain, there is not discoverable in the whole of it any direct, positive testimony to sustain the defendant’s allegation of a sheriff’s sale to him of his brother’s interest in the partnership property; still, it points strongly to that conclusion.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.6",285,[242,2081,1160,345]],["BL_286.1",286,[315,401,1153,132]]]'>“ To meet and rebut that conclusion, the following points were urged by the plaintiffs : There was no change in the books of the partnership at the time of the alleged sale, and afterwards. William Megonegal, the only clerk of the omnibus business, who had the charge of the books, says: ‘ The books were continued after the sale in the same manner as they were before.” * * * Rex Peters, after the alleged sale, started a couple of coaches, to run from the city to Laurel Hill and the Falls of Schuylkill, on his own account. <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>These coaches were kept in the yard, and the horses were fed in the stables which had belonged to the partnership, and which the defendant says then belonged only to him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.6",286,[316,529,1154,603]]]'>“ After the time of the alleged sale, it was the habit of the defendant to pay to Rex Peters <em>1 </em>money to live on,’ and it was charged to his individual account, in the books of the omnibus business ; and after his death, these payments were continued to his widow. The evidence does not show the amount paid to him, but Mr. Jarvis C. Carman, who was employed in the business by defendant, in several positions of confidence, testifies: <em>‘ </em>My orders were to pay her $20 a week, for Mr. Jacob Peters. I presume she received $20 a week, up to the time she married Mr. Shelmire.’ In passing, it is proper to advert to the fact, that the defendant, in his answer, explains that he did freely and generously contribute to the support of the widow, but avers that he did so ‘ not on the footing of a contract, and only out of good feeling towards the family of his deceased brother.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.7",286,[320,1130,1157,1288]],["BL_287.1",287,[262,419,1160,421]]]'>“ But the chief reliance of the plaintiffs is upon the admissions of the defendant, made verbally to several witnesses, and, more strongly still, by his conduct in referring his books to arbitrators, for a settlement of the partnership accounts, upon the basis of a continuing partnership, up to and including the time of the sale to the railway company. Admissions are shown to have been made by the defendant at various times, up to 1865, which consisted in expressions of intention and promises by him to pay the amount shown to be due by settlement of the books of the business. The evidence on the subject of these references to arbitration is important, and has been, therefore, critically examined. There were two references: The first to John Gay and Jacob P. Snyder, the time of the beginning of which does not appear in evidence, probably some time in 1860, and which ended in the finding of a conditional and qualified award, May 27th 1861. The second reference was to William W. Juvenal, Esq., and Mr. Jacob P. Snyder, which ended in an award, finding the sum of $11,975.98, as due the estate of L. R. Peters, by the defendant, which -award was signed by both arbitrators, but was afterwards repudiated by Mr. Snyder. This latter reference covered a period of time extending from 1862 to the latter part of 1865. It is not important at this stage of the cause to inquire what these awards were, or how these references failed to settle the matter — they are of value <em>now </em>only in showing the conduct of the defendant, as bearing on the question of the ownership of the property in dispute. Mr. Juvenal, who was examined at length, and who, besides being one of the arbitrators in the second reference, had, as mutual friend and counsel for both parties, advised the first reference, and was conversant with the whole matter, speaks clearly to this point. He says the defendant called upon <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>him and gave assent to the first reference; and afterwards it was proposed that he and Mr. Snyder should examine the books and accounts, and report upon them — and both parties having acceded to this, the defendant sent the books and papers to his house; that the defendant always stated that he desired the accounts to be settled between them as partners continuing; and that he was willing to pay whatever a just settlement of the accounts would show was due. This evidence is substantiated by other testimony on the same subject, and is not contradicted by any evidence in the cause.</p>

But admitting that he was, still his case is not sufficiently made out. The question remains, was it a <em>valid </em>sale ? Did it divest the title of Rex Peters and vest it in the defendant? The defendant’s own evidence shows that the sale took place after the sheriff was out of office, in a private office in Commerce street, which seems to have been shared between the ex-sheriff and Alderman Mitchell; no return appears to have been made to the court of a sale, and the ex-deputy of the ex-sheriff seems yet to have writs of execution against L. R. Peters in his possession. Nothing was sold beyond the interest in the partnership property, and it would have been natural and decidedly more proper to have sold it on the premises, where purchasers might have seen the partnership stock, and known what they were bidding for. The price too was very small; only $110 for a half interest in a business that is shown to have been worth $20,000 a few years earlier, and $44,000 a few years later, and it does not appear that the firm were indebted. Mr. Hicks, under whose execution defendant claims that the sale was made, got his money not from the sheriff but from Mr. Heebner, to whom he transferred his judgment. There is also evidence that the bills of advertisement of this sheriff’s sale were taken down; one witness followed the poster and took them down; and it is in evidence that the defendant was at least privy and consenting, if not active in their being taken down. These facts lead to the suspicion that there was about this sale some radical defect, which rendered it invalid. It is not improbable that there was sufficient ground upon which Rex could have applied to have the sale set aside, or could have successfully contested its validity at the time, but all inducement to do so, and all necessity of doing so for his <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>protection, was removed by the reiterated declarations of the defendant that he never meant to take advantage of that sale to claim the whole partnership property.</p>

Rex Peters could have successfully attacked it for fraud. But we think that there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that it was abandoned by Jacob, and that the partnership between him and his brother soon after, if not immediately, returned to and flowed in its former channel. If this were so, it would not be necessary for the creditors of L. Rex Peters to break down the sheriff’s sale, in order to reach and levy upon his interest. It is a confirmation of this, that <em>‡† </em>evidence of the sale was preserved. The executions were without any endorsement of levy — they were never returned — no bill of sale was executed by the sheriff. All the writing that appears is an entry by the sheriff upon his cash-book, of the receipt of a sum sufficient to pay the costs, without stating from whom. This is followed by the undoubted fact that no change was made in the books of the firm, but on the contrary, sums paid to L. Rex Peters out of the proceeds of the business, were charged against him as before in his individual account on those books. It is true that his name was painted out from some of the coaches, and he declared on several occasions that he had nothing to do with the business. Declararations ought not to avail much against facts. There are declararations by Jacob Peters to the contrary. But the most significant <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>and persuasive evidence upon this point is, that after the death of his brother, Jacob continued to make payments to his widow from the proceeds of the business and charge them in the books. Upon the bare question, of whether there shall be a decree to account, we have nothing to do with the further question, whether the partnership was continued after the death of L. Rex Peters. Long after that event, Jacob acknowledged his liability to account to his brother’s estate, and his willingness to pay whatever might be found to be justly due. He agreed to a reference, and delivered over the books of the concern to the referees for that purpose. He agreed to a second reference, after the first had fallen through. L. Rex Peters had died in 1857, and by the references the matter was continued open until November 17th 1865. During all this period Jacob was, either expressly or impliedly, declaring his entire willingness to account, and it was not until he was dissatisfied with the result of the last reference, and revoked the authority of the arbitrators, that he said “ that, if suit was brought, he believed he would contend that the sheriff’s sale vested the whole title of the partnership in him.” But a pending reference to ascertain the balance of account between partners is a continuing admission of a liability to account, of the most unequivocal kind, sufficient to suspend the running of the statute, and to preclude any denial of partnership. After a party has been delayed for six years by such a reference or references, it would be highly inequitable to allow his opponent to turn round and either deny all liability to account, or that he is barred of his remedy by lapse of time.</p>

Rex Peters,' and that it be referred to E. Coppee Mitchell, Esq., as master, to state and report such account, and the balance which may appear thereon.</p>
