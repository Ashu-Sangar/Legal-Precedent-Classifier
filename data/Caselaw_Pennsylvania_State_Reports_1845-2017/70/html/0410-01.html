The auditor decides against this application, not only on the fact of notice, but on the merits, and also on the well-settled principle that, for a mistake of law, relief will not be given against the unwise or improvident execution of a deed or agreement. But this doctrine, though founded on principle, and supported by authority, will not be allowed to bar the way to relief, where the party seeking to avoid the consequences of his own deed, shows that he has acted upon a w.ant of proper knowledge which he was not able to obtain, though vigilant and diligent in his search for it, or where information to which he was entitled, and which was necessary to the formation of a correct judgment as to the performance of a proposed act by which his rights are to be effected, has been withheld from or refused to him. Nor is the principle which the auditor invokes in support of his conclusions applicable to a case in which unconscionable advantage is taken of circumstances in which a suitor is placed, whereby his will is coerced, and he has by undue pressure been induced to do that which he would not otherwise have done. Much more clear is the ease where there is actual or legal fraud ; where t;here is a moral or legal wrong on the part of one who seeks to obtain by these means the execution of an agreement from which a benefit is to flow to himself, or to another for whom he acts.</p>

As in the case of Pusey <em>v. </em>Desbouvrie, 3 P. Wins. 315, where a daughter held a legacy of 10,000Z., upon condition that she would release her orphanage share, which amounted to 40,000Z., accepted the legacy and executed the release. On the ground that she did not fully understand her right to have an account first taken, although informed that such was her right, the release was set aside, and her orphanage share was given to her. In Evans <em>v. </em>Lewellyn, 1 Cox R. 333, a conveyance was set aside for the reason that it had been improvidently executed. Lord Kenyon remarks :</p>

The first is ruled on the fact that full information and explanation were not given; and the second on the ground of surprise, and an improvident execution. We have both these elements standing out in the undisputed facts of this case. The testimony shows that Mr. Townsend Whelen, upon application made to him, on behalf of Mrs. Fry, by a member of the bar of the highest respectability, who was well known to Mr. Whelen, refused permission to him to examine the books of the testator, in which the charges were made which Mr. Whelen claimed to deduct from Mrs. Fry’s portion. This is confessed by Mr. Whelen, accompanied by an explanation which, however satisfactory to himself, allows the fact to remain that light was refused which was every way proper should have been given, and at a time when it was of the utmost importance that it should not have been withheld. Mr. Whelen testified that he named another person to Mrs. Fry, who should advise with her in regard to the settlement of her father’s estate, but after the refusal mentioned she was not bound to accept a suggestion of this kind emanating from him; such a suggestion was in itself a sufficient reason for its rejection; and upon every principle of right and of fair dealings, she ought to have been allowed the freest access to herL father’s books, either by herself or by her chosen agent or attorney. This conduct on the part of Mr. Whelen makes a stronger case for Mrs. Fry than the facts as they are stated in Pusey <em>v. </em>Desbouvrie, made for the complainant in that case. Evans <em>v. </em>Lewellyn supports this application to open the decree on the ground of haste in the execution of the agreement of distribution. The short time that had passed after the death of Mr. Nevins, a little more than two months, makes the transaction a very uncommon one, showing unusual expedition in securing, by consent of the parties, a division of the principal portion of the assets of the estate.</p>

Townsend Whelen testifies that he told Mrs. Fry that the estate could only be settled by her allowing the deductions from her share which he claimed, and that he had been so advised by counsel. If to this is added the facts testified to by Mrs. Fry, which are uncon-£ tradicted, that she was suffering at that time great sorrow because of the comparatively recent death of her husband and father; that she was distressed and annoyed by the want of money to meet debts then due, and to supply the wants of her household, and that her children urged her to sign the agreement to avoid family alienations, we have a case of surprise, of undue pressure, and a condition of circumstances which we think show, as in the latter case cited, that she was not able to protect herself, and that she is therefore entitled to claim the protection she has invoked. This is all outside of the portion of the testimony of the Messrs. Whelen and Mrs. Fry, which is highly contradictory, the latter swearing that she was repeatedly threatened by Townsend and Edward S. Whelen with the loss of other property, which was held in trust for her, if she refused to allow the deductions, and that they possessed the knowledge that would enable them to accomplish this result.</p>

There was ignorance of title here which was not the result of negligence on the part of Mrs. Fry, but an ignorance forced upon her by the refusal of the executors to furnish the evidence for which she called.

      <em>“ </em>The intention of the testator, if it can be gathered from the will, must answer this question, and this, we think, he has not left in doubt or uncertainty. His purpose is clearly expressed in the phrase ‘ it is my express intention that the shares of all of my said children shall be equalized.’ To accomplish this the advances are to be deducted from the share of this son, or from those of his daughters <em>‘ </em>whose husbands may be indebted to me.’ The auditor is influenced in arriving at this conclusion by the term indebted, and from this argues that he ‘ referred to such advances of money as did and would, agreeably to common acceptation, constitute a debt.’ But these advances made and to be made by the testator, were not limited to money; <em>stocks or otherwise, </em>is the phrase used, which last word would cover anything of value, of which he would make advances; it might be real estate, evidences of debts or money due to him, or any other kind of personal property. To advance or make advances of such kind of property, if voluntary on his part, and without solicitation of the sóns-in-law (and there is here no evidence of such solicitation), would not of itself convert that which was thus advanced into debts (<a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20141" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Whart. 141">4 Wharton 141</a>); such advances would rather stand as gifts, to be accounted for or not, as the donor should direct, and in such manner as should be specified by him. Where there is no promise to pay, express or implied, how could the relation of debtor and creditor be estab<a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>listed in the sense in which the auditor holds that it existed between Mr. Nevins and Joseph R. Fry ?</p>

      <em>“ </em>The testator does not say that these advances shall be treated as debts, so as to carry with them the ordinary incidents of a debt, but says, ‘ the husbands who shall be <em>so </em>indebted.’ How indebted ? Evidently as he had provided for and designated in his will; who should have received from him such advances in money or property on account of the shares of his daughters.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.7",430,[294,746,1153,341]]]'>“ And these advances were not intended to be collected as debts from his sons-in-law, but were to stand as advances until the death of Mr. Nevins, when they were to be cancelled by deducting them from the shares of the estate to which the daughters would be entitled whose husbands should be so, or in this way, indebted to the testator. He evidently treated these moneys or properties given to the husbands of his daughters as advancements made to the daughters themselves.</p>

We, therefore, regard this as a direction to treat the advances as advancements made to the son or to the daughters through their husbands. Thompson’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20345" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Wright 345">6 Wright 345</a>, is a much stronger case against the view taken by the auditor than the one before us. The sum claimed to be a debt was charged to the son of the testator as debtor, and is twice stated in the account kept by the father as money, <em>and as money loaned. </em>This was held by the Supreme Court, upon the fact of intention, to be an advancement, and not a debt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b430-9" data-blocks='[["BL_430.9",430,[292,1646,1156,775]],["BL_431.1",431,[256,406,1154,1622]]]'>“ If we are right in our interpretation of the disputed clause of the will, two results follow: First, the sums of money charged to Joseph R. Fry, are to be treated as advancements made to Mrs. Fry, and because the testator so directed they are to be taken from her portion of the estate, but without interest; and second, a sale of stocks to the firm of which Joseph R. Fry was a member, which stand charged against the firm, and which is nowhere carried by Mr. Nevins to the individual account of J. R. Fry, is a mere debt of the firm, and cannot now be converted by the executors into a gift or loan, or advance; because a sale is not an advance, the testator not having directed it to be so treated, it remains a debt. And if a debt which grew out of a business transaction with the testator, which remained on that footing until his death, it does not belong to the designated advances which he directed should be deducted; for it is only the advances which he had or might make to his sons-in-law, and not their debts, which were to be taken from the share of his daughters. That a debt due by a husband cannot be deducted from the portion of a daughter is <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>clearly settled. Yundt’s Appeal, 1 Harris, is an authority in point. So also is Seagrist’s Appeal, 10 Harris 424. In this case the term <em>advanced </em>is held to be equivalent to advancement; the language of the will is, ‘ What I have given and advanced in my lifetime, to any of my children, shall be deducted from their respective sharesLevering <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20141" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="4 Whart. 141">4 Wharton 141</a>, supports the doctrine, that to convert an advance or gift to a child into a debt, such an intention must be made to appear. That if a father, without solicitation, gives to his son a sum of money, or pays a debt for him, it will be considered a gift or an advancement to the son. This was the case in Thompson’s Estate. The father had paid debts due by the son and charged them as money loaned. Looking therefore to the intention of the testator, as we understand it to be expressed in his will, we think it is clear that his purpose was to do no more than to secure the deduction from each share of whatever sums in money or property he may have made advances in his lifetime to his son or to his sons-in-law. In this sense the son or the sons-in-law are to be considered as indebted to him, and not in the sense in which the auditor interprets it. If the testator had no other purpose than this one in his mind when he gave the direction in his will which has given rise to this controversy, and we think none other can be gathered from it, with what justice can it <em>be </em>claimed that the indebtedness of the firm of J. R. &amp; H. B. Fry, growing out of transactions of purchase and sale of stock, upon part of which the testator made a profit of several thousand dollars, is to be regarded as an advance of stock to Joseph R. Fry, and as such to be deducted from Mrs. Fry’s share of her father’s estate ? We regard this as a debt due by Joseph R. Fry to the testator, and not as an advance made to him, and therefore not a proper or legal deduction from the sum due to Mrs. Fry. Bird’s Estate, 2 Parsons 168, is cited against this view, but there the father took the note of the son, which, though outlawed, the auditor held was, under a direction contained in the will, to be deducted from the son’s share for money advanced. It does not appear whether interest was charged or not. Berry <em>v. </em>Morse, 1 House of Lords Cases 70, seems to have been decided upon general principles, and not on a question of intention of the testator.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The charge of five per cent, commission is objected to as excessive. The entire estate passed into the hands of the executors in the shape of interest-paying investments in stocks, &amp;c. There was no change or conversion of assets; nothing required to be collected by suit. The actual duty performed was simply to pay to the legatees their respective portions of the securities (amounting in all to $163,000) after having held them for only a little over two months. This was all of it. Stevenson’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20104" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Whart. 104">4 Wharton 104</a>; Pusey <em>v. </em>Clemson, 9 S. &amp; R. 204; Walker’s Estate, 9 S. <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>&amp; R. 223, settle the amount to be allowed in a case of this kind at three per cent.</p>

It was charged against her in the books of the testator, and by his express direction. This is in accordance with the declared purpose of Mr. Nevins to equalize the shares of his children. The intention is shown by the clause of the will above quoted, and regarded in this light we think he intended to charge it against her as a debt. The auditor regards it as contrary to equity to hold the executors responsible to Mrs. Fry, after distribution of the estate among the legatees, and the commissions between the executors. The answer to this is, that the distribution was their own act, to which they required Mrs. Fry to assent in writing, before they would make a division of the estate, and this before account filed or an opportunity afforded to any one to raise a question before the Orphans’ Court, as to the legality or propriety of the course adopted by them. Having insisted upon pursuing this course, and chosen to walk in it with their eyes open, to the manifest injury of the petitioner, they have no right to complain if they are held to the consequences of their acts.</p>
