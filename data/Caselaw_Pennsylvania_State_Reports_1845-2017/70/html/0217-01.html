We do not view this as material under what we hold to be the law governing the case. Sedgwick and Pollock were partners as retail grocers, or generally as grocers. With this they connected the buying of grain, and a general forwarding and commission business ; from this it will be seen that their partnership business was somewhat miscellaneous. In addition to this, Mr. Pollock informs us that he sometimes bought stock, cattle and hogs, but always on his own individual account, and after the purchase would allow his partner to take an interest or not, as he was inclined to.</p>

When the lumber was bought by Pollock, Sedgwick was not at home, and <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>when Pollock was about to sign the note with the firm, he says (and in this he is corroborated by others), that he expressed himself doubtful as to his right to sign the firm name. I understood Gillespie to say that he understood his doubt to be as to the contract and not as to the power to sign; and that he said he must have Sedgwick, as he understood him to be quite responsible. But there is no pretence that anything that was said there was communicated to Lewis before he took the note. Nor is there any evidence that Sedgwick took any occasion to warn the public against the negotiation of the note. But for the matter of that, we have no evidence that Sedgwick knew that his partner had made use of the firm-name, nothing except what might be inferred from the relations between him and Pollock, that the latter might or ought to have communicated the fact. We, however, charge you that what was said by Pollock at the signing of the note might have affected Gillespie and Newcomb; still, as we have no evidence that Lewis had any notice of the nature and limited character of the partnership between Sedgwick and Pollock, he will not be affected by it, and that as to him the signature of Sedgwick and Pollock made by Pollock, although the purchase of lumber was beyond the scope of the partnership, will be binding on Sedgwick. Such we understand as the settled law. If no partnership whatever had existed, the signature would have been simply forgery; but Pollock had authority to sign the name of the firm to various transactions, and if in this instance he transcended the power, the one who trusted him must bear the loss. It cannot be expected in every transaction and signature of firm names, every one who deals with them must go around and interrogate the several partners to ascertain whether their several assents have been given, or whether the transaction is strictly within the scope of the business of the organization.” * * *</p>
