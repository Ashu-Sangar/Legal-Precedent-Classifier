The engagement of the company set forth hy plaintiff is as carriers. We must presume after verdict that this was made out. What possible chance there would be for a suit for the same goods against the company as warehousemen, I do not see. The plaintiff would be estopped hy his allegation that the goods were lost on transit, and not in a warehouse. If it had been shown that the goods were lost by warehousing, then indeed the plaintiff’s <em>nan', </em>would not have been such as to enable him to recover, and it would have been the duty of the court to have charged against him for want of correspondence between his <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata. </em>There is nothing in this suggestion of the defendants in error.</p>
