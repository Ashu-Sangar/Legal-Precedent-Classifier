Zents, and if he said the bargain was as the article showed, he, the defendant, would have to perform ; but that $300 was returned to Dale to await the return of Zents, and it has never been made since, nor has it been kept up, and the money brought into court. Under this state of facts we instruct you that the plaintiff cannot recover.] By allowing the $300 to be defalked from plaintiff’s damage, so as to enable him to recover, he must both aver and prove performance or willingness to perform, or that he was prevented by the act or agreement of defendant.
