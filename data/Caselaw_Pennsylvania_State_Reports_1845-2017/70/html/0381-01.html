He argues that the enumeration of certain kinds in the act, as ‘ houses, lands, lots of ground, ground-rents, mills,’ &amp;c., was to designate precisely what the legislature intended by the preceding terms ‘ all real estate,’and that everything not embraced in this enumeration is excluded. But this view seems to overlook the very important language, before referred to, which follows the enumeration: <em>‘ </em>all <em>other </em>real estate.’</p>

      <em>“ </em>But suppose we adopt the plaintiff’s view — that the operation of the Act of 1844 is to be confined to the several descriptions of real estate enumerated; what then ? Does not the property here taxed fall within the enumeration ? The machinery in a mill is as much a part of it as are the <em>walls. </em>As the Supreme Court has said in Gray <em>v. </em>Holdship, 17 S. &amp; R. 413: ‘ the machinery, the wheels, stones, and even the bolting-cloths, are a part of the mill,’ and <em>therefore </em>a part of the real estate.</p>

But <em>is </em>the popular meaning otherwise ? When a man, of common intelligence and business experience, speaks of ‘ Mr. Patterson’s Mill,’ what does he mean ? The establishment in its completed condition — fitted for its proper use ? Or the bare walls ? (For there is no intermediate point; all between, from the engines to the spindles, is <em>machinery.) </em>He could hardly mean the latter; for tbe walls do not constitute a <em>mill, </em>and bear no more resemblance to it, than to a barn.</p>

The original act authorizing such liens, confined them to claims for work done and materials furnished about the erection of any ‘ <em>house </em>or other <em>building.’ </em>It was, therefore, contended that the engine in a saw-mill, the copper kettles and boiler in a brew-house, and the machinery in a manufactory, are not a part of the £ <em>building’ </em>— not so understood in common parlance — (and with greater reason, we think, than it is now contended that the machinery of a mill is not a part of a mill), and, therefore, that no lien could be filed by those who furnished these things, or did work upon them. But the Supreme Court decided otherwise; holding that everything necessary to perfect the establishment (mill, manufactory, &amp;c.), and fit it for the uses designed, <em>is a part of it, </em>and falls, therefore, within the term £ building Gray <em>v. </em>Holdship, 17 S. &amp; R. 413; Wademan <em>v. </em>Thorp, <a href="/watts/5/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts 115" data-case-ids="1843996" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0115-01">5 Watts 115</a>; Morgan <em>v. </em>Arthurs &amp; Co., <a href="/watts/3/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts 140" data-case-ids="1841275" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0140-01">3 Watts 140</a>.</p>

Many of our tax laws, however, operate unequally; and it is difficult, if not impossible, to avoid it. As the Supreme Court has said in Philada. Saving Fund <em>v. </em>Yard, 9 Barr 359, some property is twice taxed — as in cases of ground-rents (the ground and also the rent issuing out of it being taxed); and land purchased on credit (the land and the money borrowed, or mortgage given, to pay for it, both being assessed). One man owning $50,000 invests it <em>on </em>real estate, at interest, and pays no tax; another owning but $1000, invests it <em>in </em>real estate, and <em>he </em>is taxed. Two men invest their means in lumber; as such it is not taxable. But one of them annexes his to his freehold — and it matters not how; he need not change its form, bore a hole or drive a nail — and immediately it becomes real estate, and liable to taxation: while the other may employ his about his business, hire it, <em>erect it into buildings </em>as a tenant, or use it in any way he sees fit (so that he do not annex it to his freehold), and it will remain personal, and exempt. And these latter instances are very similar to the case before us. While the property —the money and lumber — retains its original character it is exempt; when converted into real estate it is taxed. And while the plaintiff's machinery retained its original character of personalty it was exempt; when annexed to the freehold, and thus converted into real estate, it is taxed. It might have gone into the mill as the property of a tenant; of one from whom it was hired; or of the owner of the mill, for some temporary purpose; and it would have remained personalty and exempt. But when placed there by the owner of the mill for the common purposes of the establishment and with a view to permanency, it at once became real estate; its individuality and distinctive character were <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>lost. Under every species of conveyance it will pass as a part of the mill. And the owner can with no more reason complain of the increase of his assessment on this account, than he could have done of the increase which occurred when he put his money into the land on which the building stands, or his lumber into the building itself.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[229,642,1171,1032]]]'>“ As further evidence that the legislature did not intend such a construction, we are pointed to the special Act of 1850, directing machinery to be assessed in Delaware county for school purposes; which act it is said was unnecessary if machinery was before taxed as real estate. We do not think there is much in this. It matters very little how the legislature of 1850 understood the Act of 1844. The Digest contains ample proof that the legislature not unfrequently acts in ignorance of the existing law. And we all know how much consideration is given to <em>special </em>acts, such as that of 1850. As it is said by the Governor in his last message: ‘Special bills are usually drawn by the member having them in charge, or by some one interested. By what is called courtesy it is considered a breach of etiquette for any other member to interfere with such bills. The result is that they are passed as originally prepared without examination,’ either as to the necessity or propriety of the legislation proposed. Still there was something for the Act of 1850 to operate upon without adopting the plaintiff’s view of that of 1844. There is machinery in Delaware county, and doubtless a large amount, in the possession of <em>tenants </em>and others, not taxable as real estate. And it is quite probable that it was such machinery that the Act of 1850 was intended to cover. Its terms are general, but they cannot properly be regarded as embracing machinery which has lost its distinctive character by being converted into real estate.</p>

If what he denominates <em>machinery </em>is to be cast out in the assessment of mills, what is to be included ? Simply the bare walls ? That would hardly be claimed. But where else could we draw the line ? According to the old rule by which it was sought to distinguish between real and personal <em>property </em>— physical <em>annexation? </em>That has been found <em>impracticable, </em>no rule at all, and has, therefore, long since been abandoned. Ch. J. Gibson, in Voorhis <em>v. </em>Freeman, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 116" data-case-ids="1853586" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0116-01">2 W. &amp; S. 116</a>, says: ‘ The criterion of physical annexation is so limited in its range and so productive of contradictions, even in regard to fixtures in dwelling-houses, to which it was adopted before England had become a manufacturing country, that it will answer for nothing else. The courts will be drawn away from it by its narrowness and want of adaptation to the business and improvements of the age. From the force of habit they have adhered to it after it has ceased to be a guide; for nothing but a passive regard for old notions could have led them to treat machinery <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>as personal property when it was palpably an integrant part of a manufactory or mill, merely because it might be unscrewed or unstrapped, taken to pieces and removed, without injury to the building. It would be difficult to point out any kind of machinery, however complete in its character, or by what means held in its place, which might not with care and trouble be taken to pieces and removed in the same way; and the greater or less facility with which it might be done would be too vague a thing to serve as a test. It would allow the stones, hoppers, meal-chests, and running gear of a grist-mill, and the hammers and bellows of a forge, and parts of other buildings used for manufacturing purposes, to be put into the class of personal property. If physical annexation is the criterion the <em>slightest taelc or ligament </em>should constitute it, else if we get away from it ever so little, we shall have no criterion at all. There are so many fashions, methods and means of it, and so many degrees of connection between material substances that there is nothing about which men would more readily disagree than whether a thing held by a band or cleat was permanently annexed.’ And thus was the rule of <em>physical annexation </em>(as is said in Meigs’s Appeal, 12 P. F. Smith 28) exploded and abandoned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[326,1260,1168,517]]]'>“ Now did the legislature intend that the assessors should go back and attempt an application of this abandoned rule, which the courts had found to be, and had pronounced, impossible of application ? We presume not. And if not (and the machinery is to be excluded, as the plaintiff urges), it must have intended that the assessors should confine themselves to the bare walls. There is no middle ground; for, as already observed, from the engines and wheels up to the smallest necessary article, all must be pronounced machinery, if any part is. There is no other place — no point between the walls and the complete equipped mill (as painful experience has demonstrated), at which a line <em>can </em>be drawn designating where the <em>mill ends </em>and the <em>machinery commences.</em>
