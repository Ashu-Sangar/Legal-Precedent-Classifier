R. McAboy to recover the sum of $500, which Mrs. Johns alleged the defendant had promised to pay her for executing a deed conveying to H. L. Bollman land belonging to her husband. The cause was tried May 10th 1869, before Sterrett, P. J.</p>

The deed was prepared and executed by the husband about February 1868; Mrs. Johns was then asked to sign the deed; she refused to do so unless the defendant would pay her $500. After some <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>negotiation the defendant prepared, signed and delivered to Mrs. Johns an agreement as follows:—</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b10-10" data-blocks='[["BL_10.10",10,[320,902,1154,773]]]'>Mrs. Johns gave evidence that the defendant promised to pay hsr $500 if she would sign the deed; that she could not read the paper; it was not read nor explained to her; that the defendant misrepresented to her its contents, leading her to believe that it contained a promise to pay the $500, and that she would receive the money upon presenting the paper; that he frequently afterwards recognised his obligation to pay her the $500, and promised to pay her. She gave evidence also that in the next summer she consulted counsel in the matter, who told her what the paper was, and that it was of no value to her; she then took it to the plaintiff and left it with him, telling him that he had deceived her, and that it was not what she had expected to receive; he said he could not do anything more or better. The defendant gave evidence in contradiction of the plaintiff’s evidence — that the paper contained the terms of the agreement with Mrs. Johns, and that it had been read and explained to her before she executed the deed; he gave evidence also to show that her husband was very much in debt, and in failing circumstances.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b10-13" data-blocks='[["BL_10.13",10,[321,2103,1153,257]]]'>Answer : “ This point is refused: the law is the reverse of this.
