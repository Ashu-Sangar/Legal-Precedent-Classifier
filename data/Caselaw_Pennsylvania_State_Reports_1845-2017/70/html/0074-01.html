Hartupee gave an order on Caldwell in favor of Cuthbert; on presentation Caldwell, refused to pay Cuthbert, saying he would pay Hartupee’s debt to his firm from what he was entitled to under the mortgage. At the trial Caldwell’s partner consented that the firm’s claim might be set off to Hartupee’s claim against Caldwell. Held, that the order was an equitable assignment to Cuthbert, and he might recover from Caldwell.</p>
