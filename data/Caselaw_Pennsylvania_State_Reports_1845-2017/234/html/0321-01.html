His principal business is the buying and selling of potatoes. During the years 1900 to 1905 inclusive, he purchased on the eastern shore of Maryland some 800 cars of Irish and sweet potatoes, all of which were consigned to him at the Pennsylvania Lines produce yards at Pittsburgh. The shipments were from thirty-two stations on the N. Y. P. &amp; N. R. R. Co., coming into Pittsburgh over the lines of the defendant. The defendant had in force a tariff duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission fixing the rates on potatoes, applicable to territory including the eastern shore, in part as follows: “The following estimated weights will apply in cars where actual scale weights cannot be ascertained.... Potatoes, white or sweet (in barrels) when it is practicable for agents to weigh same, will be charged at actual weight; but when it is not practical to weigh same, the following estimated weights will govern: Sweet potatoes, — when shipped in common or truck barrels, per bbl., 170 pounds.

In February, 1906, the plaintiff brought suit to recover the difference between the freight paid, based on estimated weights, and that which he claimed should have been collected based on the actual weights; alleging that it had been practicable to weigh the shipments, and that he had continued to pay because he was kept in ignorance, by fraud and misrepresentation, of the fact that the freight was charged on estimated weights. Subsequently he twice amended his statement, and averred his bills of lading and that he was coerced into paying the freight. It was specially admitted in the court below by counsel for the defendant that, “The charges were made on estimated weights and not on actual weights,” and that, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover under the evidence, the amount claimed by Ms counsel at trial was correct and would not be questioned.</p>

It is claimed by the plaintiff that it was entirely practicable to weigh those potatoes. The defendant maintained it was not practicable.” (b) “The plaintiff claims to have shown you that at a great many of those stations there were scales that could have been used, that it was practicable to use those scales at the points of shipment in order to ascertain the actual weight of the potatoes, and that the company should have done so and should have charged, as provided by the Inter-state Commerce Commission, for the actual weight instead of what was <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>shown to be the estimated weight. They claim that if it was not practicable to weigh the potatoes at all of the stations, yet they passed through a number where it was entirely practicable to do so, and that it was the duty of the defendant company and especially incumbent upon them, if they could not have them weighed at the other points, to weigh them here in Pittsburgh, where the freight was payable by the plaintiff, and where it is claimed they have the facilities for weighing the potatoes. It was claimed they could readily have done this, and thus have determined the amount of freight to be paid by the plaintiff according to the actual weight of those potatoes. Now that is the question. Could they have done that at any of these points? Was it practicable for them to weigh these potatoes? Has the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff satisfied you by its weight that it was practicable, if so, the plaintiff is entitled to recover.” (c) “Now that is the question. Could they have done that at any of these points? Was it practicable for them to weigh these potatoes? Has the testimony on behalf of the plaintiff satisfied you by its weight that it was practicable, if so, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. If he has failed in that respect, the burden being upon him, your verdict must be for the defendant. The defence claim he has failed, and has thought it unnecessary to offer any evidence, claiming the plaintiff has not made out his case. In other words, the plaintiff has not shown you by the preponderance of evidence, that it was practicable to weigh these potatoes. That is the question for you to determine, and if you determine that in favor of the plaintiff you allow him the amount of his claim, and if he has not done so, your verdict must be for the defendant company.”</p>

The official tariff stipulated that when it was “practicable” for agents to weigh potatoes they should be charged for át actual weight, but when it was not “pracr tical to weigh the same,” then estimated weights according to the schedule were to govern; and that, “estimated weights will apply in cases where actual scale weights cannot be ascertained.” The significant words used are thus defined in Webster’s New International Dictionary: “Practicable, that that may be practiced or performed; capable of being put into practice, done or accomplished; feasible. Practical, syn. — see practicable.” The bill of lading and the printed tariff taken together indicate that these words were used in their ordinary sense; they did not require any particular or elaborate construction on the part of the trial judge. He left it to the jury to say under the evidence whether the company could have accomplished the taking of the actual weight of the potatoes, — whether it <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>was feasible for them to have ascertained their actual weight. The uncontradicted evidence showed that there were hand scales at the various stations of original shipment which had a capacity of 500 pounds, and that barrels of potatoes were at times actually weighed upon such scales; that at several points between those stations and the place of delivery there were track-scales capable of weighing carloads of potatoes, where such work was actually done; and that Pittsburgh, the terminal point, had track scales in the produce yard upon which the actual weight could have been taken.</p>

This being so, it seems reasonable to assume that they could get the actual weight to almost as great a degree of certainty by weighing a number of barrels on hand-scales at the original point of shipment and accepting the average. However this may be, we are not convinced that, under the documentary evidence, the court was wrong in submitting all of the opportunities for weighing the potatoes to the jury, for, had the defendant company desired, it could have written into its schedule and contract the stipulation that unless track scales existed at the original point of shipment potatoes should be charged for according to estimated and not actual weights.</p>

The cards themselves were the best evidence, and if the plaintiff desired to rely upon them to any extent he should have given notice to produce. But since there was ample other uncontradicted testimony to sustain a finding that it would have been practicable to weigh the potatoes, we feel that the-mistake can be treated as harmless error, and for that reason the <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>plaintiff should not be forced to a new trial. Nor, under all the circumstances, are we inclined to reverse because of the incident called to our attention in the 14th assignment. While the trial judge should at least have stricken the objectionable answer from the record and warned the jury to disregard it, yet since counsel for the appellant rested upon his exception to the refusal to withdraw a juror and continue the cause, and made, no request of the court to warn the jury to disregard the answer, we think it is probable that all parties felt that no material harm had been done. The defendant introduced no testimony; therefore, it was unnecessary for the trial judge to refer to the “weight” and “preponderance” of the evidence, but no possible harm could have been done thereby.</p>

After considering in detail each of the matters called to our attention we are not convinced of reversible error; the assignments are all overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>
