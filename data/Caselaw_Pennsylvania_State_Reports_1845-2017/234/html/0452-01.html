A printed regulation in a deposit book issued by a bank that the deposit could only be withdrawn upon four months’ notice, does not constitute a contract that under any and all circumstances the deposit would be paid back upon four months notice. Thus the bank may show that when the deposit was made and accepted there was a contemporaneous agreement that the depositor would leave the whole of the deposit remain in the bank until the note of a corporation of which he was president was paid in full. If in an action to recover such deposit after four months notice, the bank shows by the clear, precise and indubitable evidence of two witnesses that such a contemporaneous agreement was made at the time of the deposit, a verdict and judgment for the bank will be sustained.</p>

There was sufficient consideration to support the depositor’s promise, and the oral agreement was not within the statute of frauds; nor was the agreement void because of uncertainty in its terms. The note was for a fixed period, and the agreement was that the deposit should remain until the note was paid in full.</p>

Whereupon the plaintiff brought this suit in assumpsit.</p>

The trial judge charged, “If the defendant has satisfied you by clear, precise and indubitable evidence, not by one witness only, but by two witnesses or more, that the plaintiff, when he made the deposit, agreed that <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>it should remain in that bank until the note of the Pennsylvania Bed Company was paid, then you should find a verdict for the defendant. * * * If, on the other hand, you are satisfied the plaintiff did not make any such contract, or if the defendant has not satisfied you by the measure of proof which I have given you, then you should find a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.” The verdict was for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b484-5" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[310,819,1144,1012]]]'>The plaintiff has appealed and contends that where a pass book is issued showing a deposit and containing regulations as to withdrawals, it cannot be proved “by parol evidence that such deposit was not to be withdrawn in accordance with such rules,” nor can it be shown that the deposit “was not to be withdrawn until the note of a third person was paid;” that such proofs would not “constitute a defense to an action brought for such deposit after due notice of withdrawal;” that such a parol agreement would be “a violation of the Statute of Frauds;” and that it would not “constitute such deposit collateral for such note;” further, that the alleged parol agreement in this case had no sufficient consideration to support it, and was too indefinite and uncertain to be enforced. The appellant also questions the admissibility of certain evidence introduced by the defendant showing that the plaintiff was “a creditor of such third person,” that fact not being “averred in the affidavit of defense.”</p>

The rule in question was for the benefit of the defendant company, so that money could not be withdrawn in less than the stipulated time; it would not prevent or defeat any special agreement to the effect that a given deposit should remain beyond that time; particularly is this so, in a case like the present, where the deposit was made and accepted upon a contemporaneous agreement not to <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>withdraw it until' the note was paid. We say it was made and accepted upon these terms, for the testimony is that the plaintiff’s first offer was refused, and the deposit was only accepted upon his second offer, which was to allow the amount to remain until the note was paid in full; this undoubtedly was what induced the defendant to renew the note, and in that sense was part of the contract of deposit. The evidence upon this point was given by a number of witnesses whose testimony was in accord.</p>

Accordingly it has been held that such consideration may consist * * * of * * * an extension of time for the payment of a debt * * * without any new consideration”: 31 Cyc. 795-6; Downing v.

In this case the plaintiff induced the defendant to withdraw its demand for the immediate payment of the Bed Company’s loan, to extend the time three months, to forbear and waive its right to enter suit and <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>secure a judgment during that time,' and to accept a renewal note; all of which involved trouble and operated to the prejudice of the defendant if not to the benefit of the plaintiff. The Bed Company was financially embarrassed; on January 30, 1908, at the instance of the plaintiff a receiver was appointed, and when its affairs were wound up the total balance for distribution among creditors was but $290.59. Under all the circumstances we feel that the deposit was in the nature of a pledge of collateral; that there was sufficient consideration to support the plaintiff’s promise and that it was not within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
    <p id="b486-4" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[282,1030,1147,1120]]]'>We cannot view the contract as void because of uncertainty in its terms. The renewal note was for a fixed period of three months, and the plaintiff definitely agreed that the deposit should remain with the defendant until the note was paid in full. The appellee contends that “there was no necessity that the contract contain terms stipulating the method of the foreclosure of the subject matter of the pledge. Equity has jurisdiction of causes of this character; and, upon a bill filed for that purpose, a proper decree will be entered, fully foreclosing the pledge, and adjudicating the rights of the parties.” We are not now called upon to decide whether this remedy is open; nor shall we discuss that point until it is properly before us and we have had the benefit of argument thereon. The established facts, fixed by the verdict, that the plaintiff contracted to leave his $10,000 with the defendant until the note of the Bed Company was paid, and that such note had not been paid, were sufficient to prevent a recovery in the present action; and in this connection that is all we determine.</p>
