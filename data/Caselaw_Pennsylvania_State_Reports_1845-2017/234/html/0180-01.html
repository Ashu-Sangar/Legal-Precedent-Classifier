The defendant claimed under a parol gift from Peter Learn made in 1880 or 1881 followed by possession and valuable improvements made. The plaintiff proved its title by deed and rested. The defendant produced testimony that his father, Peter Learn, had the land surveyed and gave it to him, saying, “to go and rid it up and put his buildings on it, it was his,” and “go on and farm it; it is yours, but give me one-third of the grain.” Prior to this Peter Learn had taken the timber brush and logs off a considerable part of the land, but the stumps had not been removed; and he said to his son, “I give it to you, but you clear it out....” The son took possession, built a house, took out the stumps, improved the land, and has lived continuously upon the premises with his family ever since. For the greater part of the time the land was assessed in his name, and he paid the taxes upon it. The change of assessment was made at the request of Peter Learn who told the tax assessor that his son owned the land. Peter Learn had also made gifts of about the like number of acres to other of his sons, and the defendant produced a witness who testified that Peter had said to him “that the other boys had to go into the woods and clear it. Elias was to give him one-third because part of his was clear before he went on.” And, “He said Elias owned it (meaning the land).” And further, “That Elias was to farm the land to suit himself as it was his own.” To another witness Peter said that “He expected one-third of the grain that Elias raised because he had cleared part of the land for him.” A host of witnesses <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>were produced who gave testimony of declarations made to them by Peter Learn that the farm belonged to Elias as his own property, and that Elias was giving him one-third of the grain for the work that he Peter had done in clearing the land. When Elias desired to make improvements upon the property, he said to his father, “My wife has money and I could get the money from her, but we have no deed for this property and she don’t like to use her money;” to which Peter replied, “Do you think that I would give you a piece of land and turn around and take it from you? It is yours. Tell her to use her money.” Other witnesses testified that in their presence Peter had said to Mrs. Learn to go ahead and put her money in the land; that it was Elias’s property. In 1902 Peter Learn said to the agent of the parties to whom he subsequently sold the coal, referring to the land under which it lay, “At one time I owned all this; I gave them to the boys.” And he then pointed out the various tracts and showed where the several boys lived. The agent, who was upon the land for the purpose of renewing an option which his principals afterwards took up, asked Peter how he could lease the coal under such circumstances, and Peter replied, “When I gave them this land there was nothing thought or said about the coal; we did not know anything about coal then.” Testimony was produced to show that Elias always and repeatedly referred to the land as his own, that it was generally known throughout the district as his property, and that before the purchaser paid for the coal Elias had notified it not to do so because his father did not have the right to sell. The plaintiff produced witnesses to rebut parts of this testimony, but the only evidence which attacked the exclusive possession of Elias was the fact that the father usually went upon the land each year at threshing time and received his one-third of the grain, together with the tax records showing that no land was assessed to Elias until the year 1892.</p>

      <em>Errors assigned: </em>(1) refusal to direct verdict fpr the plaintiff; (2) refusal of judgment non obstante veredicto for the plaintiff; (3) a portion of the charge stating the elements necessary to a verdict for the defendant, in which the term “exclusive possession” was not used; (4) part of the charge in which the trial judge told the jury they were to decide in what capacity defendant occupied the land, whether as tenant or owner, and that if he occupied it as a tenant the verdict would have to be for the plaintiff; that the plaintiff contended the delivery of one-third of the grain by Elias to his father “was an acknowledgment that he was there only as a tenant and that the father still exercised control over that property, and that of itself should be sufficient to find that the defendant was not there claiming it absolutely as his own;” adding, “this is replied to by the defendant saying that in as much as a certain amount of clearing had been done upon this farm, that in order to even him up with the rest, he should make some return____he was not bound to make any specific return, but nevertheless one-tldrd of the grain that he raised upon that place should be given to his father in payment of the amount he was relieved from clearing-on that property;” after which the court said, “You will be required to find that fact so that you may have the entire matter before you.” (5) Part of charge making reference to the testimony concerning the assurance given by Peter Learn to Mrs. Elias Learn that she could safely put her money in the property, and adding, “that is argued by the defendant as convincing, and from what they say you will have no difficulty in finding that Peter Learn did give absolutely, this property to Elias.” (6) Part of charge in reference to the testimony as to tax assessments in which the court calls attention to the fact that 53 acres were transferred in 1895 from the <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>name of Peter Learn to that of Elias Learn. (7) Refusal to instruct that if Peter after the date of the alleged gift required a share of the proceeds of the land and Elias complied, “this shows that Peter Learn still retained control over the land and that he had not made an absolute gift,” adding, “If the jury find, therefore, that the payment of rent was imposed on Elias after the gift or after he took possession, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.” (8) Refusal to instruct that “the Statuté of Limitations would not run in favor of Elias so long as he paid any of the proceeds of the farm to Peter Learn.” And answering, “The answer to this point depends upon the finding of fact.” (9-10-11 and 12) The affirmance of certain points submitted by the defendant in which the word “possession” is used without the word “exclusive” in connection therewith. (13) The affirmance of a point of defendant, “Time is a powerful factor in cases of parol gift or sale of land. Equity is loath to undo a gift or contract for one who has failed to move for its rescission until passing years have grafted new equities upon the transaction, until the donee is grown old, spent the vigor of his age in the use and improvement of a property long regarded as his own;” the answer being, “This point is affirmed. It is the language of the Supreme Court in Sower v. Weaver, <a href="/pa/84/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="84 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1053560" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0262-01">84 Pa. 262</a>.” (14) The admission of testimony as to the general reputation in the community concerning ownership of the property.

    <p id="b216-5" data-blocks='[["BL_216.5",216,[295,1252,1146,741]]]'>The fifth assignment fails to quote all that was said by the court in connection with the instruction complained of therein. If the language employed is taken with its context, it is not likely that the jury could have understood it as a direction to find the particular fact referred to in favor of the defendant; it is more probable they understood that the court merely meant to call their attention to the fact that the defendant argued that they should have no difficulty in finding that Peter Learn made an absolute gift of the land to Elias. While this portion of the charge was not as nicely phrased as it might have been, we are not convinced that the plaintiff suffered any harm therefrom, and the assignment is overruled.</p>
    <p id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.6",216,[286,2012,1151,372]]]'>; We see no error in the sixth assignment. All the cases hold that the payment of taxes is an element in the proof of possession under a claim of title, and if the plaintiff desired the court to call attention to the fact that the land was assessed to Peter Learn prior to the date mentioned in the instruction, it should have so requested. The assignment is overruled.</p>

Whether or not the one-third of the grain was a rent depended upon the facts. It nowhere appeared in the evidence that Peter Learn had ever so designated it, and all his declarations were inconsistent with such an idea. As before indicated, that issue was for the jury and was properly submitted. This assignment is overruled.</p>
    <p id="b217-3" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[185,858,1146,316]]]'>The eighth assignment criticises the answer made by the trial judge to the effect that the running of the Statute of Limitations in favor of the defendant depended upon how they might find the fact as to whether or not Elias paid rent. We see no error in this, and the assignment is overruled.</p>

    <p id="b217-6" data-blocks='[["BL_217.7",217,[180,1568,1145,798]]]'>The testimony quoted in the next two assignments, concerning declarations by the defendant and others, was properly admitted. As to the admission of such testimony, we have said, “His (the occupant’s) own declarations while in possession of the premises as well as the understanding of his neighbors, was proper evidence of the character of his claim:" Kennedy v. Wible, 11 Atl. Repr. 98. “Such declarations accompanying his acts, constitute part of the res gestas, and as such are always received in evidence in questions of possession:" Potts v. Everhart, <a href="/pa/26/0493-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="26 Pa. 493" data-case-ids="977277" data-case-paths="/pa/26/0493-01">26 Pa. 493</a>. “The character of possession of a party as stated by himself while in possession is part of the res gestee”: Susquehanna &amp; Wyoming Valley R. R. &amp; Coal Co. v. Quick, <a href="/pa/68/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="68 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1024534" data-case-paths="/pa/68/0189-01">68 Pa. 189</a>.

    <p id="b217-7" data-blocks='[["BL_217.8",217,[228,2385,1097,42]],["BL_218.1",218,[290,368,1149,1945]]]'>Before concluding we note that it is not clear how <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>much of the testimony of the defendant was intended to be stricken from the record; but we do not take it that the first part covering the language and the time of the gift was affected by the order of the court. However that may be, whether the bargain to pay the one-third of the grain to his father was made at the time of the gift or later on, would not necessarily fix the nature of the obligation. It might have been made after the defendant went into possession, independently of the gift, out of appreciation of the services performed by his father in clearing the property, without of necessity being a rent or acknowledgment of Peter Learn’s continued control over the land; or it might have been a unilateral contract made at the time of the gift, and yet not be a rent or in the nature thereof. The repeated declarations of Peter Learn to the effect that he had given the land to his son, and as to the arrangement for the delivery of the grain, made when the parties'were face to face, accompanied by the act of the assessment of the land to the defendant by the direction of his father, constituted strong evidence of a gift: Sower v. Weaver, <a href="/pa/84/0262-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="84 Pa. 262" data-case-ids="1053560" data-case-paths="/pa/84/0262-01">84 Pa. 262</a>, 269; Matthews v.

Superior Ct. 381</a>; Caldwell v. Caldwell, <a href="/pa-super/24/0230-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="24 Pa. Super. 230" data-case-ids="849783" data-case-paths="/pa-super/24/0230-01">24 Pa. Superior Ct. 230</a>. It may also be well to note that the equities of this case are with the defendant. He was not only in actual possession of the land, which was enough to put the purchasers of the coal upon inquiry as to his title (Hottenstein v. Lerch, <a href="/pa/104/0454-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="104 Pa. 454" data-case-ids="452137" data-case-paths="/pa/104/0454-01">104 Pa. 454</a>; Rowe v. Ream, <a href="/pa/105/0543-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="105 Pa. 543" data-case-ids="454307" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0543-01">105 Pa., 543</a>; White v.

After reading the testimony and reviewing the entire record, we feel that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict and that no reversible error was committed in the trial.</p>
