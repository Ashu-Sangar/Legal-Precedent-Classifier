    <p id="b461-10" data-blocks='[["BL_461.20",461,[162,1620,1145,700]]]'>An application to open a judgment entered on a warrant of attorney is addressed to the equitable powers of the court and on appeal the question is whether there has been a proper exercise of judicial discretion. The cases are rare where there have been reversals of the findings of a judge sitting as a chancellor, because his opportunity to reach a correct conclusion from conflicting testimony, when the character and knowledge of the witness are involved is much better than ours on appeal. An apparent preponderance of testimony against a finding is not sufficient to lead to a reversal, when there is testimony, which if believed, will sustain it. Steinmeyer v. Siebert, <a href="/pa/190/0471-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="190 Pa. 471" data-case-ids="905149" data-case-paths="/pa/190/0471-01">190 Pa. 471</a>.</p>

A mere conflict of testimony is not sufficient to entitle the defendant to a trial, but when the genuineness of the writing is in dispute, and the issue is that of forgery, the writing is not of weight. Its execution is the subject of inquiry, and there is no presumption arising from the writing itself to overcome. While the measure of proof required cannot be defined by rule, it may be said generally, that where a defendant has testified that a writing is a forgery, he is entitled to go to a jury, although the counter proof is of equal force. The burden of establishing the genuineness of a disputed paper is on the party offering it. Schomaker v. Dean, <a href="/pa/201/0439-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="201 Pa. 439" data-case-ids="925595" data-case-paths="/pa/201/0439-01">201 Pa. 439</a>; Kaier Co. v.
