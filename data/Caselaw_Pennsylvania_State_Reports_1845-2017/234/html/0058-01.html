At this point there is no crossing of any character, the nearest one being approximately 300 feet east of the place of the accident, while there is another distant about one-quarter of a mile west. The tracks are below the grade of the public highway, and to reach the tracks from the home of the insured it was necessary to cross the public road and descend a bank about four feet in height.</p>

Mr. Kennedy, the engineer operating the passenger train, testified that he first saw Wilcox at a point distant about fifteen feet, and added, “The young man came down from the side of the public road and started or attempted to cross the track in front of the engine.

I called him to stop, but he did not hesitate a second. He just came down on to the track, and I called to him again to look out, for I heard this train coming. ...

But when his business or other necessities call him on the railroad track or crossing for lawful purposes, and when he is injured while in the pursuit of his lawful calling; or when it becomes necessary to use the roadbed for a lawful purpose, and he should be accidentally killed, without any knowledge upon his part of the danger, he ought not in such case be excluded from recovery, if- there was nothing else in the case.” The instructions were approved as substantially correct because in harmony with the ruling of the court, on the same clause, in Burkhard v.

Neither any business pursuit nor necessity of the occasion called him to make the crossing at that point. But it is contended, however, that the east-bound train was standing at or near the crossing and the insured undertook to cross behind the train, apparently thinking this the safer place, the prudent thing to do. The evidence does not show that the accommodation train obstructed the crossing or made passage over it dangerous. It was the shorter route to the home of his friend and avoided a walk for a distance of about 300 feet, and a return of about the same distance.</p>

    <p id="b93-3" data-blocks='[["BL_93.4",93,[162,526,1151,641]]]'>As appears -from the uncontradicted testimony, from the place where the insured was about to descend the embankment, prior to going upon the tracks, he had an unobstructed view of the train which struck him, and had he looked and listened must have seen and heard it. Hence we must conclude that when he was at the top of the bank, at the side of the public road, the train was in full view, and yet he neither stopped nor looked nor listened but went forward negligently into a position of obvious danger: Marland v.

    <p id="b93-4" data-blocks='[["BL_93.5",93,[160,1175,1150,633]]]'>It is argued by the counsel for appellant, that where a case depends on oral testimony, it must be submitted to the jury, even if uncontradicted, citing Lehigh Coal &amp; Nav. Co. v. Evans, <a href="/pa/176/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="176 Pa. 28" data-case-ids="882173" data-case-paths="/pa/176/0028-01">176 Pa. 28</a>. An examination of that case discloses that the only testimony submitted to the jury there was that of the plaintiff, and the jury evidently did not believe the same as they found a verdict for the defendant, and all that is decided there is that the jury are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses. It is consistent with and recognizes the rule to direct a verdict for the defendant where the plaintiff’s evidence if believed is insufficient to sustain his claim.</p>
