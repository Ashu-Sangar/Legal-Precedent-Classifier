It was incorporated about the year 1871 and began operations as a carrier soon after its incorporation. On August 25, 1905, the defendant acquired by lease the Pittsburg and Castle Shannon Railroad. Prior to the lease, the Pittsburg and Castle Shannon Railroad was always operated by steam power for its passenger and freight trains, and the defendant continued this method of operation until some time after the fifing of this bill. It has since then gradually changed its motive power, and at the present time the greater part of its passenger and freight cars are propelled by electricity. The width between the rails of the track in use was forty inches, and that track is still maintained and used by the defendant for carrying freight, principally coal. Additional rails have been laid on either side of the old track rails, the gauge of this additional track being the same as the gauge of the defendant’s street railway fines. The railroad extends from a point on East Carson street of the city of Pittsburg to a point in Scott township; the total length of the road does not exceed seven miles.</p>

Said Pittsburg Southern Railroad was subsequently abandoned and the tracks thereof removed, but the said branch of the Pittsburg and Castle Shannon Railroad has since 1883 been maintained and operated on Railroad street. At the time of the making of said lease from the Pittsburg and Castle Shannon Railroad Company to the Pittsburg Railways Company, said spur or' branch tracks upon Railroad street extended to within less than ten feet of the rails of the said Charleroi line, which occupies in passing through said plan substantially the same location as was occupied by the said Pittsburg Southern Railroad.</p>

It is not limited by the restrictions of the general railroad act. So far as the general powers given in its charter are concerned it looks to the act of its incorporation, not to the general acts. It therefore had a right to take a lease of the Castle Shannon Railroad and to operate it, although it was not connecting with its other lines. It has a right to connect the Charleroi line, a passenger railway leased to and operated by it, with the Castle Shannon, a railroad organized under the general railroad act. That is to say, it has the corporate power under its charter. As the lessee of the Castle Shannon it may lay its tracks wherever that company could, and the latter in laying out its plan of lots dedicated to the purchasers the streets shown upon the plan, subject to the easement of the railroad shown thereon. The lines of track were there connecting with those of the Pittsburg and Southern Railroad, and it appears that for some years they were so physically laid and connecting. The Castle Shannon had a right of way or easement to the point where its tracks have been recently laid, to the junction with the Charleroi line. If the adjoining ground is now a township road by reason of its having been worked by the township authorities, such adoption was subject to the right of way. The defendant is relaying and rehabilitating the portion of the track extending to a point about ten feet from the junction point, and the only question is as to its right to lay the intervening tracks and to operate its cars over it and to transport over it and the rest of the Castle Shannon lines the cars received from the Charleroi line. So far as the construction of the tracks is involved the defendant has gone no farther than its lessor could have done.</p>

XVII, of the constitution reads, “No street passenger railway shall be constructed within the limits of any city, borough or township without the consent of the local authorities.” This is intended as a safeguard to the rights of municipalities against the encroachments of companies organized to construct street railways in the first instance, and is a very wise provision, because it would be intolerable for municipalities to be invaded by a public service corporation of this character so closely connected with the everyday life of their people, without having anything to say about it: Erie v. Erie Traction Co., <a href="/pa/222/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="222 Pa. 43" data-case-ids="959459" data-case-paths="/pa/222/0043-01">222 Pa. 43</a>. The doubt was expressed, however, in that case whether the purpose was to protect against more than the construction and whether it included the operation. The Castle Shannon lines cannot be operated other than as a railroad. Heretofore the road has been operated by steam, but its proposed operation by electricity does not change its character: Howley v. Central Valley R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/213/0036-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="213 Pa. 36" data-case-ids="943448" data-case-paths="/pa/213/0036-01">213 Pa. 36</a>. When the defendant company receives cars on and transports them over the Castle Shannon road its power, as we have indicated, is that of a transporting company operating a railroad, not a street passenger railway. Probably it will not be possible for the observer to see any change in the manner of propulsion when the car leaves one fine for another, but we are examining the source of the corporate power and not the physical conditions. The railroad is now in the township. Its fine at one time extended over the whole of the route now traversed in the recent change. There is no evidence subject to warrant a conclusion that any of the line was abandoned. It is not seeking any further use of the highway than it already possesses. It is not seeking any new franchise <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>and, most important, it is the lessee of a railroad, not of a passenger railway.</p>
