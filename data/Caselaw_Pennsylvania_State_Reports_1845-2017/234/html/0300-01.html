    <p class="summary" id="b329-5" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[151,499,1148,808]]]'>The common source of title was that of Andrew Mulholland, the Plaintiff’s father. The statement of the case is practically this: Andrew Mulholland died intestate on the sixth day of September, 1884, leaving to survive him a widow, Margaret Mulholland, and one daughter, Mary E. George, the Plaintiff, whose husband is still living. The widow and daughter renounced their right to administer the estate, and administration was granted to strangers. The Administrators obtained proper authority to sell the lots in question at public sale for the payment of decedent’s debts, and they were purchased by the widow, on August 29th, 1885, and the deed to her was acknowledged by the Administrators in open Court on November 14th, 1885.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b329-6" data-blocks='[["BL_329.5",329,[150,1319,1149,1013]]]'>The widow and her daughter resided continuously in one of these houses from the death of Andrew Mulholland, on September 6th, 1884, down to March 12th, 1895, when the widow died. The widow devised the property in question to her Executors in trust for various purposes, among which was the payment to the Plaintiff of $20.00 per month during her natural life, and in addition thereto $100 ■ annually for clothing, with authority in their discretion to increase the amount of the monthly payments. The will likewise directs the Trustees to pay to decedent’s brother, Joseph Sawyer, $25.00 per month during his natural life. The will also provides that the whole estate shall go to any child or children of the Plaintiff surviving her, subject-to the provision made for the brother. In case of the death of the daughter without a child or children surviving, the testatrix provides for the disposition of her estate in a manner unnecessary here to relate.</p>

The Plaintiff’s answer to the allegation of estoppel is that she was under the disability of coverture, and the doctrine of estoppel or election does not apply to her.</p>

She not only received her own annuities without protest, but had full knowledge of the payment of an annuity to her uncle during the same period of time. For all these years she recognized her mother’s title to and ownership of the land in question, and this down to the time of bringing this action of ejectment. It also appears that her mother purchased the property for $2,350, subject to certain mortgages against the same, and that Plaintiff in no way endeavored to or did reimburse her mother in the purchase. There was an attempt on the part of the Plaintiff to show that her mother made certain declarations to the effect that the Plaintiff and her husband had contributed to the purchase of the property, but his evidence was so indefinite as not to be worthy of consideration. The Plaintiff saw her mother purchase this property at a public sale, and pay the purchase price; she saw her from the time of her purchase to the day of her death — some ten years— exercising every right of ownership over it; she saw her dispose of it by will, and she became a beneficiary thereunder, and enjoyed the fruits of that will for ten years. She enforced her rights as a legatee in and out of Court, down to the time of bringing this suit, having received $3,516.01, and now without proof of <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>reimbursement for money paid by ber mother on the purchase of the property, and without the slightest offer to return to the estate the amount of the legacy she has been regularly receiving for ten years under her mother’s will, she now claims the land as the heir at law of Andrew Mulholland, and that her unequivocal acts as legatee under her mother’s will are not binding upon her by reason of coverture.</p>
