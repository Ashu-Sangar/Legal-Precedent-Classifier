    <p class="summary" id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[318,482,1143,1620]]]'>The plaintiff, at the time of the injury of which he complains, was employed as a laborer by the Duquesne Brewery, whose plant was located on the south side of Mary Street between Twenty-first and Twenty-second streets, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The accident happened on November 26, 1906. On the 5th day of July, 1899, an ordinance was enacted by the City of Pittsburgh whereby said Brewery was granted the right to construct and maintain a switch along side Mary Street, to connect with the tracks of the defendant near Twenty-second street, for which it paid the city the sum of $75 per annum. The work of constructing this switch was done by the defendant, but the Duquesne Brewery paid for the same on December 5th, 1889. The switch was used exclusively by the Brewery for delivering material to it and shipping its product. The defendant had charge of the switch locks. When a car consigned to the Brewery arrived, the defendant shifted the car upon said switch to the required point in front of the Brewery, and when the car was ready for removal, the defendant ran its engine upon the switch and took the car away. According to the uncontradicted testimony, cars upon said switch were always loaded and unloaded by the employes of the Brewery — never by the employes of the defendant. The defendant had the right to take the car upon the switch, which had been consigned to the Brewery, and it had the right, upon notice, to go upon the switch and remove the car therefrom. It had no other rights upon the switch.</p>

The plaintiff was knocked down, rendered unconscious, and sustained terrible injuries. Why the engine and tender were run upon the switch was not explained. The evidence of the defendant’s negligence was clearly for the jury, and it was sufficient to sustain a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-3" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[153,825,1146,307]]]'>The defendant presented a request for binding instructions in its favor, which was refused. The ground of this request was that the plaintiff was in the situation of a co-employe of the defendant’s servants, by virtue of Section 1 of the Act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 58. Said Section reads as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-4" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[144,1154,1152,478]]]'>“That when a person shall sustain personal injury or loss of life while lawfully engaged on or about the roads, works, depots and premises of a railroad company, or in or about any car therein or thereon, of which company such person is not an employe, the right of action to recover in all such cases against the company shall be such only as would exist if such person were an employe: Provided, that this section shall not apply to passengers.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-5" data-blocks='[["BL_335.6",335,[144,1645,1148,257]]]'>Said Section of the Act of 1868 was repealed by the Act approved June 10, 1907, P. L. 522, but, as this accident happened before that date the first section of said statute was then in force; and its provisions govern.</p>

Therefore, the conclusion of the defendant is that the plaintiff cannot recover, because of <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>the provisions of said Act of 1868. It will be observed that the validity of this conclusion depends upon two propositions of the premises upon which it is based, viz:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b336-4" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[329,601,1142,141]]]'>1. The place where the plaintiff was injured was railroad or premises, within the meaning of the said statute.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b336-5" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[327,763,1142,97]]]'>2. At the time the plaintiff was injured, he was injured in railroad work.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b336-7" data-blocks='[["BL_336.7",336,[328,1038,1145,1020]]]'>“In the first the place of the accident is clearly and for general purposes the ‘roads, works, depots or premises’ of the railroad company. In such cases it is sufficient if the person injured is lawfully ‘engaged or employed on or about’ them, and is' not a passenger. * * * The other class is where the accident occurs in a place which is not exclusively and for general purposes, but only within a limited and statutory sense, the premises of the railroad company. In this class the nature of the employment at which the party injured was engaged at the time, becomes material. If it is business connected with the railroad in the sense that it is ordinarily the duty of railroad employees, then while the party is engaged at it the statute treats him as a quasi employee, and puts his rights upon the same basis.- If, however, the work has no relation to railroad work as such, and is connected with the railroad only by irrelevant and immaterial circumstances of locality, the case is not within the statute at all.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b336-9" data-blocks='[["BL_336.8",336,[332,2068,1141,312]]]'>It is not pretended that the place of the accident in this case was such as described in the first class, mentioned in the foregoing opinion. The switch was not within the exclusive control of the defendant. Was the switch railroad “works or premises,” as described in the second class mentioned in the said opinion?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b336-10" data-blocks='[["BL_336.9",336,[381,2394,1092,45]],["BL_337.1",337,[151,381,1151,1738]]]'>The switch was the property of the Duquesne Brew<a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>ery. True it was located upon a street of Pittsburgh; but the title of the Brewery is presumed to have extended to the middle line thereof, subject of course to the public easement. The Brewery had obtained municipal consent to lay the switch and had. paid for it. The defendant had the right to use the switch for the purpose of delivering loaded cars to the Brewery and for the purpose of removing cars after they were unloaded. This was the extent of its rights upon the switch. While the defendant was engaged in the performance of these duties, said switch was railroad works or premises within the meaning of the statute; but while it was not so engaged the switch was not railroad works or premises. When the defendant delivered the car, in which the plaintiff was working, to the Brewery upon said switch, its duty was ended. Its duty to remove the car had not begun, because no request to do so had been given. The fireman of the engine, which ran against the car in which the plaintiff was working, testified that the engine was neither going with cars for the Brewery, nor going for the purpose of removing cars. This testimony was not contradicted. Consequently, at the time of this accident, the switch and the car upon it were in the exclusive control of the Brewery and upon its premises. The defendant had no right to be there, and it was not there in the performance of any duty. We cannot, therefore, see how such switch, at the time of this accident, was in any sense railroad works or premises within the meaning of said statute. . If it was not, the provisions of the statute are not applicable: Christman v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/141/0604-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="141 Pa. 604" data-case-ids="974889" data-case-paths="/pa/141/0604-01">141 Pa. 604</a>; Keck v. R. R.

We thought, at the trial, that this was very doubtful and so we left the question to the jury. It was not “ordinarily” the work of railroad employes to load or to unload cars upon the switch in question. For six years prior to the acci<a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>dent that work had always been done by the Brewery’s employes, never by those of the defendant.

    <p class="summary" id="b338-4" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[307,596,1147,804]]]'>In that case, the plaintiff was employed by the Temple Iron Company to unload cars near its stock house. The railroad’s employes never unloaded such cars. The crew of the railroad came into the yard and shifted the cars, upon request of the Iron Company, but uncontrolled as to speed and manner of running. While boarding a car for the purpose of unloading it, another loaded car was sent in by the railroad against the car Avhich the plaintiff was attempting to board, and he Avas injured. The Supreme Court held that “The plaintiff was not an employe of the defendant or on the footing of one under the Act of April 4, 1868.” We can see no distinction between the facts of that case and the one at bar, with respect to the point under consideration : See also Spisak v. R. R. Co., <a href="/pa/152/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="152 Pa. 281" data-case-ids="838161" data-case-paths="/pa/152/0281-01">152 Pa. 281</a>.</p>

It is true the authorities cited by the defendant, do indicate that unloading cars, no matter where, is railroad work, but the authorities above cited, to our mind indicate the contrary. If, however, we are correct in our opinion that the place of this accident was not, at that time, the works or premises of the defendant, it is immaterial whether or not the plaintiff was engaged in performing railroad work. This being true, the rule for judgment, non obstante veredicto, must be discharged.</p>
