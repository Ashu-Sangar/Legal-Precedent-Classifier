After the death of the wife, appraisers chosen by his two daughters were to divide all of his estate “which there shall then be in two equal parts,” and allot one share to each daughter, which shares the daughters were to hold for life, subject, however, to coverture and spendthrift trusts, with power of appointment to their children, with remainder over in case of death without children to the survivor, for life, and in case of death of the survivor without children to the persons entitled under the intestate laws. Testator further provided that after his widow’s death either of the daughters might exercise the same power of sale as given to the widow “as to any of said property left to her share; and may in the same manner receive and dispose of the proceeds thereof.” The widow died without having sold the shares of stock. No division of the estate was made or demanded between the two daughters, and one .of the daughters died after the mother’s death without having exercised a power of sale. <em>Held, </em>that the executor of the deceased daughter took no title or interest in the shares of stock, inasmuch as the deceased daughter had no interest in them, but only in their proceeds, if she had chosen to exercise her option to sell.</p>

In that decree 444 shares of the Pittsburg <em>&amp; </em>Lake Erie Angeline Iron Company and 829 shares of stock in the Iron Mountain Mining Company were distributed to the Fidelity Title &amp; Trust Company, which had been appointed in the widow’s lifetime trustée to hold the estate. The petition alleges that one-half of this stock should have been distributed to Mrs. Byers’ executors, and prays that the decree be amended by so distributing them. In the will of Richard Hays, he gave to his wife, who survived him, and who died December 30, 1909, a life interest in his estate with power to sell and dispose of the proceeds of a specified portion of it, including these stocks, and in the eighth paragraph provided as follows:</p>

No demand was ever made by either of the daughters for a division of the estate. No allotment was made to them. Mrs. Byers died without exercising her power of sale, and the stocks were in the possession, at her death, of the trustee. They were part of testator’s estate which he had directed at his wife’s death should be divided into two equal parts and one allotted to each of his two daughters, and by the fourth clause of the will they only had a life estate in the parts to be allotted, subject to both coverture and spendthrift trusts. Each of them, however, had the option to take such of the stocks as should be allotted to them out of the trust by exercising the power of sale given to them in the eighth clause. It was necessary that an allotment should be made before the power could be exercised, and until made their interests in the stocks were joint, and neither of them could exercise the power until the interests were <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>severed, so that Mrs. Byers could not in her lifetime have exercised the power of sale. There is no gift of these stocks to the daughters. They only have a power of sale which when exercised vested the proceeds of the sale in them. As to the widow, that power was to be exercised by her in her lifetime, and it seems it was the testator’s intention to so hmit it as to his daughters. He says, “after her death, either of my said daughters may exercise the same as to any of the property allotted to her share, and may in the same manner receive and dispose of the proceeds thereof.” The widow could only sell and receive the proceeds during her lifetime, and as the word “manner” is one of large signification, Wells v. Bain, <a href="/pa/75/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="75 Pa. 39" data-case-ids="1036740" data-case-paths="/pa/75/0039-01">75 Pa. 39</a>, it seems the testator intended that if his daughters did not exercise the power of sale in their lifetime, that the stock should remain in and be part of the trust estate.</p>
