Jutte <em>&amp; </em>Co. is the owner of forty-one per cent, thereof, less four shares assigned to several persons to qualify them as directors. August 13, 1904, the complainant and C. Jutte &amp; Co. entered into a written contract whereby they agreed that a corporation should be formed under the laws of Louisiana, with a capital stock of $100,000, for which the complainant and his associates were to subscribe, and the object of which was to build docks at the mouth of Lake Borgue Canal, in order to handle and store coal for the purpose of coaling steamers, supplying bunker coal and loading cargo or bunker coal for export; that complainant was to transfer to said corporation a lease of certain property for its purposes; that O. Jutte &amp; Company was to loan the corporation $40,000 upon its notes to be secured by the stock, as soon as the complainant had obtained a contract for C. Jutte &amp; Co. to supply the Elder-Dempster Steamship Company with coal and had produced reasonable assurance in writing that C. Jutte &amp; Co. was to obtain like contracts from other lines; that the Dock Company was to handle no coal except that of C. Jutte &amp; Co., and all contracts were to be made in the latter’s name, and that the compensation of the Dock Company was to be all in excess of $2.85 per net ton, but it was not required to handle coal at a compensa<a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>tion of less than thirty cents per ton. Pursuant to said contract, a corporation of the State of Louisiana was formed and was named Mississippi River Coaling Company, with a capital stock of $100,000, which was subscribed by complainant and his associates. It was organized with a board of five directors. Complainant turned over to said corporation the lease, as he was required to do, for which he received $99,600 of said stock. He transferred to C. Jutte &amp; Co. $52,000 of said stock, obtained a contract with Elder-Dempster Steamship Co. and assurances from other companies, and in all respects fulfilled his obligations under the contract. C. Jutte &amp; Co. loaned the sum of $40,000 to the Dock Company and received the notes therefor and the collateral; and the coal tipple and docks were erected. Said George W. Thomas became president of the said Dock Company, his son, Albert G. Thomas, secretary and treasurer, and J. W. Friend a director. Complainant was also a director. Said George W. Thomas and James W.

Jutte &amp; Co., fraudulently failed to enforce said contract in favor of the Dock Company and against C. Jutte &amp; Co., and fraudulently violated the same for the benefit of C. Jutte &amp; Co.; that instead of selling coal through the Dock Company, C. Jutte &amp; Co. sold coal directly to said Steamship Companies and deprived the Dock Company of the large profits it would have made; that C. Jutte &amp; Co. neglected to obtain other large and valuable contracts for the benefit of the Dock Company, and that said officers and directors permitted the coal tipple of the Dock Company to become out of repair and allow washes to occur under its foundations, which could have been prevented at smalZ expense. It was also averred that, on January 31, 1907, C. Jutte &amp; Co. brought suit <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>against said Dock Company in the United States Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana and service was had upon Albert G.

Jutte &amp; Co. and against said Mississippi River Coaling Company in the sum of $70,-489.95, with interest on $65,163.89 from January 1, 1907; and that the said claim was “wrongfully and fraudulently excessive,” and was “inflated and so made excessive as one of the means of depriving the Coaling Company of its property.” Execution was afterwards issued on said judgment and the property of the Dock Company was sold to officers and directors of C. Jutte &amp; Co. for the sum of $18,000, it being of the value of at least $125,000.

Jutte &amp; Co., and had a larger and greater interest in said C. Jutte &amp; Co. than they had in said Coaling Company.”</p>

Railroad Co., <a href="/pa/195/0091-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="195 Pa. 91" data-case-ids="914038" data-case-paths="/pa/195/0091-01">195 Pa. 91</a>, 95, the plaintiff charged collusion on the part of the directors of a corporation, and we said, “The averments of collusion relied on by the plaintiff are that as the lessee is the owner of a majority of the shares of the lessor, the former elects and controls the acts of the officers of the latter. * * * * The defect of this charge is that it does not rest on any facts averred, but on an inference that by reason of the circumstances of their election, the directors will violate their duty and commit a breach of trust. There is no presumption that officers will commit a breach of trust; the charge should rest on some act, affirmative or permissive, manifestly in violation of duty, and manifestly the result of fraud and not of erroneous judgment.” Fraud is largely a conclusion of law, and all our cases agree that general allegations which do not set forth the particular circumstances are not sufficient. Where it satisfactorily appears that a demand upon the officers of a corporation would be useless, such a course need not be pursued; but here the plaintiff has not made it plain from facts stated that a majority of the Board of Directors of the corporation in question had been, or probably would have been, faithless to their trust; hence he has not shown a right to maintain the suit in his in<a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>dividual capacity. We have held, “The right of an individual stockholder to act for the corporation is exceptional and only arises on a clear showing of special circumstances, among which inability or unwillingness of the corporation itself, demand upon the regular corporate management, and refusal to act are imperative requisites. A refusal by the corporate management must appear affirmatively to be a disregard of duty and not an error of judgment, a nonperformance of a manifest official obligation, amounting to a breach of trust. There must be averred and proved an actual application to the directors, and refusal by them to bring suit or to allow plaintiff to do so in the corporate name, and where misconduct of the directors themselves is alleged, the bill must show an effort to secure plaintiff’s rights through meetings of the corporation:" Wolf v.

Ritchie, 64 Fed. Repr. 253, 262, Mr. Justice Lurton, then a U. S. Circuit Judge, stated, “The injury done by the defendants, if any, was done to the corporation. The wrong, if objectionable, was one to be remedied by an action by the corporation, or by a shareholder for the benefit of the corporation upon the refusal of the corporation to sue. A stockholder cannot maintain a suit for the indirect injury done to him as an indirect result of an injury to the corporation. This is too obvious to need elaboration.” These words are applicable to the present case.</p>

The learned court below rightly decided that the presence of this corporation as a party to the record was indispensable to the maintenance of the action. The rights of the plaintiff depended upon those of the Coaling Company, and the latter was not before the <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>court. Not only was its presence necessary to the plaintiff, but the defendants were entitled thereto so that the corporation might be concluded by any decree entered against them, and the company itself was entitled to notice in order that its interests and the rights of its creditors might be protected. (See quotations from standard text-books upon this point in Willoughby v. Chicago Junction Rys. &amp; Stockyards Co., 25 Alt. Repr., 277, 280, 281, and Eldred v. American Palace-Car Co., 105 Fed. Repr. 457, 458). There is nothing upon the record to show that it was impossible to secure service upon the individual defendants in the domicile of the foreign corporation; they were officers of that company, and in the absence of any averment to the contrary it is but reasonable to assume that they could have been served in the State in which that corporation had its being and transacted its business.</p>

The plaintiff sought to have the court below inquire into and practically set aside that judgment as fraudulent, upon the general averment that the suit was “kept wholly secret from your orator;” that the service was upon the secretary and treasurer of the Coaling Company who was the son of one of the other defendants and in the employ of Jutte &amp; Co.; that the claim adjudicated was “wrongfully and fraudulently excessive”; that Jutte &amp;' Co. “had no proper legal cause of action against the said Mississippi River Coaling Company”; that the proceedings were “wrongful, fraudulent and oppressive, and the judgment in said suit was procured by deceit upon the court * * * and was part of the general wrongful and fraudulent scheme and design of the defendants * * * for the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>purpose of preventing your orator from getting the benefit to which he was entitled as a stockholder of the said * * * Coaling Company.” Had it been proper for the court below to review this judgment, it was not called upon to do so under these general averments. We are convinced that no error was committed in determining that, “it would be highly improper * * * under the averments of this bill, to undertake to ascertain whether or not the Dock Company was properly served with process and whether or not the judgment of that court was excessive in amount.”</p>

As to this, we have said, “A Pennsylvania resident has no right to call upon the courts of his own State to protect him from the consequences of a voluntary membership in a foreign corporation.

In view of the circumstances of the present case we do not feel that a departure from our own rule would be justifiable; but in a case free from the peculiar difficulties of this one, where the foreign corporation was served and all the parties or property directly involved was within the jurisdiction of the court, if the actual exercise of visitorial powers is not requisite to the relief, the rule as to non-interference should be restricted and not carried further than is absolutely required by universal fixed rules of law; for, where possible, we should prevent its use as a cloak to cover apparent fraudulent conduct on the part of officers of foreign corporations to the prejudice of Pennsylvania stockholders.</p>
