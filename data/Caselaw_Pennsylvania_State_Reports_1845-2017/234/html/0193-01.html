In the present case, however, the plaintiff’s claim is founded wholly, or almost wholly, upon the contracts made with the various railway companies operated by the defendant company by which they bound themselves to keep the streets in repair. There is nothing in the fact that the plaintiff is a municipal corporation, or that the defendant is a public service corporation, which can give the plaintiff any peculiar right to a decree for specific performance different from the right of one individual against another. The only cases in which specific performance has been decreed in' Pennsylvania are the common cases of the sale of land and the very few cases concerning personal property in which it has appeared that for some peculiar reason a suit for damages for failure <em>to </em>perform would not give adequate <em>relief; </em>such as the case of Vail v. Osbourn, <a href="/pa/174/0580-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="174 Pa. 580" data-case-ids="878536" data-case-paths="/pa/174/0580-01">174 Pa. 580</a>, where specific performance was decreed of an agreement to cut and deliver bark to a tannery from trees close to the tannery, where it appeared that bark could not be obtained otherwise. Unless some such element appears equity leaves the parties to their legal remedy. Especially must this be the case where the contract sought to be enforced specifically is for putting streets in repair and thereafter keeping them in repair, which would involve a supervision of the court over the matter for an indefinite time. <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>No case has been pointed out to ns wherein specific performance of snch a contract has been asked for or decreed as the principal relief sought by a plaintiff. On the contrary, there have been quite a number of cases in this Commonwealth where the breach of duty to repair streets by street railway companies has been enforced in action of assumpsit, as the cases of Reading v. United Traction Company, <a href="/pa/215/0250-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="215 Pa. 250" data-case-ids="948390" data-case-paths="/pa/215/0250-01">215 Pa. 250</a>; McKeesport Boro. v.

Pittsburgh Railways Company, <a href="/citations/?q=50%20Pitts%20L.J.%20377" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="50 Pitts L.J. 377">50 Pitts. Leg. J. 377</a>, and Patton Township v.

In neither of these cases, however, did the bill pray for specific performance of a contract to repair. In the Mc-Keesport case the bill was to forfeit the franchise of the railways company for breach of a condition upon which it was granted, namely, that it shall keep the streets in repair, and the prayer was not for an order requiring the repairs to be made, but for a decree of forfeiture unless it was made within a reasonable time, which is a very different thing. In the Patton township case the agreement of the railways company, namely, to lay a second track, which it had agreed to do upon certain conditions, the existence of Avhich it denied, and the prayer as to the want of repair of the track Avhich was already laid was the same as that in the McKeesport case, for forfeiture unless the repair was made, it being alleged that the keeping of the street in repair was a condition subsequent to the grant of the franchise to lay the street railway and the prayer was that unless the repair was made the Avhole raihvay should be removed. The present bill contains no' allegation that the duty to repair in any of the streets mentioned in the bill was a condition of the continuance of the franchise, nor does <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>it ask for any forfeiture on that account. It is purely and simply a bill for specific performance. Being of opinion, therefore, that the court has no jurisdiction to grant the relief sought, for the reason above stated, the demurrer is sustained and the bill is dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff.”</p>

By the added paragraph it is alleged that the city and the railways company are unable to agree upon the extent of the liability of the defendant or the manner in which the defendant should do the work or make repairs; that it would be difficult to keep an accurate account of the cost of said work so as to properly charge the defendant, the defendant being liable to the city only for repairs and cleaning done on only a part of the street; and that it is not practicable for the plaintiff to do the work and make the repairs because in so doing it would interfere with the operation of the defendant’s cars. To the amended bill the defendant has demurred as before. Upon a careful consideration of the bill as amended we are unable to see that it differs substantially from the original bill, or that anything contained in the amendment is sufficient to give jurisdiction to decree specific performance under the circumstances.</p>
