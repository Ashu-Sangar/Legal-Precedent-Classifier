Murray, Jr., the court should have held that the- fund was personalty and distributed it as such. In the opinion sustaining the exceptions, the learned court says: “It is now contended that by the terms of Mrs. Murray’s' will and the sales made for the purpose of carrying out its provisions, conversion has in fact taken place.” He sustained the exceptions on the ground that the Price Act under which the sales were made could not prevail against the will of the testatrix, if, by the terms thereof, or the exercise of the power contained therein conversion had actually taken place.</p>

As said by Chief Justice Sterrett in Darlington v. Darlington, <a href="/pa/160/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="160 Pa. 65" data-case-ids="852127" data-case-paths="/pa/160/0065-01">160 Pa. 65</a>, 70: “To work a conversion of real estate into personalty, there must be either (a) a positive direction to sell; or (b) an absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the will; or (c) such a blending of realty and personalty by the testator, in his will, as to clearly show that he intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate, and to bequeath the same as money.” It is clear that there is no positive direction to sell contained in Mrs. Murray’s will. It is equally certain, we think, that there is no absolute necessity to sell in order to execute the instrument. After the direction to pay her debts and funeral expenses and making certain specific bequests, she “gives and disposes” of her residuary estate in three equal parts or shares. She gives one of these shares to trustees in trust to receive and collect the income and pay the same to her son, Anthony S. Murray, during his natural life, and from and immediately thereafter she gives the share absolutely to his children. This is the share now being distributed. The other two shares were given to trustees for her two daughters and their descendants with provisions similar to the gift to her son, Anthony. There is nothing in these provisions of the will that requires a sale in order to carry out the intention of the testator in the distribution of the residue of her estate. If, for instance, it was all real estate, the parties would hold it together and either party could institute partition proceedings, as we have frequently held. If the property was personalty, they could divide it, or, if they desired, sell it as a whole. If, as is a fact, the property was partly real and partly personal estate the same disposition could be made of it by the parties. There was therefore no necessity to sell in order to execute the will.</p>
    <p id="b553-6" data-blocks='[["BL_553.4",553,[186,2347,1143,99]],["BL_554.1",554,[298,377,1150,1895]]]'>There is nothing to support the contention that there was such a blending of the realty and personalty as to <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>clearly Show that the testatrix intended to create a fund out of both real and personal estate and to bequeath the same as money. There is not a single provision in the will which indicates an intention on the part of the testatrix to convert her real and personal property into money and to divide it among the distributees as such. The property is given in the form in which it was at the time the will was executed. “All the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal and mixed, I direct to be divided into three equal parts or shares,” is the language of the will. These “parts or shares” are separately given to trustees for the respective parties. There was certainly no intention on the part of the testatrix, as disclosed by this language, to dispose of the residue of her estate as money. On the contrary, it is an absolute disposition of the property in its existing form, and was to be taken and held as such by the beneficiaries. “The blending of real and personal estate by a testator in his will,” says the Court in Perot’s Appeal, <a href="/pa/102/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="102 Pa. 235" data-case-ids="502657" data-case-paths="/pa/102/0235-01">102 Pa. 235</a>, 256, “is not of much significance unless it clearly appears that he intended thereby to create a fund raised out of both real and personal estate, and to bequeath said fund as money.” Here the testatrix directed that the residue of her property, not the proceeds or money arising from the sale thereof, should be divided into three equal parts, and that the several parts be held by the trustees for the respective beneficiaries. Each of these three shares vested in the trustees for the respective beneficiaries thereof, and not the entire residue as a blended fund of realty and personalty to be held by the trustees as one fund. The testatrix did not devise her residuary estate to the trustees as a whole, but one-third thereof to the trustees of each of the beneficiaries to whom each of the three parts were given.</p>

That is too plain, we think, for argument. The <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>authority there confei’red was simply for the purpose of administering the three trust estates. The trustees were given authority “to make from time to time such investments or changes in the investments of the estate and moneys herein given to them in trust as may become necessary or they or the survivor of them may deem advisable.” There is not even an intimation in this language that the trustees were empowered to sell the real estate as a whole or the three interests therein separately for the purpose of distribution. The language clearly indicates that the purpose was to enable the trustees to deal with the trust estates in the most advantageous way for the cestui que trusts. None of the sales were made before the death of Anthony S. Murray, the life tenant. None of the sales were made by the trustees by virtue of the authority conferred in the fifth paragraph of the will. The sales were made by a trustee appointed by the orphans’ court, and, as we have seen, under the provisions of the Price Act. His authority came from the orphans’ court and not from the will. These facts are clearly disclosed by the petitions presented to the court and by the court’s decrees confirming the sales. They also appear by the account which the trustee filed. In discussing the Price Act and the effect of the sale of a minor’s real estate under it, this Court said in Holmes’ Appeal, <a href="/pa/53/0339-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="53 Pa. 339" data-case-ids="1004773" data-case-paths="/pa/53/0339-01">53 Pa. 339</a>, 342: “The sale was not made for the purpose of raising money for him, (the minor). Before making the order, the Court was satisfied that the change from land to money substituted for the land, would be best for his interest, and it was that which moved the Court to make the order. We must therefore hold that this change did not change the character in which the substitute is to pass to those entitled. It must pass as land.”</p>
