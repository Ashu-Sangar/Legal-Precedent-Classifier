The object of which offer was to make the time of the delivery of the deeds the very essence of the contract. The court then, without a further formal motion to strike out all the testimony following the offer, considered that as done which ought to have been done in the first <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>instance, and affirmed a point for binding instructions on the part of the plaintiffs, and directed a verdict of the jury accordingly.</p>

Neither did the defendants at the time of the refusal to take the property allege any other reason for their refusal than the death of one of the parties to the agreement, nor do they, when the deeds are tendered, mention delay as the vital question, but claim that the deeds were not right, without pointing out any defects, and which, if any, plaintiffs would have the right to correct: Tiernan v.
