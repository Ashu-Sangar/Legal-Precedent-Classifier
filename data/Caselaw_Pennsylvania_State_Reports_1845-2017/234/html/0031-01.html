On December 17, 1908, a petition for the appointment of a receiver of the property of Marcello was filed, and as respects said petition, there was a second written waiver by Marcello of the service of a subpoena or notice upon him. On December 17, 1908, the South Side Trust Company was appointed “Receiver of all the assets and property, of every kind and character, belonging to said bankrupt.” On December 18, 1908, the receiver gave bond, which was duly approved and filed on the same day, and thereupon, December 18, 1908, the receiver took possession of the property covered by these two policies of insurance, and placed a watchman upon it. On December 19,1908, the receiver took out policies of fire insurance issued by various companies, to the amount of $9,000, upon the same property covered by these two policies.

    <p class="summary" id="b64-4" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[307,1073,1149,1327]]]'>The safety of the insurer is dependent much upon the character of the assured, not alone upon his integrity and good faith, but upon his habits of carefulness, of prudence, and vigilance. It is obvious that the danger of fire may be much less when the assured is a man watchful and provident than where he is heedless and negligent, as well as dishonest. The provision, therefore, which requires assignment of a policy to be made with the consent of the insurers, and to be approved by them, is not unmeaning. Nor is its purpose to stipulate for a new contract with the assignee. It is designed rather to afford substantial protection to the underwriters, by enabling them to preserve, during the continuance of the risk, the safeguards which existed at its origin; those found in the honesty and watchfulness of the assured. It was for this reason that it was early laid down that a fire policy could not be assigned pending the risk, so as to give to the assignee any interest in it whatsoever, either legal or equitable: Lord Chancellor King, Lynch v. Dalzell, 4 Bro. P. C. 431. Such a policy has indeed in some of the later cases been held assignable in equity, with the subject itself, when it contained no provision to the contrary, and it is on that account that the prohibition to assign has been generally introduced: State Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Roberts, <a href="/pa/31/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="31 Pa. 438" data-case-ids="985006" data-case-paths="/pa/31/0438-01">31 Pa. 438</a>.</p>

      <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>It was not contemplated by the parties to the contracts that mere change of occupancy should vitiate them, because change “in the interest, title or possession” is expected in case of “death of an insured,” and likewise, “change of occupants without increase of hazard.” The word “possession,” as used in the policies, seems to have a broader significance than any that could be gathered from the words “occupant,” “occupancy,” or “occupation.” Such is the view taken by the Superior Court in a case involving the consideration of a policy of insurance, which contained this provision: “This entire policy . . . . shall be void .... if any change, other than by the death of the insured, takes place in the interest, title or possession of the subject of insurance (except change of occupants without increase of hazard), whether by legal process, or judgment, or by voluntary act of the insured, or otherwise.” The court says (inter alia): “We are not aware that the precise question here involved has been decided in this state. But there is a decision in Rumsey v. Phœnix Insurance Co., 1 Fed. Repr. 396, by the United States circuit court of appeals for the northern district of New York, opinion by Judge Wallace, which seems to decide this question. In that case the policy provided that it should be void ‘if the property be sold or transferred, or any change take place in the title or possession, whether by legal process, judicial decree, voluntary transfer, or conveyance.’ The court said in that case, ‘The fact that Zimmer moved out of the dwelling house, and let it to tenants, is not a defense within the conditions that avoid the policy if any change takes place in title or possession. The change of possession contemplated is something more than a change of occupation; it is a change effected by legal process, judicial decree, voluntary transfer, or conveyance; one which refers to his possessory right, and not to the occupancy of the insured. The possession of Zimmer’s tenants was his possession within the meaning of the policy.’</p>

The policy of insurance there considered contained provisions respecting a change in the “interest, title or possession” of the subject of insurance, similar to the provisions of these policies; and in the opinion of the court are certain dicta in which are expressed substantially the view taken by defendant here; namely, that possession of the receiver before adjudication in bankruptcy was such a change of possession as brought about a cancellation of the policy. But the policy, which was a renewal, was assigned by the assured to the receiver, with the written consent of the insurance company, and the question before the court was, whether a bank, which had received the original policy as a pledge for the payment of a debt by the assured, was entitled to claim the renewal as a continuation of the pledge under the terms of the original agreement with the assured. The point decided was that “the assignment of the policy to the receiver, with the consent of the company, operated as a new and substantive contract by which the rights of the bank, as pledgee, were terminated.”</p>
