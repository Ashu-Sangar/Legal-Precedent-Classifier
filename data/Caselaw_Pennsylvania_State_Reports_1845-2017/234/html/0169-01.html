When, returning to the sick room about three hours after the former interview, he told Robert that he had “a paper here outlining the statements you made,” and the reply was, “No, Will, I have told you everything I wanted; I have nothing further to add.” Miss Vogel, the nurse’s recollection of the reply was this: “No, Will, I have told you everything in the presence of Charles; now let that do; I must have some sleep; I haven’t had any sleep for three nights.” Robert died six or seven hours afterwards. Attending physicians gave the opinion based on their observation that from one hour after Robert had given the instructions to his brother Will, he was unfit physically and mentally to have made a will; but the evidence of what Robert said at the time the alleged instructions were given and three hours later, when Will suggested he <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>sign the paper outlining his instructions, which had been prepared, show conclusively that he was mentally competent to have asked another to sign for him any testamentary paper. He had then an intelligent comprehension of what he had previously done, and what he would not do. He had given his instructions and would do no more. His refusal to sign must end the matter. His purpose had been accomplished.</p>
