The construction of the wall in question, as at present located, would take the place of the slope existing at Pitcairn Street since the Spring of the year 1882.</p>

The cut begins at zero slightly West of Pitcairn Street and becomes deeper as it progresses East toward Parker Avenue, its deepest point being midway between Parker Avenue and Pitcairn Street. At the West side of Pitcairn Street the cut from the surface of the street to the subgrade of the railroad is 4.09 feet, and to the top of the outer rail of the South track 3.33 feet. At the center line of the street the cut is 5.38 feet to the sub-grade and 3.06 feet to the top of the outer rail, and at the East curb line of the street the cut is 7.06 feet to sub-grade and 5.82 feet to the top of the outer rail. The extent of the cut at its highest point midway between Pitcairn Street and Parker Avenue does not appear by the testimony except that the photograph shows it to be in the neighborhood of twelve feet, the gradient being one and one-half to one, and the toe of the cutting being at grade at the Southerly line of the four rods width, the width of the slope is additional to the four rods width.</p>

If the plaintiff has the right under its charter to take additional land beyond four rods for the cut at Pitcairn Street, and such additional land was conveyed by its grant from the Merchants and Manufacturers Bank of Pittsburgh, then the proposed wall of the Borough at the end of Pitcairn Street as now located is upon plaintiff’s property. If plaintiff is confined at that point to a strip of land four rods wide by its grant, and no more, then the location of the proposed wall is outside of plaintiff’s land.</p>

The question involved in this proceeding is confined within narrow limits. Plaintiff by its charter is authorized to acquire land over which, to construct its railroad, not however, “to exceed four rods in width,” “except in the neighborhood of deep cuttings or high embankments.” Pursuant to this authority it acquired from the Merchants &amp; Manufacturers Bank of Pittsburgh, for the consideration “of the advantages which will result to said corporation from the location and construction of the Pennsylvania Rail<a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>road, and for the further consideration of the sum of one dollar, * * * a strip of land four rods in width, and such additional width.as may be required and necessary in the construction and use of said road at deep cuttings and embankments, one-half thereof on each side of the center line of said railroad, extending in length as far as said railroad may pass over the lands of said Corporation.” The land thus acquired lies a short distance West of plaintiff’s station house at Braddock, and now adjoins the Borough of Braddock on the North. In constructing its railroad over this strip of land, to afford plaintiff the use of its full four rods of land for track purposes it became necessary to make a cut at one point which required a slope at a gradient of one and one-half to one, and ranging in heighth from zero to possibly twelve feet. The North terminus of Pitcairn Street is near the West end of the. cut, and the streets on an average of approximately six feet above plaintiff’s graded roadbed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b345-4" data-blocks='[["BL_345.4",345,[177,1419,1148,1026]],["BL_346.1",346,[283,373,1154,1290]]]'>If plaintiff’s line extends to the outer edge or top of the slope of the cut then the preliminary injunction should be made permanent; if only to the South 33-foot line it should be dissolved. Plaintiff’s charter authorizes it to hold land for track purposes to the extent of 66 feet in width. If such was not the legislative intention there was no necessity for the reference in the charter to “deep cuttings or high embankments,” and that such was the understanding of both plaintiff and the Merchants &amp; Manufacturers Bank is apparent from the language of the grant, which not only conveys the 66-foot strip but also “such additional width as may be required and necessary in the construction and use of said road at deep cuttings and embankments.” If the cut beginning immediately West of Pitcairn Street and extending Eastwardly is considered a “deep cut” plaintiff’s line extends to the top of the slope. In determining that question we are not confined to the immediate terminus of Pitcairn Street, <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>but must consider the cut as a whole. If no greater at any point than at the West end of the street we should probably say it was not a “deep cut,” but regarding it as a whole and taking into consideration the fact that it increases gradually as it extends Easterly until it reaches a heighth of at least twelve feet, we think it should, under the circumstances, be considered a “deep cut,” and carry plaintiff’s line to the top of the slope. The Legislature certainly never intended that one part of a cut should be treated as “deep” and another as “shallow,” and thus cause the line of a railroad’s property to be serrated and indented, and dangerous in the operation of trains, which would be the result if defendant’s contention that the cut at Pitcairn Street is not a “deep cut” is upheld. The term “deep cuts” as used in plaintiff’s charter in our opinion is a relative term and means such cuts in their entirety as may be reasonably necessary to enable plaintiff to use for track purposes the entire width of a sixty-six foot right-of-way. That conclusion is strengthened by the fact that provision is also made for acquiring .land for depots and other purposes. It is not contended that the slope as it now exists at Pitcairn Street is not in accordance with good engineering.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b346-4" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[289,1676,1145,754]],["BL_347.1",347,[160,374,1144,487]]]'>The cases cited by defendant do not rule the question raised here. In those cases the taking was under the corporations’ right of eminent domain; here plaintiff purchased not only a strip of land sixty-six feet in width, but such additional land as might be necessary in the construction of its road at deep cuttings and embankments. And this it had a right to do, as its charter expressly confers upon it the power to purchase or hold such real estate as may be necessary or convenient for making and constructing its railroad. If the cut at what is now the terminus of Pitcairn Street was either necessary Or convenient to enable plaintiff to use its full right-of-way for track purposes, and the uncontradicted testimony of its engineers shows that it is, <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>then plaintiff had a right to purchase the additional land, and by the purchase acquired a good title, not only to the 66-foot right-of-way, but also to the top of the slope of the cut. The fact that the Plan of the Masonic Bank shows Pitcairn Street laid out to the 66-foot right-of-way of plaintiff cannot affect plaintiff’s title, as the property was acquired by the Bank and the plan laid out and recorded long after plaintiff secured and located its right-of-way.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-3" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[157,874,1147,533]]]'>Second. The contention of defendant that the bill must be dismissed because plaintiff failed to show action on the part of its Board of Directors locating its road through this property cannot be sustained. We think such corporate action can be assumed, inasmuch as the testimony shows that the first tracks were laid upon the land acquired from the Merchants and Manufacturers Bank fully sixty years ago, and that the South line of the right-of-way is fixed by measuring from the center line of the tracks as originally located.</p>
