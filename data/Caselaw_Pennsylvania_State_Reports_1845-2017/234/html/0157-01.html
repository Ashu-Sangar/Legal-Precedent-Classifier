    <p class="summary" id="b189-4" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[143,713,1156,1283]]]'>In the case now before us, it is clearly impossible to establish by evidence the actual damages which resulted from the breach of the contract in question. The borough was granting the right to enter upon and occupy its streets and the principal defendants were engaging to connect these tracks with others two miles away, so that the residents of Ambridge might reach with ease the boroughs and towns hereinbefore enumerated. It is true the borough does not ride upon street railways, but its residents do; and in making the agreement the borough was acting as the representative of its people. The parties themselves considered, as shown by their agreement, that it was important to have the lines completed at a date certain, and ample time was given to do so. The failure to construct the fine within the time stipulated was a breach of the bond and the injured party became entitled to the damages resulting. By no standard of which we have knowledge could such damages be ascertained with any degree of certainty. And it must be assumed that this difficulty was in the contemplation of the parties when the bond was executed. They knew it would be impossible to prove the actual damages in case the line was not completed as agreed. This is, therefore, a reason for naming a sum to be paid in case of a breach.</p>
