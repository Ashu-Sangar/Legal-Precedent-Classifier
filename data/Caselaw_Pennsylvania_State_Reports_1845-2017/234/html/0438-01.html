The auctioneer was not authorized to make these representations, and the trustee refuses to ratify the same, being bound by the terms of sale as authorized; that some of the heirs are in possession, and have given notice that they will not vacate the premises; that the <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>purchaser at one of the previous offerings at public sale, bid a higher price than $15,000, at which time the party-wall had not been built, nor had the excavation been made in the alley way; that the adjoining owner admits he has all the property called for by his deeds; that no claim has been made upon this estate by reason of the wall being apparently nine inches over the line; that the property in question is of the full width advertised, exclusive of the projection or extension of the wall on the adjoining property, this having been its location for more than forty years.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b468-5" data-blocks='[["BL_468.5",468,[321,1113,1146,738]]]'>There can be no question as to the title; all the land purporting to be conveyed is undoubtedly covered by the deed to the ancestor in title. While it does appear that the wall of this old building extends beyond the lines of the lot, it is manifest that the adjoining owner has no claim thereto, because he admits he has all the ground purchased by him; nor does he assert any title to the portion questioned. It would seem upon the uncontradicted evidence as to the length of time this wall has been upon the ground, that adverse possession, for a period far exceeding the statutory limit, settled the question of title, as to the projection, and the estate has title thereto, in addition to the width called for in the deed.</p>

He saw the objectionable features as to the excavations, and the damage done to the wall; he knew this condition of affairs had taken place since he had made his former bid, and that it would require an expenditure of money to put it in shape for entrance and use. While the trustee is not bound by this unauthorized assurance on the part of the auctioneer, it would not be equitable to hold the purchaser, who depends thereon, to the strict letter of the purchase, according to the advertised terms.</p>
