While her former place differed from the present one in size and character, the occupation pursued by her is essentially the same. The first assignment complains of evidence introduced to show wages paid by the plaintiff to servants at her new hotel, who were engaged to do work which prior to the accident, at her old place of business, she had been able to accomplish herself. Testimony showing wages paid to a servant employed to perform necessary work for a plaintiff, which before her injui’y she did herself, is always admissible (Willis v. Traction Co., <a href="/pa/189/0430-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="189 Pa. 430" data-case-ids="903549" data-case-paths="/pa/189/0430-01">189 Pa. 430</a>) ; and proof relied upon to show diminution of earning power need not be clear and indubitable (Simpson v.

The testimony called to our attention is so vague and uncertain that no satisfactory conclusion concerning a definite actual loss could be based thereon and it would be of little aid for any purpose; but we see no error in its admission. The only just criticism that can be aimed at the abstract from the charge covered by the second assignment is that, in dealing with this testimony the trial judge failed to call attention to its vague and uncertain quality. Neither of these assignments is sustained.</p>
