The street thus widened was thereafter used by both owners. Nineteen years after the date of the deed, the grantor’s successors in title agreed with the grantee’s successor to permit the latter to build over the former’s line two feet for a distance of 59 feet. The former was to have the use of the wall on paying one-half of its cost. It was also agreed that the latter should leave open a passageway five feet wide in and through his building for ingress and egress of the other owner. The buildings were erected in accordance with the agreement but were burned down nine years afterwards. In the course of reconstruction the subsequent owner of the buildings attempted to close up the five feet passageway. Held, that the agreement did not extinguish the easement created by the prior deed, and that the owner should be enjoined from closing the passage.</p>

Both parties and their tenants enjoyed the several rights and privileges thereunder for a period of almost twenty years. There seems to have been no conflict of rights until the buildings were razed by a fire on the 14th June, 1907. After this fire, plaintiff called upon defendant’s agent and manager, making inquiry relative to rebuilding the premises, but, receiving no definite reply, he erected a three story building upon his own land, and served a notice upon defendant not to enclose the 25 feet used by the parties under the agreement of 1869.

We cannot subscribe wholly to either of these contentions. The purpose of the parties under the agreements clearly was to economize space where lands were so valuable as in that portion of the city, each making contribution or surrender of rights and privileges in consideration of advantages to be mutually derived. This spirit of the agreement must be kept constantly in view in determining the rights of the parties, because, in the covenant, it was stipulated that the alley or passageway to the extent of five feet in width and fifty-seven feet in length, extending from 11th Avenue, was to “remain open perpetually, for the equal use of both properties, unless the owners mutually agree to make a change.” There is no evidence of any mutual agreement to make any change, and no act has been shown by the evidence to destroy or nullify its terms. While it may be conceded that the agreement of 1888 was substituted for that of 1869, it did not absolutely extinguish the easement, except in so far as it was in direct conflict therewith. The reservation of the right of way necessary for ingress and egress to the building on Lot No. 11, was kopt in view with an eye single to the right of such access. The plaintiff’s contention that by deed of 21st August, 1869, conveying the 5 foot alleyway with the limitation thereon, a servitude was imposed upon the other 20 feet of open roadway, fails of its purpose, when it appears that the grantee did not have title to said 20 feet until 15th October, 1869. But, a more potent reason is found in the fact that no grant is shown to have been made by the owner of that fee, and the fact that both parties mutually assented to the “five feet which has been heretofore used as a passageway.” Even if it be conceded that the grant was to “be used as an addition to the street or alley,” the owner of the easement may abandon it to relieve the servient estate <a id="p615" href="#p615" data-label="615" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*615</a>of the encumbrance. 10 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, (2nd Ed.) 434. If the owner of a dominant estate authorizes the owner of a servient estate to do upon the servient estate that which prevents the dominant estate from any longer enjoying the easement, the effect will be to extinguish it. Washburn on Easements &amp; Servitudes, (4th Ed.) 726. While it clearly appears that the ancient way to the market house upon Lot Nos. 9 and 10, was to be abandoned as absolutely useless, and unnecessary to both the premises under the new conditions, and the rear end of the 5 feet passageway, had been rendered valueless, this in no way affected the 57 feet in the front, so essential to both premises for ingress and egress, which had been substituted and used for a long period by both parties. This was essential under the changed conditions for both parties, as the alimentary canal to the human body, or the door to the fire box in the locomotive. It seems clear that for the mutual advanages of each to the other, all ■rights, whether of servient or dominant tenement, in fee or by easement, was abrogated by the agreement of 1888, except as to the passageway 5x57 feet, which was to be and remain open perpetually for the use of both parties, unless the said parties mutually agree to a change. Neither party under the agreement, which provided only for a passageway or hallway, could call upon the other to erect a stairway, but the plaintiff has the undoubted right to the use of said plot or alleyway 5x57 feet as an entrance to his building, and may construct such means of access to his second and third story as he may deem expedient, but may not call upon defendant for contribution. The defendant is prohibited from interference with the use of the alleyway, for such was the servitude impressed upon -it by the parties under the deed, as modified by the agreement. Should the defendant rebuild or erect a new structure upon his lot, covering to the line prior to 1869, the alley or passageway of 57 feet may be utilized for a <a id="p616" href="#p616" data-label="616" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*616</a>stairway and entrance, provided he constructs such stairway as will afford convenient access to the plaintiff’s building now erected upon his premises, restoring thereby to the plaintiff his full rights under the spirit, true meaning and intention of the parties to the agreement of 1888.</p>

A party wall is a division wall erected between two adjoining estates belonging to different persons for use of both estates, or as defined by Washburn on Easements &amp; Servitudes, (4th Ed.) 611, “a wall built at common expense and in which each have acquired a common right therein.” The wall in the case at bar was built on the lands of both parties, the front end or portion of the wall, on lands of plaintiff a distance of 59 feet, and the rear end of 61 feet upon lands of defendant’s predecessor in title, each making contribution and each together using the same in common until the buildings were destroyed by fire. What then is the status of the parties. We are cited to Section IV of the Act of April 10, 1849, P. L. 600, which provides that “In the conveyance of houses or buildings, the rights, to and compensation for the party wall built therewith, <a id="p617" href="#p617" data-label="617" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*617</a>shall be taken to have passed to the purchaser, unless otherwise expressed, and the owner of the house for the time being shall have all the remedies in respect to such party wall as he might have in relation to the house to which it is attached.” This Act has been held to apply to any wall made such by statute, prescription or agreement, (Voight v. Wallace, <a href="/pa/179/0520-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="179 Pa. 520" data-case-ids="886960" data-case-paths="/pa/179/0520-01">179 Pa. 520</a>), and the purpose of the Act as stated in said cited case “was intended to prevent the inconvenience and injustice resulting from the title to the wall being in one person and the right to compensation outstanding and a secret claim in the hands of another.” In other words, the Act was to prevent a condition such as arose in Dannaker v. Riley, <a href="/pa/14/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Pa. 435" data-case-ids="405890" data-case-paths="/pa/14/0435-01">14 Pa. 435</a>, where the right of the first builder to compensation was considered a personal right and did not pass with the land to the purchaser.

Such rights, which are purely statutory, do not exist at common law. List v. Hornbrook, <a href="/w-va/2/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 W. Va. 340" data-case-ids="8641719" data-case-paths="/w-va/2/0340-01">2 W. Va. 340</a>. A division wall may, however, be a party wall, not only by statute, but also by agreement. Ritter v. Sieger, <a href="/pa/105/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="105 Pa. 400" data-case-ids="454276" data-case-paths="/pa/105/0400-01">105 Pa. 400</a>. We must then look to the agreement of 1888 between the parties and determine whether or not a party wall exists by contract, and what may be required of each thereunder. It is herein provided that whereas Roush is about to commence the erection of a brick building, and that he may build his wall a distance of two feet over the line of said Ebert back a distance of 59 feet, and the remaining portion of the said wall shall be built eighteen <a id="p618" href="#p618" data-label="618" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*618</a>inches beyond the said Ebert side of the dividing line, a distance of 61 feet; and that Ebert shall, after compensation, sink the joist of his said building into said wall. But, it will appear under the agreement that while provision is made for the perpetual maintenance of the hallway, no such agreement is made in reference to the wall; nor is any provision made for its repair or re-construction in the event such repairs or rebuilding may become necessary. No right has run by prescription, and, in the absence of such contract, it is to be assumed that none was intended by the parties, for only that which is expressed or fairly implied under the agreement can prevail. The easement of support by means of a common party wall, which belongs to adjoining buildings cease with the state of things which created it, and, when the wall is accidentally destroyed, or is-so much decayed as to require a rebuilding from the foundation, neither may call upon the other for its restoration, unless it was so agreed at the time of its erection.

And, where one owning an easement in a wall, which forms a side of his building, after the destruction of the wall and building, erects a new building on a different foundation, he, thereby, abandons and extinguishes the easement.

These authorities would seem to indicate that the division or partition wall is wholly eliminated from the controversy, as neither the agreement of 1888 provides for reconstruction or contribution therefor, nor is there any evidence tending to show since the destruction of the buildings that either party obligated himself to a reconstruction, or for contribution in the event of a rebuilding by the other party.

    <p id="b648-8" data-blocks='[["BL_648.9",648,[281,965,1147,1078]]]'>These appeals are from a decree entered on bill and cross-bill defining the rights of adjoining owners of land to an easement. They give rise to many questions of interest that have been elaborately and ably argued, but the crucial question in the case is whether the agreement of 1888 extinguished the easement created by deed in 1869. We concur in the conclusion reached by the learned judge of the Common Pleas that it did not and that its only effect was to define and restrict the use of the passage way. Whether under a strict construction of the deed, the easement created by it was personal to the grantor and limited to his life is of slight importance, in view of the construction placed upon it by the owners of the dominant and servient tenements. For a period of nearly forty years they construed the covenant as running with the land, and with this understanding of their rights, negotiations were entered into for their mutual advantage and money expended and buildings erected. It is now too late to call it into question.</p>
