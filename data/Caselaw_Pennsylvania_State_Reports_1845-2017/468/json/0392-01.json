The majority approves the ruling of the trial court which withheld from the jury evidence it should have been allowed to consider when determining the state of appellant\u2019s mind at the time of the shooting. Appellant sought to have a psychiatrist express an opinion as to appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the shooting. This opinion was based on the psychiatrist\u2019s observations of appellant\u2019s behavior while under an hypnotic trance induced by the psychiatrist. Once the witness was properly qualified to testify as to the experiment done on appellant, the evidence should have been put before the jury so that they, in their collective wisdom, could determine whether or not appellant\u2019s action while in a hypnotic trance indicated that she did not possess the requisite intent to commit murder at the time she shot Robert Ham.",
