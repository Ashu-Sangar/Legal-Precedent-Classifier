        "text": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nOn August 19, 1974, appellant, Alton Cooper, was convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree, assault with intent to kill, aggravated assault and battery, and assault and battery in the death of his nineteen-month old daughter. Post-trial motions were filed and denied by a court en banc. On May 21, 1975, the court imposed a sentence of not less than one year nor more than four years in the Bucks County Prison for the conviction of murder in the second degree and concurrent sentences of not less than one year nor more than four years on the convictions for aggravated assault and battery and assault with intent to kill. Appellant appealed the murder conviction to this court and appealed the convictions for aggravated assault and battery and assault with intent to kill to the Superior Court, which in turn certified the record to this court on July 1,1975.\nAppellant argues that the district attorney\u2019s comment in his summation, concerning appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right, after his arrest, not to speak to police without an attorney present, was improper and prejudicial. We agree.\nThe following excerpt is that portion of the district attorney\u2019s summation which we consider improper comment on appellant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right not to be interrogated without his attorney present:\n\u201c . . . Mrs. Cooper, you saw her testify on the stand in front of you. You had an opportunity to evaluate her credibility. She was frank in admitting that, yes, on several occasions she did discipline the child with something else than her hand. She told you about disciplining the child and what happened. You will have to evaluate that testimony on the basis of your own experience and say to yourselves, Ts that testimony credible?'\n\u201cWe know that Mr. Cooper gave a statement, that he talked to the police, and that he was up to the District Attorney\u2019s office and gave another statement. And before he gave those statements he was warned of his constitutional rights. He was told that anything he said could and would be used against him in a Court of Law. And is there anything in this case other than the argument of Mr. LaHoda, to suggest that this was some kind of a cover-up, that Mr. Cooper was, somehow, going to take the rap for his wife. I would submit to you that there is not.\n\u201cHe gave a statement after being thoroughly warned of his rights, and he told us in detail exactly what had happened. What did happen when he left the District Attorney\u2019s Office after he had been interrogated? What happened was that they went down into their car and drove away. They got up by the shopping center and Mr. Cooper told Mrs. Cooper about hitting with the sandal and she suggested that they go back and be truthful about that. You will recall up to this point the autopsy had not been finished, so that nobody knew the cause of the child\u2019s death simply because all of the evidence wasn\u2019t in.\n\u201cBut what happened after they left and before they came back and before Dr. Mihilakis had completed his autopsy, and there was a call from Quakertown Hospital, and a decision was made to arrest Mr. Cooper?\n\u201cHe came back to the office and he was arrested and at that point the Coopers declined to answer any further questions until an attorney was present.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nAn evaluation of this comment indicates that the district attorney created a picture that Mr. Cooper was willing to talk prior to his arrest but unwilling to cooperate with the police after his arrest. We are of the opinion that the above comment dealing with appellant\u2019s silence after his arrest is an improper and prejudicial comment on the exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.\nIn Commonwealth v. Stafford, 450 Pa. 252, 263, 299 A.2d 590 (1973), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 943, 93 S.Ct. 2775, 37 L.Ed.2d 404, this court, in discussing a prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning silence at the time of arrest, stated:\n\u201c . . . The Fifth Amendment protects the accused\u2019s right to remain silent and it is of no moment that in the instant case the appellant remained silent at the time of his arrest. To allow comment on his silence at the time of the arrest would also make the assertion of his privilege costly. The difference between the prosecutor\u2019s comment on the accused\u2019s failure to testify in Griffin and the prosecutor\u2019s comment here about the accused\u2019s failure to answer questions at the time of his arrest is \u2018infinitesimal.\u2019 Gillison v. United States, 130 U.S.App.2d 215, 399 F.2d 586, 587 (1968).\u201d\nSee also Commonwealth v. Haideman, 449 Pa. 367, 296 A.2d 765 (1972).\nThe Commonwealth contends that the comment was permissible because defense counsel first raised the fact of appellant\u2019s silence after arrest. We do not agree. The fact that defense counsel first brought to the attention of the jury the fact of silence did not give the prosecutor a reciprocal right to comment on appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights. See Commonwealth v. Stafford, supra, 450 Pa. at page 263, 299 A.2d 590.\nThe Commonwealth further contends that if the comment was error, it was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not agree. The district attorney\u2019s remark reasonably may have contributed to the guilty verdict and, therefore, cannot be said to be harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) and Commonwealth v. Davis, 452 Pa. 171, 305 A.2d 715 (1973). Appellant raises other allegations of error which we need not discuss because of our resolution of the above issue.\nJudgments of sentence reversed.

See and compare, Commonwealth v. Brenizer, 467 Pa. 347, 353, 356 A.2d 784, 786 (1976) (Concurring Opinion of Pomeroy, J.) and Commonwealth v. Tervalon, 463 Pa. 581, 593, 345 A.2d 671, 678 (1975).\nI think it worth noting, also, that in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 468 n. 37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 720 n. 37 (1966) the Supreme Court of the United States explicitly stated that \u201c[t]he prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that [the accused] stood mute or claimed his privilege [against self-incrimination] in the face of accusation.\u201d The Supreme Court has recently and explicitly reaffirmed that view in its decision in Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L. Ed.2d 91 (1976). The Court there held that \u201cthe use for impeachment purposes of petitioners\u2019 silence, at the time of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d 426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. at 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 98 (footnote omitted).\nJONES, C.
