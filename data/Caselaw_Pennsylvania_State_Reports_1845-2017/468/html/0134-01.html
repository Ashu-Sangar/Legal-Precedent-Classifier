Fred is an enlisted man in the United States Air Force and was stationed in Korea from approximately March 1973 to January 1974. Pandora and the two children occupied a mobile home near Shippensburg during her husband’s absence. On January 14, 1974, Fred returned home and learned that Pandora had become romantically involved with one Thompson. Fred separated from Pandora shortly after his return and moved in to his parents’ home. He has since been transferred to Mississippi, where he now resides. Pandora and the two children left the mobile home on February 11, 1974, and moved into an apartment with Thompson. Thompson moved out of the apartment shortly before the custody hearing on the advice of Pandora’s counsel.</p>

In <em>Austin, </em>the mother, after separating from her husband, lived with one Staunton for thirteen years and had five children with him. She granted temporary custody of one child to friends due to emotional problems she was having. Two years later she attempted to regain custody. The Superior Court held that her nonmarital relationship with Staunton was not a bar to regaining custody because it had proven to be “durable” and a cohesive force for the children. In <em>Gervasio, </em>the mother had entered an adulterous relationship with one Karabell, whom she later married. The court found that the home was clean and that the children were well cared for. Custody was awarded to the mother rather than the natural father despite the nonmarital affair.</p>
