Land from both sides of River Street will be taken with incursions of up to twelve feet, varying according to the need at various points. The total amount of land from the Common to be diverted to this use is .59 acres. Presently located in the path of the proposed fourth lane are sections of tree lawns and sidewalks. (See the chancellor’s Findings of Fact Nos. 18, 20 and 21 quoted above). The plan calls for replacement of these areas once construction of the new lane is finished. The disrupted area will be recurbed and restructured. The tree lawn is to be reconstituted with twenty-eight trees replacing the twenty-three which will be removed. The whole area will be relandscaped and the stone wall bordering the sidewalk on the Common side will be reconstructed with its original materials; recent flood damage to the wall will also be repaired.

We said in <em>Shields </em>that parks were commonly recognized as places particularly well-suited to recreational and athletic endeavors of every sort and that, because much of this park would remain untouched, the proposed use was not inconsistent with the terms of the original grant. Likewise, in <em>Bernstein v.

After study, these alternate plans were specifically rejected as imprudent and unfeasible. We agree, therefore, that the claim that all alternatives were not given full consideration is without merit. Similarly, appellants’ charge that the present plan does not include efforts to minimize the adverse effects is simply not borne out by the record. The plan, briefly described earlier in this opinion, plainly demonstrates an effort to leave the affected area of the Common essentially unchanged in nature once the construction has been completed. The actual amount of land to be taken is small. The trees, sidewalks and the stone wall will be replaced; the historical significance of the markers which are to be moved will be in no way affected by their relocation. All in all, the record here indicates a commitment by. the public officials involved to serve the spirit as well as the letter of Act 120. Whether they succeeded was, of course, a question in the first instance for the chancellor. He found that the proposed intrusion into the park would be relatively slight; would be at a point which is not critical to the use and enjoyment of the Common; and that, upon completion of the relandscaping and reconstruction work, the affected area will be essentially unaltered. His conclusion that reason<a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>able efforts have been made to hold the adverse effect to a minimum in accordance with Act 120 was fully warranted.</p>

The City Council of Wilkes-Barre gave conditional approval for the scheme on July 6, 1971, but took no further formal action. This non-action, in appellants’ view, demonstrates that the City withheld its approval. But, as the chancellor noted, the city manager and the city engineer both testified that the final plan did meet with the City’s approval. Even if this were not sufficient, the Act does not require ac<a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>tual approval of all aspects of the plan by the political subdivision wherein the affected land is located; it requires instead only that the cooperation of that political entity be enlisted in the formulation and the development of the plan. 71 P.S. § 512(a) (7). The chancellor’s specific finding of fact that such cooperation was forthcoming was not excepted to by the appellants.

That question may be of paramount importance when the Commonwealth as trustee is seeking to curtail or prevent the otherwise entirely legal use of private property on the ground that the proposed use impinges, in the words of the amendment’s first sentence, on “natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values of the environment.” See <em>Commonwealth v. National Gettysburg Battlefield Tower, Inc., </em><a href="/pa/454/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="34" data-cite="454 Pa. 193" data-case-ids="579878" data-case-paths="/pa/454/0193-01">454 Pa. 193</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=311%20A.2d%20588" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="311 A.2d 588">311 A.2d 588</a> (1973). Here, however, the shoe is on the other foot, as it were. There can be no question that the Amendment itself declares and creates a public trust of public natural resources for the benefit of all the people (including future generations as yet unborn) and that the Commonwealth is made the trustee of said resources, commanded to conserve and maintain them. No implementing legislation is needed to enunciate these broad purposes and establish these relationships; the amendment does so by its own <em>ipse dixit. </em>There is also no doubt that the property here involved is public property, a “public Common”, and that it is possessed of certain natural, scenic, historic and esthetic values. The deeds and the evidence establish as much. The only question is whether a court can proceed, on this basis and without more, to adjudicate the charge that the proposed road widening project “will violate the constitutional rights” of the plaintiffs to the preservation of those values (Complaint, par. 48f., at 16a); or stated another way, will violate the trust imposed on the Commonwealth to conserve those values (Complaint, par. 48g at 16a). On this record we see no impediment to asserting the constitutional claim. Cf. <em>Rhoades v. School </em>
