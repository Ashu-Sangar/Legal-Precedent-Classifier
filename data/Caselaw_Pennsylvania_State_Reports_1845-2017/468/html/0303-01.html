Barnes stated that while he himself expressed some reluctance to go along, Gaddy immediately agreed to the proposal. Nothing came of the plan, however, until January 7, 1972, when Gaddy and Odom finally persuaded Barnes to accompany them on their misadventure. That day they met at Odom’s house; Odom produced a loaded .32 caliber revolver which he indicated to the others he was taking with him on the robbery.</p>

At approximately 6:00 p. m., satisfied that no shoppers remained in the store,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> the three men moved across the street and entered the store. Inside the storeroom, Gaddy and Barnes placed themselves near the checkout counter, where Dobkin was standing, while Odom moved throughout the store removing various items from the shelves. Odom then came to the counter with his “purchases” and began fumbling in his pockets as though looking for money. Instead of money, however, he withdrew the revolver from his pocket and fired two shots at Dobkin, who fell to the floor clutching his stomach. Odom then leaned over the counter and fired two more shots. Dobkin subsequently died of a gunshot wound to the head.</p>

Four of them relate to the testimony of LeRoy Barnes, the principal Commonwealth witness; one relates to testimony of the victim’s widow; and two relate to the charge of the court.</p>
    <p id="b378-6" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[254,1341,1163,864]]]'>(1) The first error Gaddy advances is that the trial court abused its discretion in limiting defense counsel in his cross-examination of Barnes concerning his use of drugs. When counsel asked Barnes, “Do you take drugs, Mr. Barnes” ? the attorney for the Commonwealth objected. The court ruled that counsel could ask Barnes about his use of drugs on the day of the robbery on the theory that such questioning was proper to elicit whether by the use of drugs Barnes’ powers of observation had been impaired, but the objection was sustained insofar as the question sought to attack the credibility of Barnes generally. Appellant advances the view that this wider scope of inquiry in the area of drug use should have been permitted and refers us to the case of <em>Commonwealth v. Dreibelbis, </em><a href="/pa-super/217/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="217 Pa.

      <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>Appellant would have us read <em>Dreibelbis </em>too broadly. In <em>Dreibelbis, </em>the Superior Court held that it was proper, on cross-examination of an accomplice of the defendant, to question him with respect to his use of drugs on the day of the crime. The court’s rationale was that such questioning “ ‘was unobjectionable because it was asked for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the witness by showing that at the time of the event to which he testified his powers of observation and memory were impaired, so that his recollection and account of the experience might be inaccurate.’ ” <a href="/pa-super/217/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="217 Pa.

Gaddy contends that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to permit him to introduce into evidence testimony by Dr. Nicholas Frignito, a court-appointed psychiatrist. Dr. Frignito had examined Barnes when Barnes had been arrested on an unrelated charge, shortly before his arrest for the robbery-murder of Martin Dobkin. Dr. Frignito’s testimony was admissible, appellant argues, because it was directed to the issue of Barnes’ reliability, <em>i. e., </em>his capacity for truth and veracity.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">9</a> Evidence as to the witness’ general reputation for truth and veracity is admissible.

The statement was in regard to the closeness of the relationship between Gaddy, the defendant, and Nathaniel Odom. Appellant argues that Barnes committed perjury when he testified that he saw Gaddy and Odom together “just about every day” prior to December 15, 1971,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_10" id="ref_footnote_1_10">10</a> because, <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>according to court records he produced, Henry Gaddy had been committed to the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill, Pa. between November 13, 1969 and December 13, 1971.

But it is not at all clear that in fact Barnes gave false testimony. His answers as to when he recalled seeing Odom and Gaddy together prior to December 24, 1971 were permeated with uncertainty. When asked by defense counsel whether he would be surprised to learn that Mr. <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>Gaddy had been out of town for three years prior to December 1971, Barnes responded, “[n]o, it wouldn’t surprise me.” We accept the Commonwealth’s appraisal of the challenged testimony: “It is obvious from Barnes’ testimony that at best he did not clearly remember whether he had seen Gaddy during that time and that at worst he might be mistaken about it.” Appellee’s Brief at 13. <em>Cf. Commonwealth v.

The statement in its entirety was read to the jury by the police officer to whom it had been given. In the statement, which was generally consistent with his testimony, Barnes admitted his participation in the robbery-murder and implicated Odom and Gaddy as well.

That weighing was clearly not done in this case because the evidence obtained from decedent’s widow was cumulative and had virtually no probative value. Before decedent’s widow was called as a witness, the Commonwealth had called a co-defendant whose testimony indicated that decedent was alive prior to the killing. Moreover, this testimony <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>Was “corroborated by a friend of [decedent], Harry Coleman, who was present in the store during the robbery and described its occurrence like Barnes.” Brief for Commonwealth at 4.
