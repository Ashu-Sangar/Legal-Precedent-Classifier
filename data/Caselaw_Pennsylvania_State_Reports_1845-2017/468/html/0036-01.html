The trial judge took testimony on this matter and found that while there had been mass media coverage of appellant’s co-conspirator’s trial, the accounts had been limited to factual accounts of the trial and contained no inflammatory material that would prejudice appellant’s cause in Erie County.

Prior to Smith’s testimony, the prosecution had presented the testimony of Silous Huddleston, who stated that he and appellant had discussed the means that should be used to murder Yablonski and that appellant had ruled out dynamite. Huddleston then began telling about calling Smith and discussing the use of dynamite in the Yablonski murders. An objection was interposed and sustained. <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>Appellant takes the position that the objection was sustained because to speak of dynamite as a means to murder Yablonski was outside the scope of the conspiracy, since Huddleston testified that appellant had ruled out the use of dynamite. When Smith was called as a witness, the defense objected, stating that Smith could not testify as to the dynamite as a means of killing Yablonski, since appellant had ruled this out as a means of murder; this objection was overruled. We find no error in this regard. Smith’s testimony was admissible to prove a conspiracy on the part of appellant to murder Yablonski, regardless of the means used, and it further tended to corroborate the testimony of the prior Commonwealth Witness, Huddleston.

We do not agree.</p>

Appellant concedes that this could be relevant evidence of motive, but argues that he did not know of the lawsuits, so that it could not be a motive for the homicides. We do not agree. The lawsuits were a matter of public record, and since appellant was a high-ranking official in the United Mine Workers Union, he was knowledgeable in this area.</p>

Appellant sought to subpoena Judge Sweet and to compel him to produce the court records concerning co-defendants, An<a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>nette Gilly and Claude Vealey, Silous Huddleston, Paul Gilly and Aubran Wayne Martin. It is appellant’s theory that the Washington County Court records would reveal a pattern of leniency and special treatment toward the above individuals and therefore that such records could be used to impeach the credibility of such witnesses. We do not agree.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>
    </p>
    <p id="b116-4" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[255,701,1163,959]]]'>The scope of the subpoena duces tecum for Judge Sweet was for all court records dealing with co-defendants in the Yablonski murders. It first noted that pursuant to the Act of April 14, 1834, P.L. 333, § 23, 17 P.S. § 1483, the Clerk of Courts of Washington County is proper custodian of that County’s judicial records, and not the President Judge, and therefore the subpoena for court records should have been addressed to the Clerk of Courts of Washington County. Secondly, the Clerk of Courts of Washington County did testify and did produce all the court records concerning Claude Vealey and Silous Huddleston, and appellant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the clerk to establish the existence of any judicial order granting privileges to Claude Vealey or Silous Huddleston. Further, both Vealey and Huddles-ton testified at appellant’s trial and were subjected to cross-examination concerning any possible deals or favorable treatment accorded them.</p>
    <p id="b116-6" data-blocks='[["BL_116.5",116,[245,1710,1155,476]],["BL_117.1",117,[129,319,1150,148]]]'>Appellant also argues the court erred in quashing a subpoena for Mark Sullivan, a newspaper reporter for Time Magazine. Mr. Sullivan had written a story for Time Magazine concerning alleged deals and concessions made by the special prosecutor to Annette Gilly in return for her guilty plea and future testimony. Appellant contends Mr. Sullivan’s testimony was necessary because the “sole issue” in the case against appellant was one of witness credibility. Annette Gilly did not testify <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>at appellant’s trial and, therefore, her credibility could not be an issue. We therefore find no error in the quashing of the subpoena for Mark Sullivan.</p>
    <p id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[129,509,1152,585]]]'>Appellant next argues that the court erred in refusing to conduct a voir dire to determine the competency of William J. Prater to testify. The defense sought to have Prater declared incompetent to testify because of his admitted perjury. This perjury was based upon the fact that Prater had admitted that he lied before a judicial tribunal. We find no error in this denial. The witness had not been convicted of perjury and was, therefore, not incompetent to testify. See Act of May 23, 1887, P.L. 158, § 2(a) ; Act of April 27, 1909, P.L. 179, § 1, 19 P.S. § 682.</p>
    <p id="b117-5" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[131,1135,1151,477]]]'>Appellant next argues that the court erred in refusing to compel the prosecution to call Paul Gilly as a witness or, in the alternative, for the court to call Gilly as its own witness. We do not agree. The prosecution is under no duty to call every witness that it lists on the bill of indictment if that witness’s testimony would be cumulative. In the instant case, Paul Gilly was available for call by the defense and, therefore, we find no error in the actions of the court or prosecution.</p>

We do not agree. Our review of the charge of the court below reveals a complete and explicit explanation dealing with credibility of witnesses, especially the motives and interests of certain witnesses concerning possible leniency in their own cases. The trial judge also specifically reviewed the testimony of Joseph Moyer, Washington County Clerk of Courts, to the effect <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>that in his experience the postponing of sentencing in both the Vealey and Huddleston cases was unusual.</p>
