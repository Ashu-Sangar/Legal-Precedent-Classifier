The complaint alleged that pursuant to the contract Plástico had sprayed the roof of the Stevwings’ residence with a plastic coating material guaranteed by Plástico to prevent water leakage for a period of fifteen <em>years; </em>that following the application of the coating, the roof leaked at the first rainfall and continued to leak despite repeated efforts by Plástico to cure the defects in the roof’s coating.

The seven copies were identical in every respect except that one of the two “Bank Copies” contained the notice of assignment and the warning notice on the reverse side. That copy was sent to appellants with no cover letter or other indication that it contained anything not contained in the “Buyer’s Copy” which appellants had already been given at the time they signed the contract. Upon receipt of such a document, even the most cautious buyer could reasonably assume it to be an exact copy of the original contract and never examine it further, or even turn it over to see what might be on the other side. To consider the mailing of that copy of the installment contract as the giving of the <em>warning notice </em>legally required is contrary to the purpose of Section 208 — to <em>actually </em>put the consumer on notice that one must act within fifteen days.

Under Section 208, however, unless proper notice of assignment (including the fifteen day warning notice) is given to the consumer “(n)o right of action or defense . . . which would be cut off by assignment, shall be cut off by assignment . .” Therefore, if the assignee fails to comply with the notice requirement of Section 208, the consumer retains the right to bring any such action or to raise any such defense against the assignee. Section 409 of the Pennsylvania Home Improvement Act prevents the certificate of completion signed by the consumer from operating as an estoppel, assuming it otherwise would constitute an estoppel.

The contract was entitled “Pennsylvania Home Improvement Installment Contract And Note.” The contract contained a promise on the part of the buyer (the Stevwings in the present case)_to pay a certain sum in specified monthly installments over a period of 36 months.

This claim is not stressed on appeal, and in any event would not prevail. Relying upon the testimony of a bank officer, the chancellor, affirmed by the court en banc, found that the notice had indeed been sent by WPNB on April 2, 1971. Because the record reveals adequate evidence to support this finding, it has the “force and effect of a jury’s verdict and will not be disturbed on appeal.” <em>Snow v.
