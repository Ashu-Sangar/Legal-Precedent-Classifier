    <p id="b582-4" data-blocks='[["BL_582.4",582,[234,614,1160,1429]]]'>We are also of the view that the term “catastrophe” is sufficiently precise to designate the extent of the harm sought to be presented by this section. Reading sections (a) and (b) together, it is clear that the forces or substances intended to be regulated are those which are capable “of causing . . . widespread injury or damage”. Thus, construing Section (b) in accordance with the fair import of its terms the word “catastrophe” is intended to be synonymous with “widespread injury or damage.” Among the meanings offered for the word, “catastrophe” in Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. 1966), is “an extraordinary disaster”. Roget’s Thesaurus (Garden City Books, Revised Ed.1936), supplies “calamity” and “disaster” as suitable synonyms. We believe that the term “catastrophe” as used here conveys not only a quantitative but a qualitative distinction. The degree of precision is comparable in our judgment to the well-known distinction between a simple assault and an aggravated assault. The fact that the latter terms are more familiar in our system of jurisprudence is of little consequence. As courts and juries were able to distinguish the qualitative difference between simple and aggravated assault, so too will they be able to discern conduct that creates the risk of a catastrophe.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_9" id="ref_footnote_1_9">11</a>
