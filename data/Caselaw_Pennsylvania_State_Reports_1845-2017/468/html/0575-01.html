The well-established test for determining the sufficiency of the evidence for a criminal conviction is “whether, viewing all the evidence admitted at trial in the light most favorable to the Com<a id="p580" href="#p580" data-label="580" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*580</a>monwealth and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, there is sufficient evidence to enable the trier of fact to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” <em>Commonwealth v.

Viewed in this light, the evidence reveals the following pertinent facts.</p>
    <p id="b648-4" data-blocks='[["BL_648.4",648,[232,643,1151,971]]]'>At the time of the events in question, Robinson and his wife were separated, but he had repeatedly threatened to kill her if she did not return to him. On the evening of May 26, 1973, he arrived at the bar where she worked and indicated his desire to see her. When informed that she was late for work, he engaged her employer, Harris, in a conversation during the course of which he accused Harris of having an affair with his wife, which Harris denied. When Mrs. Robinson subsequently arrived, Robinson attempted to speak with her, but she ignored him and went into the office to hang up her coat. When she returned to the bar, her husband again attempted to talk to her, but she told him that she had to work. At this point Harris came out of the storage room and asked Robinson to leave his wife alone because she had a job to do. Robinson replied that he was “not going to start any trouble in your place of business” and walked out the dqgr.</p>
    <p id="b648-5" data-blocks='[["BL_648.5",648,[232,1636,1146,695]],["BL_649.1",649,[154,317,1151,315]]]'>A patron of the bar who was seated near the window, however, observed Robinson removing an object from the glove compartment of his parked car, and, within three or four minutes, Robinson returned with a gun in his hand, walked up to the bar, and asked Harris what he was going to do now. He then turned to his right and shot Ortiz, a customer who was seated on a nearby bar-stool. As Ortiz attempted to rise, Robinson shot him again. He next shot his wife in the shoulder as she attempted to flee and shot Harris in the back as he attempted to come to the aid of Mrs. Robinson. Robinson pulled his wife, bleeding profusely, toward the door. She begged him not to shoot again, but he repeated three <a id="p581" href="#p581" data-label="581" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*581</a>times the words, “I told you I would kill you.” He placed the gun against her heart, but she managed to twist loose as he shot again, and the bullet entered under her left arm. She fell to the floor, and, as she attempted to rise, he shot her again in the right side and fled the premises.</p>
    <p id="b649-4" data-blocks='[["BL_649.4",649,[147,656,1151,808]]]'>Robinson was subsequently apprehended in his car by the police after an extensive chase. On the seat beside him was a .25 caliber automatic revolver which was then unloaded but cocked. He was taken to the Crozier-Chester Medical Center to be identified by the victims. When his wife identified him, he looked at her and said, “Die.” Mrs. Robinson and Harris eventually recovered from their wounds. One of the bullets which struck Ortiz, however, caused severe damage to the spinal area and left his legs paralyzed. After an operation during which one bullet was removed from his thoracic spine and another from his leg, his vital signs were good, and he was subsequently transferred to the Veterans Administration Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, for further treatment. He died there on June 11, 1973.</p>
    <p id="b649-5" data-blocks='[["BL_649.5",649,[149,1487,1151,470]]]'>An autopsy revealed that over an inch of Ortiz’s spinal cord had degenerated and his lungs had filled with fluid. The doctor who conducted the autopsy opined that the swelling caused by the gunshot wound had interfered with the blood supply to the spinal cord, and that this in turn had caused a gradual paralysis of the respiratory muscles so that the “actual mode of death was probably a respiratory one.” He stated he was certain the gunshot wound was the cause of death.</p>

Aside from the evidence of the shooting itself, there was no direct evidence that Robinson was antagonistic toward Ortiz or indeed that he was even aware of his existence.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The evidence, however, clearly does not indicate that Robinson fired at random when he shot Ortiz. Rather, Harris testified that Robinson turned to his right, pointed the gun at Ortiz and fired, and that, after both Ortiz and the stool on which he was sitting toppled to the floor, Robinson shot him again as he tried to get up. The evidence is uncontroverted that Ortiz was indeed shot twice. From these facts the jury could properly find beyond a reasonable doubt the specific intent to kill necessary to convict appellant of first-degree murder. As this Court has previously stated: “ ‘The use of a deadly weapon directed at a vital organ of another human being justifies a factual <a id="p583" href="#p583" data-label="583" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*583</a>presumption that the actor intended death unless the testimony contains additional evidence that would demonstrate a contrary intent.’ ” <em>Commonwealth v. Bricker, </em><a href="/pa/458/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="458 Pa. 367" data-case-ids="479712" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0367-01">458 Pa. 367</a>, 371-72, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20279" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="326 A.2d 279">326 A.2d 279</a> (1974), quoting from <em>Commonwealth v.

In the instant case there was no additional evidence demonstrating a contrary intent. Rather, the evidence that Robinson shot Ortiz twice, with an interval between the two shots,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a> established the inference of a specific intent to kill — willful, deliberate and premeditated. It is well-settled that the period of premeditation necessary to form the requisite specific intent may be very brief. <em>Commonwealth v. Carroll, </em><a href="/pa/412/0525-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="412 Pa. 525" data-case-ids="1887249" data-case-paths="/pa/412/0525-01">412 Pa. 525</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=194%20A.2d%20911" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="194 A.2d 911">194 A.2d 911</a> (1963); <em>Commonwealth v.

In addition, although proof of a motive is not necessary to establish a specific intent to kill, the jury from the testimony might reasonably have inferred that Robinson deliberately intended to vent his malice toward his wife and Harris, both of whom had indicated to him before he left to get his gun that he was interfering with the bar’s business, not only against them directly, but against a customer of the bar as well.</p>
    <p id="b651-4" data-blocks='[["BL_651.4",651,[135,1596,1152,587]],["BL_652.1",652,[254,319,1151,693]]]'>Next, because the physician who operated on Ortiz and treated him subsequently at the Crozier-Chester Medical Center testified that the patient’s vital signs were good after the operation and that his condition was subsequently good enough for him to survive a transfer to the hospital in Delaware, and because “the Commonwealth failed to produce one scintilla of evidence concerning any event from the transfer of Louis Ortiz from Crozier-Chester Medical Center to the Veterans Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware to the actual autopsy,” Robinson argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove <a id="p584" href="#p584" data-label="584" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*584</a>beyond a reasonable doubt that the gunshot wound he inflicted upon Ortiz caused his death. Robinson overlooks, however, the additional testimony of the doctor who performed the operation that, though Ortiz’s vital signs were good after the operation, the severity of his injury had left him in <em>“a </em>very fragile condition,” and that the doctor had not been surprised to learn that Ortiz had subsequently died in Delaware. Further, the doctor who performed the autopsy not only concluded with certainty that the gunshot wound was the cause of death, but he supported this conclusion with extensive testimony of his findings and the reasons for his conclusion and indicated that he had found nothing inconsistent with it.</p>

It is clear, however, that where there is medical testimony that establishes the chain of causation with the degree of certainty found in the instant case, the evidence is sufficient for the jury to find the requisite causation beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the Commonwealth is not required to prove that a merely hypothetical supervening event did not take place. See <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em><a href="/pa/450/0158-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="450 Pa. 158" data-case-ids="1947033" data-case-paths="/pa/450/0158-01">450 Pa. 158</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=299%20A.2d%20643" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="299 A.2d 643">299 A.2d 643</a> (1973). Further, even where there is evidence tending to show an independent supervening cause of death, the jury is not required to accept it if there is also sufficient evidence that the accused caused the death. See <em>Commonwealth v. Webb, </em><a href="/pa/449/0490-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="449 Pa. 490" data-case-ids="1945672" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0490-01">449 Pa. 490</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=296%20A.2d%20734" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="296 A.2d 734">296 A.2d 734</a> (1972). Moreover, even if the wound inflicted by the accused is not in itself mortal and a subsequent event is found to be the immediate cause of death, the accused does not escape legal liability if his act started an unbroken chain of causation leading to the death. <em>Commonwealth v.

At trial the defense offered the testimony of Dr. Fillinger, the assistant medical examiner of Philadelphia, who, after examining the medical records alone, stated that he was unable to give an opinion as to the cause of death “from the information supplied to me.” In addition, defense counsel was permitted to argue extensively to the jury that the gaps in testimony between Ortiz’s departure from the hospital in Chester and the autopsy in Wilmington created a reasonable doubt about the cause of death. Clearly the jury rejected this argument, which it was certainly justified in doing, given the weight of the medical testimony as to causation presented by the Commonwealth. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

If a person wishes to waive his or her right to a speedy trial until counsel of his choice is available to defend, the trial court should not refuse to grant a continuance unless the prosecution can establish that its case will be substantially prejudiced by the additional delay. The majority opinion <em>assumes </em>that the requested delay will prejudice the Commonwealth’s case. Such an assumption should not form the basis for cutting off appellant’s constitutional right to counsel of his choice.
