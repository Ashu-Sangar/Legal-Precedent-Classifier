However, while net earnings may be an important element in valuation, this is not true in all cases. In <em>Commonwealth v.

Here, the book assets of appellant were $9,212,982, with a book equity of $4,713,889 and current earnings of $32,466. Considering the nature and extent of appellant’s enterprise, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court properly determined that the actual value of the capital stock of Spang’s Stores, Inc., on January 31, 1971, was $2,000,000. In disputing this figure the appellant has maintained that the court below reached its valuation figure by considering only net earnings and ac<a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>cordingly the valuation figure established represents an unrealistic capitalization of the corporation’s net earnings. It is clear, however, that the court below did not rely solely on the corporation’s net earnings to reach the valuation figure, but rather took into consideration the low net earnings and discounted the book value of the corporation’s assets accordingly in reaching its decision on valuation.
