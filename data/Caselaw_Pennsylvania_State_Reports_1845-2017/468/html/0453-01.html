In the course of his search he encountered Herbert’s brother, Gerald Cain and several other persons. From Gerald Cain, Williams learned that someone wanted to purchase marijuana and methedrine, commonly known as “speed”, for the sum of $500. Williams was carrying a .38 caliber snub-nose pistol and “dumdum” bullets which, soon after the encounter with Cain, he exhibited to the group.</p>

En route to the hotel appellant expressed his intention to hold up “somebody” at the hotel. He then gave his gun <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>to Gerald Cain and told him that he was to use it in the holdup; Miss Weintraub, according to the plan formulated by the appellant, was to go into the hotel and pretend to be Gerald Cain’s girl friend. She became frightened, however, and asked to be taken home. Williams told her not to worry because there wouldn’t be any shooting. One of the others in the car, however, explained, “If we have to, we’ll kill them.”</p>

Miss Weintraub slipped away from the others and ran outside. Seeing a police cruiser, she ran up to it and told the officer of the holdup plan, stating that “there was going to be some shooting done.” The officer apparently discounted her story and sent her home in a taxicab.</p>

When Williams saw that Miss Weintraub was not with Cain, he went inside the hotel to look for her. He there telephoned his apartment and talked with one David Hunt. Williams asked Hunt if he knew where he (Williams) could purchase some marijuana or methedrine. When Hunt answered in the negative, Williams asked him if he wanted to rob the guy he was with who, Williams said, had $500. Hunt replied that “stickups weren’t my thing,” but that two other men then in the apartment, Daniel (“Little Dan”) Clark and Calvin (“Pepper”) Williams, had overheard the conversation and were interested in the robbery plan. These two suggested a “shooting gallery” <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> on Irving Street as a place to stage the hold-up. Williams then spoke to Pepper and Little Dan directly. He told them that he would meet them at the “shooting gallery” and would <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>slip his gun to one of them. He also told them that he wanted it to appear that he was the target of the robbery.</p>
    <p id="b525-4" data-blocks='[["BL_525.4",525,[175,460,1161,969]]]'>Appellant returned to his car and drove, with Gerald Cain and Glenn Edwards, to the Irving Street address. There they were greeted by Little Dan and Pepper, and the latter led everyone to the back of the darkened house. When they reached a backroom, appellant gave his gun to Pepper. Pepper grabbed Edwards by the arm, threw him up against the wall and commanded him to “get it up.” He repeated the order a second time, then shot Edwards in the head and proceeded to rob him of his money. While this was going on, Little Dan fled, followed shortly by the others. Williams and Cain ran to Williams’ car and drove away. They came upon Pepper at the corner of 52d and Locust Streets, and appellant asked him what he had done with the gun. Pepper replied that he had thrown it away in a vacant lot. At Williams’ direction Pepper then retrieved the gun and returned it to the appellant, who placed it in the glove compartment of his car.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[173,1454,1153,743]]]'>Williams, Pepper, and Cain drove to appellant’s apartment, where David Hunt and Little Dan had preceded them. Pepper took the Edwards money from his pocket and, after counting it, announced that he was taking $115, was giving $45 to Little Dan, and that Williams and Cain should divide the remaining $70. Cain and the appellant took their shares, left the apartment and drove to Cain’s apartment in Bryn Mawr where appellant stayed the night. The next morning he drove to his mother’s house in Philadelphia where he hid the gun in a metal box in his sister’s bedroom. Two days later he was arrested outside of his apartment building on Walnut Street, having been pointed out to the police by Gerald Cain.</p>

It is his contention that the trial judge committed reversible error by cross-examining him in such a manner as to convey to the jury the impression that the judge did not believe appellant’s testimony, and thereby effectively removed from the jury’s consideration the question of appellant’s credibility.</p>

Our reasons for this conclusion follow.</p>
    <p id="b528-11" data-blocks='[["BL_528.10",528,[230,1755,1153,585]],["BL_529.1",529,[175,295,1154,308]]]'>As noted above, appellant denied that he had been accorded his constitutional warnings prior to being questioned by the police. It is also important to note that he denied the accuracy of crucial inculpatory portions of the resulting statements. While admitting that large portions of the confessions were true, Williams contended on the stand that they also contained statements attributed to him which he had not made. Two of these variances are of particular significance: First, Williams denied stating that he knew that the victim, Glenn Edwards, was to be robbed; on the stand he maintained that he be<a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>lieved that the sole purpose of the meeting in the Irving Street “shooting gallery” was to purchase drugs. Second, he denied having stated that he had <em>given </em>the gun to Pepper Williams immediately prior to the shooting; rather he testified that Pepper <em>snatched </em>the gun from Williams’ belt.</p>
    <p id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[174,640,1158,803]]]'>In light of these denials and variances, it is apparent that one of the crucial issues facing the jury was the weight, if any, it should give to the confessions. If, as he claimed, appellant had not been advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the statements should be disregarded altogether. If, on the other hand, the jury were to conclude that Williams had been given the constitutional warnings, it would be entitled to consider the statements. Williams’ entire defense rested upon his claim that he was, as he asked the trial judge to charge, merely a “terrified onlooker” at the robbery-murder of Glenn Edwards. The confessions, however, painted an entirely different picture as to appellant’s knowledge of the criminal purpose for the meeting with Edwards and appellant’s active participation in the robbery-murder.</p>
    <p id="b529-5" data-blocks='[["BL_529.5",529,[177,1491,1154,640]],["BL_530.1",530,[252,300,1153,640]]]'>Appellant’s denials of complicity at trial were not completely lacking in verisimilitude since no signed waiver of rights form was introduced into evidence and the statements themselves were unsigned.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Much, therefore, depended upon the jury’s assessment of the credibility of the defendant. The judge’s reference to a gun at the defendant’s back indicated quite clearly to the jury the judge’s own disbelief of appellant’s allegations that he had not been advised of his constitutional rights and that he had been denied his right to speak with a lawyer. A question so partisan in nature, although perhaps excusable if made by opposing counsel on cross-<a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>examination,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a> has no place in a judge’s conduct of a trial, particularly a trial for murder.

      <em>“Witnesses should be interrogated by the judge only when he conceives the interest of justice so requires. </em>It is better to permit counsel to bring out the evidence and clear up disputed points on cross-examination unaided by the court; but where an important fact is in<a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>definite or a disputed point needs to be clarified, the court may see that it is done by taking part in the examination. <em>The practice of a judge entering into the trial of a case as an advocate is emphatically disapproved. The judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person to whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, and from whom the litigants expect, absolute impartiality. An expression indicative of favor or condemnation is quickly reflected in the jury box and at the counsel table. To depart from the clear line of duty through questions, expressions or conduct, contravenes the orderly administration of justice. It has a tendency to take from one of the parties the right to a fair and impartial trial, as guaranteed under our system of jurisprudence. Judges should </em>refrain from extended examination of witnesses; they should <em>not, during the trial, indicate </em>an opinion on the merits, <em>a doubt as to the witnesses’ credibility, </em>or do anything to indicate a leaning to one side or the other, without explaining to the jury that all these matters are for them.” (emphasis added)</blockquote>
