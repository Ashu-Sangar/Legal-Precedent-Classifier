After the trial and before sentencing, the court ordered that a pre-sentence investigation report be prepared and that a psychiatric examination be conducted. See Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1403. This was done to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed and was not at the request of counsel for the defense. The psychiatric report revealed that Phillips was then laboring under a mental disability diagnosed as “Schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type in acute state”. The report recommended that he should be immediately hospitalized for further evaluation and “intensive” treatment. This report was prepared eight days following the conclusion of the trial. Regrettably, the report did not address itself to the doctors’ opinion as to Phillips’ competency during trial.</p>
    <p id="b470-4" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[267,1153,1153,311]]]'>In accordance with the recommendation, appellant was committed to the State Maximum Security Forensic Diagnostic Hospital at Holmesburg Prison for a period of 60 days. The report resulting from that hospitalization provided in pertinent part, the following diagnostic formulation :</p>
    <blockquote id="b470-5" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[299,1496,1119,639]]]'>“Personality Disorder — Mixed Type with schizoid and antisocial features. This disorder is manifested by lack of emotional response, narcissism, little regard for others, ineffective functioning in social and educational areas, minimal ego strength, and little capacity to avoid being easily led by others. Although he may have shown some symptoms of an acute psychotic process in the past few months, his present mental status is somewhat improved and he does not appear to be overtly psychotic. It is possible that he is in partial remission from a schizophrenic illness, but that diagnosis cannot be made with certainty at this time.”</blockquote>

Jablon, Clinical Director of the Holmesburg Prison Diagnostic Hospital, although testi<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>fying that appellant was, as of that time, competent to participate in legal proceedings, refused to offer an opinion as to his competency at the time of the trial of the cause. The sentencing hearing was held three months thereafter.</p>

We will retain jurisdiction of this appeal pending adjudication of appellant’s competence during trial. Following the competency determination, the parties may, if they so desire, have 30 days in which to file supplemental briefs in this Court. Further the Court is directed to permit examination of appellant by an independent psychiatrist designated by the defense. Cost of said examination to be borne by the Commonwealth.</p>
