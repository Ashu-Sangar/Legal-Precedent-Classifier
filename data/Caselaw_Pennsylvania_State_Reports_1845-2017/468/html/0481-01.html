Post-trial motions were filed and denied by a court en banc. On May 21, 1975, the court imposed a sentence of not less than one year nor more than four years in the Bucks County Prison for the conviction of murder in the second degree and concurrent sentences of not less than one year nor more than four years on the convictions for aggravated assault and battery and assault with intent to kill. Appellant appealed the murder conviction to this court and appealed the convictions for aggravated assault and battery and assault with intent to kill to the Superior Court, which in turn certified the record to this court on July 1,1975.</p>

And is there anything in this case other than the argument of Mr. LaHoda, to suggest that this was some kind of a cover-up, that Mr. Cooper was, somehow, going to take the rap for his wife.

They got up by the shopping center and Mr. Cooper told Mrs. Cooper about hitting with the sandal and she suggested that they go back and be truthful about that. You will recall up to this point the autopsy had not been finished, so that nobody knew the cause of the child’s death simply because all of the evidence wasn’t in.</blockquote>
