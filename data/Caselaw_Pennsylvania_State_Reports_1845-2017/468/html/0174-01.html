In his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Eagen states that the statutory language allowing the Bureau to establish pre-release centers “at such locations ... as [it] may deem necessary” expresses a legislative intent that the Bureau is not to be bound by local zoning regulations. This contention is not persuasive for several reasons. First, there is no indication in the statute, nor is there a legislative history, showing that the Legislature ever considered how conflicts with local zoning requirements are to be resolved. Second, if the Legislature intended that the Bureau site selection was to transcend local land use regulation, it could have expressed that intention in more definite ways, e. g., by clear language to that effect or by the grant of eminent domain. Third, in the enactment of prior legislation concerning the construction of such institutions, the Legislature itself made specific provisions for site selection. See, e. g., Act of July 29, 1953, P.L. 1435, § 2, 61 P.S. § 912 (1965); Act of June 21, 1937, P.L. 1944, § 1, 61 P.S. § 545-1 (1965); Act of June 12, 1931, P.L. 512, § 6, 61 P.S. § 732 (1965); Act of May 1, 1915, P.L. 212, §§ 2-4; Act of July 25, 1913, P.L. 1311, §§ 1-5; Act of May 18, 1945, P.L. 815, § 2, 71 P. S. § 1519.32 (1962). Because the Legislature was not itself making the site selection or delegating that responsibility to the Department of Welfare or the Department of Property and Supplies, it included the language quoted by the dissent to make clear that the Board of Corrections, not some other Commonwealth Department, would select the sites. Thus, this brief statutory authorization only designates what Commonwealth department should supervise site selection and does not authorize the disruption of local zoning ordinances.</p>

And its decision may place the center anywhere in the Commonwealth but may be subject to other statutory enactments where we can discern the Legislature intended the other enactments to take precedence.

Undoubtedly the Legislature could have explicitly stated that the Bureau’s determinations as to locations shall not be subject to local zoning.

However, the lack of such explicit language in the grant of authority to school boards did not deter this Court from ruling contrary to the position adopted by Mr. Justice Roberts when it decided <em>Pemberton Appeal, </em>supra.

Moreover, the presence or absence of eminent domain power is not a valid consideration. In <em>Pemberton Appeal, </em>supra, this Court did not mention or in any way rely on the power of school boards to exercise eminent domain in deciding that case.

That the language there was <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>more explicit is correct, but it does not follow that the language involved in this appeal is not explicit enough to determine the legislative intent to override local zoning. Moreover, in <em>Pemberton Appeal, </em>supra, the Legislature did not state why it was granting to school boards the power to override local zoning. Instantly, it did. The statute states that the power is granted to insure that effective programs will be implemented. And contrary to Mr. Justice Roberts’ assertion that this dissent confuses the issue into whether today’s decision results in prerelease centers being less conducive to rehabilitation, this dissent clearly recognizes the issue as one of ascertaining the legislative intent in order to determine if the specific power was intended to be granted to the Bureau to override local zoning in locating pre-release centers. The reference to conducive locations is made because it reveals the legislative wisdom in granting the Bureau this power, because the statute expressly reveals this as the purpose in granting this power when it states the Bureau has the power in order to carry out effective programs, and because ascertaining the legislative purpose in order to determine its intent is a well-established rule of statutory construction, particularly, where, as here, the purpose is revealed in express terms.</p>
