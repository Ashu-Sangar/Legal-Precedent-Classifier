Post verdict motions were filed and denied. Perry was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction, was given a suspended sentence on the conspiracy conviction, ten to twenty years imprisonment on the aggravated robbery conviction and ten to twenty years imprisonment on the burglary conviction. The sentences on the burglary and robbery convictions were to run concurrently with one another but both were to run consecutively to the sentence on the murder conviction.

The first, later identified as the appellant Perry, ordered a beer and then left. Shortly thereafter, he returned and sat down toward the front of the bar. The second man, identified by the barmaid as Joseph Watson with whom the barmaid attended school, entered through the side door armed with a shotgun. Watson announced that there was to be a robbery and the two men ordered all the patrons into the restrooms at the rear of the bar. One patron, Douglas Alexander, an off-duty police officer, waited for the other patrons to get to the rear of the bar, then drew his service revolver and shot Watson in the left thigh. Watson fired his weapon at Alexander and fatally wounded him. Perry helped Watson to leave the bar and the two then fled in a stolen automobile.</p>

Perry’s girl friend helped him to secure bandages for Watson but told Perry that she wanted Watson and the gun out of her house when possible. On February 10th, Perry helped Watson out of the apartment and led him to a porch across the street where he would be found and given medical attention. Perry was confident that Watson would not implicate him. However, when the police, who were looking for Watson from the personal identification given by the barmaid, questioned Watson in the hospital, he gave a statement which not only incriminated himself but implicated Perry and gave the police an address where he might be found. Patrolmen were radioed, told of the information received from Watson and directed to apprehend Perry. The officers entered the apartment where Perry was located and arrested him without a warrant.</p>

Futch, </em><a href="/pa/447/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="447 Pa. 389" data-case-ids="1942994" data-case-paths="/pa/447/0389-01">447 Pa. 389</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=290%20A.2d%20417" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="290 A.2d 417">290 A.2d 417</a> (1972) and its progeny. The chronology of the arrest and statement is as follows. Perry was arrested at approximately 11:35 a. m. on February 10, 1972. He was taken to the Police Administration Building, arriving at twelve noon. He was given the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and questioned concerning his involvement in the robbery and shooting. Almost immediately, without ever denying complicity, Perry began a narrative of the events leading up to the robbery beginning with the day before when he and Watson robbed another bar. His statement continued into the events leading up to his arrest the day following the shooting of Alexander. The statement was recorded in the interviewing officer’s handwriting and was read and signed by Perry sometime between three and four p. m. on February 10th. Perry was further questioned until approximately 10:00 p. m. <a id="p520" href="#p520" data-label="520" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*520</a>and he was arraigned shortly after 11:00 p. m. on February 10th.</p>
    <p id="b588-4" data-blocks='[["BL_588.4",588,[232,465,1150,581]]]'> This Court, on several occasions, has said that the relevant time period to be considered in determining whether an unnecessary delay has occurred is the time between arrest and the making of the initial incriminating statements. <em>Commonwealth v. Rowe, </em><a href="/pa/459/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="459 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="481025" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0163-01">459 Pa. 163</a>, <a href="/pa/459/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="459 Pa. 163" data-case-ids="481025" data-case-paths="/pa/459/0163-01">327 A.2d 358</a> (1974). Here, there was no such unnecessary delay. Perry incriminated himself immediately upon being questioned and the recorded statement which he signed between three and four hours after arriving at the Police Administration Building merely repeated what he said earlier.</p>
    <p id="b588-5" data-blocks='[["BL_588.5",588,[226,1090,1157,1132]]]'>Second, Perry alleges that his statement should be suppressed since the arresting officers were not acting on probable cause when he was arrested without a warrant. Probable cause exists if “the facts and circumstances which are within the knowledge of the officer at the time of arrest, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the suspect has committed or is committing a crime.” <em>Commonwealth v. Culmer, </em><a href="/pa/463/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="463 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1708123" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0189-01">463 Pa. 189</a>, <a href="/pa/463/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="463 Pa. 189" data-case-ids="1708123" data-case-paths="/pa/463/0189-01">344 A.2d 487</a>, 490 (1975). Here, since the arresting officer was directed to apprehend Perry, although he was fully informed of Watson’s statement, the operative question is whether the officer who directed that the arrest be made had information sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. <em>Commonwealth v. Kenney, </em><a href="/pa/449/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="449 Pa. 562" data-case-ids="1945618" data-case-paths="/pa/449/0562-01">449 Pa. 562</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=297%20A.2d%20794" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="297 A.2d 794">297 A.2d 794</a> (1972). Since the officer who directed the arrest had received information directly from Perry’s co-felon implicating himself and Perry, that officer indeed had probable cause. <em>Commonwealth v. Kenney, </em>supra. Accordingly, this assignment is without merit.</p>

He bases his contention substantially on Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100. Although Perry was arrested on February 10, 1972 and was not tried until April 22, 1974, it is the date of a written complaint which controls the applicability of Rule 1100. Here, a written complaint was filed on February 12, 1972, well before the effective date of Rule 1100. Therefore, since Rule 1100 operates prospectively only, see Commonwealth v. <em>Roundtree, </em><a href="/pa/458/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="458 Pa. 351" data-case-ids="479769" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0351-01">458 Pa. 351</a>, 355, n. 6, <a href="/citations/?q=326%20A.2d%20285" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="326 A.2d 285">326 A.2d 285</a>, 287, n. 6 (1974), Perry cannot claim its protection.</p>

The suppression court granted the motion and took the motion to suppress under advisement, “briefs to be submitted.” The motion to suppress was denied on October 9, 1973. On September 11, 1973, the defense filed two additional motions. One motion was for a change of venue and the second to suppress identification evidence.

Such a rule ignores that judges throughout the Commonwealth know and are known by many people, some of whom may eventually be the victims of crime, and assumes that no judge can remain impartial when presiding in such a case.

This is another reason why recusal is necessary when the judge has contact with a case outside his courtroom. As Justice Frankfurter stated, explaining his voluntary recusal in a case before the United States Supreme Court:</p>
    <blockquote id="b600-8" data-blocks='[["BL_600.8",600,[328,1820,1109,528]]]'>“[Rjeason cannot control the subconscious influence of feelings of which it is unaware. When there is ground for believing that such unconscious feelings may operate in the ultimate judgment, or may not unfairly lead others to believe they are operating, judges recuse themselves. They do not sit in judgment. They do this for a variety of reasons. The guiding consideration is that the administration of justice should reasonably appear to be disinterested as well as be so in fact.”</blockquote>

Appellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, conspiracy, aggravated robbery and burglary. The jury imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction. The judge, at the sentencing hearing for the other crimes, imposed maximum sentences of ten to twenty years imprisonment for the robbery and burglary convictions. He directed that these sentences run consecutively to each other and to the life sentence. Thus, appellant is to serve twenty to forty years imprisonment after he serves his life sentence. These were the most severe penalties the judge could impose for these offenses. Because of the trial judge’s contact with this case outside of the courtroom, his impartiality at the sentencing hearing could reasonably be questioned.</p>
