    <p id="b542-7" data-blocks='[["BL_542.8",542,[261,900,1161,471]]]'>On July 15, 1974 Appellant was convicted by a jury of murder of the second degree, and subsequently sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than ten years nor more than twenty years. The basis of his appeal from the judgment is the refusal of the trial court to charge, as requested, on the elements of voluntary manslaughter. We agree with appellant that the court below was in error in refusing so to charge, and accordingly reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>
