    <p id="b688-9" data-blocks='[["BL_688.10",688,[252,1188,1149,261]]]'>This appeal by the Commonwealth arises from the granting of a motion in arrest of judgment and discharge of the appellee, David Eugene Slaybaugh, on a charge of “failing to stop at the scene of an accident.” Act of April 29, 1959, P.L. 58, § 1027, 75 P.S. § 1027.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a>

    <p id="b688-10" data-blocks='[["BL_688.11",688,[241,1470,1157,426]]]'>The facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On January 20,1974, an automobile operated by Harry Lambert was involved in a minor traffic accident. The car which collided with the Lambert vehicle did not stop. Lambert followed the vehicle and found the car abandoned nearby; he wrote the license number on a piece of paper and reported the accident and license number to the state police.</p>

Section 1212 of The Vehicle Code, Act of April 29, 1959, P.L. 58, § 1212, as amended, 75 P.S. § 1212, provides that the owner of a motor vehicle is “presumed” to be the operator at the time of any violation of the Motor Vehicle Code if the Commonwealth introduces into evidence the registration card for the vehicle; provided that such a result is not required if the owner takes the stand and denies operation of the vehicle at the time of the accident and names, if known to him, the driver.</p>
    <p id="b689-4" data-blocks='[["BL_689.4",689,[158,969,1150,533]]]'>Appellee took the stand and testified that he was not driving at the time of the accident, but that he did not know who was driving and further that numerous persons had access to his automobile.

The Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, which certified the record to this court for disposition. The basis for granting the motion in arrest of judgment by the court below was its determination that § 1212 of The Vehicle Code was unconstitutional because it created a presumption that the owner of a motor vehicle was the operator of that vehicle at the time of a violation of The Vehicle Code, if the prosecution established mere ownership of the motor vehicle. Moreover, the court below found that § 1212 shifted the burden of proof to a criminal defendant to rebut the presumption of his operating the vehicle because of mere ownership. <a id="p622" href="#p622" data-label="622" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*622</a>Section 1212 of The Vehicle Code constituted the only “evidence of operation” against the appellee.</p>

      <a id="p623" href="#p623" data-label="623" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*623</a>The starting point of our analysis is whether the above section creates a statutory inference or an impermissible criminal statutory presumption. In <em>Commonwealth v. DiFrancesco, </em><a href="/pa/458/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="458 Pa. 188" data-case-ids="479735" data-case-paths="/pa/458/0188-01">458 Pa. 188</a>, at 193, n. 3, <a href="/citations/?q=329%20A.2d%20204" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="329 A.2d 204">329 A.2d 204</a>, 207 n. 3 (1974), this court explained the characteristics of both inferences and presumptions:</p>
    <blockquote id="b691-4" data-blocks='[["BL_691.6",691,[190,639,1106,1243]]]'>“ . . .an inference is merely a logical tool which permits the trier of fact to proceed from one fact to another. A presumption, on the other hand, is a procedural device which not only permits an inference of the 'presumed’ fact, but also shifts to the opposing party the burden of producing evidence to disprove the presumed fact. Failure to meet this burden of production will normally result in binding instructions on the issue of the presumed fact’s existence in favor of the party invoking the presumption. But the notion of a directed verdict against a criminal defendant is. contrary to accepted tenets of criminal, justice. Placing the burden of production on a defendant under the threat of such a sanction would run afoul of the presumption of innocence, see <em>Commonwealth v. Bonomo, </em><a href="/pa/396/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="396 Pa. 222" data-case-ids="1284928" data-case-paths="/pa/396/0222-01">396 Pa. 222</a>, 229-30, <a href="/citations/?q=151%20A.2d%20441" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="151 A.2d 441">151 A.2d 441</a>, 445-46 (1959), as well as the defendant’s privilege of declining to testify. Thus, where the presumed fact comprises an element of the crime charged, the inference authorized by a presumption can never be compelled by the court. See generally <em>Commonwealth v. Turner, </em><a href="/pa/456/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="456 Pa. 116" data-case-ids="584444" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0116-01">456 Pa. 116</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=317%20A.2d%20298" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="317 A.2d 298">317 A.2d 298</a> (1974).” At page 193, 329 A.2d at page 207.</blockquote>
