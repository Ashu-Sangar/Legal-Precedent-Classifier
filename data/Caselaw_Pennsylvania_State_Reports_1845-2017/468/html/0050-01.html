In March 1973, John was charged with committing certain crimes and fled Pennsylvania to New York. John and Rochelle were caring for three children at that time — Josephine and Michael, born out of wedlock to John and Muriel Kapcsos,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> and Jonathan, born out of wedlock to John and Rochelle. Shortly after John left Pennsylvania, Rochelle became ill, and, because her illness was believed to have been caused by an attempted suicide, she was placed in a mental hospital for observation. On March 13, an employee of welfare services visited Rochelle at the hospital and asked her to consent to welfare services taking custody of the three children. Welfare services was not aware at that time that Rochelle was the mother of only one of the children — Jonathan. Rochelle acceded to welfare services’ request. She stated that she was planning to move to New York City to reunite with John as soon as she left the hospital and would want to be reunited with the children after she set up housekeeping.</p>
    <p id="b123-4" data-blocks='[["BL_123.4",123,[94,1410,1153,526]]]'>On May 29, 1973, Rochelle telephoned welfare services and requested custody of Jonathan. Neither John nor Rochelle made any inquiries concerning the two older children. Welfare services instructed her to appear before the New York City welfare department so that an investigation could be made of her living conditions. Rochelle followed these instructions and, in July 1973, the New York City welfare department reported to welfare services in Cambria County that Jonathan should not be returned to Rochelle.</p>

Apparently, the principal obstacle to reunion was the lack of adequate housing. John worked as an apartment <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>manager and had only a limited salary. Their apartment was furnished as part of his salary. John and Rochelle asked his employer for a larger apartment.</p>

Neither parent expressed any interest in Josephine’s or Michael’s welfare or any desire to be reunited with them during their absence from Pennsylvania. John never informed welfare services of his location either while in New York or while in prison in Cambria County.
