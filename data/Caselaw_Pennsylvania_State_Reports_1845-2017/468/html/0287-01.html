I., who was the second youngest child, and her six brothers and sisters were removed from appellant’s home. The removal occurred after numerous attempts by school officials and social workers to provide adequate in-home assistance. On May 12, 1967, the Lawrence County Juvenile Court awarded custody of the children to the Lawrence County Child Welfare Services (hereinafter “welfare services”).</p>
    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[228,1355,1153,747]]]'>R. I.’s removal was prompted by circumstances which seriously endangered her welfare. She suffered from malnutrition at the time of removal: she was extremely underweight, had a hole in her chest, was unable to swallow her food, and was unable to move her bowels. In addition, R. I. had numerous bleeding sores on her body; her scalp was covered with scabs; and her hair was matted in these scabs. On at least one occasion all of the children were found sleeping on a concrete floor. There was testimony, which the hearing court chose to believe despite appellant’s denial, that this was a regular occurrence.

Her father had a severe alcoholic problem, had lost his job a year before removal and had no prospects or apparent desire for employment in the future. As a result of his refusal to seek work, the family lost its public assistance grant. The lack of financial resources and appellant’s total inability to plan for her family’s care forced her, on at least one occasion, to seek emergency help because she had no funds to buy necessary groceries. In addition, the family had been evicted from their home the month before removal and had been forced to move into quarters totally inadequate for a family of nine. Appellant and her husband had no prospect of obtaining adequate housing in the near future.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a>

Appellant visited R. I. regularly until December 1969, when welfare services refused to allow further visitation rights.

To this end, she and her successors met with appellant on several occasions. The principal conditions for such a reunion were that appellant and her husband must find adequate housing and must exhibit ability to care for the family financially. Originally, welfare services intended to return the children one at a time, beginning with R. I.’s older siblings, gradually reuniting the family as the parents showed an ability to care for the children.</p>
    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[232,915,1156,752]]]'>Appellant made diligent efforts to satisfy these conditions and showed an unswerving devotion to her children. She sought employment and began working long hours to meet the welfare services’ financial requirements. She and her husband also sought a new residence; but, except for one period which lasted only one week, they have never succeeded in finding quarters large enough for more than one or two children. Her efforts have been handicapped by the necessity of caring for her seriously ill husband. His health has deteriorated to such an extent that he seldom leaves his home, but he refuses to seek medical help. He has not sought employment since 1967 and has made no efforts to help appellant regain custody of R. I.</p>

Although she has shown an interest in being reunited with R. I. in the future, her testimony shows agreement with welfare services that such a reunion must be postponed.

R. I.’s physical condition and the condition of her family at the time she was removed from her parents compels a conclusion that she was exposed to “repeated and continued” parental neglect or incapacity to provide essential care and subsistence. Appellant was unable to provide R. I. basic food and shelter. Despite in-home efforts prior to removal, R. I.’s physical condition deteriorated. Her father was indifferent to her plight, and appellant’s efforts were inadequate to change this unfortunate situation. Removal became necessary to protect her <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>welfare. The events of the last eight years offer compelling evidence to support the final requirement, that the causes of the neglect or incapacity cannot or will not be remedied. Appellant, despite her efforts and despite the assistance offered by welfare services, has been unable to remedy the conditions which caused <em>R. </em>I.’s initial removal. Even if we assume that welfare services erred in refusing to allow the older boys to return to their parents, the fact remains that R. I. cannot be cared for by appellant, as appellant herself admits.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_11" id="ref_footnote_1_11">11</a>

There, we held there was not “compelling” evidence to show that the children were “without essential parental care, control or subsistence.” The hearing court had terminated appellant’s parental rights based on disputed testimony by social workers. They stated: that the children’s home was “submarginal” and “was setting a cultural standard which would be a deprivation in the future”; that the parents had serious marital difficulties; that the mother was mentally retarded; and that the family was very poor. However, there was undisputed evidence that the children were not undernourished, received ample food, had adequate clothing and were in generally good health. Thus, the trial court in <em>Geiger </em>sanctioned removal of children from their parents and termination of parental rights merely because the children were poor and culturally deprived.

In dissent, Mr. Justice Manderino states that this Court has always required a showing of “willful misconduct” by the parent before termination of parental rights is permitted. To the contrary, this Court has never used the term willful misconduct and has never imposed any similar requirement. Nor could the statutory language permit such an interpretation. Under section 311 of the Adoption Act, parental rights may be terminated if: (1) a <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>parent “failed to perform parental duties” for a period of six months, or (2) there has been “repeated and continued incapacity [of] the parent” which has caused the child to be without essential care and the conditions of the incapacity “cannot” be remedied. This Court has consistently held that “parental duties” and “parental care,” as used in the Adoption Act, comprise numerous affirmative obligations on the part of the parent.

Since we are required by Section 1922(3) of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, 1 Pa.C.S. § 1922(3), to interpret all statutes in a light which makes them constitutional, Section 311(2) should be read to require a showing of willful misconduct.</p>
