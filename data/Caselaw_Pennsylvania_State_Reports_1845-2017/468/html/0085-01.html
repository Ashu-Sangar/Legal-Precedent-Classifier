The controversy between Lincoln and appellee Keystone Building Corporation has been the subject of protracted litigation including an earlier appeal to this Court, <a href="/pa/439/0444-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="439 Pa. 444" data-case-ids="1931047" data-case-paths="/pa/439/0444-01">439 Pa. 444</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=266%20A.2d%20648" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="266 A.2d 648">266 A.2d 648</a> (1970). On remand, the trial court held that a decree entered by consent of the parties is res judicata on the issue of Lincoln’s liability for breach of contract. The Superior Court affirmed and we granted the petition for allowance of appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> We find that there was no determination of Lincoln’s liability, reverse the order and remand for further proceedings.</p>
    <p id="b155-8" data-blocks='[["BL_155.8",155,[115,1486,1156,424]]]'>The Keystone Building Corporation, the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company of Canada entered into a construction loan agreement on October 7, 1968. Under the terms of the agreement Lincoln agreed to lend Keystone the funds necessary to finance Keystone’s construction of an apartment complex and Manufacturers agreed to be the permanent mortgagee for the project.</p>
    <p id="b155-9" data-blocks='[["BL_155.9",155,[121,1934,1152,256]],["BL_156.1",156,[277,290,1149,526]]]'>In May 1969, approximately two months after construction had begun, a dispute arose between Lincoln and Keystone over the terms and conditions under which Lincoln was obligated to advance the necessary funds. The dispute revolved around the nature and sufficiency of the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>proofs of expenditure which Keystone was required to present to Lincoln as a precondition for payment. Keystone believed it was submitting the vouchers in the proper form. Lincoln refused payment contending that the vouchers were not in accordance with the contract requirements. After protracted negotiations, Keystone commenced a suit in equity on July 3, 1969, asking that Lincoln be compelled to advance the requisitioned loan proceeds and that money damages be assessed against Lincoln for its asserted breach of contract.</p>
    <p id="b156-4" data-blocks='[["BL_156.5",156,[272,846,1153,749]]]'>On July 18, 1969, the court entered a consent decree based on an agreement between counsel for both parties.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> The decree sought to resolve the dispute between Keystone and Lincoln concerning the form of the vouchers necessary to authorize payments. The decree provided that Keystone had to support its present and future requisitions for loan proceeds in a specified manner and that Lincoln had to advance the amounts thus requisitioned promptly. Unfortunately, Keystone and Lincoln could not agree on the implementation of the decree and the dispute continued unabated. On August 5, Keystone petitioned for and was granted a rule to show cause why Lincoln should not be held in contempt for failing to comply with the July 18 decree.</p>

The court found that certain other expenses were not payable because they were beyond the terms of the construction loan agreement. The October 6 decree did not address whether Keystone was entitled to damages caused by Lincoln’s alleged breach of the contract. There is no indication that either the court or the <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>parties focused on anything other than how the vouchers should be submitted and which amounts were properly included for payment.</p>
    <p id="b157-4" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[123,496,1150,590]]]'>Lincoln did not make the payments immediately and, on October 10, Keystone again petitioned for and was granted a rule to show cause why Lincoln should not be held in contempt. Lincoln filed a motion to dismiss the rule contending it was premature. It argued that Pa.R. Civ.P. 1518 allows twenty days to file exceptions to the October 6 order and that the twenty days had not yet run. The trial court ruled that Lincoln was not entitled to file exceptions to the October 6 decree because that decree “only interprets the final decree of the Court of July 18,1969.” Appeal was taken to this Court.</p>
    <p id="b157-5" data-blocks='[["BL_157.6",157,[122,1108,1153,746]]]'>During the pendency of the appeal Manufacturers took an assignment from Lincoln of all its interest in the agreement. Lincoln then petitioned this Court to dismiss the appeal or remand the case to the trial court with directions to dismiss the action. Lincoln argued that because Manufacturers had assumed all of the responsibility for payment of the vouchers the case had become moot. Keystone replied that, although the question of payment on the vouchers may have been mooted by the assignment, the case was not moot because Keystone had sought other relief. Keystone had sought damages in its original complaint for the costs of interim financing and other expenses incurred as a result of Lincoln’s alleged breach.</p>

The case was transferred to the law side of the court for further proceedings.

The trial court stated, referring to the July 18 decree, that there had been a decree of the trial which was “not reversed, and therefore, the prior proceedings should be considered as res adjudicata on the question of [Lincoln’s] liability.” The trial court certified the question for appeal.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> The Superior Court affirmed in an opinion by Judge Jacobs.</p>

Although the July 18 and October 6 decrees were directed only to the issue of performance — the payment of the vouchers — Lincoln argues that the entire <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>action on the contract constituted one cause of action <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> which was extinguished by the consent decree. Thus, Lincoln contends, if the prior decree is res judicata it is res judicata against Keystone barring Keystone from seeking any further relief on the contract. We need not consider that contention because Lincoln raises it for the first time on this appeal. Because it was not raised in the court below it has not been preserved for our review. <em>Dilliplaine v.

The decree was designed to interpret the contract requirements to get the funds flowing. The conduct of the parties and the court, and the language of the decree itself, indicates that they did not intend the decree to act as an adjudication of whether there was a breach of the contract by Lincoln rendering it liable for unascertained damages. That issue was not addressed and was reserved for future determination. Thus, although the requisite identities for res judicata are present there has not been a final judgment on the merits of the liability question.

The July 18 decree itself indicates that the court and the parties did not intend it to be a final determination of the entire claim. The decree states, “Jurisdiction of the within matter shall be retained by this Court pending further order.” In its answer to Lincoln’s “Suggestion of Mootness and Motion to Vacate Orders as Moot” filed in the prior appeal to this Court, Keystone argued that the case should not be dismissed as moot because “evidence on other matters for which relief is sought was not fully presented to the Court below.” It is apparent that Keystone did not then regard the liability issue as adjudicated. Moreover, Judge Louik’s order stating that the further proceedings in the trial court would proceed only on the damage issue was a sua sponte pronouncement. Up to that time Keystone had not contended that the question of Lincoln’s liability was res judicata.</p>
