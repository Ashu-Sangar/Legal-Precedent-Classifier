Since 1961 § 102(17) (iii) revives the doctrine only for residents owning realty outside Pennsylvania, and only in certain specific situations there described, the application of the doctrine, in any of its aspects, to Pennsylvania realty owned by nonresidents, would be equivalent to a determination that the term ‘real property’ had wholly different meanings in 1961 §§ 102(17) (i) and (iv), meaning realty without regard to equitable conversion when used in 1961 § <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>102(17) (i) [hence the need for 1961 § 102(17) (iii)] and realty only after the doctrine had been applied when used in 1961 § 102(17) (iv).</p>

In the instant case, what the Commonwealth is seeking to tax is purely and simply the transfer of the unpaid portion of the purchase price for real property. Since that chose in action belonged to a vendor who was a nonresident of Pennsylvania at the time of her death, it seems evident to me that its transfer is not subject to inheritance taxation by Pennsylvania under the Act of 1961, supra.</p>

That case involved exactly the reverse of the situation presented by the case at bar. That is to say, whereas here the question is the taxability of the transfer of legal title to Pennsylvania land which a non-resident decedent had in her lifetime contracted to sell to another, the question in <em>Paul’s Estate </em>was whether the death of a Pennsylvania resident occasioned a tax on the transfer of his legal title to foreign real estate which before his death he had contracted to sell. Recognizing that it is beyond the power <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>of Pennsylvania to tax real estate or a transfer of ownership in real estate which lies beyond its borders,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_3" id="ref_footnote_2_3">3</a> the Commonwealth was arguing in <em>Paul’s Estate </em>that the transfer of legal title to New Jersey land was taxable because the doctrine of equitable conversion had divested the decedent’s interest of its character as real property, thereby converting it to personalty. A majority of the Court held, the doctrine of equitable conversion notwithstanding, that the decedent’s interest in the property had remained real property and therefore that its transfer was not subject to Pennsylvania inheritance taxation. All things being equal, <em>Paul’s Estate </em>would be persuasive, although I believe erroneous,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_4" id="ref_footnote_2_4">4</a> authority for the result the Court reaches today. But all things are <em>not </em>equal, for by the Act of 1961, supra, the legislature expressly changed the rule announced in <em>Paul’s </em>Estate.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_2_5" id="ref_footnote_2_5">5</a>

In states in which the decedent’s contract right is viewed as an intangible as a result of the doctrine of equitable conversion and in which all intangibles owned by resident decedents are subjected to inheritance taxation, see note 14 of the opinion of the Court; <em>ante </em>at 582-583 the decedent’s rights under the contract would be a taxable asset both in Pennsylvania and in the state of domicile.</p>
