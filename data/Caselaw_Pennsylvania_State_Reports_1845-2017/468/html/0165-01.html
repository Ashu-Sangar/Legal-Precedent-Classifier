    <p id="b235-9" data-blocks='[["BL_235.9",235,[128,1248,1151,645]]]'>Appellant is the natural father of a child born out of wedlock in December 1970 while he and the mother were living together. The parents separated thereafter and a formal support agreement was executed in November 1972. In April 1973 appellant initiated a habeas corpus proceeding to enforce his visitation rights under the support agreement. In May 1973 the visitation provisions of the support agreement were superseded by a court ordered visitation schedule, which, inter alia, provided weekly visitation rights. Appellant has made all support payments as required by the agreement and has fully exercised his visitation rights.</p>

On May 7, 1974, her husband filed a petition for the adoption of appellant’s child. The mother joined the petition. The orphans’ court directed that appellant be given notice of the hearing on the petition, scheduled for May 23, 1974, by registered or certified letter sent to his last known address. Such notice was sent May 9, 1974, to an address appellant had supplied the <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>Domestic Relations Division of Dauphin County. The letter was returned, marked “Moved, left no address.” Although it was stipulated that appellant visited his child twice during the period from May 9 to May 23, no further attempt to give him notice of the hearing was made.</p>

On July 26, 1974, in the orphans’ court which decreed the adoption, he filed an application for a rule to show cause why the adoption should not be reversed and “remanded” for a new hearing. The rule was issued on the day it was filed. Following an answer to the rule, appellant, on December 12, 1974, filed a petition to reopen the decree of adoption. A hearing on both the rule and the petition was held on February 18, 1975. The facts established by the pleadings and an oral stipulation made part of the record at the hearing were: (1) appellant did not have actual notice of the May 23, 1974 hearing on the petition for adoption, (2) the only attempt made to notify appellant of the hearing was the letter mailed to the address obtained from the Domestic Relations Division, (3) appellant was visiting his child each week during this entire period as permitted by the court ordered visitation schedule, and (4) appellant had not consented to the adoption. Following the hearing, the rule to show cause was discharged.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> In an opinion <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>filed August 4, 1975, the orphans’ court held that, under Pennsylvania law, appellant was not entitled to notice of the adoption proceeding and that the mailed notice satisfied any right to notice that he may have had.</p>

Because the consent to adoption of the unwed father is not required by the statute, he need not be given notice of the adoption proceeding.

This notice, marked “Moved, left no address,” was presented to the court as evidence of appellee’s inability to provide appellant notice of the hearing. Appellee failed to tell the court that appellant came to his home every week to visit his child and that appellant could easily have been personally served with notice of the hearing. In fact, appellee’s wife handed a copy of the final decree of adoption to appellant, just four days after it was entered, when appellant arrived at appellee’s house for the regular visit with his child. There is no reason why notice of the hearing could not have been given in the same manner or why appellant could not, at least, have been told of the hearing.</p>

Federal constitutional law compels the same result we reach on the basis of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">405 U.S. 645</a>, <a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">92 S.Ct. 1208</a>, <a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">31 L.Ed.2d 551</a> (1972), the United States Supreme Court held “that, as a matter of due process of law, [an unmarried father] was entitled to a hearing on his fitness as a parent before his children were taken from him and that, by denying [an unwed father] a hearing and extending it to all other parents whose custody of their children is challenged, the State denied [the unwed father] the equal protection of the <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.” <a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">Id. at 649</a>, <a href="/us/405/0645-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="405 U.S. 645" data-case-ids="11723248" data-case-paths="/us/405/0645-01">92 S.Ct. at 1211</a>. Although it is possible factually to distinguish <em>Stanley </em>from this case, we are not persuaded that any of the differences would compel a contrary result here. Cf.
