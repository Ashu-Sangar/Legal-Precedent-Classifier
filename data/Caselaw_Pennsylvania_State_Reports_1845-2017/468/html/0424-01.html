The testimony establishes that the incriminatory statements were obtained after approximately one-half hour of police questioning. Counsel did assert undue delay as a basis for a finding that the confession was involuntary. Therefore, the only question before us is whether or not they should have, under the circumstances, made the additional claim that it was an unreasonable delay in violation of the procedural rule then in effect.

We find this argument to be without merit. Both trial counsel were present and actively participated during the hearings to suppress appellee’s confession. There is no reason to conclude that there was any need for them to secure the notes particularly in view of their judgment that the ruling should not be appealed. Cf. <em>Commonwealth v.

However, after a careful review of the record we can find no basis to support the hearing court’s finding that the arrest was in fact without probable cause. Although appellee had checked the square on <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>the post-conviction petition form, asserting that the confession was the product of an illegal arrest he did not set forth any facts to support this claim in his petition, <em>Commonwealth v.

To the contrary the record is devoid of any evidence of the circumstances of appellee’s arrest other than time and location. While there was testimony that other individuals may also have been taken into custody at the time of appellee’s arrest, this fact alone does not support that appellee’s arrest was without probable cause. Thus in absence of any basis for finding that the arrest was unlawful, we cannot conclude that former counsel was ineffective for failing to raise such a claim.

The majority reverses, holding that the claim was waived. In so doing, the majority asserts that the record does not support the hearing court’s finding that the arrest was illegal and concludes that the otherwise inexplicable failure of appellee’s trial counsel to raise the claim did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

The shooting in question was attributed to a gang to which the appellee allegedly belonged. Several youths believed to be gang members were arrested and interrogated. Appellee put the number arrested at ten or more. The testimony of Detective Sincavage, whose interrogation produced the statement from appellee, indicates that the police had little basis for a belief that the appellee was responsible for the shooting. In fact, Detective Sincavage’s suspicion apparently was based on information obtained from the defendant and the other youths after their arrests rather than information received prior to the arrest. Appellee’s mother testified that a detective told her: “they have several boys there and they’re being questioned and they would be released when they got done questioning him.” The record indicates that the arrest at issue here was part of a pattern and practice of arresting suspected gang members without probable cause and holding them for questioning. Several times that summer police investigating a gang related crime had arrested a number of youths, including the appellee, only to release them after interrogation. Appellee’s mother testified that “they got so that they’d pick them up even if they were just standing on the corner.”</p>

There can be no “reasonable basis designed to effectuate [appellee’s] interests” in his failure to proceed on this issue. The facts of appellee’s arrest were readily available to him, and the applicability of <em>Fogan </em>and <em>Davis </em>to those facts cannot be disputed. If counsel had raised this issue, an incriminating statement would have been suppressed, materially improving appellee’s position at trial. <em>No </em>tactical reason can be advanced for trial counsel’s failure to file a suppression motion. Thus, trial counsel must be deemed ineffective for failing to raise the illegal arrest claim. Therefore, the claim has not been waived.

This reliance is misplaced. The hearing court granted appellee relief 'based on his claims of unlawful arrest and unreasonable delay between arrest and arraignment.
