Lucille Daoust was then nineteen years old and the putative father was incarcerated. The parents have never lived together and the father has never contributed to the financial or emotional support of the child. Lucille, who has not completed her high school education, attempted for eleven months to raise Latasha through public assistance and part-time employment. During this period mother and daughter subsisted in extreme poverty. Not only were their living conditions squalid, but Latasha was clothed in hand-me-downs which frequently were too large, was fitted in shoes which were much too small, and was not fed a proper amount of solid foods. In June of 1974, Miss Daoust, upon the advice of a social worker and motivated by her evident frustration with her then life situation, agreed to allow the Densons to assume custody of Latasha.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a> Following this placement, Lucille’s living conditions improved markedly. By the time of the involuntary termination hearing, she had become engaged to be married to a soldier who had a good paying job awaiting him upon his impending discharge; she had secured full <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>time employment on a regular basis and was no longer receiving public assistance; and she had made arrangements to move into a two bedroom apartment in a low-income housing complex. Under these circumstances it cannot be said that Lucille’s incapacity or neglect to furnish the requisite parental care cannot or will not be remedied. Thus we conclude, as above stated, that the hearing judge was correct in finding that Lucille Daoust’s rights should not presently be terminated under § 311(2)<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_4" id="ref_footnote_1_4">4</a>

Appellants’ claim is that the evidence justified the involuntary termination of Miss Daoust’s parental rights because she had “refused or failed to perform parental duties”. This contention is advanced on two alternative evidentiary grounds: (1) that for a six month period between December 1973 and June 1974, Lucille improperly fed, clothed, housed and cared for Latasha; and (2) that Lucille relinquished custody of the child and thereafter for a period in excess of six months commencing in June, <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>1974, failed to give her proper parental support.

Such an assertion, however, may not properly be entertained under §311(1). A review of both the historical origins of § 311(1) and the statutory context in which it appears persuades us that that subsection does not authorize involuntary termination on the basis of parental neglect which occurs during a period when the parent has custody of the child. As explained hereafter, we think that relief from such custodial neglect must be obtained under § 311(2) of the Act. Section 311(1) represents a liberalization of the more stringent standards of parental abandonment contained in the predecessor Adoption Act, Act of April 4, 1925, P.L. 127, § (1) (a), repealed by Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, 1 P.S. § 601. <em>In re Adoption of McCray, </em><a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">460 Pa. 210</a>, 215, <a href="/pa/460/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="460 Pa. 210" data-case-ids="482775" data-case-paths="/pa/460/0210-01">331 A.2d 652</a>, 654 n. 6 (1975). Under the former Act <em>both </em>a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to the child <em>and </em>a failure or refusal to perform parental duties were necessary, dependent elements of proof of abandonment. Settled purpose was defined as a positive intent to sever parental relations,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a> and, without proof of such intent, a <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>parent who had in fact deserted a child could not be said to have abandoned the child.</p>

By isolating “[failure] to perform parental duties” as an independent basis for termination, the legislature has recognized that the absence of a positive intent to sever parental ties does little to mitigate the harm done to a deserted child who is deprived of love, affection and support. Thus a parent’s desire to retain parental ties is no longer a defense to a termination petition. See, <em>In re Lutheran Children &amp; Family Service, </em><a href="/pa/456/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="456 Pa. 429" data-case-ids="584423" data-case-paths="/pa/456/0429-01">456 Pa. 429</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=321%20A.2d%20618" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="321 A.2d 618">321 A.2d 618</a>, 621 (1974).</p>
    <p id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[240,1336,1155,584]]]'>The change wrought by § 311(1) was to broaden the power of the courts to terminate involuntarily the parental rights of a parent who had relinquished custody and thereafter neglected the child. The subsection did not, however, authorize termination in those instances where the parental neglect occurred at a time when the parent still retained custody. Rather this contingency was expressly provided for in § 311(2). A comparison of the elements of the two subsections persuades us that the legislature did not intend the two to be used interchangeably.</p>
    <p id="b148-7" data-blocks='[["BL_148.7",148,[237,1953,1147,149]],["BL_149.1",149,[113,317,1153,1145]]]'>As discussed earlier, § 311(2) provides that termination may not be ordered unless the causes of the incapacity or neglect will not or cannot be remedied. To repeat, <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>the legislature has concluded that if a parent is currently capable of responsibly raising a child, prior instances of abuse or neglect may not support a termination order under § 311(2). Section 311(1), however, contains no such proviso. Once it has been established that a parent has failed to render parental support to a deserted child for the requisite six months period, that parent’s rights may be terminated without inquiry into his or her current capacity to care for the child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> To read “refused or failed to perform parental duties” as encompassing instances of parental neglect of a child still in the custody of the parent, would be to allow a proponent of the termination to circumvent the “present parental capacity” proviso of § 311(2) merely by filing the termination petition under § 311(1). We cannot ascribe such a purpose to this statutory language. Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. S. § 1922. Thus we hold that § 311(1) does not authorize involuntary termination where, as here, the petition seeking termination is founded on conduct showing parental neglect and incapacity which occurred during a period when the parent had custody of the child.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

It thus may be properly entertained under § 311(1). In June of 1974, following a three month period of unemployment, Lucille secured employment as a kitchen worker at an Army base near her home in Maryland. Under the terms of her employment she was required to be “on call” and was never certain when she would be summoned to work. As a consequence, she was unable to make appropriate child care arrangements and was required to leave the child with one Mrs. Braddock, a sister of Lottie Denson, until such time as she could be assigned a regular work shift. Shortly after Mrs. Braddock had been given temporary custody of Latasha, she told her sister, Lottie Denson, that she was caring for a child whom the mother wished to give away, and inquired whether the Densons might be willing to take custody of the child. On June 24, 1974, appellants traveled to Miss Daoust’s home in Maryland and were informed by her that she no longer wanted to keep the baby. In the presence of a lawyer, Miss Daoust and the Densons executed a guardianship agreement giving the Densons custody of the child, but reserving to Lucille reasonable visitation rights and the right to revoke the agreement. The agreement by its terms was expressly “precedent to adoption proceedings.” On August 8, 1974, Miss Daoust, through her attorney, wrote to the Densons requesting that they return Latasha to her and advising them that she no longer was willing to consent to the adoption of her daughter.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_8" id="ref_footnote_1_8">8</a> Miss Daoust twice traveled to the Denson home in an effort to effect the return of Latasha to her.

      <em>In re Adoption of Wolfe, </em>supra, a mother signed a petition for the voluntary termination of her parental rights eighteen days after the birth of her son. On the same day, custody of the child was delivered to prospective adoptive parents. More than six months later the natural mother revoked her consent to a pending adoption at a hearing on her petition to voluntarily terminate her parental rights. The prospective adoptive parents then initiated a petition for involuntary termination under § 311(1) charging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the relin<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>quishment of custody of the child for a period of six months constituted a refusal and failure to perform parental duties. In affirming the decision of the trial court which denied the petition, we held that a parent who makes suitable arrangements for the care of a child for a temporary period during a time of personal crisis does not by such an act alone fail or refuse to perform parental duties within the meaning of § 311(1). In the instant case, Miss Daoust through her revocable guardianship agreement made a similar arrangement for the temporary care of Latasha, and like the natural mother in <em>Wolfe, </em>she did not refuse to perform parental duties simply by temporarily relinquishing custody of her daughter to appellants for a period in excess of six months.</p>
    <p id="b152-5" data-blocks='[["BL_152.4",152,[259,1132,1150,804]]]'>Nor can we say that the hearing judge erred in concluding that Lucille adequately performed her affirmative parental duties during the period Latasha was in the custody of the Densons. The hearing judge expressly found that Lucille Daoust frequently telephoned the Den-sons to inquire into the well-being of her child; that she purchased gifts for the child oh Christmas and her birthday; and that she twice traveled the considerable distance to the Denson’s home in Mercer County in an effort to convince them to surrender custody of Latasha. We are satisfied that these findings are supported by competent evidence in the record and that, given these findings, the court correctly ruled that appellants did not meet their burden of showing that Miss Daoust had failed to perform parental duties.</p>
