On May 9, 1973, Walker, age 26, picked up a fourteen-year-old female and her fifteen-year-old female companion who were hitchhiking in suburban Pittsburgh. Walker inquired as to their ages and they responded with their correct ages. Walker suggested that they go riding in his automobile and the girls agreed. Some wine was produced and the three drank it. They later made several stops so that either Walker or the girls could run their own errands. Afterward Walker bought some wine and a quantity of marijuana which all three shared. The girls became intoxicated and ill; in fact, the fourteen-year-old began to vomit and became unconscious. Walker attempted to register all three at a motel so he could “sober up” his companions; however, they were refused. The fifteen-year-old then said she wanted to go home and Walker suggested she take a cab. He gave her five dollars in cash and a check, with his name printed on it, to pay for the transportation and she left. Walker then rented a room in a motel where he took the fourteen-year-old. Later when the young girl began to regain consciousness, she became aware Walker was having sexual relations with her. She screamed, but was warned to be quiet or she would be killed. She <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>again lapsed into unconsciousness and upon reawakening was sent home in a cab.</p>

Our inquiry is limited to whether the imposition of separate but concurrent prison sentences on the rape conviction<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">1</a> and the statutory rape conviction <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_2" id="ref_footnote_1_2">2</a> constitute duplicitous sentences in the constitutional sense where both convictions grew out of the same and single act of intercourse. Initially, the Commonwealth contends that this issue has been waived since Walker failed to object to the sentences when imposed. See <em>Commonwealth v. Tisdale, </em><a href="/pa-super/233/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="233 Pa.

However, unlike the appellant in <em>Tisdale, </em>Walker is not attacking the propriety of being twice convicted for a single act and, as such, is not making a disguised attack on the validity of the convictions underlying the sentences. On the contrary, Walker’s challenge is directed exclusively at the lawfulness of the sentences imposed upon these convictions. As such the claim has not been waived and is properly before us.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_3" id="ref_footnote_1_3">3</a>

Second, the Commonwealth maintains that since the sentences were concurrent, Walker has suffered no prejudice and cannot be heard to complain at this point. However, concurrent sentences, at least because of their collateral consequences have been held to be sufficiently prejudicial to a defendant to constitute a justiciable controversy and, as such, can constitute double punishment. <em>Benton v.

One of the purposes of the criminal law is to punish offenses against the Commonwealth, as defined by the Legislature, and it follows that, “[t]he criminal prosecution is for the injury done to the Commonwealth, and not for the injury done to the individual who may, if entitled, obtain redress through a civil action. Where there is but one act of cause of injury, or death of a number of persons, there is but one injury to the Commonwealth, but where t'! acts or causes are separate, they are separate injuries to the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.” <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>

At Walker’s urging, the victim ingested intoxicants until she became unconscious. Then, by taking advantage of her advanced intoxication and by threatening to kill her, Walker had sexual relations with her. His use of force to procure relations without the victim’s consent constitutes but a single act and his single act constitutes but a single offense against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth.</p>

Under 18 P.S. § 4721(a), unlawful carnal knowledge of any female, regardless of age, which is procured by force and accomplished against the victim’s will is the crime of rape. Under 18 P.S. § 4721(b), consensual carnal knowledge of a female under the age of sixteen years, by a male, not her husband, older than sixteen, is made a crime and that crime is statutory rape. Under Section 4721(a) rape can be perpetrated against any female, whether or not the victim is <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>under age; the crux of the offense is force and lack of the victim’s consent. The statutory rape provisions are only applicable when the victim is under age and has consented, thereby excluding the crime of rape. Accordingly, under the statute, intercourse may be the offense of statutory rape only if the female is under the age of sixteen and has consented; however, all intercourse procured by force against the victim’s will, regardless of the victim’s age is the crime of rape. In sum, a female’s consent to sexual intercourse excludes the possibility of a conviction for the offense of rape and makes the act of intercourse criminally cognizable only if the consenting female is under the age of sixteen. On the other hand, lack of the female’s consent excludes the possibility of a conviction for statutory rape but is criminally cognizable as the crime of rape if the non-consensual intercourse was initiated through the use of force.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_5" id="ref_footnote_1_5">5</a>

Unlawful non-consensual intercourse, that is rape, is punishable by either (1) a fine of up to $10,000 or fifteen years to life imprisonment or both, where serious bodily injury is inflicted upon the victim during commission, or (2) a fine of up to $10,000 or up to twenty years imprisonment or both where no serious bodily injury is inflicted during commission. Consensual, but unlawful, sexual intercourse with an underage female, that is statutory rape, carries a penalty of a fine up to $7,000 or imprisonment of up to fifteen years <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>imprisonment or both.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_6" id="ref_footnote_1_6">6</a> Throughout the statute, the penalty increases as the degree of force used in commission increases. The deterrent effect of the legislative scheme is intended to be the prevention of forcible, non-consensual intercourse and, therefore, the protection of all women from forcible invasions of the person. On the other hand, the primary consideration in prohibiting unlawful, consensual intercourse with an underage female has been traditionally attributed to the legislative desire to protect those who are too unsophisticated to protect themselves.</p>
    <p id="b402-4" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[234,921,1158,1078]]]'>From the foregoing, the legislative scheme to protect all females from invasions of the person can be determined. The Legislature seeks to protect all females from force and where force is used, the actor is guilty of rape. On the other hand, the Legislature seeks to protect some females from their own lack of sophistication and an actor who trades on unsophistication, as defined in the statute by age, is guilty of the crime of statutory rape. Here, Walker was not taking advantage of the girl’s lack of sophistication, <em>per se, </em>to procure her consent, but rather, used force and threats to induce sexual relations. Therefore, it is the Commonwealth’s interest in prohibiting and preventing forcible invasions of the person which is offended here, not the Commonwealth’s interest in protecting the unsophisticated since sophistication and age become irrelevant once force or violence is used against a victim. Accordingly, the Commonwealth has suffered only one injury from Walker’s single act of unlawful sexual intercourse and Walker’s single act mandates but one punishment.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_7" id="ref_footnote_1_7">7</a>

Prior to May 12, 1966, when the Legislature amended 18 P.S. § 4721 by creating 18 P.S. §§ 4721(a) and (b) and changing the language of the former statute from “with or without her consent” to “with her consent,” statutory rape could be accomplished either consensually or nonconsensually.

It is clear from the record that the trial judge incorrectly charged the jury on the point of statutory rape. In his charge, the trial judge stated the law as it existed prior to the amendment of 18 P.S. § 4721, in fact, he read and repeated the phrase “with or without consent” which had been eliminated by the amendment of 1966 and which amended statute was applicable to the case at bar.

I find the conclusion of the Superior Court compelling that appellant’s challenge is not to the lawfulness of the sentences per se but an attack on his convictions. <em>Commonwealth v. Walker, </em><a href="/pa-super/234/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="234 Pa. Super. 433" data-case-ids="6772171" data-case-paths="/pa-super/234/0433-01">234 Pa.Super. 433</a>, <a href="/citations/?q=340%20A.2d%20858" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="340 A.2d 858">340 A.2d 858</a> (1975). In effect appellant’s challenge is nothing more than an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence to support both convictions. That this is so, is borne out by the fact that the Court finds it necessary to conclude that (1) under the Crimes Code convictions for rape and statutory rape based on a single act of intercourse are mutually exclusive; (2) that the record in this case demonstrates that both convictions rested upon a single act of non-consensual intercourse; and (3) that the fact that the intercourse was non-consensual precluded conviction of statutory rape.
